The Winslow Boy is directed by Anthony Asquith and has a stellar cast led by Cedric Hardwicke Robert Donat Margaret Leighton and others. The film evokes a period of time when honour selfsacrifice and the heavy arm of authority ruled countries such as England in the name of the common good. The setting is the Edwardian Era of early 20th century England and into this time and place we find a youth who has been expelled from a naval academy for stealing. The family believes he is innocent and his recentlyretired father distant from his children ageing and afflicted with arthritis sees an opportunity to strike a blow for his youngest child against injustice. In jurisprudence it is called let right be done.In this heroic effort Arthur Winslow the father played by Cedric Hardwicke is backed by the strong conviction of his daughter Kate Margaret Leighton and Sir Robert Morton who takes on the government of the day Robert Donat.Thirteenyear old Ronnie Winslow is expelled from his academy for theft. The evidence against him is real but the son is adamant that he is innocent. Arthur Winslow believes his son and takes the matter to his lawyer and eventually to the Cabinet. He is paid a visit by Robert Donat as Sir Robert Morton a Member of Parliament who takes up the case.One of the most hardhitting scenes is a ruthless crossexamination. The boy maintains his innocence and the MP leaves their home convinced of the boy's innocence. The badgering is relentless and had me on the edge of my seat as Donat hurls one accusation after another at the boy who does not bend during the ordeal.Sir Robert takes a shine to Kate Arthur Winslow's daughter who is played by Margaret Leighton. She superbly performs the role and risks her engagement by pressing the MP to proceed with the case which has now become a national sensation.There is a dramatic showdown in the House of Commons and the First Lord of the Admiralty egged on by Sir Robert agrees to let the case go to court. The final outcome has added emotion as the senior Winslow and Sir Robert are tired and ailing. This is an excellent period piece as well as high drama with great acting by the leading players and those in supporting roles particularly Kathleen Harrison the housekeeper. The era is evoked with scenes taking place on golf courses and men's clubs where politicians discuss matters of state not to mention the churches concert halls and railway stations. The nation's affairs are dominated by the suffragettes and the Irish question. Allround great entertainment. Highly recommend.".

It took David Mamet's excellent filming of the Winslow Boy to remind us that at his best Rattigan was an exceptionally fine dramatist. Having much enjoyed the movie I was curious to see the 1948 version directed by Anthony Asquith who worked on a number of occasions with Rattigan. It's an exceptional film from all accounts. Asquith's adaptations of theater works for the screen are excellent. Without opening them out too extensively they manage to avoid being stage bound Pygmalion Browning Version Importance of Being Earnest. Being already familiar with the storyline I simply sat back and savored the wonderful performances and what performances they are. Cedric Hardwicke as the father lacks the softness of Nigel Hawthorne's portrayal and yet that's what precisely makes it ultimately more moving. Robert Donat overflows with charisma and Margaret Leighton plays her very first screen appearance with much intelligence and total aplomb.The best of British".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been said that the various public sensations in the period before World War I were the last times that public attention and anger could be brought forth in defense of the individual who seemed to be wronged. This was true in France from 1894 to 1906 om the Dreyfus Affair and in Russia in 1911  1913 in the Blood Libel trial of Mendel Beiliss. One might consider later events Sacco  Vanzetti the Rosenbergs Caryl Chessman showed similar outbursts of indignation could occur long after World War I was over but the turn of the 20th Century seemed very fruitful in these cause celebres.Terence Rattigan like all good dramatists knew that you could squeeze much dramatic juice out of a good real judicial drama. He would do a play based on the tragedy of the Rattenbury  Stoner murder trial of 1935. He would also do a wonderful extrajudicial drama called The Winslow Boy based on a 1910  1914 cause celebres that rocked Edwardian England. It was the Archer  Shee Case with the family name changed to Winslow for the purposes of Rattigan's stagecraft.Martin Archer  Shee was a young naval cadet who was at the Naval War College when he was wrongly accused of stealing postal money orders from his fellow classmates. He was expelled from the school as a result protesting to all he had not done this. His father believed him and got England's premier barrister Sir Edward Carson to help force a government reversal of this disgraceful action. Carson is best recalled for his masterful but tragically effective destruction of his old college mate Oscar Wilde at Wilde's first trial against the slander of the Marquess of Queensbury in 1895. But he was far better than that incident which he always secretly regretted  he saw Wilde years later as a poverty row derelict in Paris. If you doubt this check into his excellent prosecution as Attorney General of the wifemurdering poisoner Severin Klosowski George Chapman the Borough Poisoner in 1903. He did oppose the Home Rule Movement of Parnell and his successors but Carson loved his native Ireland and hated the 1922 division of the island into Eire Free State and Northern Ireland. He would try with Kevin O'Higgins of the Southern Irish Government to restore the two sections together but O'Higgins' assassination in 1927 ended that attempt.Carson's best features came out in his defense of Martin Archer  Shee. He refused despite repeated dismissive behavior of the Asquith government to give up protesting their highhanded behavior to the boy. The fact was the government's proof of Archer  Shee's criminal activities was weak a young cadet was known to have cashed the stolen postal orders but the identification with Archer  Shee was feeble at best. In the end he managed to manipulate the government weakened by a serious scandal of it's own involving the Marconi Wireless Company into reviewing the actions. In the end the decision of the Naval authorities had to be reversed by the House of Commons in a special vote and then a trial was held in which Archer  Shee was acquitted. World War I was soon upon Europe. Martin Archer  Shee joined the army and died in Flanders Fields.Rattigan was not the only one to see the dramatic possibilities of the story. Alexander Woolcott wrote about it several times and even attempted to edit a volume of the Notable British Trials series on the case. But Rattigan had to humanize the story even more. First the name of the family is changed to Winslow and the spotlight is on Martin's father. Arthur Winslow is played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke who is actually a kind hearted man behind his stern Edwardian facade. He is more concerned with his older boy Dick's Jack Watling's interest in the Bunny Hop dance craze over his studies at Oxford than with the younger more sensible Ronnie Neil North. The social ostracism of the disgraced family effecting the engagement of his daughter Katherine Margaret Leighton and the standing of Dick at Oxford forces Winslow to go to Sir Robert Morton Robert Donat as Carson for the justice he demands. Donat does not appear in the film until nearly half the film is done  but he dominates the second half while Hardwicke dominates the beginning. It is like the passing of a torch.Donat's performance is a trifle stiff  but that is what Carson occasionally came across as. He is humanized in one way that is historically inaccurate  a romance blossoms between him and Leighton that did not between Carson and anyone in Archer  Shee's family. Still that is underplayed. Instead we watch how he will not be silenced by the indifference of the government in power. In particular the First Lord of the Admiralty Walter Fitzgerald and the Attorney General Francis Sullivan. The former pretends to be more concerned in his golf game than the honor of a little boy. By the way the play and film does not mention the name of this individual it was Winston Churchill.The film is a wonder  and oddly enough does not have the conclusion occur in the courtroom but has a character describes what happened. But it all works well and gives the audience a good feeling. Occasionally justice is done!".

Carson is best recalled for his masterful but tragically effective destruction of his old college mate Oscar Wilde at Wilde's first trial against the slander of the Marquess of Queensbury in 1895. But he was far better than that incident which he always secretly regretted  he saw Wilde years later as a poverty row derelict in Paris. If you doubt this check into his excellent prosecution as Attorney General of the wifemurdering poisoner Severin Klosowski George Chapman the Borough Poisoner in 1903. He did oppose the Home Rule Movement of Parnell and his successors but Carson loved his native Ireland and hated the 1922 division of the island into Eire Free State and Northern Ireland. He would try with Kevin O'Higgins of the Southern Irish Government to restore the two sections together but O'Higgins' assassination in 1927 ended that attempt.Carson's best features came out in his defense of Martin Archer  Shee. He refused despite repeated dismissive behavior of the Asquith government to give up protesting their highhanded behavior to the boy. The fact was the government's proof of Archer  Shee's criminal activities was weak a young cadet was known to have cashed the stolen postal orders but the identification with Archer  Shee was feeble at best. In the end he managed to manipulate the government weakened by a serious scandal of it's own involving the Marconi Wireless Company into reviewing the actions. In the end the decision of the Naval authorities had to be reversed by the House of Commons in a special vote and then a trial was held in which Archer  Shee was acquitted. World War I was soon upon Europe. Martin Archer  Shee joined the army and died in Flanders Fields.Rattigan was not the only one to see the dramatic possibilities of the story. Alexander Woolcott wrote about it several times and even attempted to edit a volume of the Notable British Trials series on the case. But Rattigan had to humanize the story even more. First the name of the family is changed to Winslow and the spotlight is on Martin's father. Arthur Winslow is played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke who is actually a kind hearted man behind his stern Edwardian facade. He is more concerned with his older boy Dick's Jack Watling's interest in the Bunny Hop dance craze over his studies at Oxford than with the younger more sensible Ronnie Neil North. The social ostracism of the disgraced family effecting the engagement of his daughter Katherine Margaret Leighton and the standing of Dick at Oxford forces Winslow to go to Sir Robert Morton Robert Donat as Carson for the justice he demands. Donat does not appear in the film until nearly half the film is done  but he dominates the second half while Hardwicke dominates the beginning. It is like the passing of a torch.Donat's performance is a trifle stiff  but that is what Carson occasionally came across as. He is humanized in one way that is historically inaccurate  a romance blossoms between him and Leighton that did not between Carson and anyone in Archer  Shee's family. Still that is underplayed. Instead we watch how he will not be silenced by the indifference of the government in power. In particular the First Lord of the Admiralty Walter Fitzgerald and the Attorney General Francis Sullivan. The former pretends to be more concerned in his golf game than the honor of a little boy. By the way the play and film does not mention the name of this individual it was Winston Churchill.The film is a wonder  and oddly enough does not have the conclusion occur in the courtroom but has a character describes what happened. But it all works well and gives the audience a good feeling. Occasionally justice is done!";

That is something that North's father Cedric Hardwicke is determined to see he gets.It costs the Winslow family considerable.

The play itself is pretty stagy and because of this it doesn't suffer from being dated  the 1948 production values are easily the equal of the 1998 version. The film here differs from the recent version in that it has much more of the legal wrangling onscreen and not off. This makes the film much better as it encompasses both the social battle of the Winslow's and the legal one.Both are involving and gripping but I must admit that I wasn't as caught up in the social drama as much as I wanted to be because I felt that any family who's main worry in life was that there son had been excluded from school needn't worry about much! The fact that the Winslow's were able to get the ear of an MP just made it more difficult for me to get into  few people live in such high circles even if they work in a bank!.The cast are good. Hardwicke is good as Winslow but the real star of the piece is Donat as Sir Morton. He is very stiff but also has layers that he reveals as he goes  as well as carrying the weight of the legal thrills. The majority of the cast are good in roles of varying sizes and noone does a noticeably bad job. Some are slight stereotypes but not to the film's detriment.Overall this is a very good film and is better than the modern version. It mixes drama with wit and romance to good effect and puts the legal drama and the social drama on the same level rather than letting one suffer to the other.

	schema:headline " An Exciting Movie But Read The Play";
	schema:reviewBody "This film adapts a play by Terence Rattigan first staged in 1946. The author had a great story. An ordinary citizen battles the British government to gain a fair trial for his son who has been expelled from a junior naval academy for the crime of stealing.In the play the father's crusade is important but not the main dish. Rather the focus is on the impact of the crusade on the boy's family circle and how they respond. Every scene occurs within the home. The whole country may be arguing about the case but the arguments we hear  whether the boy is guilty whether even if innocent his expulsion warrants so much fuss  are made or quoted en famille.This movie adaptation on the contrary moves out into the world where the public fight takes place in the offices of naval officials in the British House of Commons and before the Lord Chief Justice. The approach is exciting and makes it easy for the audience to follow the stages of the battle. A disadvantage is that it leaves less chance to experience what the play says about people and about life.Usually in dramas about battles for justice a wrong has been done. The business of the action is to right the wrong. However in Rattigan's play it is never clear that a wrong has occurred. Although the play helps us believe that Ronnie Winslow did not cash a stolen money order as charged at least one member of his family thinks he did and no proof emerges that he did not.If we assume he was innocent did the degree of wrong to him warrant the battle waged and the sacrifices it entailed? There is no indication of animus against Ronnie on the part of the academy which had strong evidence for thinking him guilty. If their finding was incorrect it seems a reasonable mistake. Moreover the boy is happy in another school and increasingly uninterested in the crusade. In these circumstances how grave is the wrong? Does it justify the enormous public attention it receives or the physical social and financial costs to members of his family?The play raises these questions stubbornly and extensively. That doesn't halt the action which perseveres as often in real life toward a goal whose worth is uncertain. The movie focused primarily on winning the battle tends to pull away from the play's uncertainties. Nevertheless in one respect it adds to them. When it takes us to court it shows the family's lawyer running circles fairly and unfairly around the opposition. Is a battle for justice unjustly waged a battle for justice?Robert Donat is very good as the family's forensic champion. I might have thought excellent had I not been spoiled by Ian Richardson's superb matchless? definitive? performance of the role in a PBS broadcast of the intact play in 1988. As the father Cedric Hardwicke is insufficiently forceful and expressive. Margaret Leighton as the daughter is pretty but insubstantial. Neil North does well as the expelled boy. Cameo appearances by Cyril Ritchard and Stanley Holloway are fun.".

There is no indication of animus against Ronnie on the part of the academy which had strong evidence for thinking him guilty. If their finding was incorrect it seems a reasonable mistake. Moreover the boy is happy in another school and increasingly uninterested in the crusade. In these circumstances how grave is the wrong? Does it justify the enormous public attention it receives or the physical social and financial costs to members of his family?The play raises these questions stubbornly and extensively. That doesn't halt the action which perseveres as often in real life toward a goal whose worth is uncertain. The movie focused primarily on winning the battle tends to pull away from the play's uncertainties. Nevertheless in one respect it adds to them. When it takes us to court it shows the family's lawyer running circles fairly and unfairly around the opposition. Is a battle for justice unjustly waged a battle for justice?Robert Donat is very good as the family's forensic champion. I might have thought excellent had I not been spoiled by Ian Richardson's superb matchless? definitive? performance of the role in a PBS broadcast of the intact play in 1988. As the father Cedric Hardwicke is insufficiently forceful and expressive. Margaret Leighton as the daughter is pretty but insubstantial. Neil North does well as the expelled boy. Cameo appearances by Cyril Ritchard and Stanley Holloway are fun.";

It seems in the early part of the twentieth century in Britain there was a petty theft and the boy was punished even though it was not clear he'd committed the crime. Not surprisingly the boy's father insisted there was a miscarriage of justice...but what makes it interesting is that the case didn't drop there but made its way all the way up to sessions of Parliament....where the case was championed by an MP. Some time later the playwright and screenwriter Terrence Rattigan resurrected the story and wrote a play about it...and changed the names in the process. Now some time after the play the story finally made its way to film and Rattigan teamed up with one of his favorite directors for this well made movie.It certainly helps the story that two very distinguished English actors appeared in two of the leading roles Robert Donat and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Oddly Donat was given top billing...even though he doesn't appear in the film until about the 40 minute mark! But both are mesmerizingly good...and the well crafted story really makes an impact on the viewer as they too are outraged by the school's highhanded and unfair handling of the case...especially when the accused was a mere boy. Well worth your time.".

ArcherShee was accused of stealing a postal order while a cadet at Osborne Naval College and dismissed from his post his father decided to challenge the dismissal and a battle royal ensued. While the real case had differences to the film the essence was the same and Rattigan's play and the associated film tell the story in a way that fully demonstrates the drama pathos and prejudices of the times.The casting is impeccable and the performances outstanding. Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Ronnie's father is superb and Robert Donat as the great counsel named as Sir Robert Morton in the film but actually Sir Edward Carson could not have been bettered his admittedly theatrical exmination of the boy before he accepts the case is sensational. That Donat is now largely forgotten is a tragedy as is his early death.  Margaret Leighton another who died tragically young is beautiful strongwilled and brilliant as Ronnie's older sister who gives up her romance for the cause and eventually falls for Donat. The supporting cast is without exception wonderful if slightly elderly for some of their roles. Marie Lohr Jack Watling Francis L Sullivan and the rest are all superb. The atmosphere of the day created by music hall interludes as well as by the overall surroundings is perfect.I've watched this film more times than I can remember but it never palls.

	schema:headline " A great human rights film with wit and superb cast";
	schema:reviewBody "A number of films have been made about great courtroom dramas. Some have been over basic human rights. And a few have been made about the challenges and efforts to get human rights cases to court. The Winslow Boy is all three of those things. The last was the most difficult and trying. Based on a true story this is a masterful tale of family love honor and integrity. But it's one that shows the sacrifices tribulations and dissensions among family members. It is not a film about justice. It is about right. Justice falls within the law but right is a higher aspect of life humanity and civilization. And that is wonderfully articulated in this film. Let right be done could be another title for the film. Besides the drama this story is laced with humor throughout. It is masterfully handled so that the serious aspect is never forgotten. The humor is interspersed among the cast and relates to other things of the day. Popular music and phonographs the suffrage movement styles and dress of the day allow for some light respites in the family's twoyear wait and worry about the case.The story takes place in England. It is based on the George ArcherShee discharge of 1908 that was tried and settled in 1910. The names of the characters have been changed and some of the characters in the film are different from those in the actual case. But the details of the case are about as they occurred. That includes the final statement from the Attorney General. Sir Robert Morton is based on Sir Edward Carson a politician and one of Britain's brightest barristers of the time. Where Morton is single in this film Carson was married. The ArcherShee family in the film is the Winslows. The wrongly accused Ronnie Winslow in real life George ArcheShee had an older halfbrother but not a sister. The addition of Catherine Winslow in this film provides for some excellent discussions and witty dialog as well as a subtle underlying romance. The cast for this story is superb. One can't imagine better choices for all the lead roles. Or any better performances. Robert Donat one of the greatest actors of all time plays Sir Robert Morton. He gives his character an air of aloofness that comes across clearly as snobbery. But as the story unfolds he changes ever so slowly and later explains to Catherine Winslow why his detachment is intentional. Margaret Leighton is superb in the role of Ronnie's sister. Catherine also is an intellectual favorite of the father Arthur Winslow. Cedric Hardwicke fills that role superbly. He has just retired from a major bank position. He suffers from severe arthritis but is determined to clear his son's name. Marie Lohr is excellent as Grace Winslow. She's at first a trusting and caring mother but then worries more about the family's comforts and social standing than about her son's honor. She has a long line of dialog in which she expresses her dismay over the case so disrupting their family. Jack Watling is very good as brother Dickie Winslow. His easygoing modern attitude as a college student at Oxford is a contrast to the other characters and shows a diversity among family members. And Neil North is superb as Ronnie. It was his first role in film and his only substantial one of just ten movies. North was an antiques dealer with a very short career in acting as a boy. But he returned to film more than 40 years later to play the First Lord in the 1999 remake of The Winslow Boy.Other characters are important in the story and are played superbly as well. Desmond Curry Basil Radford is a solicitor and friend of the Winslows who helps them secure Sir Robert Morton to handle their case. Frank Lawton is very good as John Watherstone Catherine's fianc. He eventually leaves her over the Winslow's persistence in pursuing the case. Kathleen Harrison is excellent and has one substantial line as Violet the family's maid of 25 years. The rest of the cast excel in their roles. Most notable are Francis L. Sullivan as the Attorney General Walter Fitzgerald as the First Lord Nicholas Hannen as Colonel Watherstone Ivan Samson as Captain Flower of the Naval Academy Ernest Thesiger as handwriting expert Ridgeley Pierce Evelyn Roberts as the Member of Parliament Hamilton and Kynaston Reeves as Lord Chief Justice. The real George ArcherShee story is a very interesting read. It has a sad outcome with World War I. But it included a government settlement to the family for its hardships in this injustice. It was a sizable amount. Sir Robert Morton alludes to compensation for the family in the end of this film. And the movie leaves the audience with a happy thought of a blooming romance around the corner between Sir Robert and Catherine Winslow. This highly entertaining and enjoyable film gives audiences a look at some top British actors of the day. It's a wonderful story with superb acting all around. Here are some favorite lines. For more poignant and clever dialog see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the film. Sir Robert Morton It has a certain ring about it hasn't it? Let right be done. First Lord In certain cases private rights may have to be sacrificed for the public good.Catherine Winslow But brute stubbornness may not be such a bad quality in the face of injustice.Sir Robert Morton I'm very glad to hear it. Both of those activities would be highly unsuitable in that hat.Lord Chief Justice You are prejudicing your case by these interruptions. Sir Robert Morton Oh? Do you really think so my Lord?".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the Terence Rattigan DVD collection with most of the adaptations being from the 70s and 80s when staying with family friends last year Rattigan very quickly became one of my favourite playwrights and he still is. His dialogue is so intelligent witty and meaty his characterisation so dynamic complex and real and the storytelling so beautifully constructed.'The Winslow Boy' is along with 'The Browning Version' and 'Separate Tables' one of Rattigan's best containing all of the above and also showing his gift of giving his principal characters an emotional and psychological complexity in a real life situation if not quite as much as 'The Browning Version'. Was even more blown away by this 1948 film than with the wonderful 1951 adaptation of 'The Browning Version' only because it doesn't have anything that rings false compared with 'The Browning Version's' contrived optimism at the end.Not only is again from personal opinion this 1948 film is the definitive version of 'The Winslow Boy' though it also has the excellent 1976 BBC adaptation with Alan Badel and Eric Porter and the version with Jeremy Northam which needs to be rewatched but remember it having a lot of good merits to compete with but it is also one of the best adaptations of any of Rattigan's plays.Rattigan's involvement himself with the screenplay has a lot to do with it. It is an incredibly faithful adaptation to the play practically unscarred and largely untouched remarkable for a work so textbound. Fidelity doesn't always come as a good thing when adapted if too faithful the essence of the work can be lost here it's the fidelity that makes 'The Winslow Boy' so impressive. Is it talky? Yes it is. That is not the fault of the film. The play is talky. Rattigan in general is talky but the dialogue itself and the themes that Rattigan touches upon are so amazing that to me this is a rare case of talky not being a bad thing. Rattigan manages to maintain the essence exactly of his own work while also opening up the action and extending it which immediately gives a more cinematic feel and immediately avoids the potential issue of being too stagy.Anthony Asquith directs as assuredly as ever never undermining the intricacies of the events and the complex character dynamic and sharpening up the legal and social dramas and Rattigan's class and hypocrisy insights. 'The Winslow Boy' is a beautiful looking film lovingly shot with sumptuous settings and costuming.From start to finish even when dialogue heavy the story is riveting with a much tighter pace than the BBC version and so much is told and done and in a way where one doesn't miss any of it. The highlight in the play has always been the interrogation scene between Morton and Ronnie that's the case here in this film as well some of the cleverest dialogue delivered with nailbiting tension and wit. The characterisation and character dynamic is spot on where one feels sorry for the right people amused by the right people inspired by the right people and grow to hate the right people. The main conflict is so easy to root for done with real intelligence and meat and one really wants justice done as much as the characters do and Catherine sums up Morton perfectly in describing him as a cold fish that you grow to admire.You need good acting to complement all this. The acting is more than good all round especially Robert Donat whose Morton is even more unforgettable than Alan Badel's and a brilliant performance in its own right one of his best. More than up to his level are a moving Cedric Hardwicke a charming and witty Margaret Leighton and Neil North's relatable Ronnie. It was easy to sympathise too with Basil Radford and learn to dislike Frank Lawton in John's eventual treatment of Catherine later on. Wilfred Hyde White makes a distinguished appearance as well.One expecting a climactic courtroom scene without knowing the play will be disappointed that one finds out the verdict a different way but that's also how the play ends and it rings just as true this way.In summary fantastic film and just as great an example of Rattigan at his best. 1010 Bethany Cox".

Rattigan in general is talky but the dialogue itself and the themes that Rattigan touches upon are so amazing that to me this is a rare case of talky not being a bad thing. Rattigan manages to maintain the essence exactly of his own work while also opening up the action and extending it which immediately gives a more cinematic feel and immediately avoids the potential issue of being too stagy.Anthony Asquith directs as assuredly as ever never undermining the intricacies of the events and the complex character dynamic and sharpening up the legal and social dramas and Rattigan's class and hypocrisy insights. 'The Winslow Boy' is a beautiful looking film lovingly shot with sumptuous settings and costuming.From start to finish even when dialogue heavy the story is riveting with a much tighter pace than the BBC version and so much is told and done and in a way where one doesn't miss any of it. The highlight in the play has always been the interrogation scene between Morton and Ronnie that's the case here in this film as well some of the cleverest dialogue delivered with nailbiting tension and wit. The characterisation and character dynamic is spot on where one feels sorry for the right people amused by the right people inspired by the right people and grow to hate the right people. The main conflict is so easy to root for done with real intelligence and meat and one really wants justice done as much as the characters do and Catherine sums up Morton perfectly in describing him as a cold fish that you grow to admire.You need good acting to complement all this. The acting is more than good all round especially Robert Donat whose Morton is even more unforgettable than Alan Badel's and a brilliant performance in its own right one of his best. More than up to his level are a moving Cedric Hardwicke a charming and witty Margaret Leighton and Neil North's relatable Ronnie. It was easy to sympathise too with Basil Radford and learn to dislike Frank Lawton in John's eventual treatment of Catherine later on. Wilfred Hyde White makes a distinguished appearance as well.One expecting a climactic courtroom scene without knowing the play will be disappointed that one finds out the verdict a different way but that's also how the play ends and it rings just as true this way.In summary fantastic film and just as great an example of Rattigan at his best. 1010 Bethany Cox";

	schema:reviewBody "Frankly I was bored by the tiresome plot about an upper class British boy who is accused of petty theft five shillings and sacked from school much to the annoyance of his stern father SIR CEDRIC HARDWICKE. It was a letdown. I was expecting too much after first reading the comments on this film. The smallness of the theft and the social class distinctions that were obviously meant to be pointed out with a subplot involving Hardwicke's daughter were not sufficiently engrossing for me to care about the outcome. ROBERT DONAT doesn't even enter the film until the first fortyfive minutes and then his character behaves rather oddly and seems cold and distant. Donat by the way was already beginning to show faint signs of the illness that he suffered all his lifethe asthma that gave his voice a nasal tone seemed to be affecting his health long before he made his last film.MARGARET LEIGHTON is the chief bright spot in the tale and FRANK LAWTON is effective as her not so wealthy suitor. NEIL NORTH is excellent as the Winslow boy at the center of the storybut it's a longwinded talky tale taken from a stage play by Terence Rattigan and could easily have been trimmed for the movie version.The ending is somewhat disappointing in that we don't see the Donat's actual triumph at trial. Instead the British maid overwrought with emotion comes tearfully into the living room with news of the verdict and gushes for five minutes about all the happenings before we close with an ending that suggests Donat may have an interest in seeing Leighton again. This implication was the only clever touch in the screenplay's rather limp ending.Sorry this very British melodrama was not my cup of tea. Director Anthony Asquith seemed to have a feel for courtroom dramas. WILFRID HYDEWHITE has a brief moment an actor later used in the director's 1959 version of another British courtroom drama LIBEL. But his skill as a director was sorely tested by this material.".

And when the main character has a nickname like lemming when you know you're in some laughs. Now that I think about it lemmings keep falling a lot in this video game. Okay this film was adapted from a novel and without having read it I'm sure they did a decent job with bringing this one to the screen. Fritz Karl is the actor who plays the title character here. I think he is okay but sadly his character does not have really that much to work with. The exact opposite is true for Krotznig who is the main villain here instead of the actual killer and the actor can let it all out without it ever seeming unrealistic. The female main character is played by the beautiful and talented Julia Koschitz and she adds a lot to the film too and I am not only referring to her topless scene here. As a whole this was an enjoyable 90 minutes and I recommend it to everybody who like their crime movies a bit on the funny side. It does never get stupid and it never feels as if this one is more about comedy but it is certainly a dominant aspect here. I personally found it almost more interesting to watch all the multilayered characters with their quirks than watch the actual case even if it is a really tragic story. The way he dies at the end says all about the dark comedy in here. Oh yeah and don't worry about the dog. Finally a dog survives in a film. This also is an indicator for this one being more of a comedy than a thriller. So yeah enough said. Check this one out if you get your hands on a copy.".

Unfortunately she wants more from himMUCH moreand she ends up doing something truly shocking.This is a downbeat and pretty disturbing movieit's not however especially believable.

Nosbusch does give a pretty convincing performance and this helps greatly. This firsttime German actress would go on to a short career in cinema including Englishlanguage films like Good Morning Babylon under the name Desiree Becker. She became more famous perhaps though as a singer and a presenter of the Eurovision contest where she no doubt introduced musical acts even worse than that of the fictional R.This was a good movie but unfortunately I got my copy via Britain where it was subject to some idiotic even by their standards censorship. To wit Nosbusch's impressive butt and boobs are literally on display for about ten minutes here but the Brit censors decided a brief fullfrontal scene was apparently just too harmful to society. This cut reputedly doesn't make that much of a difference though which is exactly why it is so STUPID. Anyway I would recommend this but if you have a choice try to get a version WITHOUT the checkered triangle with an 18 on it the international symbol of the idiocy of the BBFC. In any case much like R does with his obsessive young fan this one will definitely stay with you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Fan is a practically unknown horror film but also a very good one and a film that I would call the definition of a 'sleeper'. The film is halfway between a drama and a horror film with drama taking up the first hour before the horror is unleashed in the final third. Eckhart Schmidt's film draws you into the central character with the slow building opening and successfully lulls his audience into a false sense of security before pulling the rug from under us at the end. The result is very effective and ensures that the horror of the story carries a lot of shock value with it. The film focuses on a schoolgirl named Simone. Simone is a quiet girl and the reason for that is down her obsession with 'R'  a cheesy eighties pop singer. She's written him a letter in which she declares her undying love and constantly watches the post office for a reply and is constantly disappointed. She can't concentrate on her schooling and decides to hit the road in order to find her love. She eventually meets him in Munich but doesn't get the treatment she believes she deserves...The film is German and the version I saw was dubbed poorly into English  and that's really the only bad word I have to say about it. The first hour of the film focuses solely on the main character and her obsession for the pop singer and while I can't say I can relate to it from a personal point of view the way that things are portrayed makes things interesting. The loneliness of the central character always shines through and even though she's more than just a little bit odd the director does actually succeed in making us feel bad for her plight. The film is slow for the first hour and not a great deal happens although it really isn't boring and all credit has to go to the film for giving the audience an amazing payoff towards the end. All the patience invested in the film is surely rewarded when the big twist hits and Eckhart Schmidt delivers a totally bizarre conclusion and brings with it a change of pace that is really difficult to forget. I'm not too surprised that this film isn't often rated more highly as it will undoubtedly struggle to find a target audience but if you like your horror dark and shocking and have a bit of patience  this little flick is well worth checking out!".

	schema:headline " Slow paced for sure but what a pay off";
	schema:reviewBody "For the first hour this is a slow even stately paced movie utterly mundane and pretty boring for those who expect action scenes every ten minutes and a twistaminute plot. It's a West German production that feels very much like other product from that country I'm thinking in particular of MOSQUITO THE RAPIST here in that the characters are cold and the film has a clinically detached feel to it as if we're scientists watching events play out in a laboratory. There's not a great deal of room for emotion here but there is a high degree of realism  everything we see is matteroffact and everyday stuff from a teenage girl's pop star obsession to the daily life that goes on around her.Then at around the hour mark there is an absolutely massive plot twist and the film suddenly turns into this dark psychological horror yarn that isn't for the squeamish. It's never gory but the subtle events that play out involving dismemberment and cannibalism are extremely disturbing precisely because they're presented in a mundane normal way as if this stuff was expected to happen and is nothing out of the ordinary. This makes things all the more disturbing. As the young protagonist Desiree Nosbusch gives an understated performance that works precisely because she hides most of her character's feelings especially towards the climax of the movie. She's also far from shy and spends most of the latter half of the film walking around completely naked which is a little distracting for the viewer.The supporting cast members vary in quality but I did like Bodo Steiger as the odd pale pop performer and it's one annoyingly catchy tune he sings. So in essence this is a film where exploitation meets subtlety where depraved horrors are the stuff of normal existence and it works precisely because of that reason for viewers who are patient enough to sit it out to the end. As such it's a neat precursor to the kind of modern Japanese shockers like AUDITION where the surprises are saved for the final reel to blow the reader out of their seat at the film's climax. Just remember that TRANCE got there first.".

	onyx:emotionText "For the first hour this is a slow even stately paced movie utterly mundane and pretty boring for those who expect action scenes every ten minutes and a twistaminute plot. It's a West German production that feels very much like other product from that country I'm thinking in particular of MOSQUITO THE RAPIST here in that the characters are cold and the film has a clinically detached feel to it as if we're scientists watching events play out in a laboratory. There's not a great deal of room for emotion here but there is a high degree of realism  everything we see is matteroffact and everyday stuff from a teenage girl's pop star obsession to the daily life that goes on around her.Then at around the hour mark there is an absolutely massive plot twist and the film suddenly turns into this dark psychological horror yarn that isn't for the squeamish. It's never gory but the subtle events that play out involving dismemberment and cannibalism are extremely disturbing precisely because they're presented in a mundane normal way as if this stuff was expected to happen and is nothing out of the ordinary. This makes things all the more disturbing. As the young protagonist Desiree Nosbusch gives an understated performance that works precisely because she hides most of her character's feelings especially towards the climax of the movie. She's also far from shy and spends most of the latter half of the film walking around completely naked which is a little distracting for the viewer.The supporting cast members vary in quality but I did like Bodo Steiger as the odd pale pop performer and it's one annoyingly catchy tune he sings.

Hypnotically slowly it follows the development of a teenybopping waif's obsession with a pop star spiraling out of control. It's one of those movies which you kind of have to see in a cinema because on TV you'd zap away after 10 minutes. But it richly rewards your for its slower moments.Apparently there was a lot of controversy around lead actress Dsire Nosbusch's nudity scenes which are admittedly surprisingly crass. But they are not exploitative and absolutely gel in with the movie. Kind of ironic that immediately after this scene there is one of extreme violence which went practically unnoticed by the public. A nice society we're living in.It's very respectable that the director fought to keep these scenes in as they are essential to the escalation of the story. They are actually a good example of how those scenes should be done realistically but without becoming pornographic or voyeuristic. It's a big fat shame that this controversy tainted the reception and popularity of this great movie.And by the way other than is often stated the affair between star and fan doesn't end with the star dropping her after a night of carnality. It's not a case of find'um furp'um and flee. R. merely returns to his reality whereas Simone stays locked in her fantasy world.Some tidbits about this movie R. is actually played by the singer of the band Rheingold Bodo Staiger which furnished the soundtrack.

Believe you me it's all just patient and awkwardly uncomfortable building up towards one of the most shocking and revolting climaxes ever. This was an incredibly controversial release back in its home country Germany and it's not too hard to see why. Without revealing too much about the infamous denouement I can safely say this girl Simone singlehandedly gives a whole new dimension to the term obsessive groupie. Dsire Nosbusch gives away a hugely impressive performance as Simone and undeniably the other biggest strong point of the film  apart from the ending of course  is Rheingold's prototypic 80's electro pop music. If you're familiar with the oeuvre the relatively known 80's band Kraftwork The Model Autobahn Radioactivity you know pretty much what to expect. Der Fan isn't a movie for all tastes but certainly a curious collector's item for the more avid and openminded cult fanatic to seek out.".

Unlikely as it may seem R takes a personal interest in Simone and the pair spend the night together.

There is a coldness to the production that is reminiscent of some of Michael Haneke's works and the shocking ending is both deranged and satisfying. The mechanical newwave soundtrack fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film and mirrors feeling of Simone's alienation and despair. My only gripes with the film are the ATROCIOUS dubbing of my copy  I would have much preferred a subtitle track. The pacing was also definitely a bit slow until the final act of the film but I didn't find it to be overly dull. I'm also disappointed that my copy of the film appears to be the shorter 88 minute version and there does appear to be a few awkward edits in the sexscene and in the finale. I would really like to know what I missed in those two parts. Other than those issues DER FAN is a very solid and overlooked film that I would recommend to dark horrordrama fans that can stand to wait for the payoff...8.510".

The writer and director is Eckhart Schmidt and it's probably his most known work and also one of the most known works for actress Dsire Nosbusch who plays the title character that easily turned her into one of Luxembourg's most successful actresses ever and all this at such a tender age. I must say I am not familiar with any of the other actors in here though except Blacky Fuchsberger who has a small cameo. If you read a bit about this film you will see that it was a controversial film back then not only because of the contents but also because of the argument ensuing between Nosbusch and Schmidt around the time when the film came out and that had to do with Nosbusch's nude scenes.And with the controversy dying down over the last few decades very little stays memorable from this movie. I thought Nosbusch gave a good performance but I also felt that almost all the supporting players were mediocre or bad on most occasions. This also includes male protagonist Bodo Steiger and I am not surprised at all that he has not acted in more films really. The story also has huge problems in my opinion. For example it was entirely unfitting that Nosbusch's character suddenly starts cutting off body parts from the man. It feels a bit tough already for me to make an argument for her killing the man but you can somewhat explain it through spur of the moment and affect. There was no indication at all that she was a sociopath or a violent killer earlier and then they let her do stuff like that. Yes she was misguided but still. And lets be honest the way he rejects her is not really severe rejection and it's difficult to justify her screaming and her killing in that scene. It was also cringeworthy how they showed it so many times from different angles. Or how did nobody from the crew tell the police who he went away with. I am not sold at all. As a whole I can only say that by today's standards I see this film as a blatant case of style over substance that lacks realism entirely and goes for cheap thrills from start to finish instead of delivering a good character study. The bald head at the very end is the perfect example. I cannot recommend the watch. The few topless shots of the then already stunning Dsire Nosbusch are not enough to sit through all the mediocre and weak moments. Watch something else instead.".

She finally by chance ends up meeting him but their relationship takes a dangerous turn.I guess the less said about the plot of DER FAN the better it will be for those who haven't seen it. This now cult item was released to a lot of controversy and it remains somewhat shocking today and especially the twist that happens so it's best that you don't know this big spoiler so I'm certainly not going to give it away here. Is the film worthy of all the hype and controversy? I would personally say no as I think there are much better films out there that deals with someone losing their mind but there's no question that there's enough here to recommend it.I think one of the strongest things going for the film is the wonderful music score by Rheingold who manages to build a lot of dark atmosphere. I thought the score perfectly brought out the mind set of this teenage girl and I loved how it got deeper and darker as her mind began to slip. There's also some nice cinematography and some good editing that helps the film along. Director Eckhart Schmidt does a very nice job at slowly building up the slipping mind of this character. At 93 minutes the film actually feels much longer due to the slow style but for the most part I thought the director did good in making sure that it never got too boring.The performance of Nosbusch is another reason to check the film out. The actress was probably just 16 or 17yearsold when she made this film so there are going to be some who object to the full nudity that she has throughout the final portion of the film. I think attacking the film for this would be rather narrowminded even though the actress did stir up controversy when she tried to have the film pulled on its original release although I wonder how much of this was just hype to sell the picture. Either way she certainly delivers a convincing performance of someone slowly losing their mind. I thought she perfectly captured the naive nature of this character and when she finally goes off the deep end you can believe what you're seeing.i would also say that the biggest problem is that while the actress pulls off the mental state of the character the direction really doesn't pull the psychological drama out of everything like he should have. This film falls well short of the psychological horrors of something like TAXI DRIVER. THE FAN certainly has plenty of flaws including a notsooriginal story but at the end of the day the performances and the overall tone makes it worth watching.".

To make her classes seem more organized to Abercrombie Anna enlists the help of one of the older students fifteen year old Maori Whareparita. Anna's students including Whareparita see her as their guardian angel.

In this story Anna also has the extra element of dealing with a troubled suitor Paul Laurence Harvey who keeps showing up and causing a disturbance both physically and emotionally for Anna. Another more subtle suitor is the school headmaster Abercrombie. Then about halfway through the story we start to see another issue arise. One of her teenage students Whareparita played by the beautiful Nobu McCarthy is pregnant with twins. Anna talks to the chief who is happy with this news and asks Anna why she herself has no man and no children. Keep in mind the title of the original book is Spinster. At one point Paul tries to kiss Anna and when she puts a stop to it he says what you have is incurable. The production code was just about all gone by the late 1950s but we have to try to decide just what is holding Anna back. Clearly she doesn't want to have sex before marriage and says so several times. But is she afraid of falling in love? Or is there a bigger issue here? When the chief says men are the water to support her tree Anna says she had always thought of men more like lightning. I think the title of the book should have been Three Loves  Paul Abercrombie and teaching. At the abrupt ending we are shown a ray of hope that there has been a breakthrough of sorts for Anna.

It's also extremely talky. Talky is fine  I don't need action every second  but the dialogue needs to be scintillating. This wasn't.MacLaine comes off like a scatterbrain Harvey acts like a demented nut and Hawkins is very serious. I would have perhaps cast someone else in Hawkins' role.

I guess Hollywood thought it was interchangeable with England.Anna does come to grips with what and who she wants finally. But it's a strange film and it's hard to warm up to the characters. It's also extremely talky. Talky is fine  I don't need action every second  but the dialogue needs to be scintillating. This wasn't.MacLaine comes off like a scatterbrain Harvey acts like a demented nut and Hawkins is very serious. I would have perhaps cast someone else in Hawkins' role. It needed someone a tad younger and more charm or personality.Disappointing though not awful just kind of blah.";

Based only on this film I'd say Harvey was a pompous buffoon who overacted to the max. As evidence  the singing scene and the drunk scene. Based on Harvey's acting alone it is no wonder that this film was a total flop at the box office. I wonder when playing in the theatres did the audience laugh out loud at some of the dramatic scenes? Shirley MacLaine's acting is better but her situation is so foolish that it ruins her acting. And I saw that as someone who generally likes Ms. MacLaine.More interesting is Jack Hawkins. At least he appeared to be able to act in this drivel.There is only one reason to watch this film  to see just how bad a movie can actually be.

I think by now I am qualified to answer them or to at least give my opinions.Why does Laura choose to 'flush' her ring down the toilet instead of taking it off while she is in the ocean or pawning it? Because she is symbolically ridding herself of Martin and their dysfunctional marriage. She is in a hurry to get out of the house and never stops to think that the ring might remain in the toilet bowl. Under the circumstances would you? How did the lady from the YMCA get Martin's work number? And after Martin said he didn't know what she was talking about why did the lady continue to give Laura's life story? Martin was a successful Boston businessman. Laura took swim lessons at the Y in Boston for several months and apparently got to know some of the women fairly well. Her name and her husband's name were undoubtedly well known by the time she finished her swim lessons and moved on. It probably only took a look in the Boston phone book to find Martin as Laura had nothing to hide at the time of the swim lessons except the bruises which she explained away and surely mentioned where he worked or he had an individual listing. The lady was certain she had the right person when she was talking to Martin so unfortunately she developed diarrhea of the mouth and provided Martin with too many details.Why was the ring still in the toilet when Martin cut his finger months later? Didn't he use the toilet in those months? Or does he have a serious digestive problem? I am surprised so many people overlooked this the house at the Cape was the Burneys' weekendsummer home. Martin Burney worked in Boston and they had a house there where they lived during the week. When his wife died Martin immediately closed up the Cape house  hence the coverings on the furniture when he returned months later  and moved to their house in Boston. Guess he didn't have to pee before he left or he used one of the other bathrooms in the house.How did Laura get a house under an alias without a driver's license? What...in Iowa you don't need identification to buy a house or a car? And where did she get the money? Laura did not BUY a house she rented it and for very little in cash. She apparently bought a used car. As we saw when she returned to the Cape house after faking her death to collect her things and run away there was a big wad of cash in her travel bag. I don't remember all the details from the book but obviously she had been saving money all along. She worked parttime at the library in Boston after her 800 a.m. swim lessons one presumes so had her own money as well as whatever she could save from the money Martin gave her for groceries etc. Money talks in Iowa like anywhere else! Just because Laura didn't want to have sex with Ben Ben asks Oh my god what did he do to you?' How the heck does he know that anything happened? What does he have as evidence besides the facts that he called her in a crowd and she didn't respond and she had a bruise on her head? That's a pretty great assumption to make. Ben was a perceptive intelligent guy. He knew right after meeting her that something was seriously wrong in her life and that she was hiding her identity for a reason. He put things together pretty quickly but figuring out that she was running from an abusive man wasn't exactly rocket science with all the clues she gave out.And the thing that really makes me mad. She hears a noise so it must be her husband. Instead of calling the cops or running out of the house...she goes and checks the cabinets to see if all of the cans are neatly arranged. I know that this does happenbut if your husband was in your house what the heck would make you think that he took the time to arrange your cabinet and he's not just going to kill you? The man had been terrorizing her for four years. She was paranoid. She wasn't thinking clearly and was doubting her sanity.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen this movie for the first time in years I can safely say it is an easy entertaining watch but my praise stops there i'm afraid. The story of an abused wife who goes to extreme measures quickly becomes as predictable as the day after Friday is Saturday. The real highlight is that it proved Julia Roberts could act and go beyond romcom roles. However the same can't be said for Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson. Bergin speaks in a soft voice and bulges his eyes to make him scary which he fails miserably at Kevin Anderson's character is neither likable nor realistic. It is little wonder that neither of these two actors careers have progressed that much since this film. Also this film has so many unexplained and unrealistic moments that it becomes laughable by the end of the film. How after i'm assuming at least weeks does the YWCA decide to call Bergin and tell of Laura's life story? How did Bergin not spot the ring in the toilet before? How did Laura pay for a home for her mother without the supposed dominant husband getting wind of it? How did Laura suddenly become a brilliant swimmer? I ask this because even a reasonable good swimmer would struggle in a storm on the ocean yet Robert's character was practically a novice but swims to shore with ease! How come Laura's mum did not recognise Martin's voice when her daughter was with him for four years? What are the odds they never met? It is an insult to blind people as they recognise people by their voices! Why would Martin suffocate Laura's mum? What would it achieve? Wouldn't it be blatantly clear he killed her since he was the last person seen in her room? Also say Robert's character is at the most is 30 why does her mother look more as though she is pushing 80? So that would make her pushing 50 when she gave birth. How does Martin know where Laura lives before he has even started to follow her? He seems to have rearranged a lot as well in the short space of time he has in the house would even a crazed lunatic go to such lengths? Also when he is in the house he seems to be the greatest ever player of hide and seek. Its only a small house yet he manages to stay out of sight whilst overrunning a bath rearranging cans straightening towels and making a hifi turn on by itself. The truth is if you are looking for a by the numbers movie this will suit. If you want something that makes sense don't bother with this tripe!".

The story of an abused wife who goes to extreme measures quickly becomes as predictable as the day after Friday is Saturday. The real highlight is that it proved Julia Roberts could act and go beyond romcom roles. However the same can't be said for Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson. Bergin speaks in a soft voice and bulges his eyes to make him scary which he fails miserably at Kevin Anderson's character is neither likable nor realistic. It is little wonder that neither of these two actors careers have progressed that much since this film. Also this film has so many unexplained and unrealistic moments that it becomes laughable by the end of the film. How after i'm assuming at least weeks does the YWCA decide to call Bergin and tell of Laura's life story? How did Bergin not spot the ring in the toilet before? How did Laura pay for a home for her mother without the supposed dominant husband getting wind of it? How did Laura suddenly become a brilliant swimmer? I ask this because even a reasonable good swimmer would struggle in a storm on the ocean yet Robert's character was practically a novice but swims to shore with ease! How come Laura's mum did not recognise Martin's voice when her daughter was with him for four years? What are the odds they never met? It is an insult to blind people as they recognise people by their voices! Why would Martin suffocate Laura's mum? What would it achieve? Wouldn't it be blatantly clear he killed her since he was the last person seen in her room? Also say Robert's character is at the most is 30 why does her mother look more as though she is pushing 80? So that would make her pushing 50 when she gave birth. How does Martin know where Laura lives before he has even started to follow her? He seems to have rearranged a lot as well in the short space of time he has in the house would even a crazed lunatic go to such lengths? Also when he is in the house he seems to be the greatest ever player of hide and seek. Its only a small house yet he manages to stay out of sight whilst overrunning a bath rearranging cans straightening towels and making a hifi turn on by itself. The truth is if you are looking for a by the numbers movie this will suit. If you want something that makes sense don't bother with this tripe!";

I think Nancy Price did a far better job of studying an abused wife who never really stopped loving her brute of a husband than the makers of the film. It depicts SaraLaura as a far more interesting character than the somewhat insipid Julia Roberts version.If you have read the book then some little touches in the film i.e.  African Violets become clearer.".

The final third of the film is also well worthy of the word thriller for the tension is nigh on unbearable as we slowly come to the conclusion whilst Julia Roberts as Laura does a very tidy job as this sort of modern day princess escaping the evil clutches of her keeper. Must mention the great use of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique it's eerie and impacts hard for the scenes it is used for.Patrick Bergin plays his role well enough it's just that his villainy is never fully realised we see enough to know that what he does is wrong yet it feels a bit too polished. Whilst a sequence that sees Laura dress up as a man is clearly the low point of the film it really does stretch the viewers patience and sadly insults their respective intelligence. It's a mixed bag that isn't quite a waste of time it just doesn't leave you with anything other than a feeling of being semi fulfilled shame as it could have been brilliant with a bit more bravery and brains in the script 610.".

Julia Roberts brings a real vulnerability to all her roles and is perfect here as the affluent but both mentally and physically abused wife.The sad tale revolves around an apparently perfect upper middle class couple who share a beach home...the beautiful young Laura who has every material comfort and her obsessive and abusive husband Martin. Laura lives in terror of her abuser finally seizing a chance to escape by faking her own death and and fleeing to another town where she assumes an entirely new identity. Meanwhile Martin becomes ballistic when he discovers that his wife is not really dead and goes after her...I admit it the plot is pretty far fetched a lot of holes in the story some events depicted not very believable. Leave your logic behind. Still I was able to overlook all this and focus my attention on Laura's plight hoping she could evade or eliminate this intellectual brute and build a new life for herself with a new love.The portrayal of Laura's terror is vivid as she tries to appease her obsessive husband who becomes violent if she fails to keep the pantry shelf items in perfect alignment. The most chilling scene of all is the rape with its accompaniment of Martin's favorite classical music a piece which thereafter haunts his young wife. No sympathy here for the husband whose unfolding actions simply go from unspeakable to unthinkable.Not a particularly believable plot but engrossing nevertheless and a pair of vividly drawn characters who elicit strong emotions. However the best part of this movie is definitely its message. Contrary to the typical image spousal abuse is no respecter of social class. It would have been much more difficult for me before this film than it is now to picture an affluent educated sophisticated abuser.".

	schema:reviewBody "Selfdefense isn't murder That was the tag line of Enough a film that didn't know the difference between selfdefense and premeditated murder. It would have been a better tag line for Sleeping With the Enemy a movie that does know the difference. Whereas Slim plotted and planned her husband's violent death Enemy's protagonist Laura acts in the heat of a moment and most importantly her actions are justified.Laura and Martin have been married for four years and seem perfectly happy. Unfortunately Martin's severe ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder and selfconfidence issues have put a strain on the marriage. Laura simply can not live up to the standards he needs to keep his OCD under control. If the towels aren't hung correctly on the towel bar or if the pantry isn't organized just right he has a fit of uncontrollable anger. When Martin's fits elevate to physical attacks against Laura she leaves him.Laura fakes her own death and then begins life anew in a small town with a new identity and she has a romance with a man named Ben.Thankfully the movie doesn't try to justify Laura's running away or her adultery or make her seem perfect it simply shows the choices she makes. Whether she makes the right choices is all up to your own moral radar and I like that. If this were Enough the case would likely be much different. But this isn't Enough. This is much much better.Sleeping With the Enemy is a smart film that actually let's the audience see why Laura feels she has the right to leave Martin. Mostly it has to do with her own inability to deal with Martin's mental infirmities and that's an understandable problem. OCD can ruin lives and it can seem overwhelming when you try to help someone who suffers from it. I'm not saying it's right to run away but her fear is legitimately justifiable. And it's obviously her fear that causes her to overlook the possibility of getting Martin some help.Her killing Martin is also justifiable. When he bursts into her house with a gun that provides a reason to kill him. And what do you know it makes sense. Do I even have to say the E word again? We all know that movie provides no good reasons for anything that it's characters do. Even though the end of Sleeping With the Enemy is predictable it's really the only ending the movie can logically come to by that point so I really can't complain and I'll stay off my soapbox. Besides I need to save it for when I review Irreversible. Sleeping With the Enemy has other merits besides the smart script. For one the cinematography is beautiful especially in the early scenes at Laura and Martin's beachfront home. I was left saying Wow. Another selling point is the acting. Julia Roberts who usually bugs me does a fine job as Laura. She never takes it into the territory of melodrama or schlock thankfully. Patrick Bergen as Martin does a good job of portraying a sufferer of OCD and when Laura's ruse is revealed an enraged husband. He has reason to be angry with Laura for leaving him or so he believes thanks to his mental issues plus he has those selfconfidence issues that fuel his instability. To some he may seem overthetop but to me he seemed very real. Like I said OCD wrecks those who suffer from it.My only real problems with the movie were the silly way Martin died Three bullets and he's still standing? Please! and an unnecessary dance number with Laura and Ben. Why is it that some filmmakers deem it necessary to use pointless dance routines to show that two people are in love? And what place do songs like Runaround Sue and BrownEyed Girl have in a movie like this? However distracting those errors may be Sleeping with the Enemy is a fine movie that actually makes the effort to realistically portray real issues. And for that I commend it.".

Patrick Bergin is believable as a violent psychopath whose need for perfection in all things has grown to an absurd proportion and in addition Kevin Anderson is good as Ben who in complete contrast to Martin is good natured sensitive and caring.".

Patrick Bergin is believable as a violent psychopath whose need for perfection in all things has grown to an absurd proportion and in addition Kevin Anderson is good as Ben who in complete contrast to Martin is good natured sensitive and caring.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of many standard thrillers that were scattered through the late 80s and early 90s many of which would star Julia Roberts and which showed her to be more than just the pretty romantic lead. Here she plays a much stronger character a woman fleeing her abusive husband to start a new life strong independent but still skittish worried that she might be found.A tale of beautiful but terrified housewife LauraRoberts who resorts to desperate lengths to escape the constant fear of her violent and controlling husband martin Patrick Bergin in which she lives  faking her own death to be able to begin a new life far away. However finding little peace she is still haunted by her previous life a life which inevitably catches up with her when her husband discovers she is still alive and attempts to track her down.Roberts can do the strong independent woman role in her sleep and make it appear effortless  a fact proved later with her Oscar win for Erin Brockovich  and in Sleeping with the Enemy she shows the early talent which would eventually lead her to that Oscar win. Meanwhile Bergin is suitably menacing in a rentavillain kind of way all grimacing and intense staring. He does however have a rather interesting tic  a form of OCD towels all neatly lined up and so on  which could have served as a rather effective tension builder had it been given further development.However the film itself while entertaining and diverting enough in its' own right there is still something very standard and formulaic about the plot. For far too much of the film's admittedly short 94minute runtime we seem to be waiting for the film to get going and the climax arrives far too late and is too short wasting the tension which has been built up. In addition Kevin Anderson as Ben the white knight who should rescue Laura from her fear just does not seem to gel with the part  coming off as slightly creepy himself rather than a hero particularly in the early half of the film.Overall Sleeping With The Enemy remains a standard typical early 90s thriller of which there were so many no better or worse than any of the others. A curio for fans of Julia Roberts wishing to see her earlier career development in an effective performance but the average plot makes the film a throwaway thriller which could serve for a Saturday evening's entertainment with a bottle of wine but little more. Reasonable serviceable but forgettable.".

	schema:headline " Interesting plot line but some things unbelievable";
	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie on a few levels and there where things that I found totally unbelievable. The story line is basic an abused woman who flees from her abuser the enemy who happens to be her husband. I picked up something watching a second time. It was when the abused woman Julia Roberts calls her mother who was blind and in a care facility. The main character said she had a job and was making her own money. It made me think that possibly the reason she may have remained in the abusive relationship was because she didn't know if she could make it on her own support herself without him. She was young and beautiful but basically uneducated. She is wined and dined by a rich handsome powerful man a policeman that she marries thinking he was her prince charming and she his princess. His OCD and lack of ability to view her as a human but only as a possession means a horrible existence for her filled with fear as he beats her and completely controls every aspect of her life. She plans her escape and waits for the opportunity and then it presents itself. Here is where the plot begins to become unbelievable to me. When the impromptu opportunity arises and time is of her essence for her to make her escape she takes the time to cut her hair change her clothes throw her wedding ring in the toilet and basically leave a ton of clues that she didn't perish the way he was going to think she perished.This is possibly her once in a lifetime opportunity to get away from this monster and she risks it by taking time at their home doing things that could easily have waited. Of course she finds a love interest in a town far away. But I think the movie failed to really show the fallback of women who have been abused for years. I think it would have been much harder that they portrayed it and I think she would have looked over her shoulder for years possibly always. Forget about sitting on the front porch so soon after she escaped. I also didn't believe the mother daughter relationship. Maybe it was her grandmother and I missed it? Anyway it lacked believability. And even though the mother didn't know the husband she did know her daughter had to show up in male disguise to see her and had flown for her life and still harboring fear of being recognized and it getting back to him somehow. As a mother I would have been way too hesitant to talk to someone who just showed up in my room asking questions about my kid without knowing exactly who I was speaking with. This mother just handed up the info and every detail to the psycho husband. Yes I know she couldn't see him but she knew enough about the situation to have been on guard.Lastly in the final scene when she calls the police to report she had just shot an intruder why not simply say the truth. She had just shot her husband? Ben was there to back things up albeit he had been knocked out by the husband. Was this abused woman ever going to get her real identity back now? I thought this could have been much better by being more realistic.".

	schema:reviewBody "In all honesty this movie struck me as a bit flat both in terms of plot and performances. To begin with I'm not the biggest fan of Julia Roberts in the first place. I've had some mixed reactions to her work. She's been in a couple of good films but much that I've seen has disappointed me. Sleeping With The Enemy has to rank in that disappointing category.It's clich driven from beginning to end and it hits every note possible in the story of an abused woman. Roberts character of Laura Burney qualifies on that count married to a violent OCDdriven husband played by Patrick Bergin who controls every aspect of her life and makes her live in fear. Faking her own death Laura escapes his clutches moves to a small town in Iowa under an assumed name and of course falls in love with a nice guy Kevin Anderson  except that you know hubby has to be planning to show up. I'll grant that Roberts was the best part of a cast that really didn't inspire me very much.The movie is at times a bit slow paced but in the last twenty minutes or so it does have all the required chills for this kind of movie and there's some suspense about how it's all going to turn out. Still for the most part it was a rather uninspired effort which left a lot to be desired. 510".

From the bruised and bloody opening we know this is going to be a bad trip. After a few days of good sex Ms. Reid finds out she's very likely trapped on the island. Reid is also nervous and afraid around water. She never learned how to swim. Her cell phone doesn't work either. He looks great wearing only his jeans but Mr. Pardue shows psycho possibilities. Making matters worse Pardue is close to running out of cigarettes...There isn't much of a story here so director Joel Viertel deserves credit for sustaining some interest as scenes progress. The costars are about all you'll see they are good looking and beautifully photographed by Matthew Jensen. Pardue and Mr. Viertel keep the male lead from overreaching which does make his character and the situation more convincing. Pretty in pink lipstick Reid looks mildly disgusted when she first sees the honeymoon shack and maintains that emotion she keeps her shirt on also. While the repair efforts are appreciated Pardue's seethrough love shack does not look like it would stay dry inside.

From the bruised and bloody opening we know this is going to be a bad trip. After a few days of good sex Ms. Reid finds out she's very likely trapped on the island. Reid is also nervous and afraid around water. She never learned how to swim. Her cell phone doesn't work either. He looks great wearing only his jeans but Mr. Pardue shows psycho possibilities. Making matters worse Pardue is close to running out of cigarettes...There isn't much of a story here so director Joel Viertel deserves credit for sustaining some interest as scenes progress. The costars are about all you'll see they are good looking and beautifully photographed by Matthew Jensen. Pardue and Mr. Viertel keep the male lead from overreaching which does make his character and the situation more convincing. Pretty in pink lipstick Reid looks mildly disgusted when she first sees the honeymoon shack and maintains that emotion she keeps her shirt on also. While the repair efforts are appreciated Pardue's seethrough love shack does not look like it would stay dry inside.

It can be reached only after miles of travel over dusty logging roads. And the cell phone doesn't work out there either. You know there's gonna be trouble.When Britney still in her wedding dress climbs into the truck immediately after the ceremony and tells her new cutie to get me the fck outta here you also know you're in for some wonderfully bad dialog hammy overacting bad direction and writing and lots of lowbrow by the numbers fun. And this flick does not let you down. After a few days when Britney runs out of birth control pills and AF starts to get weird about wanting to make babies she might want to end the marriage as quickly as the real Britney did hers but boy does she have her work cut out for her to do it.This movie is something a community college drama student from say northern Minnesota who had seen a lot of Hitchcock movies and decided he could make one just like them might turn out. Cary Grant James Mason or Paul Newman our leading man ain't but the disconnect between his obviously angelic mallrat looks and the manly deer hunting wife beating obsessive character he is asked to portray is most of the fun.

The two are newlyweds and are on their honeymoon on a small island in a cabin. Mitch begins to go insane and sinks their boat. Since Julianne can't swim she cannot get off the small island and as Mitch becomes more and more insane she realizes that she may not make it off the island ever and if she does only one of them are going to be alive.This film reminded me of Misery and it was very suspenseful and entertaining. 1010.".

The acting by Tara Reid is pretty awkward at times but she did a good job. The husband's acting was dull and I thought him smoking in nearly every scene was annoying and distracting.Although this film is less than 85 minutes I thought it went for too long. There were some slow scenes throughout. I didn't like how every time she tries to escape and he taunts her yet she still loves him  though at the end though she fakes it. I mean from the first fight she shouldn't even have forgave him. She should've tried to escape from the beginning really as there was nothing nice about him.Besides those flaws the film was pretty suspenseful at parts which that was helped by the tense and adrenaline pumping score. For a TV film it did have good scenes of high tension and suspense. It's a fun thriller to watch although it shouldn't be taken seriously. The whole exotic yet isolated setting made it stand out from its predictabilities clichs and slow scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "Devil's Pond is a simple straightforward thriller movie that was a big surprise to me. The story itself is quite simple. Julianne Tara Reid is a young woman who marries a man named Mitch Kip Pardue. The newlyweds take off into the Montana wilderness for a naturefilled honeymoon on a small secluded island in the middle of a lake. After spending some time on the island Julianne gets tired and wants to head home away from the tiny cabin on the island. But Mitch begins to slowly go mad showing his true colors. Of course Julianne is terrified of the water and never learned to swim so she's trapped. After failed attempts at escaping Mitch's behavior becomes more and more violent to the point where he has Julianne chained up by her foot. She realizes that she needs to get off the island before one of them loses their lives.Reminiscent of Stephen King's Misery I found Devil's Pond to be a welldone thriller. The story was simplistic but the stylish direction and isolated setting really benefited the film and made it interesting. The acting was decent Pardue and Reid did a good job although a few moments came off as a little corny but it was nothing too major. They are for the majority the only characters in the film and they pull it off pretty well. The audience has sympathy for Julianne and you're rooting for her through most of the movie as Mitch gets more and more insane. There were some great action sequences and I thought the final showdown between Mitch and Julianne was very well executed and pretty creatively done. The atmosphere was great and the whole setting was beautiful. I'm quite familiar with Montana where the movie was filmed so I found the imagery and the setting to be rather interesting. I really don't know why everyone has so many problems with this movie I thought it was an entertaining and all around good thriller.Overall Devil's Pond isn't as bad as a lot of people on here are saying that it is. The acting was good for the most part the story was well written and interesting and my attention was held the whole way. If you liked Misery chances are you'll enjoy this too. This film goes to show you that you don't need a bundle of characters and a complicated story to make a good movie. 810.".

Kip Pardue's talent is limited to a few different facial expressions taking his shirt off once in a while and having tantrums. Tara Reid has one basic facial expression  like someone has asked her to figure out her bank balance using an abacus with warped beads. She slowly realizes the man she married is a loon and conveys through acting skills alone that she wonders if she left the porch light on when she left. The opening scene is of Tara smoking a cigarette which she handles quite convincingly looking mussed with a scratch on her jaw. THEN the story starts from her flashback point of view  the wedding bride's mom reminding them to be careful on the island mom's birthday is in a few weeks so be sure to be careful and come back in one piece preferably with a great gift in hand. I don't know what other pictures if any Joel Viertel may have directed but here's a free tip Joel  when you show the main charactervictim at the beginning of the movie and the rest is told in flashback we pretty much KNOW that no matter what happens she escapes and in this case with nothing worse than a few bruises a scratch on her jaw and a hankering for Marlboros. The isolated island setting is a good plot device until you see in the long shots that the cabin is in FULL VIEW of anyone who may be ambling around the pond. Tara's character also displays the ability to think quickly a talent she must have developed from taking 16 items into the 10 items or less check out counter. She wants Kip to leave the island so she can plan her escape so she burns up the WHOLE BOX of matches clever girl  and Kip has to leave the island to drive to the nearest PigglyWiggly for smokes and lights. Tara swings into MacGyver mode and takes action. Then stays there and waits for hubby to come back so they can act some more I guess. There's not much more to say other than this is a movie about two characters and the incredible match of wits halfwit vs. dimwit between them.".

Somehow she thought he was completely normal until they spend a couple of weeks at their honeymoon spot on a tiny island.Also Tera is scared of water which foreshadows the fact that she will be trapped on this island unless she can conquer her fear. Since this movie is a 'womangood manbad' type movie you can already predict the sequence of events and the ending.Reid does a better job at acting than her male companion but that isn't to say she's good. She goes from looking like she's going to have a breakdown to just looking out of it...maybe she was just drunk on set. Who knows?As for the rest of the movie it's filled with magical cigarettes that don't get soaked when swimming a diet of only pond water and meat which I must say there must be a water filter around that island because with Tera's shaved legs and fluffy hair there's got to be chemicals in there and a man that can take a frying pan to the face and a bear trap on his ankle but gets woozy when hit with a piece of wood.So that is Devil's Pond in a nutshell. If you are wondering why I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 it's because I got a laugh out of it. Will it also humor any of you to tell you I watched this film on Lifetime?".

It can be reached only after miles of travel over dusty logging roads. And the cell phone doesn't work out there either.  You know there's gonna be trouble.When Britney still in her wedding dress climbs into the truck immediately after the ceremony and tells her new cutie to get us the fck outta here you also know you're in for some wonderfully bad dialog hammy overacting bad direction and writing and lots of lowbrow by the numbers fun. And this flick does not let you down.  After a few days when Britney runs out of birth control pills and AF starts to get weird about wanting to make babies she might want to end the marriage as quickly as the real Britney did hers but boy does she have her work cut out for her to do it.This movie is something a community college drama student from say northern Minnesota who had seen a lot of Hitchcock movies and decided he could make one just like them might turn out.  Cary Grant or James Mason our leading man ain't but the disconnect between his obviously angelic mallrat looks and the manly deer hunting wife beating obsessive character he is asked to portray is most of the fun.  The rest is laughing at how dense the chick is for winding up out there in the first place and how once her brain cells start sparking a little she manages to get herself the fck out of the mess she is in.

By the end of the movie I was cheering the psycho on hoping he'd kill her before she had a chance to breed and thus noticeably bring down the average IQ of humanity. I admit I didn't have high expectations and only saw it because my girlfriend wanted to see it but I was floored by how weak and stupid the main protagonist's character was written. She was probably the weakest most useless character since the wife in the original The Shining. I would highly recommend you avoid this movie at all costs unless you enjoy watching about an hour and half of one stupid act after another. Maybe you could turn it into a drinking game every time Tara Reid's character does something you think is stupid and you would do something different take a drink.

I admit I didn't have high expectations and only saw it because my girlfriend wanted to see it but I was floored by how weak and stupid the main protagonist's character was written. She was probably the weakest most useless character since the wife in the original The Shining. I would highly recommend you avoid this movie at all costs unless you enjoy watching about an hour and half of one stupid act after another. Maybe you could turn it into a drinking game every time Tara Reid's character does something you think is stupid and you would do something different take a drink. I guaranteed you will get absolutely plastered.";

	schema:reviewBody "I found Fireproof to be entertaining as well in convicting. Most of the acting was realistic and sincere even if it was not professional. Within a very short time the story had me so involved in the characters lives that any minor flaws were not noticed. As in their previous movies the Kendricks brothers had me crying laughing cheering and during the action sequences on the edge of my seat.Being a Christian I was not turned off by the messages of faith in Christ that are an inherent part of Sherwood Pictures productions and I didn't feel like that aspect of the movie was being shoved down my throat. It is presented laid out before the audience and is there for you to take it or leave it. If you find occasional conversations about God Jesus or spiritual matters offensive then be warned you may be offended on occasion. I'm sure there are plenty of movies at your theater that push loose morals profanity and obscenity that you can choose if this is not your cup of tea. But if a message of being good kind and loving doesn't frighten you I highly recommend this movie.At times I saw myself on the screen as most of us can relate to some level of tension in marriage or any relationship. The principles behind the message can work in most situations  whether or not you are a Christian. And I believe people of any marital status can learn valuable lessons from this movie and be entertained at the same time.An interesting side note  I heard in a couple different interviews that Kirk Cameron auditioned for this part like all of the other volunteer actors AND was a willing volunteer himself  pretty much quieting the skeptics who claim he and others were making this movie to line their pockets.".

	schema:headline " Fireproof  A Poor Excuse For A Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I review this film I think you should know how I'm approaching this. I'm an Evangelical Quaker basically a Christian who believes that you can reach anyone by being understanding compassionate and loving without thumping their head with a Bible and my father at one time was a pastor of a church plant. My faith even though I abandoned it for about six months and became an Objectivist an atheist who believes in individualism has gotten me far in life. I suffer from Bipolar disorder and if you know anything about that would know that having this illness is a truly horrible thing. God is the only thing in my life that has been constantly helping me out in times of crisis. I have seen and been in relationships torn apart by addictions. I also want to be a film director someday. On top of that I write short stories and novels in my free time. I've studied the craft of good storytelling and I can recognize it when I see it.Now... on to the review... To put it as blunt as possible Fireproof is for Christians who are really well off in their faith and have not encountered anything truly wounding to them. It's not their fault I know but the fact that film makers are making money off of them for money really ticks me off. Christians are a really easy market to milk. Every artist knows that. Why? Well make a mediocre movie that's politically correct doesn't offend anyone and put Jesus' name in it and you'll soon find out. People especially Christians are so easily mislead to believe that just because the people who made the movie share their beliefs that it must be good even though the film's clearly bad. I love the premise of it. The idea of sticking by your partner and helping him or her out because you know that it can work out in the end is really rare nowadays. But they deliver it so poorly that it's laughable. And if you think that I'm being somehow antiChristian and that this movie is flawless let me point out all the things in this movie that are flawed 1 The conversations between the firefighters is so unrealistic. No curse words at a fire department filled with men? I mean... really? 2 If a guy found out that his wife was flirting with someone at the office with an intent on cheating his first response should be to take a shotgun go down where he works and stick it under his chin and say something like I'm going to blow your brains all over the wall if you touch her again. You do not show him your wedding ring and say Stay away from her or... or... I'll say something even more mean! Whoo! You tell him Mr. Firefighter! You tell that mean doctor! 3 You do not get over addictions instantly after being converted. It's a long and hard process. That is a myth that this movie is producing that I have a huge problem with. 4 People do NOT treat you with respect for getting religion of any kind. They will manipulate mock and even threaten you for your faith. Every time Christians tell me this is one of the greatest movies ever made I die a little inside. But when a truly Christian movie comes along like Walk the Line or The Road they ignore it because people say it isn't Christian enough. Nonbelievers clearly see the contradictions in that. These are the types of Christian movies that people should look up to instead of this trashTender Mercies 1983 Deals with the theme that some people need to be polished with love in order to change.The Road 2009 Deals with the theme of persevering in the harshest circumstances presented to you. This was marketed towards Christians to show how the world will be like when the church is next to nonexistent. The fatherson relationship is a metaphor for passing the torch on to the next generation.I Am Legend 2007 Deals with the theme of losing everything in your life and then regaining it again and realizing God's love.The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 Asks the question of how people ignore God when they have seen the Devil.Walk the Line 2005 Again deals with the theme that some people need to be polished with love in order to change. Christians complained this wasn't Christian enough even though it clearly shows Johnny Cash's faith after he's gotten clean through his actions.Signs 2002 Deals with the theme of losing everything and losing faith. In this case a preacher losing his wife. If you hate M. Night Shyamalan a lot ignore the fact that he made this movie. You'll thank me for it.I could go on and on. The point? These movies were well done had great quality and produced a very strong Christian message. Churches ignored them because they weren't up to their impossible standard of being politically correct and nonoffensive and still having good quality. It just can't happen. Why are Christians so afraid to show the brutality of life without God? It doesn't make sense to me... and it never will.I could go on and on about this but I think truly openminded people no matter what their faith will get what I'm saying. God bless HorrorWriter7493".

	schema:headline " Husband emasculating brainwash tutorial";
	schema:reviewBody "Caleb is a respected leader of a firefighter squad. His wife works in the hospital and flirts with a married doctor. When Caleb comes home all he gets from his wife is bitching and disrespect. No wonder he resorts to internet porn and is saving money for a boat probably so that he can sail away and finally enjoy life outside of his work. His wife wants to intercept all the money he has been saving and make him doing household chores so she constantly nags and shows disrespect. In the meantime she is working on her backup option a rich doctor who would likely give her more money than her blue collar husband. Finally she resorts to a divorce threat to break Caleb's spirit. The firefighter would be happily free from the greedy witch but his father begins a series of preaching sessions and is finally successful in persuading Caleb that he is the one to blame for all the marital disorder. The newly brainwashed firefighter smashes his porn loving computer and starts a program in which he sucks up to his wife every day. He even starts doing household chores. She ignores him and continues to work her charms on the doctor until she makes sure that Caleb is totally obedient to her and would accept any crap she gives to him. Finally he gives her actually her mother all the money he has been saving for his boat.The only thing that the wife really goes after is money. She did not care that her hubby was doing his best to please her for 40 days. When she was thinking that the Doc was the one who gave her the money she was falling for him and was ready for a divorce. When she realized that the money was actually given by her husband she started loving Caleb again. Basically she acts like a super expensive escort If the married doctor had given her more money than her husband she would have followed the money because this movie blatantly shows that this is the main thing which makes her tick.The movie basically teaches how to emasculate and brainwash your husband to get all the money and all the control in the relationship. Well life is brutal. But wait why is this called Christian?".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is in the same honest nonglitzy straightforward style of its predecessor from the same team Facing the Giants a film I loved. It tells the story of a marriage headed for dissolution which is turned around when the husband makes a commitment to God and his wife. Kirk Cameron is a revelation and if you saw him as a cocky sitcom star in Growing Pains in the late 80searly 90s you will be amazed as the fireman husband who gets respect everywhere but at home and has never asked himself if he deserves it. At the urging of his father he agrees to take forty days before seeking divorce and work through a book called The Love Dare. This book offers a new suggestion for deepening the love relationship to be followed every day together with short related Bible verses. At first Cameron's character just goes through the motions but as time goes by helped by his parents and a fellow fireman his love is transformed and renewed. Is it to late to reach his alienated wife?Uplifting but real the movie will inspire many married people to commit more deeply to their marriages. Truly worthwhile.".

I'm not married myself but it touched me so much because I saw in it the relationship my parent's have had for years.

Fireproof finally puts together solid production values mostly topnotch acting and a very nicely written script that includes some clever plot twists.Yes it is explicitly Christian in its message.

Yes there are two or three moments where the sentimentality goes just a bit over the top.If any of these statements about Fireproof close your mind to it that's your loss but God bless you as you pass on this one to go see something lighter or edgier.

I get tired of everyone trying to fix him doesn't anyone listen to his problems. It really hacks me off that Christians try to fix everyone instead of listening. and this movie has lots of fixing. even people who don't have a relationship with the main characters try to fix. IE the nurse talking to the wife towards the end of the movie. OMG! earn the right to speak into someones life.2. She didn't do anything to help their marriage. the movie portrayed everything as being his fault. anyone who's been in a tough marriage knows that both sides do their part to make things worse. she isn't free from being just as guilty as he is. The church and this movie has told men a lie for far too long..... That they have to earn respect and freely give love. I disagree i think that men should freely give Love to their wives but wives should freely give respect to their husbands. that is the 1 need in each gender why do men have to work so hard to gain respect but also work so hard to show love. this movie put all the responsibility on the husband and none on the wife.3. this is by far the thing i hated most about it. She was flirting with another man.... allot!!! and she never apologizes for it. What kind of message are we sending wives?? that is OK to flirt around if the husband isn't loving enough? the husband apologizes for all his crap and not once does she ever say that she is sorry.once again its all up to the man to fix everything. i wish they could make a realistic movie. the divorce movie with Bruce Willis was better than this. the story of us".

She was flirting with another man.... allot!!! and she never apologizes for it. What kind of message are we sending wives?? that is OK to flirt around if the husband isn't loving enough? the husband apologizes for all his crap and not once does she ever say that she is sorry.once again its all up to the man to fix everything. i wish they could make a realistic movie. the divorce movie with Bruce Willis was better than this. the story of us";

But as the film progressed and reached its climax there were actually some very powerful and moving moments performed very impressively by both Kirk Cameron and Erin Bethea. This movie kind of reminded me of Freedom Writers where overall it was soso yet contained some very poignant profound and memorable scenes.I am a Christian and I admired the fact that the makers of Fireproof were not shy of bringing forth the Gospel message and how Jesus Christ should be the focal point of a healthy marriage. I couldn't help but think what I would have thought about this movie if I had seen it before I received Christ into my life. Back then I think I can honestly say that I may very well have turned it off after those first 20 minutes. But if I hadn't it could very well have helped to change my life.

The whole movie is about him trying to find ways to save his marriage and become a better man. I think that after you see this movie you will want to start praying and believing in the lord. The movie is extremely sad in many different scenes. It had a ton of emotion in several scenes especially the firefighting scenes. The movie is mostly all about second chances at life. The acting started out pretty average and got a little better. The only really good actor was Kirk Cameron. I think that everyone who sees this movie will most likely tear in one scene. The movie hits you hard and doesn't stop until the very end. It gets better and better as you keep watching. If you pay close attention you can pick up many different smart things about the movie. For a lowbudget film this was a very superb one. This movie was really great for couples having trouble with marriage should see. Adults would understand this movie very good. Kids might get a little bit out of it as well. I think all parents should take their kid to go see this movie and have your kids follow the lord at a young age. Overall this was a very excellent movie with a great amount of meaning.".

I saw a preview of this film on the Hallmark channel and thought it was going to be a cable movie...so I was completely blown away when I saw it was going for major release. I am not a diehard Christian let me say that first and foremost. I will not tell you how this movie rocked based off of Bible verses...I will tell you that it was an important story about reaping what you sow and staying true not just to God if you don't believe but to your morals and being a good kind person.Kirk Cameron delivered an AMAZING performance as Caleb Holt frustrated by his marriage and more so questioning himself for why everything he seemed to do was wrong. Erin Bethea was perfect as his frigid wife who seemed to have thrown in the towel when her fairytale marriage didn't pan out the way she imagined it the film opens with a voiceover of her as a little girl asking her mom about marriage. The supporting cast was great and I don't know why people thought Kirk was so unbelievable as a firefighter ok i admit I don't know A LOT about the ins and outs of their daily work.There was a Jesus element of course...but I went into the movie expecting Bible verses at every turn. Not so. I think my favorite part of this movie was that the people in it seemed like REAL PEOPLE not actors. If was as though people were just grabbed from a regular church potluck and asked to play roles in the film now here I do come from a background of church plays and drama so maybe I am a bit biased. I was really glad I saw this film and definitely thought it was excellent! I would say if you are prepared for a movie with a lesson see this...if you want lovemaking scenes and need lots of blood swearing alcohol and hitting people...skip this film. But don't trash it or say it is horrible insulting or lame because it has a be a good person...and here do that through God message it pretends to be nothing else.".

Man has anger management issues. Man's father who is openly Christian leads him on a venture to save his marriage and with seemingly nothing to lose man accepts. Then it starts to take an interesting turn unlike most movies that have been made in a long time.That's because for the first time in any film since Passion of the Christ the message is blatantly Christian. There's no subtlety or mere illusion the core premise is that without Jesus attempting to rescue a relationship is hopeless. Whether it be listening to the old man confidently remind his son about Christian principles that apply to relationships Bible verses throughout Caleb's 40day plan or characters getting saved by Jesus onscreen this movie ultimately says one thing It all comes down to Christ. Depending on your beliefs you'll really love or hate what starts to unfold and my prediction is that a wide diversity of 1's and 10'slargely 10'sfrom user reviews on IMDb will demonstrate this.For those of us who stand somewhere in the middle on this we are simply left to judge how the events unfold on screen and in truth it almost works very well. It's got decent action and fairly welltimed comic relief but that's not to mention some of the best character development I've seen in any film this year. However there's one big catch Fireproof relies heavily on gender stereotypes and I can't help but think that this is going to deal its reputation a black eye when it hits the big screen. We see women and their gossip cliques male coworkers and their antics a woman gradually opening herself to outside relationships a man who tries but fails to sneak in online porn two rescue scenes whose victims are in both cases female etc. I'm very very sorry but I cannot see how a movie claiming to show people how to resolve relationships can get away with such a cardinal sin. If saving one's marriage is about looking within at one's true self then this movie flings an awful lot of stereotype crap in the way.Now don't get me wrong there are a lot of good moments here that a lot of people of many faiths or lack thereof will be able to take away from Fireproof. Looking within and not pointing fingers at others getting one's anger under control leaving one's work at work learning to be sociable with those around you and saving enough emotional energy for your spouse are all lessons that we need to learn. In spite of that however lies the other problem that this movie can't shake Try as it mightand it tries darn hardit never makes a fireproof case that Caleb absolutely had to rely on Jesus to resurrect his marriage. It can't truly say that all the abovementioned problems could have been cured via counseling or simply shutting the hell up and listening to other people most of all his wife. To those who would disagree or even have seen or experienced such a comeback in relationship as a result of an increased faith in Christ so be it. I fully accept the fact that this story may well be based on a true story that faith in Jesus Christ may prove to be that missing link in ones life. Just be willing to offer other people whose views diverge from your own the same level of respect.But I digress this is a film review not a post in an online religious forum. For underrated acting the film receives some bonus points. But for raising more questions than answers and for biting off more than it wants to chew it loses them back. 12 4 stars.".

The writing was very good and the acting did not come off as if a church group just wanted to make a movie. I know some of the actors had only been in maybe one other movie but they did an outstanding job. I felt that they portrayed a marriage in trouble that was very realistic I even identified with some of it. It is a Christ based movie but just like in Facing The Giants I did not feel I was preached at. The Kendrick brothers are a good team and I hope they will keep giving us some wonderful movies to see in the future. They did a great job giving you some very light and funny moments to help balance the intensity of some of the scenes. There were a few times that I was on the edge of my seat and then the next I was laughing my head off. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who has struggle in their marriage or is planning on getting married.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a cult classic in Milos Forman's native Czech Republic where the previous Communist regime banned it for its biting social satire and because Forman emigrated to the US.The director brings out a number of themes and devices that would become his trademarks on later awardwinners such as One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest Hair and Amadeus. Nonactors and firsttimers predominate in the cast giving the film a gutsy realism. As in Forman's later films the pace and tone of the film are light and comedic setting the viewer up for the shock of the tragic denouement. And it is worth noting that the film's cameraman M. Ondricek and art director K. Cerny later continued to work with Forman in Hollywood winning Oscars as well.The Czech subtitle translates roughly as In which they dance steal and extinguish and that about sums it up. A retiring smalltown fireman is treated to a farewell ball by the rest of the brigade. The retiree clearly a holdover from the prewar democratic society represents the old values of personal decency and integrity contrasting pointedly with his younger colleagues. Most of the film is taken up by the ball itself and depiction of the townspeople involved. The characters drawn range from gentle caricature to fierce satire. Highlights include a hastilyarranged beauty contest each girl uglier than the next a table full of disappearing door prizes another one is gone every time you look  and the couple guarding the table are doing some of the stealing too and the final presentation of the award to the retiree the box with the ceremonial fireax is empty but the old man stoically hides his confusion and disappointment.In these episodes Forman is indirectly criticising not just a decadent society but the Communist regime whose lawlessness and twisted sense of values brought about the decay. The final moments of the film  when an actual fire breaks out in the town  make the point uncompromisingly people have forgotten what is really important in life.If you don't care much for European films and aren't interested in life in the former East bloc this film may seem tedious and the humor hard to understand. But if you want to see one of the classic films of the Czech New Wave and gain an insight into the early development of an Oscarwinning director this film is definitely worth an hour and a half of your life.".

Forman had to deny that there was a political message behind the film in Socialist late 60's Czechoslavakia. He has a rare talent for presenting humans not necessarily pretty but engaging and natural. Forman encourages us in an introduction to not think too much.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you're only familiar with Milos Forman through his latterday works such as the People vs. Larry Flynt Man on the Moon Amadeus or even Cuckoo's Nest you should probably do yourself a favor and seek out his earlier films made in his native Czechoslovakia. Made during that country's years as a Soviet satellite The Firemen's Ball can be seen as an underhanded commentary on the shambles of communist rule but more importantly it can be seen as an exploration of human foibles. Abiding by Murphy's Law apparently everything that can go wrong does go wrong with the Firemen's Ball planned to celebrate the retired fire chief who is now dying. Prizes are stolen and ugly girls become contestants in a beauty pageant. It's all very funny and everyone is quite silly but the film doesn't lack empathy. Forman sympathizes with his characters because he knows that they're just like the rest of usbumbling through life causing and becoming affected by minor catastrophes.As I said it's very funny but not without a tinge of melancholy which primarily emanates from the old chief. The film recognizes that yes these mishaps are funny but sad toosad because this is the only sendoff the old man is likely to receive and sad because he doesn't necessarily want the send off. The film is an amazing amalgamation of pathos and humor quite like some of Woody Allen's more inspired comedydramas Manhattan comes to mind. This is whimsical filmmaking at its best and a wonderful if too short film. Forman has attempted to capture the same sense of silliness spontaneity and joy in his American films but they come up somewhat lacking. Along with Loves of a Blonde this is likely his crowning achievement and for what posterity should remember him. From my perspective it's also the film most like Forman himself. About six years ago I met him at a film festival in upstate New York. He shuffled into a panel discussion with Michael Ondaatje Paul Schrader and Russell Banks about fifteen minutes late. Forman wore sweatpants and looked exhausted yet he was the liveliest and most amusing member of that panelyou could see pieces of Tom Hulce's performance in Amadeus or Nicholson's performance in Cuckoo's Nest there. Having seen The Firemen's Ball I know what I actually was seeing was this film in the flesh.".

The 1967 comedy The Firemen's Ball has been interpreted as an allegory for the Socialist system that had a major effect on how people lived in Eastern Europe at the time but it also works as an entertaining little flick in its own right.The loose plot was inspired by an actual firemen's ball that Forman and his screenwriter friends once attended. The aging fire department of a small village is arranging a ball in honour of their elderly chairman who is turning 86 and unbeknownst to him dying of cancer. The program is to include at least music dancing a beauty contest for the ladies and a lottery with various prizes but it seems that Murphy's Law is alive and well in the village the lottery prizes keep getting stolen at an increasing rate nobody wants to participate in the beauty pageant and the general chaos grows more and more out of control. Soon the firemen get to demonstrate their occupational skills in a genuine incident.Most of the actors were reportedly real firemen from the town where the movie was shot but despite their lack of acting experience they fit in their roles perfectly. The grumpy men's arguments about the stressful arrangements are pretty hilarious but the women are funny too even though their roles are somewhat smaller. Also personally I didn't find any of the reluctant beauty contestants ugly at all unlike the frustrated committee members! In addition I should give a nod to the catchy ballroom music that is playing for a lot of the time and even references a Beatles song at one point. It is possible that the atmospheredriven collection of errors and misadventures may feel aimless to some viewers who would prefer a stronger plot but those with a fondness for looser narratives should find it easy to enjoy the firemen's adversities.Besides the comical bumbling there are also more melancholic moments in the short movie. The fire scene near the end carries a feel of powerlessness when an old man watches his house burn down while the firemen futilely try to put the flames out by shoveling snow into the fire. Still the service of drinks is never interrupted during the turmoil keeping up appearances no matter what. The whole plot line of the stolen lottery prizes also culminates in a wistful moment when the honorary chairman finally gets to accept his gift after sincerely thanking his colleagues for the help they have given over the years. This lack of the oftmentioned solidarity among the masses not so much among individuals may have been what prompted the Czechoslovakian officials to originally ban the film forever.As for myself I can say I enjoyed The Firemen's Ball more than Loves of a Blonde 1965 the other early Forman film I have seen at the moment. Czech cinema in general is something I'd like to get better acquainted with later but for now I can say that The Firemen's Ball is probably my favourite of the handful of movies I have seen from the country.".

Forman directs wonderfully the script is deep and funny and the story changing from gently mocking smalltown manners to a blazing allegorical satire on the incompetence of the rulers drew me right in. The pace was taut there are many details to be admired not just with the ball but with the satire and politics too and the acting is great.All in all a very interesting film but not the careerbest film from a talented director such as Forman.

	schema:headline " Appealing More as a Historical Example Than a Film In and Of Itself";
	schema:reviewBody "Milos Forman's 65000 black comedy which clocks in just above one hour takes place as small town firemen reckon on their festivity are present at it and endure it. They've arranged the titular ball in honor of their former chief though it may be in the chief's eleventh hour. The beginning scene seems to promise an airy screwball comedy with lines like We should have given it to him last year when he was 85 instead of now when he's about to die. As is made clear while the simple men theorize on the reasoning contrary to that observation that the antiquated fireman diagnosed with cancer unbeknownst to himself will be awarded a princely little fire ax in a velvetpadded box. Following this opening scene a fireman balances carefully on a high ladder to carefully singe the sides of a paper banner until his ladder loses its footing he is left dangling and the poster bursts into flames. Beyond these actually quite underplayed scenes the comic feel diminishes in consistency.One scene which stands out is easily one of the funnier moments but even still it could have been funnier In the course of the ball a local barn catches fire and the firemen rush the rest of the town to the scene. But their truck getting stuck in the snow is much more pivotal and potentially funny than its execution here as by the time they get there the barn is overcome by an inferno. Nonetheless there are laughs to be had at this point The sullen farmer is staring longingly at his blazing barn the firemen heed the suggestion that his chair be turned away from it but the farmer simply turns his head to continue staring longingly at the barn. And when the farmer whines that he is cold the firemen do the only thing they really can and move his chair closer to the fire.The swelling to that scene consists of the firemen's struggle for a beauty pageant with the queen deputized to bestow the ax. They fill a table with raffle prizes that are salivated over as implied in a very restricted sense within the context of the film's time and place. So the prizes begin to depart a bit too early from sight. The beauty pageant is a catastrophe of ignorance and disorganization and not least owing to hardly any of the neighborhood girls none of whom are beauties have any desire to be involved.Siding very much with the film itself concerning its treacherous political history Forman is not scoffing at his characters but at the system they populate. Frankly I think the censors knew this when they condemned it as a damaging picture of Czech society because that is the reactive approach in a fragile system that panics about criticism. Censors have always feigned the role of patriots regarding any criticism as unpatriotic when in effect criticism is a patriotic responsibility. Even now here in America when the media is judged for disapproval it most often merely signals that someone has had the nerve to probe the guiding principles of the party in power.So this presently obscure installment in the tremendous Criterion Collection appeals to me as a historical example particularly with which to further open the elements of the Bush administration and not so much for the film's content in and of itself. As a raucous comedy by Milos Forman it today sponges no oomph from its hazardous time as it clearly did then. And it is as a indirect topical commentary where this film gains momentum and alas Forman cleverly for the sake of his film's spirit did not urge his political arguments leaning back with a grin to let them make themselves insinuating with poise from the histrionics.".

By itself there isn't much about The Fireman's Ball to set it apart from the British Carry On movies or from any other oddball comedy made in Europe in the 60's and 70's.That's not to say the film doesn't have some excellent scenes the one with the beauty pageant contestants in the officers' office is the most famous but certainly not the only memorable one. The humor is black and dry but the very natural acting by the local unknown actors makes all the difference their facial expressions telling a complete story all by themselves and the film has some truly inspired shots especially considering the meager budget. The great scenes are few and farbetween though and they can easily get lost in the general messy chaos and it's easy for the viewer to get bored quickly. To sum up I recommend it for cinephiles and lovers of cinema history especially cinema made under Communist regimes  I'm glad I saw it even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped to  but not for the general public.".

I'd always been curious about his earlier Czech career but only now have I watched The Fireman's Ball and realized that he's always been a talent. Most of its scenes feel like a farce almost like a Jacques Tati film seen through a veritie lens. It's pure joy to watch things escalate out of control over such small things. Despite the 43 ratio limitations the colourful cinematography is wonderful and it fits perfectly with the music and ensemble of characters. It's a truly great satire which is always interesting and surprising if very simple. I wish more films were like this as through its satire it says a lot about the attitudes and behaviour of society.

	schema:reviewBody "Released three months before the Soviet crackdown on the progressive Dubek administration in Czechoslovakia Milos Forman still had to deal with a negative reaction to 'The Fireman's Ball' from both Communist censors and his own producer Carlo Ponti. Forman's farce was intended as a goodnatured ribbing of the Communist system specifically its corruption and bureaucratic ineptness. The censors and Ponti didn't like it because in their eyes it had no sympathy for its working class subjects who come across as complete fools.As the story goes Communist officials decided to play the film in the small town where the film was shot which featured locals playing themselves as members of the local fireman's committee.

They identified immediately with the broken down system where a fire breaks out across the street but the firefighters are unable to do anything as their fire truck ends up stuck in the snow.

Forman was ultimately saved by French director Francois Traffaut who ended up buying the film with some partners and distributing it outside of Czechoslovakia where it was permanently banned after the Soviet invasion.As for the film itself 'The Fireman's Ball' manages to be distinctive mainly on the basis of the authenticity of its performers.

	schema:reviewBody "Milos Forman's third feature THE FIREMEN'S BALL is the last film he made in his motherland and Oscarnominated in the BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM category lost to U.S.S.R.'s mammoth WAR AND PEACE made by Sergei Bondarchuk. It is an outright comedy masked with mordant mockery of the Communist party the story takes place on the day when the titular ball is held to honor an 86yearold exchairman of the fire brigade in a small Czech town and reallife firemen and nonprofessionals constitute most of the cast. Milos Forman is unequivocally a master of satire and an adept hand in shaping up its comical storyline inside a groaning town hall peopled with local folks the succinct diegesis the film's running time is merely 71 minutes chiefly concentrates on two burlesques a droll situation of missing raffle prizes which are overseen by a hapless fireman Josef Kolb and his wife Jezkov and a firemen committee's listing up proper candidates for a beauty pageant whose winner will have the honor to confer a honorific gift to the exchairman as the culmination of the evening. While the former is portrayed with a peevish overtone and somewhat plebeian rejoinders but at least it elicits some chuckle when petty larceny is revealed within one's own household the latter is plain lowbrow hijinks pampering for lecherous geezers and crass to the petticoat participants exploitative to the younger ones and disrespectful to the motherly ones that is not what we contemplate as comedy with class. But the film actually ameliorates itself when a fire alarm disrupts the farce where the pageant goes awry and Forman does create something aesthetically poetic with the spectacular outdoor scenes where a house is devoured by conflagration with its intractable owner wistfully looking back in consternation and onlookers casting lugubrious looks to the loss and incandescence then this piteous instance precipitates the final dressingdown of the tentacles of corruption and filching among the country's populace the lightsoff tactic is so accurate for those who grow up in a Communist country and of course it backfires where the famous line paraphrased here the repute of the brigade over one's own integrity becomes an obvious fair game of the censorship it is an outright attack on the authority's inaction and stateoverpeople frame of mind one can hardly conceive it as unintentional with its conspicuously democracyangling slant in hindsight it even tempts one to doubt whether Forman was deliberately concocting this film as a stepping stone for himself to bail out from the regime he can no longer consent with. A rather shrewd and dicey stratagem if it were true and looking at where he is now? Enshrined among the rarefied two times Oscarwinning director list with two BEST PICTURE champs under his belt Mr. Forman is a torchbearer for many a foreign filmmaker to follow suit whose artistic agenda is at loggerheads with stately censorship. Having been revered as a landmark of Czechoslovak New Wave ever since THE FIREMEN'S BALL is a substantially political caricature on top of its ostensible frivolousness not without its own beguiling magnetism the final shot is a coup de matre yet it does trigger a lingering suspicion cannot be summarily dissipated how much part has its ideology played in its road of canonization?".

A child is born their marriage gets into trouble they drift apart will their love prevail ... ? But this movie is not that profane it's actually a fairytale. Some of the characters come straight from the fairytale world. There is the evil queen her husband the naive and childish king and of course a Prince Charming. Otto has got two fishes that are an enchanted human couple and the viewer can hear them talk. They might be enchanted but their dialogues are extremely profane like from a cheap soap opera. So strangely enough all this fairytale elements are totally devoid of magic.Mixing fairytale stereotypes with soap opera stereotypes doesn't turn it  by a coup de fe  into something brilliant and not boring. It would take some genuine movie magic to to this trick. Unfortunately Doris Drrie is no disciple of this ancient knowledge and no enchantress helped her to save this movie that therefore stays on the narrow roads predetermined by it's shallow ingredients. This doesn't give the actors much of a chance to show their abilities. Christian Ulmen is capable of doing so much more than play somebody with a permanent constipation. Alexandra Maria Lara can be so much more than just being cute but her cuteness is about the only thing this movie has still got so there's no complaining here.This is supposed to be a comedy which is funny because I didn't laugh but once about the very inappropriate way Ida was wearing the Japanese flag as a dress.

There is no great acting. If this would be  as it looks like  the first work of a young director nobody would encourage him to go on.

	schema:reviewBody "Der Fischer und seine Frau or The Fisherman and His Wife is a German film from 2005 so this one is already over a decade old and the writer and director here is Doris Drrie one of Germany's most famous female filmmakers. It runs for a bit under 100 minutes as a whole and features several names in the cast that German film buffs will immediately recognize such as the two actors playing the title characters Christian Ulmen and Alexandra Maria Lara. But also Elmar Wepper and Simon Verhoeven will be familiar even if the latter now mostly because of his work behind the camera. As for Drrie her fascination with Asia goes decades back and here we have another piece of evidence even if this one is more about the culture clash between Germans and Asian culture and also Germans clashing with each other and not really with Asians or even Asian culture. Actually this one here is much more about expensive Asian fish than Asian humans. Nonetheless I believe that most of the focus here is on the couple mentioned in the title. Maybe you have heard about this title already in another context as it is also the name of a famous tale and Drrie clearly turned this film into a modern version of said tale. The parallels are undeniable.I would say that this was a good watch overall in the first half. It is subtle and quietly convincing and the only aspect I found annoying were honestly the talking fish one of them Heiner Lauterbach who worked with Drrie before of course as they seemed way too gimmicky for my taste. But sadly after the fiftyminute mark the film heads into a direction that just didn't work for me at all and this includes the win of this special competition the cheating with the formerly best friend and eventually the explanation that she did what she did only because he never said those three magical words and he also accepts this explanation. Needless to say the talking fish parts were still bad even if they were less frequent which is really the only good thing about the second half. The final frog transformation was definitely nothing to be proud of and it adds more absurdity. Shame they did not manage to keep the level from the beginning and turned this into a loud and boastful movie that traded depth for makebelieve. It stopped feeling realistic then really quickly. As for Drrie's Asia centered works it's definitely nowhere near the bad level of her recent Fukushima film but it also is way way below the high quality of Enlightenment guaranteed. The latter has Gustav Peter Whler in the lead and he plays a small role in this 2005 film too and he sure did a lot with the little material he had to work with. I would have loved to find out more about his character and life as actually this character also would have deserved his own film from what we find out about him here. Anyway it would have moved the action too far away from Ulmen and Lara so I guess I can see why they kept Whler's character's story minimal even if I find it a pity. As for the entire film we have here I have to give it a thumbsdown I guess. Had it not declined so rapidly then my thumb would certainly show into the opposite direction as I enjoyed what I saw early on. As for the product however I suggest you skip it and watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Donnie Yen returns as the titular kung fu grandmaster in Ip Man 2 with Wilson Yip reassuming his directorial duties and most importantly Sammo Hung back in his role as action director and also as a main character.The story picks up from where the first movie left off. Ip having survived the war period in Foshan moves to Hong Kong with his family and attempts to make a living teaching his beloved art of Wing Chun boxing. However he is met with opposition and hardship in the form of rival martial arts schools and the atypical British oppressors and finds that even his formidable martial arts prowess may not be enough to resolve these problems.But the story aside anyone with a little background knowledge of this film should know what to expect a dose of intense Hong Kong kung fu film action. As the story begins to drag at some point even a unsuspecting viewer should have realized that all the plot devices and dialogue serve little purpose other than as catalysts leading to the combat scenes. And at helm of the fight scenes is none other than the legendary Sammo Hung in familiar territory choreographing the Wing Chun style which he made a name for himself in movies such as The Prodigal Son in the 80s. With some creative input of his own he manages to compose complex and graceful fight sequences that stays true to traditional kung fu styles from Praying Mantis to Hung Gar Kuen. And who better to bring his imagination to life than the ever reliable Donnie Yen? What Hung designs Yen executes with masterful control and precision. And in the movie when the former steps up to challenge the latter in a sparring session we witness two of Hong Kong's greatest kung fu stars pushing themselves doing what they're best at in a brilliant exchange of strikes and blows. Absolutely a sight to behold.In the end the typical viewer is unlikely to be captivated by the highly borrowed storyline save for some who still enjoy the cinematic display of Chinese pride that is rather blatant and unsubtle. But you will be blown away by the fights you will be in awe of the moves and if you're able to appreciate the action scenes not as the mindless disposable portion of the movie but rather the core of it carefully thought out executed and filmed as a true form of art. With that forgive the storyline and enjoy the film for what it is.".

	schema:headline " Exciting action sequences marred by weak third segment";
	schema:reviewBody "Ip Man 2 contains topnotch action sequences from the beginning to the end. It is a befitting sequel that is almost on par with the first movie.However it is unfortunate that some of the action scenes rely too much on wireworks. The battle between the masters for example was inventive but a bit on the fantastical side. Looking back at the first movie all of the best action sequences were much more grounded in realistic portrayal as the Wing Chun style looks good in this manner.It was good to see some cool style vs style fights though as we get to see Animal Style Baguazhang and Hung Gar vs. Wing Chun. A friend and I were wondering though if it'd be more accurate to present Preying Mantis Taiji and Choy Li Fut in the mix as these styles are well established in Hong Kong.In terms of plot Ip Man 2 transitions nicely from the first movie where we get to follow Ip Man as he establishes and propagates Wing Chun in Hong Kong after escaping Communist persecution in 1949. A fact that was obscured by making the character look like he's escaping the Japanese Army instead. No doubt this is a marketing ploy to make sure the movie would not upset the powersthatbe in China.And like the first movie Ip Man 2 takes liberty with many facts and plot to condense the essence of Ip Man's characters and what he stood for. It is interesting to note that little is mentioned about his sibling and extended family who helped him in some capacity during this difficult period of time. One of his first pupils was loosely based on a reallife counterpart the late Master Wong Shung Leung. In Ip Man's old life he'd often send Wong to successfully answer challenges.Sammo Hung has delivered yet another amazing feat with choreographing this movie despite his declining health during production.My biggest disappointment has to do with the blatant stereotype and onedimensional characterization of the British colonists and the Twister character. It's a lazy writing that may excite a certain segment in the Chinese market but in my eyes this serves only to bring down the movie to Bgrade martial art flicks of bygone era. There's no denying the populist appeal of this method considering the main target market.All in all this has been a fun movie to watch and I hope the prequel will be as fun if not more mature in its storytelling.".

But everything else is a work of a masterpiece!! Acting costumes development of the action plot and emotional plot as well ...

His moves are fluent and perfect but it is his facial expression that impress me the most I am peaceful I do not want any troubles just let me be otherwise... The story of this movie is almost perfect no matter what other people here say. Certain characters are little pushed to the extremes but that is exactly what gives this movie a charm. Nevertheless I find the story told in the first movie little more original. After watching Yip Man 2 I was really sorry that it had to end. You cotton with the characters in some way and I can not wait for the part three. It would be the trilogy better than Godfather I dare to say! This is the movie you have to watch and after that I am sure that you will want to watch it again. But de gustibus non est disputandum! At the end who can satisfy everyones appetite!?".

	schema:reviewBody "Donnie Yen returns in this rushed sequel to the far superior Yip Man. While the first film offered startling and far more brutal martial arts action than previous entries there is nothing new or original in the second installment. The film is basically two halves of different stories mashed together. Yip Man's struggle to continue teaching Wing Chun while resisting the local martial arts schools as they attempt to extort money from him. Sammo Hung the lead antagonist in the first half shows some decidedly corrupt and criminal behavior but ends the film as a hallowed saint. Midway the story falls back on the previous films theme  Chinese Nationalism. The evil Japanese are now replaced by colonialist British administering postwar Hong Kong. The white characters are all portrayed as cartoon villains right down to the dastardly laughs and blatant derision for the Chinese. The film fails to mention that the real Yip Man moved to British Hong Kong to avoid oppression and death from his fellow mainland Chinese. Yip Man and Master Hong suddenly bury their feud in the face of British Boxer Twister who in a page ripped from Rocky 4 later kills Master Hong in the ring after insulting Chinese martial arts. Towards the end there arises a hatred of westerners that was not present or even indicated for most of the film. Returning characters are little used such as Simon Yam and Lynn Hung is just there to nag Yip about money. New younger characters look as if they've just stepped out a boy band video. The fights throughout are competent but nothing new and use more wire work than before with men in their 50s60s doing acrobatics while fighting. Luckily talk of a 3rd film is now looking unlikely.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since Ip Man started making waves across Asia a continuationsequel was inevitable. People wanted more out of Donnie Yen and Wilson Yip. They wanted more of the same martialarts actionladen sequences carefully woven around an oldfashioned moral lesson about martial arts. And that is exactly what Yen Yip and company have made here a sequel which is surprisingly as solid as the first.As per the first film Donnie Yen once again proves that he can act AND fight at the same time. He is perfect as the wise sifu Ip Man and he acts rationally without ever losing control of himself. Even when he gets angry. Now that is a true man. His fighting skills prove that in spades.The supporting actors are a mixed bag. On one hand we have the Chinese actors giving their best including Sammo Hung in a memorable role as a fellow martialarts master. However the British actors are the ones I'm complaining about some of their acting is just overdone and hammy. But the action still overlays this flaw. One part I did like about this sequel though a villain in the previous film now becomes a likeable friend in this one. The reason? He found a family and humbled down realizing his foolish mistakes in the past. This is proof that this movie is not allaction but it has a big heart as well.Again the story is nothing new to write home about it's basically the Hong Kong version of Rocky IV with Donne Yen playing Ip Man which is equivalent to Stallone's iconic character and a very buffedup Darren Shahlavi playing a British boxer which is the equivalent of Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago character. However the direction and the fight scenes are executed so masterfully that it makes the story easy to relate to.Once again his fists move like a chaingun firing without reloading. And as for Sammo Hung if you think that a fat guy can't fight think again. Sammo Hung moves at breathtaking speed and it's a marvel watching Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung duking it out on the big screen. The martialarts action sequences reaches new heights of excitement and the adrenaline level of anyone watching them will be spiked. Then again it has it's fair share of realism in it as well. Donnie almost gets the crap beaten up of him at one point making his character all but human just like the rest of us.Overall it is a fine martialarts movie with good acting a good ol' fashioned moral tale and lots of exceptional fight sequences that will leave you breathless. It's one Asian blockbuster not to be missed. And that last scene of the movie... a promise of things to come like Ip Man 3?Overall rating 6410".

	schema:reviewBody "Ip Man 2 is a huge step backwards from the original Ip Man. It lacks the compelling drama and the excellent characterizations that made the first film so successful. Instead the filmmakers decided to focus a little more on the action and it shows as the fight scenes here are a lot more overthetop and fantastical this time around. But is it a still a good movie? Let's take a look shall we?First let's take a look at the story. The story here... just isn't too great. I'm not going to do a plot synopsis since this is IMDb so you can easily find it on this site. Besides you've probably already seen this film. But the story here is just too farfetched and exaggerated. Sammo Hung's disciples in this movie feel like comicbook villains because they are so ridiculously violent and meatheaded it's ridiculous! I know that you need villains in a kungfu movie but these guys are just ridiculous! But surprisingly they aren't the most overthetop thing about this movie. There's an English boxer named Twister in this movie who is our main antagonist and he is so overthetop so cartoonish it's downright racist! This is another one of those martial arts movies where it paints Chinese people as good and English people as scum. It's really sad how this movie goes back to all these kungfu movie clichs that the first film avoided. There's also a billion subplots here that don't have any real purpose. Ip Man's wife is pregnant Ip Man's business friend got shot in the head so he now has amnesia Ip Man's teenager friend becomes a hit in writing newspaper Ip Man's former enemy has now settled down and became a new man etc. These subplots are just random and they don't add much to the film so I have no fricking idea why they are even here.There are a few things I like about this story though. I like how proactive Ip Man is now since he learned his lesson about using his martial arts for good in the first film. I like how Sammo Hung's character isn't onedimensional. He's a bit of a jerk but we also see him slowly learn to accept Ip Man so there is something that's refreshing about his character. There's also a really cool Bruce Lee cameo at the end of the film.The acting is pretty good here with the exception of Darren Shahlavi as Twister who's just hamming up his performance to absurd degrees. Lastly the fight choreography is probably the best of all the Ip Man films. Here Ip Man is in a lot more danger than he was in the first film. He gets attacked by 20 people with knives he fights Sammo Hung who is probably the most equal of all his opponents and he fights Twister who is probably his most dangerous foe yet. Yes even more dangerous than the Japanese general in the first film.Overall it's not a very good story but it has some good performances amazing fight choreography and it's pretty entertaining. It's not a mustwatch but if it's on television or Netflix I'd say check it out. I'm gonna give it a 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is my first review on IMDb but after watching this film and being bitterly disappointed i felt i had to write one.I want to begin by saying what i liked so much about the first one to illustrate the differences between the 2 films. The first one blew me away the fight scenes were absolutely brilliant before seeing ip man i was always a fan of the jet li stuff but donnie yen changed everything in the first film it made me fall in love with win chung and he was awesome none of the fight scenes were over the top they were simple but thats what made them brilliant. In the second one i felt like i was watching a John Woo film death by slow motion.None of the characters were properly developed so you didn't care about them and the fight scenes seemed to drag on i mean taking on 50 guys with machetes c'mon for gods sake its supposed to be based on a real man i don't care how good anyone is that just wouldn't happen and the bit with the crate Jackie Chan film comes to mind but the worst bit was the final fight  yaaaaaaaawwwwwnn!!! how boring and predictable and as someone else mentioned Rocky 4 done all over again. People watch these films for the beauty of Chinese martial arts and in this one Wing chun in particular and all of that is gone in this one other than the very first fight with his student. Also the film touches on the spirit of kung fu and the belief system that goes with it but doesn't go any deeper which i would have loved and this film had the opportunity to do that because he was teaching kung fu in this film.So to sum up Ip Man 2 is nothing special still enjoyable but doesn't come close to the first one ill still look out for more donnie yen films though because i still think he played the part well.".

The first one blew me away the fight scenes were absolutely brilliant before seeing ip man i was always a fan of the jet li stuff but donnie yen changed everything in the first film it made me fall in love with win chung and he was awesome none of the fight scenes were over the top they were simple but thats what made them brilliant. In the second one i felt like i was watching a John Woo film death by slow motion.None of the characters were properly developed so you didn't care about them and the fight scenes seemed to drag on i mean taking on 50 guys with machetes c'mon for gods sake its supposed to be based on a real man i don't care how good anyone is that just wouldn't happen and the bit with the crate Jackie Chan film comes to mind but the worst bit was the final fight  yaaaaaaaawwwwwnn!!! how boring and predictable and as someone else mentioned Rocky 4 done all over again. People watch these films for the beauty of Chinese martial arts and in this one Wing chun in particular and all of that is gone in this one other than the very first fight with his student. Also the film touches on the spirit of kung fu and the belief system that goes with it but doesn't go any deeper which i would have loved and this film had the opportunity to do that because he was teaching kung fu in this film.So to sum up Ip Man 2 is nothing special still enjoyable but doesn't come close to the first one ill still look out for more donnie yen films though because i still think he played the part well.";

His acting is very good and he has perfect moves.The fight scenes are awesome...while Ip Man has more drama than fighting this one has much more fighting and less drama. Sammo Hung is awesome although he has problems with his heart. The fight scene between Hung and Yen is perfect it's really enyoable..though I liked the last fight scene better...For those who thought Ip Man was awesome...well after this movie you'll want to run out and start fighting random peoplehehe...I actually cried when I saw Donnie's speed in last fight...This movie is worth to watch. Seriously..whatever you have to spend just do it. I'll give it 1010 because of all the fightings scenes..even the story is OK and the actors are great.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ip Man 2";
	schema:reviewBody "Edmond Wong's screenplay like the first film focused more on drama and had moments where questions such as integrity and the living of one's life according to ideals get raised whether it is for the sake of the greater good worthwhile to forgo those ideals in order to make a living and allow those who work for you to make something out for themselves too. In essence which of the lesser evils are you willing to compromise on. There's also time taken to devote to the corruption of Caucasian police officers as well as how the Chinese used to fight their own before learning to unite in the face of stronger external opponents out to humiliate and insult long held values because of ignorance and prejudice.The second half of the film with what we've seen in the trailers involving yet another East versus West matchup that have been covered in contemporary martial arts films and biopics like Fearless and True Legend was quite the worry for me in that it would be another opportunity for meaningless bashing and the championing of nationalistic messages. It's that sense of dejavu that you fear arising from a similar situation from its predecessor but thankfully we get a fight that's quite compelling to watch with Ip Man now being properly challenged by an opponent who's skilled with plenty of power and dexterity with that lack of honour in dishing out a fair fight. Darren Shahlavi who portrays Twister the boxer gets top marks for making you all riled up with his constant air of superiority.Action choreography continues to be designed by Sammo Hung and personally three action sequences stand out. I didn't enjoy the fish market brawl as I didn't take to Ip Man fighting with an unruly horde except that there's a moment of truth there when he shows by example his philosophy of running away not that he's a coward which continues from where he left off from an answer to Wong Leung. Two scenes which stood out involves Shahlavi's battle with the Chinese grandmasters and frankly despite being a boxing match it was really imaginative of Sammo to deliver something that's quite different from the usual action sequences in Chinese films involving battling a Caucasian in a ring.But the number one action sequence albeit a little bit short would be that which you've been teased by the trailer with Ip Man versus Sammo's Hung Jan Nam mano a mano atop a flimsy table in what would be Wing Chung versus Hung Ga Kuen. Naturally not to offend real life practitioners means the result of the fight would be understood but to see Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung match up against one another is an action film fan's dream come true again from SPL especially after Ip Man dispenses with the side show phonies. If I had a complaint these two really went all out with the speed of execution that you just want to beg the camera to stay put from afar in slow motion to allow us all to gaze.And because of the enigmatic presence of Sammo somehow I feel that Ip Man the character got diluted screen time because ample time has to be set aside to prevent Sammo's Master Hung from being just the supporting character but one that's properly fleshed out. He's there to be the contrast as the older martial arts practitioner who's well respected by his peers and providing that glimpse of how Ip Man could progress and whether to want to compromise ideals for those dependent on him for livelihood. Sammo being Sammo also chews up the screen with his charisma and you can hear gasps of reverence reverberate around the cinema hall when he first appears on screen his persona just screaming that he's one bad mofo not to be messed around with.So Ip Man's thunder did get stolen a little and the air of invincibility of Ip Man also got shattered in this film as Wing Chun gets practiced and delivered by others and we see him drawing or even beaten which is something rare and unseen thus far. Of course this makes his character even more believable that he's no Superman and that it provides an opportunity for us to cheer him on in continuing to combat and stand for his ideals. Yen continues to deliver Ip Man in a relatively low key style preferring smiles and the occasional smoke to wanting to show off that he's one of the best martial artists out there.Simon Yam Calvin Cheng Fan SiuWong and even Lynn Hung who plays Ip Man's Wife from the first film were all sadly underutilized and the introduction of Kent Cheng was something like a direct replacement of Lam KaTung's character from Ip Man 1 which means the deleted scene in the earlier film could be considered canon if you wish being the default translator between the Chinese and the British and more often than not is seen siding with the Westerners in order to keep his cop job. Huang Xiaoming brings a youthful energy as Wong Leung and I suppose his inclusion is to capture the Mainland market where he's got a huge following.Same same but different is my verdict of Ip Man 2 being just as enjoyable but lacking a certain inexplicable xfactor that could have made the second outing surpass the first.".

The one to watch for takes place half way through a duel between Yen and Sammo Hung a tenminute scene that takes 4 days to film according to one local report.

There is no story. The martial arts are horrible. The camera only shows the heads of the fighters and they could be playing ticktacktoe for all I know. The music makes no sense and it is just a repetitive banging in the ears.

	schema:headline " Simply a martial arts masterpiece and destined to be another classic just like its predecessor";
	schema:reviewBody "Picking up immediately after the events of the first film we follow Ip Man now to the British colony of Hong Kong in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As he did at the cotton mill in Foshan Ip Man opens his own academy to teach Wing Chun this time on the rooftop of a news editor's Pierre Ngo apartment. Without the reputation he had previously in Foshan business is bad until he meets Wong Leung Huang Xiaoming an impetuous young man quite like Fan SiuWong's bandit Kam in the original.Leung demands that Ip Man defeat him before he becomes Ip Man's pupil and the subsequent duel is the first of many thrilling kungfu sequences in the movie. Indeed just watching the precision power and speed of Donnie Yen's moves as Ip Man is reason enough to rejoice his return to the most iconic film character of his career. But as one soon finds out this is no less than an appetiser for the later aweinspiring jawdropping sequences to come.The next ups the ante as Ip Man goes fist to fist kick to kick with not just ten but multiples of that number of Master Hung's Sammo Hung disciples to rescue Leung whose brashness and arrogance has gotten him in trouble. Set around an oldstyle fish market this confrontation is testament not just to Ip Man sorry I meant Donnie Yen's lightningquick moves but also to the actor's agility and versatility as he handily uses a wooden crate and subsequently two knives to fend off his opponents. I apologise if I gush but Donnie Yen is just that awesome on screen.Kudos too to action director Sammo Hung this sequence would not be as thrilling were it not for the expert choreography and direction of Sammo whose camera direction perfectly mirrors the fluidity of Donnie Yen's action and ensures that the audience is never lost in the thick of the action. But perhaps the greatest praise for Sammo Hung should be reserved for his exhilarating oneonone with Donnie Yen atop a round dining table surrounded by upturned stools.Enlightening Ip Man's ignorance Master Hung informs him that any martial arts pugilist who wants to open an academy in Hong Kong must first accept a challenge from all the wushu masters. So Ip Man appropriately shows up to prove his worth going up against none other than Sammo Hung himself. If you were blown away by the finale between Yen and Hung in SPL let's just say that it is nothing compared to what you see here.You've got to hand it to the 59year old martial arts veteran as he leaps up across the sea of upturned stools onto the ring and proceeds to engage in a fast furious and ferocious battle with Donnie Yen. The subsequent 10min showdown between two equallymatched kungfu masters is I would argue worth the price of admission alone and will definitely go down as one of the classic fighting sequences ever on film. Yes if Yen's 'battle of ten' was the highlight of the original then this Donnie YenSammo Hung fight is that equivalent in this sequel.Besides this match against Donnie Yen Sammo Hung also goes manoamano against a Western boxing champion Twister Darren Shahlavi nicknamed the King of Boxing as the film shifts to portray the insolence of the Westerners towards the Chinese in the second half. At once the parallel between the first film and the second becomes clear in the first Ip Man was fighting for the dignity of the Chinese people against the oppression of the Japanese in this film he will also eventually fight for the dignity of the Chinese people against the contempt of the West.Admittedly the similarities in the original and this sequel are a tad disappointing since one would expect that Edmond Wong producer Raymond Wong's son would be bold enough to take the film in a different direction. What's also a letdown is the portrayal of the Westerners who receive scant characterization other than that they are a conniving bullying lot. In fact what nuance the original had in portraying the Japanese as more than just cardboard baddies is sadly lost this time round resulting in a stereotyped portrayal of the Whites in the film as evil gwailos.Thankfully director Wilson Yip's polished execution and Sammo Hung's outstanding action direction delivers a spectacularly rousing showdown between Ip Man and Twister in fact more so than the finale between Ip Man and General Miura in the original. Manipulative though it may be the film's climax ultimately is stirring enough to leave you mistyeyed over Ip Man's indomitable spirit and humility exemplifying once again that the spirit behind the martial arts is just as important if not more important than its form.In the same way Yen continues to embody the character of Ip Man so thoroughly that it's hard to imagine another actor in the role. We already know how good a martial arts actor Yen is but Yen tops his careerbest performance in the original with even more daring stunts and perhaps just as significantly injecting more gravitas and pathos into the dramatic scenes here. It is firmly to Yen's credit that his scenes with pregnant wife Xiong Dai Lin and son are though limited simple yet powerfully effective in portraying Ip Man's commitment to his family.And with Yen's winning performance Ip Man 2 again captures perfectly both the spirit of the master Ip Man as well as the art of Wing Chun. Like the original it is not just thrilling and exciting it is also moving and affecting. And together with its predecessor it belongs right up there with the classic martial arts flicks of yesteryears.".

Set around an oldstyle fish market this confrontation is testament not just to Ip Man sorry I meant Donnie Yen's lightningquick moves but also to the actor's agility and versatility as he handily uses a wooden crate and subsequently two knives to fend off his opponents. I apologise if I gush but Donnie Yen is just that awesome on screen.Kudos too to action director Sammo Hung this sequence would not be as thrilling were it not for the expert choreography and direction of Sammo whose camera direction perfectly mirrors the fluidity of Donnie Yen's action and ensures that the audience is never lost in the thick of the action. But perhaps the greatest praise for Sammo Hung should be reserved for his exhilarating oneonone with Donnie Yen atop a round dining table surrounded by upturned stools.Enlightening Ip Man's ignorance Master Hung informs him that any martial arts pugilist who wants to open an academy in Hong Kong must first accept a challenge from all the wushu masters. So Ip Man appropriately shows up to prove his worth going up against none other than Sammo Hung himself. If you were blown away by the finale between Yen and Hung in SPL let's just say that it is nothing compared to what you see here.You've got to hand it to the 59year old martial arts veteran as he leaps up across the sea of upturned stools onto the ring and proceeds to engage in a fast furious and ferocious battle with Donnie Yen. The subsequent 10min showdown between two equallymatched kungfu masters is I would argue worth the price of admission alone and will definitely go down as one of the classic fighting sequences ever on film. Yes if Yen's 'battle of ten' was the highlight of the original then this Donnie YenSammo Hung fight is that equivalent in this sequel.Besides this match against Donnie Yen Sammo Hung also goes manoamano against a Western boxing champion Twister Darren Shahlavi nicknamed the King of Boxing as the film shifts to portray the insolence of the Westerners towards the Chinese in the second half. At once the parallel between the first film and the second becomes clear in the first Ip Man was fighting for the dignity of the Chinese people against the oppression of the Japanese in this film he will also eventually fight for the dignity of the Chinese people against the contempt of the West.Admittedly the similarities in the original and this sequel are a tad disappointing since one would expect that Edmond Wong producer Raymond Wong's son would be bold enough to take the film in a different direction. What's also a letdown is the portrayal of the Westerners who receive scant characterization other than that they are a conniving bullying lot. In fact what nuance the original had in portraying the Japanese as more than just cardboard baddies is sadly lost this time round resulting in a stereotyped portrayal of the Whites in the film as evil gwailos.Thankfully director Wilson Yip's polished execution and Sammo Hung's outstanding action direction delivers a spectacularly rousing showdown between Ip Man and Twister in fact more so than the finale between Ip Man and General Miura in the original. Manipulative though it may be the film's climax ultimately is stirring enough to leave you mistyeyed over Ip Man's indomitable spirit and humility exemplifying once again that the spirit behind the martial arts is just as important if not more important than its form.In the same way Yen continues to embody the character of Ip Man so thoroughly that it's hard to imagine another actor in the role. We already know how good a martial arts actor Yen is but Yen tops his careerbest performance in the original with even more daring stunts and perhaps just as significantly injecting more gravitas and pathos into the dramatic scenes here. It is firmly to Yen's credit that his scenes with pregnant wife Xiong Dai Lin and son are though limited simple yet powerfully effective in portraying Ip Man's commitment to his family.And with Yen's winning performance Ip Man 2 again captures perfectly both the spirit of the master Ip Man as well as the art of Wing Chun. Like the original it is not just thrilling and exciting it is also moving and affecting. And together with its predecessor it belongs right up there with the classic martial arts flicks of yesteryears.";

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I think some people will look at any martial arts film even one based on a real person's life and say What does the story matter? As long as there's good action! Even if that's you do not waste your time on this film.Donnie Yen is amazing and Sammo Hung is also a legend they both do great work. There is ONE scene with them that is worth looking up on Youtube. However there are many other scenes in the film that focus on other martial artists or more likely actors who TRY to do martial arts. The quality level just isn't there. There is a lot of use of wirework and lots of quick editing to make it look like there is power and speed to the fights when actually there is none even for some of Yen's moves. There is even a fight in the movie with a character wearing boxing gloves and this is portrayed as not making him any slower or lessdamaging to the other fighters. Not only is it a fair fight he's even MORE powerful than them. Most of the fights are just ridiculous not close to the level of the first Ip Man film.Another comparison to be made to Ip Man 1 is that these films both claim to tell a story based on Ip Man's life. Now while the first film showed Ip Man doing manual labor and having a public fight with a Japanese general which weren't true the film was at least based on truths from the real time period. Many Chinese were impoverished were victims of Japanese brutality and atrocities. It was modern Chinese propaganda but it had a historical basis.Ip Man 2 is just blatant propaganda. Ip Man did move to Hong Kong and open a school. There was a boxing match between his STUDENT and a Russian boxer. And.....those are pretty much the only parts of the film that have any basis in reality. Every British person in the film is only interested in exploiting the Chinese and keeping them making money for them. I actually looked online to find any basis for this and couldn't. All the main roles are such onedimensional raging racist assholes that it's hard to believe they wouldn't be killed in their sleep their first night in Hong Kong. The Chinese characters on the other hand do some pretty horrible things to each other and show zero concern for the lives of other Chinese. But the message in the film is that if you unify against non Chinese then you prove your worth and all will be forgiven.This is a 2 hour piece of propaganda plain and simple. Hong Kong don't fight China! Our real enemy is the foreigners who hate our skin color and history! It is what binds us together so ignore any oppression by Chinese in power and instead tell the foreigners that they must respect us!The EndP.S. For a good YenHung film watch S.P.L! It has awesome fights AND an actual plot!".

	schema:reviewBody "Continuing from where the first film ended Wing Chun master Ip Man and his family move to Hong Kong in the early 1950s after their escape from Foshan. There Ip desires to open a school to propagate his art as well as to make his living but he has difficulty attracting students due to his lack of reputation in the city. One day a young man named Wong Leung appears and promptly challenges Ip to a fight but is easily defeated. Wong leaves humiliated only to return with some friends to gang up on him. Ip beats them as well. Stunned and impressed by his skills Wong and his friends become Ip's first students bringing more disciples to help the school thrive.Wong is later caught posting promotional posters for the school by some Hung Gar students. One of them challenges Wong to a fight and loses but his friends take Wong hostage in revenge and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local wet market as directed but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Ip and Wong fight their way outside to meet Jin Shanzhao  the martial artist and former bandit in the first film  who comes to their rescue with his own gang. The students' master Hung Chunnam arrives to break up the fight. Ip introduces himself and Hung informs him that before setting up a school he needs to attend a special fighting ceremony to test his skill. Ip Wong and Jin are subsequently arrested by Officer Fatso for disturbing the peace but are later released on bail. Hung and Fatso are then shown to be acting as reluctant collectors for the martial arts schools including Hung's as part of a protection racket headed by Superintendent Wallace a corrupt officer in the Hong Kong police.Ip attends the ceremony and defeats his first challengers and then strikes a draw with the last challenger Hung. Ip is allowed to keep running his school on the condition that he pay the monthly protection fees but he declines. Hung thus has his students loiter in front of the Wing Chun school and harass anyone interested causing a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced to close up and move the school nearer to home. Ip soon confronts Hung who blames him since he wouldn't pay the protection fees with Ip telling Hung that he chose to work with the Westerners. Hung insists that they finish their fight but during this last encounter Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking his son as he suddenly appears earning his respect from Hung. Ip leaves and the next day Hung invites him to a British boxing match he had helped to set up quietly coming to terms with him.The boxing competition begins with the various martial arts schools demonstrating their skills. However the event's star boxer Taylor The Twister Milos a Chinesehating sociopath openly insults and attacks the students causing chaos as the masters try to restore order. Hung accepts Twister's challenge to a fight so that he can defend his culture.The fights are superb. The boxer won against Master Hong because he was old and taking medication mostly probably for the heart. Therefore Ip Man begged Master Hong to give up the fightsame as Rocky Balboa did to Apollo Creed in ROCKY IV. The white boxer nicknamed Twister has a truly awesome physique and uses sheer musclepower to beat his opponent.Next we see Ip Man challenging Twister. Now we see the effect of technique against power. Ip Man's Wing Shun provides him a countertactic against the strength of his opponent. Ip man is no longer young in this sequel so he takes a lot more punishment from Twister. Had he been younger than Twister wouldn't even had a chance to touch Ip. However the sheer willpower courage and perseverance see Ip through as he exposes Twister's weaknesses and wins the matchagain I am reminded of Rocky IV match of Balboa Vs Drago.Ip Man's closing statement to the audience is powerful and thoughprovoking. He says that he didn't accept Twister's challenge to prove which style was better but to prove that one person's integrity or worth is not OVER that of another. He wanted also that the English and Chinese respect each others customs.This then is Ip Man 2 a worthy sequel that stands shoulder to shoulder with the original Ip Man. The ending scene shows a young Bruce Lee at Ip's door. Ip inquires as too why young Bruce wants to study Wing Chun. Bruce calmly replies to beat up people I don't like.Ip smiles and tells him to see him when he is much older and the rest as we say is history.".

The good old 'make it bigger better and more badass' approach to sequels.There's that classic fight against 10 Japanese karate studentssoldiers in Ip Man 1. Ip Man 2 never comes close to matching that. I really disliked the Sammo Hung fight on the table with obvious string work  wasn't the first film about realism?

See the character Adrian in the Rocky series only with considerably less dialogue being the two of them. Returning characters from the first film? Wasted.

	schema:reviewBody "Life is never easy when you're a martial arts master there's always someone on your case insisting that you prove your skills. Take Ip Man for exampleHaving been wounded by the Japanese Wing Chun expert Ip Man Donnie Yen escapes to Hong Kong where he sets up a school to teach his style of kung fu. The first potential pupil to show up is Wong Leung who says he will only pay for lessons if Ip Man can defeat him which he does ashamed Leung runs away. Leung returns later with several of his friends who team up to try and beat Ip Man but to no avail. They realise that Ip man is a true master and beg for him to become their sifu.Word soon spreads and Ip Man's class grows steadily larger but when Leung is kidnapped and held to ransom by the students of a rival school the Wing Chun master must once again prove his worth by freeing Leung and beating the rival students. This brings him to the attention of master Hung ChunNam Sammo Hung who runs the local guild of martial arts schools. Ip Man is told he can only continue to teach Wing Chun if he takes a test against the other masters. Yet again Ip Man has no choice but to show what he's made of beating several masters and matching Hung in a oneonone.Ip Man is accepted by the guild but is told that he must pay a monthly fee of 100 he refuses to accept their terms but continues to teach which causes more friction that results in a massive street brawl.Ip Man goes to smooth out matters with Hung and earns the guild master's respect. Hung makes a peace offering in the form of tickets to a western boxing match being organised by Superintendent Wallace a corrupt British officer in the Hong Kong police force. At the match star boxer 'Twister' Miller Darren Shahlavi insults the Chinese fighters who are demonstrating their skills saying that kung fu is no match for boxing. Hung enters the ring to defend his culture and accepts a challenge from Twister. Sadly Hung is killed during the match. During a press conference to try and placate the Chinese Twister once again boasts that he can beat any of their fighters. Guess who accepts the challengeThis sequel to the hugely popular Ip Man 2008 once again blends fact with fiction to tell the exploits of the Chinese national hero who would later go on to train superstar Bruce Lee. Taken with a pinch of salt it proves to be hugely entertaining stuff with Yen exercising both his acting and his fighting muscles to the fullest. The fish market fight against the rival students is a little far fetched and the martial arts scenes rely a little too much on wirework for me to find them fully satisfying but with Sammo Hung as action director and super fast moves and incredible athleticism from star Yen there's still plenty to make the jaw drop.Sammo Hung also shows that he's still got what it takes in front of the camera with his fights against Ip Man and Twister being a lot of fun but it is the Wing Chun master's fight against the Ivan Dragostyle bad guy in the final act that inevitably proves to be the highlighta brutal smackdown guaranteed to please all but the most fussy of martial arts fans.7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDb.".

They realise that Ip man is a true master and beg for him to become their sifu.Word soon spreads and Ip Man's class grows steadily larger but when Leung is kidnapped and held to ransom by the students of a rival school the Wing Chun master must once again prove his worth by freeing Leung and beating the rival students. This brings him to the attention of master Hung ChunNam Sammo Hung who runs the local guild of martial arts schools. Ip Man is told he can only continue to teach Wing Chun if he takes a test against the other masters. Yet again Ip Man has no choice but to show what he's made of beating several masters and matching Hung in a oneonone.Ip Man is accepted by the guild but is told that he must pay a monthly fee of 100 he refuses to accept their terms but continues to teach which causes more friction that results in a massive street brawl.Ip Man goes to smooth out matters with Hung and earns the guild master's respect. Hung makes a peace offering in the form of tickets to a western boxing match being organised by Superintendent Wallace a corrupt British officer in the Hong Kong police force. At the match star boxer 'Twister' Miller Darren Shahlavi insults the Chinese fighters who are demonstrating their skills saying that kung fu is no match for boxing. Hung enters the ring to defend his culture and accepts a challenge from Twister. Sadly Hung is killed during the match. During a press conference to try and placate the Chinese Twister once again boasts that he can beat any of their fighters. Guess who accepts the challengeThis sequel to the hugely popular Ip Man 2008 once again blends fact with fiction to tell the exploits of the Chinese national hero who would later go on to train superstar Bruce Lee. Taken with a pinch of salt it proves to be hugely entertaining stuff with Yen exercising both his acting and his fighting muscles to the fullest. The fish market fight against the rival students is a little far fetched and the martial arts scenes rely a little too much on wirework for me to find them fully satisfying but with Sammo Hung as action director and super fast moves and incredible athleticism from star Yen there's still plenty to make the jaw drop.Sammo Hung also shows that he's still got what it takes in front of the camera with his fights against Ip Man and Twister being a lot of fun but it is the Wing Chun master's fight against the Ivan Dragostyle bad guy in the final act that inevitably proves to be the highlighta brutal smackdown guaranteed to please all but the most fussy of martial arts fans.7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDb.";

In my opinion they should have just stopped the movie 2 minutes short.I was raised in middle Tennessee about 3 hours south of the Adams farm and grew up hearing all the stories and reading all the books so I'm a pretty big fan of the Bell Witch. I wanted so badly for his movie to be an accurate representation of the real story but it was not. As in all movies these days they had to put a big twist at the end to shock everyone. This twist completely kills the movie and nullifies the whole Bell Witch legend. The movie even contradicts itself and in the end just becomes a confusing mess.If you are looking for jolts and some scary scenes you will not be disappointed. My hair stood on end more times than I think it ever has before. And up until the ending I was willing to give it an 8 out of 10. The last 2 minutes or so absolutely kill this movie. Once we saw the ending all the little hints throughout the movie tied together in the worse kind of way and the movie falls apart. If you are a Bell Witch fan you will hate this movie. If you do not know the story you will probably love the movie and just think the ending was dumb.In the Bell Witch legend Betsy Bell is tormented by a spirit named Kate that follows her wherever she goes. It starts out with what is considered poltergeist activity strange noises things moving around the house etc... but then becomes abusive and begins pulling Betsy's hair scratching and slapping her etc... She even vomits needles at one point. In the end though the spirit focuses its attention on John Bell and ultimately poisons him. This is the legend. Spoilers follow  The movie follows along the story fairly closely but in the end its John Bell who is abusing and raping Betsy Bell. Betsy has conjured up this protector spirit because of his abuse. That's the big twist. And its the mother Lucy Bell that poisons John Bell due to this abuse. The spirit which is apparently Betsy Bell's spirit ????? then returns in 2006 to warn a relative of the Bell's that her exhusband is abusing their daughter. Just stupid. To me this destroys the whole legend.There were so many parts of the legend that they should have put in but instead focused on shocker rape scenes and dreams she was having so you never knew what was real and what wasn't. No mention of the Andrew Jackson incident or the witch singing Row me up some Brandy'o in front of 500 people at John Bell's funeral. Instead we got more shocker scenes and more of Betsy being drug around by the hair. Just how many times do we need to see Betsy being drug around by the hair anyway? I've waited for years for a good movie that tells us the real Bell Witch legend and I guess I'll keep waiting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Acting. Thats the most noticeable thing you will find in this movie. All the characters have performed well and acted according to the period of the story. I haven't watched Bell Witch Haunting 2004 but I have read a lot about the original legend. Instead of retelling the actual event this movie revolves around it giving us an entirely different interpretation of the haunting. Also it tells nothing about General Andrew Jackson who visited Bell's family during that time and later became the American President. Its worthy to note that he was once quoted as saying  I'd rather face the whole British Army than face the Bell Witch again.Around 1818 a farming family living in Tennessee is haunted by a spirit the most affected ones being the daughter Betsy and the father John Bell. While the father's health deteriorates the daughter gets all poltergeistic treatment. Slowly they suspect the woman also witch? Kate Batts who previously has some legal issues with John and curses him that he and his daughter will suffer for his deeds. The haunting gets worse and the family members try to fight back the ghost in their own ways. By the end when they seem to have abandoned their faith the spirit itself reveals the reason for its existence.The scary scenes are predictable but good. The notable ones are the first major attack on Betsy the swing encounter Richard's questions John's visions the cave and the best of all is the chariot ride. Excellent cinematography. A few good things in this movie keep us on the edge and makes us wait for the best part. But that best part never comes.The fictional ending though unexpected and slightly shocking is not conceived properly. The movie begins with a NightShyamalanlike atmosphere. Most of it feels like as if you are watching The Village. Later it goes on to remind us of The Poltergeist The Exorcist Child's Play and several others even The Omen. The ending is tried in a Lynchian manner  just tried. Sadly it doesn't register in us at all.Overall this movie has good acting good cinematography few honestly scaring scenes and a different interpretation to the original Bell Witch Haunting. Nevertheless it has a confused screenplay halfbaked script and an overhasty direction. The slow scenes are empty and the fast scenes are packed. So the balance is knocked out and what results is boredom. Watch it for the good aspects but make sure to take lots of popcorn inside the theatre. You'll need them to stay awake.".

	onyx:emotionText "Acting. Thats the most noticeable thing you will find in this movie. All the characters have performed well and acted according to the period of the story. I haven't watched Bell Witch Haunting 2004 but I have read a lot about the original legend. Instead of retelling the actual event this movie revolves around it giving us an entirely different interpretation of the haunting. Also it tells nothing about General Andrew Jackson who visited Bell's family during that time and later became the American President. Its worthy to note that he was once quoted as saying  I'd rather face the whole British Army than face the Bell Witch again.Around 1818 a farming family living in Tennessee is haunted by a spirit the most affected ones being the daughter Betsy and the father John Bell. While the father's health deteriorates the daughter gets all poltergeistic treatment. Slowly they suspect the woman also witch? Kate Batts who previously has some legal issues with John and curses him that he and his daughter will suffer for his deeds. The haunting gets worse and the family members try to fight back the ghost in their own ways. By the end when they seem to have abandoned their faith the spirit itself reveals the reason for its existence.The scary scenes are predictable but good. The notable ones are the first major attack on Betsy the swing encounter Richard's questions John's visions the cave and the best of all is the chariot ride. Excellent cinematography.

How would you feel day after day if you were being repeatedly raped by your own father? That is the point they were trying to convey. I'll tell you what this movie was about since some people seem confused. The girl that was being tormented by spirits was actually being raped by her father. He was sneaking into her room and molestingraping her. In the scene where you hear moans and whimpers from a girl the mother is searching for the noise well that's the father raping his own daughter. He then comes out of the room and bumps into the mother where they both agree the sounds have mysteriously stopped hmm gee I wonder why. The girl is so victimized by her father that her spirit leaves her body. She was hurting herself because the abuse was so painful. Finally at the end she poisons her father with her mother standing watch. Her mom had finally realized what was happening duh. Then at the VERY end of the movie with the modern day mother and daughter... the daughter was being sent to her dad's house joint custody. The mother sees the spirit of the little girl and instantly runs out after her daughter because the spirit of the little girl only appears where there is a child being rapedmolested. Therefore the daughter was being raped by her father also. That's why the girl was chewing her nails and so worried looking from inside the vehicle as her and her dad drove off together. The spirit of the girl will always stick around to protect kids who are being abused. The End. I have heard this wasn't the original fact based story that comes from Tennessee but I am just telling you this is what happened in the movie. What actually happened is supposedly a whole other story. I hope you understand the movie better now. Most people just dismiss it and think its a lame horror flick but in the mind of an abused little girl this was her daily torment.".

I'm not really into gory horror but this kind of psychological and maybe supernatural is more my cup of tea. It looked like an atmospheric piece with foggy scenery old houses churches autumnal feel with some candles and fireplaces etc. Cast looked good I'm a fan of Donald Sutherland and why not Sissy Spacek too. Only I was a bit suspicious since this had flown under my radar. Out of all the many many haunting movies to come out during this millennium I didn't recall this one.If only I had realized the movie was directed by the same guy who did the infamous Dungeon's and Dragons back in the day. The director is not a very well known bad director because he only has a few movies under his resume but none of them seem to have a very good reputation. Had I known this I would surely have passed this.The movie is never very engaging. The atmosphere and scenery is OK but the camera work is not. The camera moves in a very distracting manner and the shots are not very well framed in my opinion. The sets look OK but details fail like a fireplace looks like a few fake logs on a gas fire. So much for the genuine 1800's feel. The acting is everything from downright bad to mediocre. Even Sutherland doesn't nail it there are a few scenes that are rather cringe worthy. Rachel HurdWood is OK tho I think she does quite well and is never as lost or overacting as the others.The movie isn't very scary and since the outcome is obviously nonsupernatural it's difficult to digest all the supernatural stuff. There are cheapish tricks like the image changing from black and white to color. The sound fx were not that good listening with headphones. The title graphics uses a typeface that is probably called The horror movie font on a site providing royalty free fonts. The overall feel was quite cheap and lacks any sense of style. The framing story of a single mother and a daughter living in a modern world is quite tacky too.This could've been passable as a shorter episode of Masters of Horror style series as it's got that cheap TV feel but even then it would've been a disappointment. Avoid.".

Both of these actors played their part well and if it weren't for such a terrible story and generic scare tactics they may have been able to save the movie. Alas like many of the PG13 horror films of today not even good acting can make up for a shady plot bad directing and terrible editing. The film is based on the poltergeist story involving a family in rural Tennessee in the early 1800's. The story is filled with the garbled and incoherent dreams of seemingly possessed Betsy Bell played by Rachel HurdWood. In a movie built around a ghost story it was disappointing to see cheap scare tactics instead of making the movie all around eerie. I am not sure what director Courtney Solomon was thinking when he chose to film the movie with a style similar to a low budget hack 'em slash 'em film from the 80's but clearly there are better ways of scaring an audience. While the filming style could have used some work the editing and special effects were a disaster. It mostly resembled a bad soap opera. It jumps around between dreams and reality faster than Ricky Williams' in a Marijuana haze. A movie like this doesn't need a whole lot of special effects but the few that it had were terrible and even ruined the scenes. The poltergeist was nothing more than Betsy with a slight hue around her. The only scary thing about this film was how many 13yearold girls turned up to the theater to watch this on opening night. As a fan of horror films I understand if you want to judge this for yourself but listen to my words wisely don't bother.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was at the Sunday afternoon screening of An American Haunting at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. I was waiting to see this film as I love this genre and am a fan of Sissy Spacek Carrie and Donald Sutherland. I did some research on the legend of the Bell Witch before seeing the film and more after so I had an idea of what to expect. First I have to say that Rachel Hurd Wood was fantastic as Betsy. I did not see Peter Pan but for 14 years old she put on a restrained and haunting performance which she should be commended for. Onto the film. This film was scary scary scary and creepy. I was thinking about it for three days after and my friends and I even talked about it at lunch today a week later. It really stays with you which I think is the sign of a good film. If you are looking for blood and guts then it will not be for you. But if you are looking for tension suspense and creepiness then it's definitely for you. I saw it with three friends and we were all on the edge of our seats. I had nail marks from my friend Lisa who kept covering her eyes because she was so scared. I don't want to give anything away but there is a surprise ending which I was happy to see they obviously built the film around instead of just added it at the end like a lot of films do these days. It reminded me a lot of the The Others with Nicloe Kidman. Anyway the film really delivers and it says something important at the same time. I think having read some other comments that this film will appeal more to women. You will see why. I did think that the score was a little large at times and that the sound was a little loud but really good and effective just loud. The cinematography was great and the way the director moved the camera to create a spirit view I thought was really good and fresh. There is a scene where the spirit tracks down one of the characters and it was truly amazing! Having recently seen Emily Rose I would have to say that this film was much better and would highly recommend it. I can't wait to have a chance to see it again. If I had to rate it I would give it a 8.5 out of 10. Matilda.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was at the Sunday afternoon screening of An American Haunting at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. I was waiting to see this film as I love this genre and am a fan of Sissy Spacek Carrie and Donald Sutherland. I did some research on the legend of the Bell Witch before seeing the film and more after so I had an idea of what to expect. First I have to say that Rachel Hurd Wood was fantastic as Betsy. I did not see Peter Pan but for 14 years old she put on a restrained and haunting performance which she should be commended for. Onto the film. This film was scary scary scary and creepy. I was thinking about it for three days after and my friends and I even talked about it at lunch today a week later. It really stays with you which I think is the sign of a good film. If you are looking for blood and guts then it will not be for you. But if you are looking for tension suspense and creepiness then it's definitely for you.

	schema:reviewBody "Let's say it flat out An American Haunting is the scariest most intelligent ghost story to hit the screen in two decades. More original than The Others which was a watered down cocktail of The Innocents and The Sixth Sense and ten times more effective than the pallid The Exorcism of Emily Rose An American Haunting wastes no time in setting itself up as a thriller with something more on its mind than just simply rehashing the same old grab bag scare tactics that every 'Exorcist' remakerehash resorts to. Based on The Bell Witch an apparently true account of demonic possession that resulted in the first recorded case of a ghost actually killing a human being over a hundred and fifty years ago in Tennessee the film elevates itself by not wallowing in cheap tricks to scare you and by always taking the high road. And by doing so it creates it's very own world a unnerving mood and an a undercurrent that prevails throughout until when you least expect it  it strikes out grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very last frame. The sheer terror of waiting and watching until the entire story unfolds in a way you least expect is so original and surprising that by the time the finale hits you it shatters you like no other horror film you've ever seen . The performances by Donald Sutherland and Rachel HurdWood are first rate. It's their story all the way and the beauty and generosity of the other actors subtle effective performance especially Sissy Spacek is a testament to their respect of the material. But the real star of this film is directorwriter Courtney Solomon. After having recovered from the bollocking he took for the impossible task of bringing Dungeons  Dragons The Movie to the screen Mr Solomon has rebounded with a story he was born to tell and the result is an assured first rate thriller told with intelligence force style and wit. It's a roller coaster ride all the way so fasten your seat belts. The audience I saw it with at the AFI Film Festival could not have been more responsive. You could actually feel the hair on the back of your neck standing up. The cinematography by master Adrian Biddle and the score by Caine Davidson are first rate and help propel you into an unforgettable ghost story that will linger in your memory and haunt your dreamsnightmares for months after.".

Instead the flick is largely boring confusing and poorly executed. Even though it clocks in at a running time of just 90 minutes or so the film drags throughout most of the nonhorror scenes and even through some of the socalled 'scary' moments. All of it leads up to a conclusion that is baffling illogical and very stupid. The twist is one of the least sensible of its kind in recent memory as there is nothing in the film up to that point to warrant such a move. Pretty much a terrible film.Though the cast looks solid on paper the acting here is quite bad. Everyone looks like they're just picking up a paycheck from Sutherland who looks bored to Spacek who's never been more shrill to Rachel HurdWord who attempts to do her best Linda Blair impression but ends up just screaming and staring around wideeyed most of the time. The direction is absolutely abysmal as all scenes with the spirit look incredibly amateurish with the swooping camera and for some reason are shot in black and white. Although it's clear this was done with some foolish artistic idea in mind it ends up standing out terribly and erases any small amount of suspense or tension that might have been built up. Most of the suspense though is destroyed by the absolutely atrocious editing which is at once frustrating annoying and pointless. It all adds up to a lame excuse for a horror film.The only thing that saves this from being a complete waste is that there are some cool visuals and occasionally some decent cinematography. Other than that though this is an abomination of film with terrible acting dreadful directing and awful editing. A complete waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "So just to be clear there's no actual ghost or demonic presence in this movie at all. No curse and no real haunting technically. The movie is basically about a living disassociated haunting. This movie reminds me of The Uninvited which also tries to pull a fast one by appearing to be a traditional ghost movie but breaks down to being only about hallucinations and lies and contains NO supernatural activity at all no matter how much its implied or lied about in the trailers. Both movies left me feeling a bit empty because they try so hard to accomplish their respective twists of being a ghost film at the same time as NOT being a ghost film and in fact being about psychological breakdown.This movie in particular was a muddled mess of metaphors and reality and hauntings melding into dreams melding into more and more and MORE scenes of haunting trauma many without a climax or an explanation or any kind of bridge to allow the audience to exhale and nod and think they understand whats going on and to prepare themselves for the next scene or to allow us to feel we are making even the tiniest bit of headway in dealing with the situation. Even without the molestationdisassociation twist being thrown in there the movie got to be over the top with its continual haunting episodes without relief or the hint of a solution while this poor little girl is getting beat up and thrown around and raped and after a while seems almost catatonic with distress and no one seems able to handle the situation and the entity seems impervious to everything they try. I think it tries to be a little too much Exorcist without any of the depth of that movie. Just a lot of bed scenes of a young girl being tormented by something supernatural while her parents watch helplessly and a priest cant seem to help.But then you have the twist... which was too much for me. A living poltergeistic projection? What?? And her actually appearing as a ghost of herself at the end was absurd. Im sorry. And not sure if we really needed the book end bits from the modern family going through the exact same thing.".

Why did the producers feel the need to turn it into a completely different plotending? The only thing about the film that is consistent with the true Bell Witch story is the names of the characters and that it is set in early 1800's Tennessee. In fact if I was a descendant of John Bell or Betsy Bell or any of the people referenced in this movie and there are lots of them I would be appalled at the way they portray John Bell as a child abusing rapist. What was the need in that? Was this a true American ghost story or was it a movie about child abuse and rape? In my opinion child abuse and rape are far too important of a subject matter to be something that is thrown in at the end of an otherwise true American ghost story just to provide a shocking twist for the end of the movie. It had nothing to do with the true story and frankly I think it was just thrown in to add interest and that is not a very appreciative thing to do. Being from near the area where this true story supposedly happened I somewhat know about this story and have even visited the site in Adams TN. And I would imagine that all involved in the true story are not very appreciative of the movie's choice of turning John Bell into a child abusing rapist.I gave it a 4 because they chose a story that COULD'VE been a great ghost story it does have a decent cast and the acting is not bad. But like most Hollywood horror films of today it has to throw in that shocking twist at the end that just screws up everything and even makes it go completely off course from the original true plot. They could've made it a great one and they screwed it up. It's not unentertaining. It has some pretty cool effects and some good scary scenes. If it weren't for those I would've given it a lower rating. But in my opinion it is a storyplotcast that could've possibly received a 10star rating had they simply stuck to the original TRUE story.Enjoy".

'ghost cam' for example when we entered the spirits perspective was utter rubbish. The scenes set in the present day were completely pointless. A failed attempt at creating emotional resonance. Since the Sixth Sense directors feel the need to add a twist. And An American Hauntings twist. nonsense. complete nonsense. not even Spacek or Sutherland come out of the film with any credit. If i didn't have a cinema pass i would have asked for a refund. Save your money and watch The Exorcist on video.".

This clichd nonsense kept me awake all night not because it was haunting but because i couldn't comprehend how such a misguided film ever got made. 'ghost cam' for example when we entered the spirits perspective was utter rubbish. The scenes set in the present day were completely pointless. A failed attempt at creating emotional resonance. Since the Sixth Sense directors feel the need to add a twist. And An American Hauntings twist. nonsense. complete nonsense. not even Spacek or Sutherland come out of the film with any credit. If i didn't have a cinema pass i would have asked for a refund. Save your money and watch The Exorcist on video.";

Lastly it is the most over used most generic plot ever which is taking the story of a scary spirit who torments the protagonist for two hours like movie goers haven't seen that scenario a million times. So in conclusion all this piles up to be a twohour parade of taking a generic story throwing in an Evil Dead camera shot rip offthat happened way too oftenat least in Evil Dead it led to something you haven't seen in the movie rather than the same door sceneand throw in some cheesy acting and you got yourself the funniest twohours you'll ever see. That's right you read correctly this was the funniest movie I have seen in awhile.

	schema:reviewBody "First I want to say that if you read past the first few lines here there are big time spoilers. So if your not interested in knowing what this movies about if you weren't you probably wouldn't be here then read no further. First this is not a Ghost movie. I repeat NOT a Ghost movie. This is a movie about child abuse and the possibility that the abuse caused extreme stress resulting in Poltergeist activity. The movie begins with the father Sutherland losing face for usury for trying to take another woman's land in a deal with high interest which she wouldn't be able to pay back therefore losing her land to him. This is in defiance of church law. This also immediately establishes dad as pretty much a scumbag but a nice guy sort of scumbag. Soon after things begin to happen which could be construed as ghostly. Seeing Ghost wolves who aren't really there Until later when they need to be there for a particular scene otherwise they wouldn't have been there. Ghostly things beginning happening to Betsy the daughter. She is haunted at night when she sleeps. Always something comes into the room at night and always does the same things. You see her blanket being pulled off her writhing around and screaming dragged around etc. This is a little scary the first time by the 9th time you see the same door slamming the same covers being removed the same everything it has ceased being scary. In fact it ceases to be scary by the third time. This Ghost is attacking dad and daughter. Then one day one of the slaves comes in and has a bag with some items that dad had left on the property of the lady he tried to rip off. As soon as we see the items we know whats happening. This is about 23rds way through the movie. The items are dads shirt and Betsy's nightgown with blood on it. Guess why might as well guess now because it probably wont take you 23rd of the way through the movie to guess the reason behind the haunting. It becomes obvious none too quick. Earlier dad is having some serious emotional issues and even attempts suicide. After mom finds out what the reason behind all this is she poisons and kills dad. And incredibly the haunting stops. So what we have is a movie about a young girl being raped incestuously causing her to possibly be manifesting these things that happened to the Bell family. No spirit kills dad mom kills dad. Throughout the movie Betsy is confronting the ghost of a girl who's hands and face turns black when they touch. Mostly these confrontations happen in dreams. As soon as dad kicks the bucket the little girl no longer turns black but in fact turns bright and it is her confronting herself. The rapist is killed the stress is gone and things look brighter the story seems to say. One note I intentionally left out was that in the beginning of the movie it opens in 2006. A young teenage girl is in the woods chased by a ghost and runs to her room. In the attic she has found a letter from Betsy's mother to Betsy telling her the whole story This is how we know what happened. Throughout the movie we hear or see the girls mother reading the story with this look on her face like Yea right..this is stupid. At the end of the movie its 2006 again. The teenage girls father comes to pick her up Mother and father are divorced and when the teenage girl leaves the ghost of Betsy appears. The mother runs after the father car screaming because guess what SHE HAS FIGURED OUT THAT BETSYS GHOST MEANS HER DAUGHTER IS BEING RAPED!'. Umm...just a coincidence? Preposterous! The end is followed by a written definition of Poltergeist Young girl under stress causing manifestations...or usually a young girl and a disclaimer that this is one possible explanation for what happened to the Bell family. To sum it all up I would only recommend this movie if you have already seen United 93 MIIII and RV. I have seen all of these and they are all better than AH.".

	schema:headline " Great acting great script terrible movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start with what was good about this film The acting Donald SUtherland gives another stellar performance as John Bell and Sissy Spacek puts you in the mother's shoes as Mrs. Bell. There is actually a moment where you feel like Sissy must have just seen a real ghost on set as her acting is so great. Rachel HurdWood also does a good job as Betsy showing what she was allowed to show competently. Dialogue The script seems real and adds a nice degree of competence to the film. The characters talk to each other with the exception of Betsy like any real family would do and it's easy to connect to most of the major characters in the film. You can see John Bell's pain and fear as his family is tortured and the terrified mother who only wants to protect her child. There was a memorable line that I liked a lot in this film the irritated John Bell saying 'A pea shooter?!?' I actually laughed at that line. Like I said great script. Characters Through a combination of good acting and good dialogue it's hard NOT to be able to connect with the characters and to really feel like you know them with the exception of Betsy. Cheap scares This movie is full of them. While some people look down on cheap scares the kind that make you jump I say that these types of scares have built the horror industry and are still the only way to make your heart REALLY thump other than dropping a person out a 4th story window. The scares are good and there are plenty of them so be expected to jump at least a good dozen times throughout the movie. NOW on to what's not so good about the movieBetsy Bell While Rachel WoodHurd does a great job of playing Betsy she has too few lines and really does nothing except sleep and scream. All the characters in the film are fully fleshed out except her the main character. How ironic. Repeating scenes Now seriously this ticked me off. Does the director seriously think that we Americans are so dumb that we don't realize that we're watching the EXACT SAME SCENE more than once?! Betsy Bell's poltergeist is the most obvious of this. We see the scene where the spirit is looking down at Betsy in the bed and then she looks up and watches sadly as John Bell leaves the room. The next time we see her she is looking at John Bell lying dead on his bed and then she looks up and sadly stares at the wall. Same scene same camera angle same everything. Come on people we are not that stupid! The ending Betsy scares the girl's mother then she stares sadly at the floor and then looks sadly at the wall. Same scene... again. Also the scene in the woods where Betsy goes after the ball Joshua has just lost is a copy. We see her chase the ball look around and then stoop to pick it up. Next we see her enter THE EXACT SAME CLEARING look around then stoop to pick up the ball. It was a copy scene designed to save money. Thanks for being cheap at our expense director! Special effects The effects are barely worthy of a 'World's Most Haunted Places' special. I guess while the director was saving money on repeating scenes he was also saving money on the special effects. Some good examples include the disappearing little girl truly one of the lamest scenes I have seen in a major film in a while poltergeist Betsy and the black wolf which I didn't' understand the presence of anyway. The little girl Did we really need her in the film? I'd say no. As far as I know the little girl is NOT a part of the Bell Witch legend and it only adds a heavy dose of cheese to the film. I understand that the actress is trying to hide her face but must she walk so stiffly? And how come the girl has an 18yearold Betsy's face on what looks like a 6yearold's body? The 2006 anything We didn't need that in the film either. It just makes the Bell Witch legend look even dumber and it was a huge waste of the film's time. The paranormal adolescent girl thing As far as I know no paranormal activity thought to come from someone's mind has hurt anyone yet alone the person it's coming from. And if it was from Betsy's mind then how come we see demonic activities from the spirit crosses flying off the wall pages being torn out of a Bible etc? That makes no sense. Betsy is not evil and therefore would not do these demonic things. If nothing else regular paranormal activity of the mind just involves moving things around. I get this weird feeling the director never bothered to research what he was talking about before he dove right in. The stage coach incident OK you can say Betsy was a heavy sleeper and all that but I highly doubt spirit or no spirit that she can defy gravity. But that is exactly what she does when the stagecoach that is carrying her flips over. Not only that but she retains that same position and IS STILL ASLEEP. Dumb.To summarize the film had its good parts  the acting dialogue and scares but everything else failed. Sad because I believe this movie could have had real potential to be a cult classic if it had been done right. I certainly did enjoy parts of it I just wish the whole thing was done that way.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is actually the first Hammer movie about a mummy I've seen in its entirety. And now I want more! Although it's not exactly the most gruesome or most entertaining Hammer effort out there it wasn't a letdown either. THE MUMMY'S SHROUD plays it downright serious to some extend with success on other levels a bit of a failure. Let's start with a few negative points first. As mentioned in other usercomments the prologue knows a poorly staged and acted Egyptian sequence that might have you chuckling because of how cheap the sets look it really looks a bit like a high school stageplay. But nevertheless plotwise that prologue was a necessity to provide the history to the story. Another thing is that the plot relies a lot on the cast to tell the story. Which is good and bad. Good thing is that the whole cast is more than capable when it comes to performances. The bad thing is It results often in too much talking and less thrills and chills. The budget restrictions also show resulting in limited sets. There's only a handful of rooms and a couple of narrow city streets all clearly built on a soundstage. The filmmakers just inserted the same overview establishing shot of the city a couple of times and the viewer should get the impression that the cast is running around in it. All this really isn't a complaint because it works and that's just the way it was shot on a modest budget. It's just that it's clearly noticeable albeit the setdesign was handled with care. The handful of outdoors shots weren't filmed in a real desert of course. You can clearly see it's just a few hills were they tossed around an amount of sand in one shot you can even see some plants in the background that shouldn't normally grow in a desert. Still no complaints because the film shows they did the best they could.Now for the stuff that matters. The story is wellconstructed. Of course it's about a mummy who comes to life and goes on a vengeful rampage to kill off all the cursed people who entered his tomb and placed him in a museum. But the little catch is it's actually a shroud that causes the shrieks and slaughter for he who has it holds the power to resurrect the mummy. Knowing this it's up to the archaeologists and the local police detective to figure out who exactly wants the members of the expedition dead. Sadly the mystery isn't there since the plot really serves up only one possible suspect. But still nothing to nag about because there still is the main attraction The murderous mummy. The first time he comes to life features a memorable closeup shot of his face. The special effects shot where he opens his dusty  crusty eyelids 'animatronics' avant l lettre is effectively creepy. I even rewound that bit because at first I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at until they started to move. The mummy's got strength and he's a real stalker shuffling his way through the streets at night into buildings and bedrooms. The kills are nicely staged and my favorite one involves a jar of acid and a fire. Don't expect anything too graphic though. It might be a Hammer movie but after all it was still the sixties. There's a decent short but satisfying climax in the museum too. It shows us that a mummy's shoulder is firm soil to plant an axe into although it's not likely to stop him.One more thing that made this movie worthwhile watching too. An actress. Maggie Kimberly. I just can't quite put it into words... At first you don't particularly notice her. She's just part of the expedition. But the more screen time she gets in different scenes the more she just demands your attention. She just had a mesmerizing look to her beauty. The more I saw her the more I wanted to see of her. She has gorgeous blond hair always tied together. And at one point I was wishing her to finally let her hair down for it to engulf her shoulders... And then wham! The last scenes has her with her hair down. Ravishing! I just love it when a girl grants my wish. Even in a movie. Anyway I'm going way off topic here. But whatever happened to her as an actress? She only did three movies and a TV episode. Strange...Oh well. Bottom line So far I've never seen a Hammer movie that disappointed me. THE MUMMY'S SHROUD might maybe not make it to the 'Best Of Hammer' list but it sure is a fun watch.".

The cast is mixed with the best actor Andre Morell wasted in a minor role. There are compensations however as Hammer veteran Michael Ripper dubbed by Christopher Lee as 'face of Hammer' is given is best role as Longbarrow his death is perhaps the dramatic highlight of the movie.In addition 'The Mummy's Shroud' is superior to Hammer's last movie in the series 'The Curse Of The Mummy's Tomb' having a faster pace and sticks better in the memory mainly due to the talents of Gilling. While not vintage Hammer by a long chalk it's a solid Hammer movie which suffers from the 'seen it all before' factor.Oh by the way if you're a Peter Cushing fan you will be disappointed as despite being credited to Cushing in some sources the narrator does not sound remotely like him.".

	schema:headline " Beware the wrath of Prem";
	schema:reviewBody "Mummy movies are notoriously difficult to make interesting. The original Universal film with Boris Karloff succeeded by becoming a dark and dreamy romantic fantasy. Hammer's fullblooded remake in 1959 gave us a powerful yet sympathetic Mummy portrayed by Christopher Lee. Beyond those two most mummy films have been of middling quality. This is one of the better ones though it surely has its faults.The lengthy historical prologue has been complained about by many but I think it it necessary to show the great loyalty and devotion that the slave Prem has towards his young master Kahtobey. It gives him a sympathetic edge as he did everything to honor his master both in life and death. This aura of sympathy is in all of Hammer's Mummy films to some degree. Lee's Kharis suffered horribly for true love while RaAntef in Curse of the Mummy's Tomb was a noble soul terribly betrayed. Prem fits well with his predecessors.The reanimated Prem is little more than a slave of the fanatical Hasmid and his crazed mother. But when he strikes it's with a lot of violence in some very wellcrafted death scenes. He crushes one character's head like an eggshell off screen but we can imagine the gruesome details splatters another with burning acid before setting him on fire strangles another before dashing his brains out on a wall and wraps up another in a bed sheet before tossing him out a window to the street far below! Now THAT is a violent mummy and one capable of more than just simply strangling people.Prem's unique look is based on actual Egyptian mummies. Some find it disappointing...I do not. One of the best scenes is when the mummy slowly opens its crusty eyelids. Prem is also mighty tough. He gets singed with acid giving him a nice smoky look hacked with an axe and shot to hell at close range without much effect. When destruction finally comes to the mummy it comes in a most unique and gruesome fashion.Most Hammer films boast good performances and there are several worth noting here. John Phillips hits just the right note as the arrogant and cowardly Stanley Preston. One of the more subtle horrors of the film is his completely loveless and emotionally dead relationship with his wife. Just before his meeting with the Mummy Preston must realize that he will be missed by no one. Elisabeth Sellars as Mrs. Preston gives one of the most coldblooded and emotionally detached performances I've seen. Roger Delgado is great as the sinister Hasmid unleashing an amazingly perfect stream of Arabic gibberish. Delgado would perfect his evil as The Master in Dr. Who. Another wild performance is given by Catherine Lacey as the demented Haiti the fortune teller. Never has any fortune teller delighted in predicting her customer's deaths as much as Haiti.One black mark against the movie is the criminal misuse of Andre Morell as Sir Basil. Morell was a terrific actor so memorable in Plague of the Zombies Hound of the Baskervilles and the littleseen Cash On Demand but here he makes little to no impression. Something which I blame more on the script and the director than Morell himself.Maggie Kimberly is quite stunning as Claire. She looks rather average at first but the more she is in peril the more attractive she becomes.The actor who really walks off with the movie is Hammer mainstay Michael Ripper. What a versatile actor he was. As the meek and suffering lackey of Preston's he makes for a perfect milksop. We feel an overwhelming sympathy for this simple character and his death is a brutal shock.There are parts where the movie lags particularly in the opening desert scenes but once Prem is awakened the action never flags and the movie builds to a powerful and actionpacked climax. In the end Hammer gave as much life as they could to the tired mummy concept with The Mummy's Shroud and the film should satisfy anyone looking for escapist horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like almost all the Hammer movies I saw this movie on TV on a Saturday afternoon when I was 8. I wasn't scared by it but I was entertained by it. The movie begins in ancient Egypt when the Pharaoh's wife gives birth and dies. The Pharaoh dedicates everything to his son the future Pharaoh KahtoBey but little did he know that his brother was planning to take over. On one night the palace was attacked by the Pharaoh's brother. While the attack KahtoBey's bodyguard Kremm escaped with the Pharaoh's son to the desert. Later KartoBey dies in the desert and his bodyguard mummifies him and covers him with the sacred shroud. In the 1920 an expedition is sent to find the tomb of KartoBey. The expedition is led by Sir Basil Walden played by Andre Morell Archaeologist and son of the financier Paul Preston played by David Buck and linguist Claire de Sangre played by Maggie Kimberly but there is nothing known about the expedition or the members. The financier Stanley Preston Played by John Phillips orders a search party. While in the desert the Archeologists are trapped in a sand storm but after the storm settles they find a cave and inside they find a mad man speaking some kind of dialect warning them to keep away. Obviously they didn't listen later they are found by the search party and among them is the financier S. Preston who had come to ensure his investment on the expedition. Soon they find that the cave is the tomb of the Pharaoh's son. They find KartoBey and they take him to a museum but the shroud that accompanied the mummy mysteriously disappears. Then one by one the members of the expedition are been killed by a mysterious force. This is a traditional mummy movie explorers find tomb and are later hunted by the wrapped mummy. Nothing is new about it but it has an interesting story and characters are well developed. The actors take it seriously and this makes the story believable. This movie brings back great memories when movie didn't need CGI or complicated stories to make them entertaining. If you are a fan of classic horror from the 50s and 60s this you will definitely enjoy. So on a Saturday night order a pizza and some beers and enjoy Hammer's legacy of horror.".

	onyx:emotionText "Like almost all the Hammer movies I saw this movie on TV on a Saturday afternoon when I was 8. I wasn't scared by it but I was entertained by it. The movie begins in ancient Egypt when the Pharaoh's wife gives birth and dies. The Pharaoh dedicates everything to his son the future Pharaoh KahtoBey but little did he know that his brother was planning to take over. On one night the palace was attacked by the Pharaoh's brother. While the attack KahtoBey's bodyguard Kremm escaped with the Pharaoh's son to the desert. Later KartoBey dies in the desert and his bodyguard mummifies him and covers him with the sacred shroud. In the 1920 an expedition is sent to find the tomb of KartoBey. The expedition is led by Sir Basil Walden played by Andre Morell Archaeologist and son of the financier Paul Preston played by David Buck and linguist Claire de Sangre played by Maggie Kimberly but there is nothing known about the expedition or the members. The financier Stanley Preston Played by John Phillips orders a search party. While in the desert the Archeologists are trapped in a sand storm but after the storm settles they find a cave and inside they find a mad man speaking some kind of dialect warning them to keep away. Obviously they didn't listen later they are found by the search party and among them is the financier S. Preston who had come to ensure his investment on the expedition. Soon they find that the cave is the tomb of the Pharaoh's son. They find KartoBey and they take him to a museum but the shroud that accompanied the mummy mysteriously disappears. Then one by one the members of the expedition are been killed by a mysterious force. This is a traditional mummy movie explorers find tomb and are later hunted by the wrapped mummy. Nothing is new about it but it has an interesting story and characters are well developed. The actors take it seriously and this makes the story believable. This movie brings back great memories when movie didn't need CGI or complicated stories to make them entertaining. If you are a fan of classic horror from the 50s and 60s this you will definitely enjoy. So on a Saturday night order a pizza and some beers and enjoy Hammer's legacy of horror.";

Routine mummy movie from Hammer. Helped by nice cast that includes Hammer vets Michael Ripper and Andre Morell. Ripper has probably his best role as the tragic Longbarrow. John Phillips makes a particularly hissable villain. Opening prologue seems to go on forever. The mummy makeupcostume is particularly ratty. Not sure if that was the look they were going for or if it was just the best they could do. It's not a particularly special horror movie but it's entertaining enough if you're a fan of mummy movies as I am.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cairo 1920 A team of British archaeologists lead by Sir Basil Walden ANDRE MORELL and financed by the stuffy and selfcentred multimillionaire business tycoon Stanley Preston JOHN PHILIPS discover the tomb of an ancient Egyptian prince called KahToBey. They remove his mummy plus some artifacts from the tomb with the intention of shipping them back to the British museum. However they ignored the warnings of the tomb's guardian Hasmid Ali ROGER DELGADO who told them that they would all die if they desecrated the tomb. True to his word Hasmid Ali revives the mummy of KahToBey's servant Prem EDDIE POWELL using the words of death written upon KahToBey's shroud and it sets out to murder the members of the expedition team one by one.Hammer's mummy franchise was never that strong from the word go. The main problem for the scriptwriters was that once the mummy came back to life  they were never sure what to do with him and in practically every film he just went on the predictable murder spree as is the case here. Plotwise THE MUMMY'S SHROUD is more or less a rerun of Hammer's THE MUMMY 1959 only this time Christopher Lee's stunt double Eddie Powell plays the mummy for what I imagine to be economy reasons for they had somebody who could both do the acting stuff and the stunts as well. It must be said that the mummy is a pretty emotionless character here and Powell couldn't convey the emotion that Lee had done so ingeniously under all his heavy makeup.Nevertheless despite it's limitations in those departments THE MUMMY'S SHROUD is still an entertaining little second feature  it went out as a double bill with the studio's marvelous FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN in June 1967. Director John Gilling who declared this to be one of his worst films actually manages to revitalise as best he can what he himself called a worn out theme. The film was the last picture that Hammer shot at the legendary Bray Studios in Berkshire and despite the fact that the picture rarely ever got outside the studio gate apart from one day's location shooting in a quarry in Gerrards Cross made to look like the Egyptian desert the film has a nice sense of place thanks to the atmospheric and economical sets of Bernard Robinson and the lensing of Arthur Grant who turns in some of his best ever camerawork for Hammer the viewer can actually feel himselfherself in Egypt although you know that you are actually within a few miles of London rather than Cairo. Good performances too especially from Michael Ripper as Preston's publicity assistant Longbarrow who is truly a sympathetic portrayal of the puton dogsbody of a stuffy and selfish businessman. In addition his character becomes all the more poignant since he meets an incredibly brutal demise at the hands of Prem who wraps him in a sheet and throws him head first out of a top floor hotel room window. Catherine Lacey is enjoyably bad and over the top as the fortune teller Haiti who helps her son Hasmid Ali ROGER DELGADO to lure the victims into the path of the mummy. Interestingly Delgado a very good character actor enjoyed fame as Dr Who's archnemesis The Master on television but tragically he was killed in a car crash in 1973.All in all THE MUMMY'S SHROUD is a better than average secondfeature with better production values than one would normally expect and some fine performances and neat period atmosphere. An underrated Hammer horror which shows that a lot can be achieved within a low budget with good technicians and actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hammer Films made a bazillion horror films from the 1950s1970s. This is one of several mummy films they made during the era. It's not the best of their mummy films this would be THE MUMMY 1959 nor is it the worst that would probably be CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB 1964. In fact it's very typical of a mummy film in most every way.The film starts with a long prologue about a young Prince whose throne is usurped. A faithful servant takes him into the desert and the boy dies. However in death the servant makes sure his master goes to the afterlife by having him buried. In 1920 an expedition finds both this mummified boy and the servant who is also a mummy though they look very very different. It's obvious that the servant is just some bozo in a cheap mummy suit looking nothing like the great Universal films mummies of the 1930s and 40s. As for the boy I thought it looked like a real dessicated dead kid but my daughter who has taken classes in archeology and has seen mummies up close says it looked nothing like one. Either way to the untrained eye it's not badnot a cheesy one like the servant.Later some weirdos who are mummy cult members utter a long curse in order to bring the dead servant to life and kill those who desecrated the grave. Wow you didn't see that coming...no wait that's the plot of virtually EVERY mummy film! So for the next 30 minutes the mummy does some nasty killing. The first few are particularly nasty though the really bad guy who DOES have it coming dies in an amazingly anticlimactic manner.The film has several pluses. The sets aren't bad and although the story is very very familiar it's handled well. Also a few of the murders are clever and different. As for the minuses it's not terribly original. Also I don't know why Hammer did such a rotten job with their mummiesthey just look terribly unrealistic and cheapalthough the scene with the mummy at the very end was well done.Overall very watchable for monster fans but don't rush out and see this. It's a case of been there done that.".

It was Hammer's third foray into the land of the Pharaohs first with their wonderful version of The Mummy with Cushing and Lee then the very entertaining Curse of the Mummy's Tomb and followed by this serviceable sequel of sorts at least as subject matter is concerned. Hammer would do one more Mummy movie  the lamentable Blood from the Mummy's Tomb. The Mummy's Shroud tells the story via prologue of a very young Pharaoh being deposed by his evil uncle being led to the desert by his faithful servant Prem dying and being entombed. We then move to 1920 with an archaeological group looking for his tomb finding it and well you know what comes next. Is there anything really original about the story here? Not really but it is executed with Hammer quality production values good acting a beautiful haunting melodic score by Don Banks and some firstrate set pieces. John Gilling directs with his customary finesse for detail like he used in other such Hammer films like Plague of the Zombies. There are some great scenes in this film from the ending in the museum to the deaths of several key characters. The Egyptian sweeper finding the first body was in particular very eerie and wellshot. Andre Morrell may have top billing but is MIA throughout most of the picture. The real star of the film is John Phillips as a thoroughly unlikable wealthy British financier of the whole expedition. Phillips plays the arrogant duplicitous selfcentered man with great aplomb. The other actors are all effective with Elizabeth Sellars as Phillip's wife and Richard Warner as a police inspector standing out. But the best performance belongs to British everyman character actor Michael Ripper who first of all gets a pretty juicy part in terms of screen time here but also is allowed to flex his acting muscles and range. Ripper is very strong in a somewhat thankless role as Phillip's press secretary and doitall man. One reviewer already talked about in length the scene where Ripper breaks his glasses and I concur that it is a powerfully tragic ironic and wonderfully shot scene. The Mummy's Shroud is certainly not one of the best of the House of Hammer but I do think it was one of its better movies as the sixties began to wane. I haven't nearly the respectloveadmiration of Hammer's seventies films as I do for its sixties films. Now I will wrap it up!".

As it so happens the young boy was forced to flee into the desert with a loyal servant named Prem Dickie Owen because of intrigue within the Pharaoh's family. Unfortunately the Egyptian desert proves too much for the young boy and KahToBey is buried by Prem and a curse is placed upon anyone who might disturb his master's tomb. As luck would have it the archaeological expedition finds the tomband brings the body of Kahtobey back to the nearest Egyptian citywhere the wealthy financier of the expedition named Stanley Preston John Phillips takes all of the credit. What he doesn't count on however is the mummified body of Prem being brought back to life by the ancestral guardian of the tomb who then orders the mummy to kill all of those who dared to desecrate the sacred resting place of KahToBey. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film pretty much shared the same plot and formula as any number of mummy films made prior to it and as a result there really isn't much here than hasn't been seen before. Even so it was an okay movie for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.".

It is however an uneven film with a number of strengths and an even number of big weaknesses and one of Hammer's least accomplished.It looks good some of the editing lacks tightness sometimes and the Mummy effects are not very good but the photography is solid and often wonderful especially in the final thirty minutes the lighting is suitably eerie and the sets give a sense of time and place very well while also looking great. The music score thunders thrillingly and doesn't feel stock and overbearing fitting with the atmosphere appropriately. The murders are inventive and quite grisly while the first murder is the one with the most punch the most memorable being Longbarrow's. While the best The Mummy's Shroud gets is the final thirty minutes which is very entertaining and legitimately scary.Casting and actingwise it is a rather mixed bag with a few coming off well. The best performance comes from Michael Ripper I appreciated that his role was more substantial in comparison to some of his other roles and he is excellent in it the tragic nature of the character Longbarrow was so poignantly done and had such pathos that it was easy to feel sympathy for him. John Phillips also stands out as a suitably loathsome villain while Barbara Sellars matches him more than ideally the interplay between Phillips is very effectively played by both. David Buck is an appealing hero. Catherine Lacey tries too hard sometimes but it is clear that she was having fun and she is enjoyable to fun as one of the film's more colourful characters.Others don't fare so well. Roger Delgardo has a tendency to overcompensate that it takes one out of the film his tongueincheek comedic nature too much out of place. Andre Morell was a reliable actor but is completely wasted no matter how hard he tried to give some serious depth to his character. As truly attractive Maggie Kimberly looks her acting is very overtheatrical and melodramatic and it does hurt the film sometimes. Lastly the Mummy of the title is badly disadvantaged by the truly laughable and fake look it hasthe Egyptians in the opening sequence are also very poorly made up its far too late and far too short screen time and Eddie Powell'seven more lumbering and anaemic than the worst of Lon Chaney Jnr's interpretation emotionless and unmenacing performance.The film takes far too long to get going with an overlongdid it really need to be seven minutes? and not always relevant opening scene with the backstory rather unnecessary. Despite the distinguished delivery the narration was not really needed and it should have been a case of more show less tell. The script is very stiff and rambling with a lot of talk that doesn't do anywhere. The first half is also let down by its draggy pacing noticeable lack of suspense and horror and a very overfamiliar story with a few subplots that either lead nowhere add little or both.All in all an uneven film and one of Hammer's lesser and least accomplished films but by all means watchable especially for the final thirty minutes and Ripper's performance. 510 Bethany Cox".

One of the biggest pluses to this is the rather enjoyable action scenes that have a lot of rather kinetic enjoyable fun to them whether it's the opening assault taking place in historical Egypt or the exploration of the tomb as both of these manages to feature some enjoyable and surprising aspect to not only keep them moving along but also feature some suspenseful moments to match the spectacle.

As well the finale here works incredibly well by featuring the appeasement attempt before it resurrects and begins brawling and chasing them around the exhibit before finally having the fun of getting the mummy turned to stone so there's plenty of exciting action placed there to get this one on a highnote. Still there's a few things that hold this one back most notably the subplot about the doctor being placed in an asylum which has little if anything to do with the film itself and isn't really given any sort of justification why. It plays it off as if that was how the end result for him all along was going to play out yet then has him break out anyway which causes a series of logic problems with incarcerating him in the first place.

	schema:headline " Nothing to do with the Sphinx";
	schema:reviewBody "This film has nothing whatever to do with the Sphinx and the title is just a comeon. The story concerns an imagined true and concealed tomb in the Valley of the Kings of King Seti I second pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty New Kingdom period. It is not a bad yarn and a great deal of the film is shot on location. Even the scenes in the Winter Palace Hotel lobby in Luxor were really shot there and not in a studio. The second unit stuff is endless and they must have been let loose on Egypt for weeks. Frank Langella is very good indeed as a sophisticated Egyptian. He should take it up as a sideline. The film is essentially ruined by one of the world's most irritating actresses Lesley Anne Down who plays the lead. She spends the whole film wondering how she looks are her blue eyes refracting light at the correct angle do all the fellas lust after her etc. Having started life as a model at the age of ten what hope could there be for her? She epitomises everything that is most revolting about female vanity and dimwitted inanity. And to think that this film was directed by Franklin Shaffner who won an Oscar for 'Patton'! He allows this terrible actress to whimper and simper through the film hysterical one moment flirting the next in a kind of hurricane of idiocy as she reels from one man to another either screaming or making bedroom eyes it matters not. She is supposed to be a young Egyptologist. But she has never been to Egypt before! She takes a taxi to Giza and catching her first glimpse of the pyramids gushes in ecstasy 'But they're so BIG!!!!' Barf! OK so that was the script but she takes to the banality too readily giving the impression that it is her natural element which I don't doubt for a minute. Elements of the story are sound. There is indeed a serious problem about a black market in antiquities there. True! Well done! The novel by Robin Cook which I have not seen may be OK for all I know. It was fun to see the name of Cyril Swern as sound recordist on the film as I knew him pretty well long ago. Stanley Kubrick's stepdaughter Katharina is described as 'draughtswoman'. I wonder what that means? Maybe she did some set work. Anyway the antiquities in the film are pretty good actually. And we get to see lots of the Cairo Museum and numerous scenic locations. They actually go inside King Tutankhamun's Tomb! I don't imagine that would be allowed today for a movie. A lot of inappropriate scenes take place in mosques. That would not go down well today but in 1981 such things were not on the agenda. The music for the film is absolutely appalling worse than Lesley Anne Down in fact! But there were sound track elements which were surprisingly authentic one being the cacophony of traffic noise of Cairo which is accurately rendered in the background and would make anyone who knows Cairo chuckle nervously. Also the loudspeaker calls to prayer are there the whole time another touch of authenticity. Why didn't they get this right? It could have been good.".

If the public does not understand why this is laughable they deserve this film. The title Sphinx has nothing to do with the plot which is loosely about the discovery of a lost tomb. Not exactly PC because all the good Egyptians are played by Europeans and the bad Egyptians are played by Egyptians. In the opening credits the cast names are spelled out in hieroglyphs which seems to be the extent of the research wasted on this turkey.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Robin Cook novel Coma had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978. A couple of years later it was the turn of another Robin Cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment  but in the case of Sphinx virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong. This is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances stupid dialogue unconvincing characters and leaden pacing. The only reason it escapes a 1outof10 rating is that the Egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself. Hard to believe Franklin J. Schaffner of Patton and Planet Of The Apes is the director behind this debacle.Pretty Egyptologist Erica Baron Lesley AnneDown is on a working vacation in Cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer AbduHamdi John Gielgud. Hamdi befriends Erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge. Consequently he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of Pharoah Seti I that he is keeping secretly in his shop. The very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in Erica for it could provide vital clues in locating Seti I's longlost tomb a prize as great as the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. Before Hamdi can tell Erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop with Erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end. Afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen Erica attempts to track down the treasure. She finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties none of whom are truly trustworthy. For one there is Yvon Maurice Ronet seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives? Then there is Akmed Khazzan Frank Langella an Egyptian for whom Erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her.The biggest problems with Sphinx generally result from its total disregard for plausibility. Down couldn't be less convincing as a female Egyptologist  one assumes she would be quite welleducated and resourceful yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick. On those rare occasions that she actually isn't running from a potential villain she does other brainless things such as taking Polaroid flash photos in a 4000 year old tomb! The plot twists are heavyhanded to say the least mainly comprising of revelations and doublecrosses that can be predicted well in advance. One can't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare because the pacing is awfully sluggish. What little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium. A famous review of the movie declared Sphinx stinks! Never before has a 2hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words.".

Sphinx consists mostly of LesleyAnne Down shrieking whenever something unpleasant happens and with how she was dressed  without a veil  the people in Egypt would have taken her for a prostitute. I couldn't tell whether or not Frank Langella's character was supposed to be Arab or white he had an Arab name but looked and talked like a EuroAmerican. And then John Gielgud plays an Egyptian man was it still acceptable to cast white people as nonwhite people by this point? For the record the title statue only appears in one or two scenes.I should say that the movie isn't terrible. I learned some interesting stuff about archeology. But a far cooler movie in this genre is the Charlton Heston movie The Awakening. This one is the sort of movie that you rent if there's absolutely nothing else to rent. I read that director Franklin J. Schaffner most famous for Planet of the Apes Patton Papillon and The Boys from Brazil ended his career on a downslide with this sort of movie I can see why. Also starring John RhysDavies Sallah in the Indiana Jones movies and Victoria Tennant Steve Martin's first wife she costarred with him in All of Me and L.A. Story.Not that this is really related but I wanted to talk about this movie getting released through Warner Bros. When I was little I always associated WB with Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck etc. Had I known then that the studio also released this movie  plus horror movies like The Exorcist The Pack The Shining and The Nesting  I probably would have asked something like Why did Bugs Bunny make a bunch of scary movies? This movie however is not scary.".

In fact almost all the Arab characters in this film are portrayed as bad men or savages when compared to the white angelic Down  the few trustworthy Arabs being played by white or western actors such as Sir John Gielguld.  Frank Langella gives a drab uninteresting performance as Khazzan.  He manages to show almost no emotion and only one facial expression throughout the film  as a mysterious romantic character he totally fails.Overall an interesting story is delivered with all the excitement of a traffic jam and is spoilt by a bad performance by an actress better suited to TV movies an actor that is almost totally without character and a support cast that are portrayed as savages.

Despite a great deal of production expense and travel not to mention Michael J.

Perhaps the heroine although superbly played by LesleyAnn Down was seen as too eager too liberated for either male or female picturegoer identification? Or perhaps the mass audiences just won't accept a girl  any girl  as an action lead in the cinema? On TV no problem. People leave their critical faculties dormant if the show is ostensibly free. Perhaps that's why TV's Wonder Woman chalked up such high ratings? Maybe the movie's plot was regarded as too facile and contrived? Maybe what the critics said about the characters being both too enigmatic and too onedimensional hit home even though audiences don't usually care a damn what critics say  and it didn't stop people from buying and reading the novel? Perhaps the background was too authentic the recreation of the real Egypt too meticulous? Or maybe it was simply that by 1981 Egyptian curse pictures had had their day so that even a superior story like this Sphinx could make no box office headway?".

The romantic storyline with Frank Langella lacked any chemistry between the characters it could have been stronger.

In London the son meets his half brother a rich man who is half Chinese who has designs on the snake. The battle between the brothers becomes a struggle for control of the world. This is a yellow peril story that is more akin to a Fu Manchu story then the mysteries that are the norm in the Edgar Wallace series. Actually it isn't surprising since Wallace was the man who came up with the story for King Kong so a tale of high adventure is right up his alley. This is a very good little film not just because it breaks with the conventions of the rest of series nor just because it's a ripping yarn but the film is unique in that while all of the characters are likable most of them are not wholly nice. Our hero is roguish and almost rakish his father is willful and clearly possessing a past of darkness his brother is charming as well as villainous the heroine is at times almost mousy her sister a bit too self centered and the girls' father is a shady business man who will do anything to keep himself afloat including offering up the girls. No one is spotless except perhaps for the hero's antique loving friend. It's an interesting group of people and it makes the film have a great sense that anything can happen at any time. More than worth a bowl of popcorn and a soda.".

He went on to make many many more films some of which are still known today as they are from the time when Karl May softcore and trash movies were very successful. But back to this film here We have an animal in the title a color and something that sounds like danger and with all these components the title is the epitome of an Edgar Wallace film title even if this film is far from the most famous Edgar Wallace films as we perceive them today. On the contrary you rarely find one here on IMDb with a lower rating than 5. And I can understand why. Then again I am generally not the greatest fan of this era of German crime movies.

	schema:reviewBody "Following the death of Peter Sellers the Pink Panther series seemed to have little future but director Blake Edwards still managed to grind out two further entries. The Trail Of The Pink Panther was mediocre but it had funny moments The Curse Of The Pink Panther is a stretch too far. This  number seven in the popular series  is a feeble comedy in which the plot is poorly contrived the actors look totally indifferent and the comic moments are tired rehashes of scenes from the earlier films. It's no exaggeration to say this is the worst of the series.Dreyfuss Herbert Lom is assigned to use a supercomputer to track down the world's greatest detective. Once found this awesome detective will be entrusted with the task of finding the missing Inspector Clouseau. However Dreyfuss has no intention of helping in the hunt for Clouseau you may remember from earlier films that Clouseau drove Dreyfuss to the brink of insanity. Thus Dreyfuss deliberately misuses the computer and finds the worst detective in the world  the inept New York officer Clifton Sleigh Ted Wass. Sleigh travels to France and follows a trail of clues hither and thither accidentally surviving numerous attempts on his life and getting into all manner of wacky situations as he closes in on the truth. Along the way he crosses swords with various characters from earlier Pink Panther films before it is finally revealed to the audience though not to Clifton Sleigh what actually became of the hapless Inspector Clouseau.There are a few compensations amid the general air of indifference. A certain famous film star billed as Turk Thrust II makes a guest appearance as Clouseau near the end and has a funny cameo role mimicking the mannerisms that Sellers had brought to the character. Henry Mancini's music is as catchy as ever and there are infrequent sight gags which are fairly amusing e.g. the scene where Wass sits on a giant rubber duck only for the beak to poke out suggestively from between his legs. On the whole alas The Curse Of The Pink Panther is a very poor film. With a running time close to 2 hours the film needs more than a couple of amusing gags and a good cameo appearance. Long before the end heck long before the middle! it becomes a tedious affair and as the plot unfolds one increasingly wishes that the final credits would hurry up and put an end to the misery. After this Edwards gave up on the series until in 1993 he belatedly added one final flick entitled The Son Of The Pink Panther.".

The Trail Of The Pink Panther was mediocre but it had funny moments The Curse Of The Pink Panther is a stretch too far. This  number seven in the popular series  is a feeble comedy in which the plot is poorly contrived the actors look totally indifferent and the comic moments are tired rehashes of scenes from the earlier films. It's no exaggeration to say this is the worst of the series.Dreyfuss Herbert Lom is assigned to use a supercomputer to track down the world's greatest detective. Once found this awesome detective will be entrusted with the task of finding the missing Inspector Clouseau. However Dreyfuss has no intention of helping in the hunt for Clouseau you may remember from earlier films that Clouseau drove Dreyfuss to the brink of insanity.

The stars of the show are again Herbert Lom and Joanna Lumley and the sexy Leslie Ash in a Bond girl like role. The man who steals the show is surprisingly Roger Moore as the newly Plastic surgery clad Clouseau who is made up to look like rather appropriately Roger Moore. An hilarious twist which is something Clouseau would have gone in for. It is a pity Moore wasn't given the role of Clouseau out right because he is effective in the part and quite funny.

	schema:reviewBody "This following to popular series is a new attempt to maintain the slapstick franchise in spite of Peter Sellers death by substituting in American actor Ted Wass . He's investigating bungling Clouseau disappearance and is on the trail of the jewel known as the Pink Panther and during his first scenes Ted appears in drag . Clouseau's previous chief Herbert Lom threatens to destroy the new detective . At the same time Ted Wass like Clouseau is making life intolerable for Inspector Dreyfuss . He then goes to Clouseau museum where he meets Kato Burt Kwouk  to the French Riveira and Valencia Spain where encounters mobsters Robert Loggia who wish to kill him . Later on  aboard a yacht along with the habitual David Niven  Capucine  Robert Wagner he goes to Mallorca . There he attempts to track down the Clouseau trail but he meets a suspect Countess Chandra Joanna Lumley. This is arguably one of the most average of the series about the botcher Inspector and being the eight Pink Panther movie in the known film franchise . In this slapdash as well as disconcerting comedy  Wass attempts to investigate whether or no Clouseau is living somewhere . This fun release has some hilarious moments here and there . The film continues where Trail of the Pink Panther 1982 leaves off . Though uncredited late Peter Sellers can still be heard in various scenes through archival sound . Starring Ted Wass as Sleigh is sympathetic imitating to Sellers  outdoing his botcher and diverting character . Actors considered for the role of Clifton Sleigh included John Ritter John Cleese Dudley Moore and Rowan Atkinson  in the end  the part went to Ted Wass . The actors seem to enjoy immensely themselves but they are supposedly spending some amusing holidays in Riveira  Mallorca Valencia . Players appearing in this movie who had appeared in the original Pink Panther 1963 the first film in the series  were Capucine David Niven and Robert Wagner . In the film appears the usual series as Herbert Lom chief Inspector Dreyfuss Andre Maranne Sergeant Francois Duval Grahame Stark as a bored waiter and the ordinary professor Harvey Korman . The movie was simultaneously filmed along with Trail to the Pink Panther where equally the protagonist Joanna Lumley is looking for Inspector Clouseau . Writer producer  director Blake Edwards gets some inspired bits penned by himself  however he attempts to alive his classic personage with no much success . Rating  Mediocre but entertaining .".

Still while Peter Sellers is missed his character is missed even more. The studio could have counted its losses and found a new Clouseau and a new director to bring new blood to the franchise. Instead the events of the previous films including the little inconsistencies between movies are brought to a head as Clouseau's disappearance and the Pink Panther diamond's theft come together in one mangled conspiracy theory.

Appropriate since this was originally supposed to be his franchise.It turns out in the end that Clouseau has had plastic surgery in order to look like Roger Moore played by Roger Moore. The scene where Moore and Wass meet is priceless providing a chance for Clouseau and Sleigh to see who the bigger buffoon is in a hilarious game of comical oneupmanship.Not as funny as any of the Peter Sellers films by a long shot but a novelty among the series and a worthwhile comedy for fans of this comedymystery series.".

Herbert Lom's character goes through the motions as does the Cato character. David Niven and Robert Wagner seemed as though they were led out onto the set with cash hanging from a fishing line. There is no reason for this movie. Trying to have a mediocre guy like Wass replace Peter Sellers would be like replacing Billy Crystal for Woody Allen or something of the like. Tom Hanks perhaps or anyone anyone but Wass. He seems at times as if he's stuck in this film and doesn't know what to do. I feel for him. I have no idea who cast this poor guy. This is a lousy movie.

The computer finds Clifton Sleigh.Wass has some enormous shoes to fill and he wisely doesn't even attempt to do so. Instead of mimicking Sellers he creates a completely new character one who is smarter than Clouseau but about twice as accidentprone. A scene in which he is sitting with his instant companion doll at a French cafe is hilarious especially when it springs a leak and he attempts to keep it from deflating.The movie's weakest moments are his dealings with actors from previous PINK PANTHER movies such as David Niven Robert Wagner Cappucine and Burt Kuouk who all appear to be doing this as a personal favor to director Blake Edwards. On the other hand Harvey Korman has a funny bit taking over the role of disguise designer Professor Balls.The movie leads up to a bizarre and hilarious finale which is best left a surprise. Suffice it to say there is a surprise cameo by an actor who DOES do a flawless Clouseau impersonation! I'd guess I recommend this movie. It's pretty funny and has a few gems hidden in there with the more sophomoric stuff. But there will only ever be one Peter Sellers and there's really no reason for this movie to exist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed right after Trail of the Pink Panther Curse of the Pink Panther continues the storyline of finding both Chief Inspector Clouseau and the Pink Panther diamond. Since Dreyfus however would rather Clouseau was never found he has someone from jail tell him how to fix it so a HALlike computer finds the opposite of best detective in the world. That opposite would be Clifton Sleigh Ted Wass from New York City. Meanwhile a Countess Chandra Joanna Lumley in her second consecutive Panther role has the diamond and it seems an affair with a certain police detective...All right I'll just say this right now I didn't like the way Clouseau ended up in this movie being an accomplice to the Pink Panther theft and changing his face as well. I can't believe this is the way he would have behaved considering his sworn oath to upload the law or luw. Having said that I was very amused when he ended up looking like Roger Moore and how perfect was he when he did the Clouseau voice! Okay moving onI wasn't crazy about Sleigh when they first showed him disguising as a hooker in New York. Then he showed up at a Chicago airport during a windy storm with his umbrella almost swept up in it and I laughed a little. What got me on his side was that hilarious scene with an inflatable woman provided by Balls Harvey Korman again taking place at an outside French restaurant with once again another hilarious performance by the versatile Graham Stark as a bored waiter who can't keep his eyes off of the doll and Sleigh's attempts at blowing her up. There was also a hilarious fight scene between Clifton some gangsters led by Robert Loggia and a woman he just met named Juleta Shanereal name Julie Morgan Leslie Ash who later tries to bed Sleigh. Oh and Korman was only fitfully amusing as Balls here though I did like the way he said caca. And besides David Niven and Capucine it was nice to see Robert Wagner also show up as Niven's nephew George Lytton who's also from The original Pink Panther. One more appearance I was pleasantly surprised by was that of Pat Corleybest known to me as Phil the bartender on Murphy Brownas Sleigh's frustrated superior in New York. He sounded different here but I recognized him just the same. Herbert Lom as Dreyfus still provides some laughs but Burt Kwouk as Cato was mostly wasted here especially when he wrestles with the American Sleigh at the nowClouseau Museum apartment. So I guess overall I really enjoyed Curse of the Pink Panther despite the absence of Sellers and what Edwards did with his character. Oh and I wasn't crazy about the animated beginning credit sequence from Marvel Productions this time around though as always the Henry Mancini theme is way cool. One more note This was Niven's final film appearance as well as the final Panther stint for Andre Maranne as Sgt. Francois Duval. Since this movie bombed or buumbed you'd think Edwards was through with the Pink Panther series once and for all. Once again you'd be wrong. P.S. Edwards' stepdaughter Emma Walton is an angry hooker here and his son Geoffrey who also cowrote the screenplay is the voice of the computer Aldous. Next up Son of the Pink Panther...".

The overall Plot is actually kind of clever and keeps you wondering how it can possibly unfold knowing that Sellers character is not available...those who do not like this film I believe are of the you can't replace Sellers' clousseau ilk. that may be true but give the master of adult comedy Edwards  a chance  open your mind and be entertained".

The overall Plot is actually kind of clever and keeps you wondering how it can possibly unfold knowing that Sellers character is not available...those who do not like this film I believe are of the you can't replace Sellers' clousseau ilk. that may be true but give the master of adult comedy Edwards  a chance  open your mind and be entertained";

'Curse' its successor was an improvement thanks to a funny performance from the likable Ted Wass best known as 'Danny Dallas' from the longrunning T.V. show 'Soap'. His character Clifton Sleigh had more than a touch of Harold Lloyd about him but alas Sellers proved irreplaceable  Dudley Moore and Rowan Atkinson knew this too. They both turned it down  and we never saw Sleigh again. Some good visual gags include Dreyfus falling from his office window and Sleigh's problems with an inflatable doll. The film might have stood a chance had it not been continually looking over its shoulder at what went before. Especially confusing was Joanna Lumley's appearance as Countess Chandra  a totally different character to the one she'd played in 'Trail'. The decision to turn Clouseau bad rankled with audiences as well. David Niven's final film sadly.".

For one thing it doesn't drag on like the original film again it could just be meand give Blake Edwards credit for at least attempting to continue the series.Looking back at Edwards' previous five films 10 S.O.B. VictorVictoria Trail of the Pink Panther and The Man Who Loved Womenwhich I persist in admiring even in the face of universally dismal reviews I suppose it was a tough act to follow those great films with Curse perhaps it was a way to get out of his UA contract so he could make more important films at Columbia including the great Micki and Maude That's Life Blind Date and A Fine MessBut by all means Edwards hasn't made a bad picture. Curse is very much worth a look to see how the series might have turned had it not been a DUD at the box office. As for the casting one might condemn Ted Wass for even attempting to fill the enormous shoes left behind by Sellers but he gives it a good try and makes his own niche as an entirely different kind of stupid detective. And as usual Herbert Lom is hilarious as Chief Inspector Dreyfus. He really holds the film together and how he never received an Oscar nomination is beyond my understanding.If you haven't seen the other Panther films one might look at Curse of the Pink Panther as a very good even great comedy. However if you have seen the other films Curse will look tissue thin by comparison. But that didn't stop me from finding much to enjoy in this film.

	schema:headline " A superb addition to the cinematic annals of lycanthrope";
	schema:reviewBody "A modest werewolf epic that never feels formulaic in the hands of director Terence Fisher and writer Anthony Hinds. The film is one of Hammer's most accomplished and deals with the subject of lycanthrope with some imagination. Young Leon Justin Walters the consequence of a rape is born with what appears to be a dormant werewolf gene that is awakened when he tastes the warm sweet blood of a bird. Unable to resist his true nature he starts killing livestock in a small rural community. His juvenile rampage doesn't last long because the local priest John Gabriel identifies his condition and encourages his adopted parents to shower him with love and affection convinced that it is love that will keep the boy's desires at bay.

	onyx:emotionText "A modest werewolf epic that never feels formulaic in the hands of director Terence Fisher and writer Anthony Hinds. The film is one of Hammer's most accomplished and deals with the subject of lycanthrope with some imagination. Young Leon Justin Walters the consequence of a rape is born with what appears to be a dormant werewolf gene that is awakened when he tastes the warm sweet blood of a bird. Unable to resist his true nature he starts killing livestock in a small rural community. His juvenile rampage doesn't last long because the local priest John Gabriel identifies his condition and encourages his adopted parents to shower him with love and affection convinced that it is love that will keep the boy's desires at bay. Clearly the priest's faith in love is not misplaced because ten year's later the adult Leon nicely played by Oliver Reed who has just left home is only a wolf with the women.

	schema:reviewBody "On certain days I consider The Curse of the Werewolf to be my alltime favorite horror film. In my opinion it was Hammer's best effort except possibly for the highly underrated Phantom of the Opera with Herbert Lom. The story is most unique and carries a strong yet very Catholic spiritual element. The cinematography is excellent as well as Terence Fisher's direction. One of the most outstanding qualities of the movie is the immaculately intricate and powerful music score by Benjamin Frankel. I've never heard of this composer before or since but I would love to find this score on CD.There are already plenty of writeups detailing thoughts on the story so I won't go there. The acting is adequate to superb and Oliver Reed does an outstanding job portraying a tormented soul protractedly  possessed by the raging spirit of unbridled destruction. I've notice one goof in the movie that is actually rather glaring when you notice it... The movie starts off with narration Some twohundred years ago in a village in Spain blah blah blah... and as the story develops to the end of the narration the servant girl is in the swamp as Clifford Evans approaches and the narration ends with and that is how I found her.The movie is filled with powerful scenes and the story keeps the viewer involved at all times. It slips a bit when the wolf hunter Pepe finds a dead sheep and says  Hello what's this then? A bonafide Spanish Limey! Despite the movie's lowbudget production and the era it was created it ranks as an excellent horror film even by today's standards. If you are a person who has to have graphic violence and lots of running and screaming to keep you entertained then this movie is not for you. If you enjoy a good original story and interesting characters then this movie will suffice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Curse of the Werewolf 1961 Director Terence Fisher CastOliver Reed Clifford Evans Catherine Feller Review Hammer films is known for making many vampire films many Frankenstein films and even a few Mummy films...but for some reason Curse of the Werewolf was their one and only werewolf film ever made. Even though they only made one Werewolf film I'm happy because at least the only one they did make is really really good.The story is about a beggar who gets thrown into a dungeon by a despotic marquis who takes pleasure in demeaning other human beings. The beggar spends years upon years in prison until he becomes almost animal like. A young and beautiful servant girl is thrown into the same cell as the insane beggar is because she rejected going to bed with the same marquis. The beggar decides to rape her and the offspring of that rape is Leon Corledo. A young boy who is cursed to become a werewolf because he was born on Christmas Day. And on this movie being born on Christmas Day means you are forever cursed to become a werewolf when the full moon comes.I enjoyed this movie immensely and I have to say that one of the things that enhanced my enjoyment of it was Oliver Reeds portrayal of Leon Corledo. He is magnificent in this movie. He has a great presence and a roughness to him that is perfect for playing a man cursed with lycanthropy. He has some very intense moments in which we can see that he is torn between letting his animal side loose or keeping it under control.Terence Fisher one of Hammers prime directors did a fine Job in bringing to life the tale of the werewolf. Hes done many fine Hammer films in the past and this one is just another jewel in his crown of great horror films. The movie is heavy on atmosphere and creepy visuals. A standout moment for me was when the young Leon has turned into a werewolf in his room and cant escape it because his stepfather has barred the windows in his room so he cant escape at night. The look on the kids face and the music is a real horror movie moment. Fisher made sure there's plenty of cool shots of the fool moon hovering over the dark sky as we hear the howling of a wolf in the distance. Or the scene in which the are going to baptize young Leon and the water in the altar starts to boil.... Its nice touches like those that make a HammerTerence Fisher film special.I also liked how they treated the origin of the werewolf. The really go back and explain how it all started. Its not just a movie about a werewolf running amok killing people in a little town. Here we get the whole back story as to how the whole thing started. I liked that. It gave the film lots of depth. Its a story covering a few decades of history. Another thing that made the story special was the idea that love and compassion towards Leon could help him control the beast inside of him.Then there's the werewolf transformation which is after all one of the big things about watching a werewolf film. There's always a spotlight on the transformation sequence. Its always a showstopper in films like American Werewolf in London and The Howling and even in The Wolfman. Here I must say that for the time it was made the make up is really excellent. I'm guessing that it was for budgetary reasons that hey held the transformation all the way till the very ending but when it does happen its very good. I was amazed that for the time it was made 1961 it turned out as good as it did. In fact I think this look was the one that Fredd Dekker was paying homage to when he directed his monster film The Monster Squad in which The Werewolf teams up with Dracula Frankensteins monster The Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Mummy to bring the forces of darkness to earth. The look of the werewolf in that movie is exactly like the one seen on Curse of the Werewolf. I don't blame Fred Dekker for wanting to pay homage to such a cool creature.The only downside to this movie? Watching English actors playing Spaniards. It was kind of funny to see that the only thing that they added to their acting to make it look Spaniard was saying Seor at the end of every sentence.Finally Id say that this is one of the best Hammer films ever made and that this movie deserves a whole lot more recognition then it gets. It should be out on DVD because as it is its one of the best werewolf films ever made.Rating 5 out of 5".

A beggar is thrown into a cell by a despotic nobleman and forgotten about. The only people he has any contact with are the jailer and his mute daughter. Over time the daughter grows up and becomes the beautiful Yvonne Romain who after avoiding the amorous advances of the now decrepit nobleman ends up being thrown into the same cell as the beggar who is now quite insane and rapes her. She escapes kills the nobleman and disappears into the woods where she is eventually found by the kindly Don Alfredo Corledo who takes her home to care for her. The product of the rape is born on Christmas Day which means bad luck for the kid as children born out of wedlock on the day Christ was born are cursed. After a few years goats started getting killed and everything points to the young Leon being the culprit his mother died in childbirth and the kindly Corledo is raising him as his own. So his windows are barred to stop his excursions and most importantly he is given love and affection which stops the werewolf coming out.This is one of the best aspects of Hammer's version of the werewolf tale. This version of the lycanthrope legend purports that the manwerewolf is in constant battle within the person  when the spirit of the man is weak the werewolf will emerge but when the spirit of the man is strong the werewolf will not. So when showered with the love and affection Corledo and his missus give him the werewolf is not to be seen. When he leave home he falls in love which again keeps the beast at bay but this is a horror film and the beast will emerge.The film looks wonderful. The Spanish sets are realistic and Fisher handles the proceedings in his usual faultless way. The addition of the love story here is integral to the plot and works perfectly. What really helps with this film is the long prewerewolf story which adds so much depth to the character of Leon that it makes it a standalone film in the lycanthrope genre. Probably most Hammer fans would put this under the perfect ten but to me it is perfect and also occasionally beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Curse of The Werewolf marks the beginning of a slight decline in the quality of Hammer's Golden Age horror output.

	schema:reviewBody "The Curse of the Werewolf was the only werewolf movie produced by Hammer studios and to be honest I can understand why even with the usually excellent Terence Fisher at the helm and a young Oliver Reed in the starring role I found the film rather disappointing suffering from a weak script that offers up one of the most ridiculous reasons for a case of lycanthropy that I've ever seen and terrible pacing that keeps the werewolf under wraps for most of the running time.Much of the first half is given over to back story a beggar Richard Wordsworth visits a castle looking for food there he is mocked and ridiculed by the wicked Marques Siniestro Anthony Dawson before being thrown into the dungeon where he is looked after by the jailer and his mute daughter.

	onyx:emotionText "The Curse of the Werewolf was the only werewolf movie produced by Hammer studios and to be honest I can understand why even with the usually excellent Terence Fisher at the helm and a young Oliver Reed in the starring role I found the film rather disappointing suffering from a weak script that offers up one of the most ridiculous reasons for a case of lycanthropy that I've ever seen and terrible pacing that keeps the werewolf under wraps for most of the running time.Much of the first half is given over to back story a beggar Richard Wordsworth visits a castle looking for food there he is mocked and ridiculed by the wicked Marques Siniestro Anthony Dawson before being thrown into the dungeon where he is looked after by the jailer and his mute daughter. Years pass the beggar becomes a savage the jailer dies and his daughter grows up to be a major hottie the stunning Yvonne Romain.

	schema:reviewBody "Curse of the Werewolf is a film steeped in uncertainty. Sometimes referred to as a wasted opportunity sometimes considered the greatest werewolf movie of all time Curse isn't really either and although a wellmade film it isn't very good. But what I am certain of is that it's my favorite Christmas movie of all time!!!Don Alfredo CorledoClifford Evansis apparently an omniscient immortal as he begins the filmafter the creepy opening credits showing the werewolf's crying eyesby informing usthrough pasttense voiceoverof events he could not possibly have witnessed or found out about and that he states happened 200 years ago when by the time we meet him during those events he is clearly a middleaged man. Oh well the film starts with the ringing of a church bell in a small Spanish village where a handsome but scruffy beggarRichard Wordsworthinquires why the bell is ringing even though it's not a Sunday. After several curt dismissals he finds that the local Marquis has just gotten married to a village girland left the village impoverished by raising taxes to fund the wedding and from what we can tell it apparently wasn't a marriage she was willing to enter into. A sarcastic barfly tricks our ragclad hero into going to beg the Marquis for food. And as you may have gathered the Marquis isn't exactly a charitable man....The MarquisAnthony Dawson from Dial M for Murder is a sadistic creep who loves abusing his underlings and he makes no exceptions with the beggar making him act like a dog and dance. After the Beggar makes a suggestive comment he ends up being locked in a dungeon where he gradually loses his grip on realityand his good looks too. Meanwhile the Marquis now suffering from leprosy and more occupied with creating houses of cards than the outside world tries to rape a busty mute servant girlYvonne Romaine who effectively uses facial expressions to emote for a role that requires no talentwho bites him. He has her thrown in the same dungeon as the beggar who rapes her anyway. The beggar dies and the girl escapes after killing the Marquis. She tries to drown herself but is rescued by Don Alfredo and brought to his home where she is taken care of by his maid Teresa. The girl dies giving birth on Christmas eve but because widdle baby Jeebus has some serious birthday attention issuesFor an unwanted child to be born on Christmas is an insult to heaven! says Teresa the child Leon is cursed.....I'd like to point out that this has all happened in the first 26 minutes.Following some boring longwinded exposition involving an explanation for Leon's affliction a comedic subplot involving the goatherder's rivalry with the night watchmantwo of the most British sounding 'Spaniards' I've ever heard! and some truly awful overactingTeresa's line I just meanhe didn't come through here!! gets my medal as the most meaningless line ever uttered with such overthetop conviction balanced with some very good actingJohn Gabriel gives a wonderful naturalistic performance as a kindly priest scenes intended to be frightening that will give rise to all kinds of lewd jokescheck out the kid's hairy palms we finally meet the adult LeonOliver Reed who sets off to work at a local vineyard and falls in love with the owner's daughter CristinaCatherine Feller and the story begins....at last.Its' pretty much just a retread of Romeo  Juliet' with elements of the 1941 universal film thrown in. The difference being that there we got to know and like Lon Chaney Jr's character. Here we find out NOTHING about Leon and what we do find out pretty much makes him come off as a jerk yelling at Cristina and shaking her even before he finds out that he's a werewolf and needs a woman's love to cure him. Cristina pretty much sees that Leon is little different from her controlling dad and obnoxious fiance but decides to give him a shot anywaywhat girl could resist a young Ollie Reed? Leon refuses to show some simple patience and instead goes to a brothel with his Benny Hilllike coworker Jose. Apparently being in a 'sinful' atmosphere awakens the beast in Leon and he becomes a werewolf Don Alfredo finds out and you can guess the rest....Oliver Reed is one of my favorite actors but he doesn't get to do much here. We see or hear so little of Leon and what we do makes him come off as an impatient jerk who is hard to pity. He does however pull off the transformation scenes incredibly well and as the werewolf he's simply one of the coolestlooking monsters of all time. Larry Talbot couldn't escape a bear trap Leon can rip a rip an iron prison cell down and chuck doors and bales of hay at people! The rest of the cast is competent Clifford Evans is obviously disinterested Hira Talfrey overacts badly as Teresa and although she does a good job as Leon's mute mother Yvonne Romaine has little screen timedespite prominent billing and poster art depicting her as Leon's loveinterest!. Martin Matthews provides good comedy relief as Jose. Catherine Feller isn't believable as an object of affection for two handsome men but she succeeds at evoking sympathy and is the film's most pitiable character. The real standouts however are Wordsworth and Dawson as the Beggar  Marquis. Both actors deserved better careers.Curse' isn't great despite nice sets and cinematography but it's great to pop in at Christmas time! Where else can you see a movie about Christmas with cruelty to the homeless food wasting leprotic lechers a mute woman being raped werewolves drunk guys named Jose who kiss papercutouts and 'Spaniards' who talk like Monty Python extras?".

At any rate I think this movie is better than THE WOLF MAN. This isn't taking anything away from the great classic but CURSE is better. It's more in depth and frankly I think the werewolf makeup is much better. You feel for Leon Coledo the way you felt for Larry Talbot. And Terrence Fisher seems to have established a trademark of showing the monster's eyes during the opening credits of all his movies. You begin to feel the tragic poignancy of the story when at the opening credits you hear the howl of a wolf and there is a closeup of the creature with tears in his eyes. He used this effect in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA a year later.I'm trying to picture what it must have been like when this movie premiered in 1961. A servant girl raped? That was a taboo subject back then. I'm a little young to remember how the public reacted to this back then but it sure would be interesting to find out.".

	schema:headline " Hammer's dark and classy epic tragedy...";
	schema:reviewBody "Story says that when a deal for a coproduced movie set in Spanish Civil War fell legendary producer Anthony Hinds of Hammer Films decided to use the already built sets in a horror movie of their own in order to recover some of the investment. With time and budget against him he decided to write the screenplay himself getting inspiration from the legendary 1933 horror novel The Werewolf of Paris  by Guy Endore. Writing under the pen name of John Ender Hinds made his own adaptation of the classic novel named The Curse of the Werewolf and set his story in 18th Century Spain. Filmmaker Terence Fisher Hammer's most successful and original director was the man chosen to give life to Hinds' epic tragedy of a man born under the terrible curse of the Werewolf.The story begins with the arrival of a poor beggar Richard Wordsworth to Spaniard county where he becomes the victim of the Marques' Anthony Dawson sadism and becomes prisoner at the castle. Time goes by and many years later a beautiful mute servant girl Yvonne Romain has the same luck and ends in the same cage as the beggar who in his madness brutally rapes the young woman. After that tragic event the servant manages to escape from the castle only to be found by Don Alfredo Corledo Clifford Evans who takes the woman home in order to take care of her. To his surprise the girl was pregnant and her child is finally born on Christmas Day a day when according to an old legend demons attempt to posses humans. Named Leon Oliver Reed the child becomes a young man but the tragic circumstances of his conception and birth have put him under a devilish curse making him to become a werewolf when the full moon shines over the sky.Anthony Hinds does a very good job at writing this excellent werewolf story as while his story lacks the lurid details of Endore's novel he manages to keep the essence of the novel intact despite being really a loose adaptation. The most captivating element of The Curse of the Werewolf is the way it handles the tragedy of the curse set as a irremediable dark fate that awaits for Leon as a brutal change that eventually he will have to make. Leon suffers from a disease he didn't asked for that he simply was born with it and Hinds plays with that tragedy without excessive melodrama almost making the movie a horror version of a Greek tragedy. Hinds' way to introduce his audience to Leon's story may be excessively slow the entire first third dedicated to the events previous to Leon's birth but in the end it really pays off as one can't help but feel captivated by the epic tale of this cursed man.By the early 60s and after making influential horror films like The Curse of Frankenstein 1957 and The Brides of Dracula 1960 director Terence Fisher was still regarded as Hammer's best director and his remarkable work in The Curse of the Werewolf is definitely on par with the previous classics he had made at that point. Fisher gives a great used to the lavish sets built and makes the movie one of his most beautiful looking films and despite the budget constrains he creates a Gothic atmosphere of impeding doom that suits perfectly Hinds' story. Speaking of his take on the script this is probably the film that better represents Fisher's obsession with the dual nature of evil and he takes full advantage of his character's dilemma to create powerful scenes of suspense drama and even eroticism.Oliver Reed is simply perfect as Leon as his natural charm and powerful presence really enhance his character's beastly nature. It's a great performance as a man who tries to be good despite having a beast inside. While Reed is without a doubt the star the highlight of the movie is Clifford Evans whose performance as Leon's uncle Don Alfredo is heartbreaking in its delivery and certainly brings back good memories of Claude Rains in The Wolf Man 1941. As many have pointed out Catherine Feller is probably the weakest link in the cast although this doesn't mean she gives a bad performance but her presence is easily overshadowed by her peers. Hira Talfrey and John Gabriel make an excellent job in the supporting roles of the film giving the film a heart and completing the main cast of the movie.The Curse of the Werewolf is one of Hammer's most enjoyable movies combining perfectly period drama with horror and giving the movie the classic Hammer look with brilliant colors and haunting atmospheres. However it's also safe to say that the movie suffers from some quibbles that lessen the film's power. The main flaw in my opinion is the fact that the movie is too short for the kind of epic story the script attempts to narrate it starts very nicely slowly developing the tragic events but some scenes feel a bit too rushed. Certainly the budgetary constrains had a hand in this and it's a shame that the flow of the story is not constant as it does feel like a lot was missing. Modern viewers may not be used to Roy Ashton's work of makeup but I found it very appropriate and remarkably well done.Along with classics like The Wolf Man and An American Werewolf in London this movie easily ranks as one of the most enjoyable horror stories about werewolves ever told. The way it conveys the tragedy of the curse and Leon's attempts to control it make the movie an excellent film not only within the horror genre but in cinema in general. Watching the resulting product it's safe to say that the botched deal that prompted Hinds to write this movie was one of the best happy accidents ever. 910".

Most of the material is unneeded but it has a mute servant girl being raped by a almost beastlike man. She later gives birth to a baby boyand dies. He is named Leon Oliver Reed and is born with the sign of the werewolf on him. It's kept downuntil he is denied a girls love and he turns...This film is colorful and wellacted especially by Reed but slow moving. The LONG back story was a bad ideait takes too long for things to happen. Reed doesn't even show up until the film is half over and the werewolf attacks don't happen until over an hour has passed! Still it's not bad and beautiful to look at especially in the Universal DVD. And Reed is frightening as the werewolf GREAT makeup job and sympathetic as Leon.This was a major bomb in 1961 and Hammer never made another werewolf film. Too badthis could have been so good. Seriouslywhy the long back story and WHY set it in Spain? I give it a 6.".

Reed's response to EVERYTHING that happens in the film goes something like this AAARRRGGHH!!! Still he's adequate and Curse of the Werewolf works very well overall. The fact that you don't see what the monster looks like until the film's violent fastmoving climax a device that director Terence Fisher also employed in his next film Hammer's fine version of The Phantom of the Opera enhances the scares.

I didn't quite know what to expect but I thought it might be something like Possession the excellent novel by A S Byatt which was made into a much less good film i.e. a story in which a presentday researcher solves a mystery about some aspect of the life of a historical figure. Well it is that the historical figure is the painter Watteau and the presentday researcher is Lucie Audibert who is played charmingly by Sylvie Testud.There's a sidestory about a deafmute mime who does his act outside Lucie's work and with whom she strikes up a relationship. It adds little to the film although there seems to be some real chemistry between Lucie and the mime Vincent played by James Thirre.I found it quite compelling. The pictures on the screen are beautiful the cinematography is by JeanMarc Selva which is not a name I had ever heard before but it one I'll look out for in the future. The story moves along steadily never hurriedly and an atmosphere of tension is gradually created and built. Although Watteau is long dead there's a sense of sadness and loss at the part of his life that is revealed which is complemented and counterpointed by the sadness and almost desperation that surrounds Lucie's. Sylvie Testud is superb. She's as thin as a sparrow and not particularly pretty but one of the things I like about French films in general and this one in particular is that they are about not always of course but quite often rather ordinarylooking people who are shown to be men and women of substance.I've given it a score of 8 out of 10. I'd prefer to have given it 7.5 but that's not possible and it's better than a 7. It's not a great film but it's a very thoughtful one.".

Many of his paintings feature a man with his back to the artist. On some occasions this mystery man is actually the central figure. I've always believed that the man is Watteau himself and presumably the plucky little heroine of this movie has arrived at the same conclusion. Why did Watteau do this? To my mind it's definitely a symbol of rejection. Yes French society now adores him but there was a time when he was literally starving in a garret. But he was just as talented then as he is now. Perhaps more so! Anyway as far as I could make out French is not my native tongue the idea behind the artist's backtothecamera act was not made abundantly clear in the movie. Instead it was somewhat obscured by a secondary plot revolving around a mute youth who scrapes up a few coins as a living statue. Presumably the intention was to make this youth's twoway rejection shed the same light on Watteau. But it doesn't work in my opinion. I don't think audiences will get the connection  a connection that is further obscured by a plot twist that lands the young man in hospital. Anyway to get back to the main story for some totally unknown reason the little heroine's professor played by her costar Jean Dussart is violently opposed to her efforts. He does his best in fact he steps way out of line to discourage her from continuing her research. But Lucie is stubbornly persistent.COMMENT What My Eyes Have Seen The Watteau Mystery to translate the French title rather than refer to the movie by its generally used English title The Vanishing Point  which is too close to the 1971 cult movie for comfort in my opinion has loads of mesmerizing atmosphere and a great little actress in Sylvie Testud but all in all is somewhat disappointing for at least three major reasons which I've outlined in my Synopsis. To recapitulate 1 The mystery is never made abundantly clear. 2 The mystery is obscured by a secondary plot. 3 The professor's overthetop opposition is never explained. This said however the movie certainly has wondrous atmosphere. Partly this is achieved by the splendid acting of Sylvie Testud partly by the superb cinematography often using real locations such as Herv's Caf and the surrounding streets  and partly by David Moreau's haunting music score.".

	schema:headline " Not necessarily a Grudge to keep";
	schema:reviewBody "Sequels are a tricky thing. You have to serve the core audience who saw the first film while trying to not prove too bewildering to a new audience that may have not seen the original. Horror films are even more difficult to spin a sequel off from as suspense and scares are often by nature dependent on a lack of expectation from the audience. With The Grudge 2 director Takashi Shimizu and screenwriter Stephen Susco have attempted to not fall into that trap by approaching the sequel a little differently but by the time it's over unfortunately it still proves to be a little too repetitive for its own good.Unlike 2004's The Grudge which unfolded in a largely linear fashion The Grudge 2 shakes things up a bit by splitting the narrative between three different plot lines that all take place at different times. First there is the continuation essentially of the story from the first film where Karen Davis Sarah Michelle Gellar is being kept in a hospital after surviving the ordeal of the first film which centered around a house in Japan where a woman had been killed by her husband and thus created The Grudge a rage that consumes every living being that enters the house. Arriving from America to attempt to retrieve Karen is her sister Aubrey Amber Tamblyn who quickly becomes embroiled in the same situation as Karen. Second is a plot thread featuring Allison Arielle Kebbel an American girl in high school in Japan who is goaded by two classmates to enter the spooky house from the first film and finds that it lives up to its haunted house reputation. Finally the third plot string plays out in Chicago Illinois where Trish Jennifer Beals has moved in with her boyfriend Bill Christopher Cousins and his two children Lacey Sarah Roehmer and Jake Matthew Knight. The same day as she moves in so does a mysterious neighbor after which everyone in the apartment complex starts acting weird.When The Grudge 2 works the best word to describe it is creepy. The horrific imagery mostly of a long haired blue skinned Japanese woman and a young child is unsettling and when they appear on screen accompanied by some equally disturbing sound effects it can't help but send chills up and down your spine. However the circumstances in which these characters make their appearances have used up the suspense quotient of this franchise. By now the rules are clear when characters are alone and everything seems normal these beings are popping up somewhere to scare the bejesus out of whoever is on screen and attempt to exact their revenge. It works sometimes but the film fails to make any adjustments to the situations involving these beings and you stop really being surprised by their appearance and begin expecting it. Yes they are creepy but the circumstances that surround them are relatively rote. Suspense works well when you can't predict what is going to happen but in The Grudge 2 after a while it all seems rather familiar.The film's fractured narrative while giving The Grudge 2 some difference from the previous entry works against the film in many ways also. Because it is constantly switching back and forth between three different subplots it is difficult to get attached to any of the characters. Of course as this is a modern horror film the characters are relatively thin to begin with but with the constant cutting between stories it becomes enormously difficult to get a bead on anyone and develop much attachment to them. So when the characters find themselves in peril you have a hard time feeling much sympathy for them. The Grudge 2 also has a plot twist which early on becomes reasonably obvious so when it plays out at the end there isn't much surprise in store.The actors are the usual batch of relative no names for the most part. The girls in the film which is what the stories largely center around do their best to cry scream and shake hysterically and they are all reasonably effective but there is nothing revolutionary being performed. Sarah Michelle Gellar reappears for a relatively small role so she doesn't make much impact and the other major actress Jennifer Beals is also saddled with what almost amounts to a bit part.The Grudge 2 isn't a complete bomb by any means it is more than disturbing enough in moments to provide some general discomfort that horror films should try to apply. However other than some chills here and there The Grudge 2 doesn't offer anything tremendously original or scary resulting in a largely mixed bag.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sequels are a tricky thing. You have to serve the core audience who saw the first film while trying to not prove too bewildering to a new audience that may have not seen the original. Horror films are even more difficult to spin a sequel off from as suspense and scares are often by nature dependent on a lack of expectation from the audience. With The Grudge 2 director Takashi Shimizu and screenwriter Stephen Susco have attempted to not fall into that trap by approaching the sequel a little differently but by the time it's over unfortunately it still proves to be a little too repetitive for its own good.Unlike 2004's The Grudge which unfolded in a largely linear fashion The Grudge 2 shakes things up a bit by splitting the narrative between three different plot lines that all take place at different times. First there is the continuation essentially of the story from the first film where Karen Davis Sarah Michelle Gellar is being kept in a hospital after surviving the ordeal of the first film which centered around a house in Japan where a woman had been killed by her husband and thus created The Grudge a rage that consumes every living being that enters the house. Arriving from America to attempt to retrieve Karen is her sister Aubrey Amber Tamblyn who quickly becomes embroiled in the same situation as Karen. Second is a plot thread featuring Allison Arielle Kebbel an American girl in high school in Japan who is goaded by two classmates to enter the spooky house from the first film and finds that it lives up to its haunted house reputation.

A typical Americanized sequel that sadly didn't follow the unique plot of JuOn 2.After Sarah Michelle Gellar's cameo the movie focuses on her sister but gives her nothing to do. What seems like a totally separate storyline inside an apartment building is more distracting than involving. The scares become very routine and there are so many characters here that the viewer cannot become attached to any of them.The movie does however kick it up in the final twenty minutes or so. And the ending is a lot darker and much more mean spirited than the original and for that it has to earn some points for not taking the safe way out.The Grudge 2 is not a complete loss but it could have been so much better.".

Johnny's Worst of 2006 list meet The Grudge 2.What's going on here? I was under the impression that this was supposed to be a sequel to The Grudge rather than a remake. If that's the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original? This floater doesn't even feel like a movie. It's just a 90minute soundtrack of the weird contortionist chick making that annoying croaking sound.A sound on which I'd recommend you not get me started. It was kind of creepy the first time I heard it but I've heard it about 12367 times since 2004 so it's pretty much run its course. And it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it'd be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie. Sigh.Folks YOU'RE NOT FUNNY SO JUST SHUT UP! I promise you EVERY SINGLE TIME that a character was walking slowly through an empty room which is approximately 97 of the movie somebody in the audience would start it up Uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk. Yes I know that's a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters but you get the gist. So then some dude in the audience would giggle and not to be outdone deliver his own rendition. I was very close to just walking through the audience and punching random people.I told you not to get me started.There's absolutely nothing about The Grudge 2 that I can recommend. There's not a single original scare or idea in the entire film. There's not one memorable acting performance. Are you a Sarah Michelle Gellar fan? Welp enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue. Are you an Amber Tamblyn fan? I hope you can deal with the fact that she's given nothing more to do than walk around looking like she's suffering from a pinched nerve. Can you believe the story if you can call it that is even worse than The Grudge's? At least the original was fairly creepy and boasted a few effective jump scenes. I didn't jump once during this lametrosity yeah I made the word up deal with it. That's right. Not a single time. The scares are so manufactured and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the gotcha moment arrives. Watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess  you're always four or five scenes ahead.There are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. One that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jug. Huh? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot of that during the movie. Laughing. Sighing. Head shaking. Falling asleep I did twice.The movie even makes a 15thhearted attempt at a plot twist. Wow. It's so bad that I don't think we should even dignify it by labeling it a twist. Did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John coming out of the closet.And of course the ending goes the whole nonclosure look we might have another sequel route. As soon as the credits rolled the audience booed. My sentiments exactly. Had the audience paid money for this turd burger then things would have most likely gotten violent and I would've gladly led the charge.We learned from The Grudge that there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage then a curse is left behind. Much like a Ben Affleck movie it's a stain that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred. Well in The Grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a stain on any theater where the movie shows.THE GIST If you're a total wimp and never saw The Grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares. But I strongly recommend saving your money otherwise there's a good chance you'll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge.".

Unfortunately it was nowhere near as good as I had hoped. Of course given the genre and the fact that it was a sequel to a remake and not really a remake of a sequel it was exactly what I expected. Yes I have high hopes but realistic expectations.I prepped myself for this by watching the unrated DVD of the previous film just a few short hours before heading to the theater which in hindsight was probably a mistake. While the first film relied heavily on cheap scares and gotcha moments the second toned it down a little and aimed at being a little more suspenseful. The end result is a chaotic mess with a convoluted storyline that weaves through time without ever indicating it slightly confusing at the start as there is a two year difference between the events we see throughout the film but I will refrain from spoilers.The attempts at building suspense fall flat as every significant event is telegraphed and therefore incredibly predictable even when you're not trying to think ahead of the film's pace. The kills themselves are far from satisfying as they are simply more of the same that we saw the first time around. I'm sorry but even if you have never watched the Asian originals the creepy girl with the hair in her face and the hitch in her step fails to frighten after two Ring films Dark Water Pulse and of course the previous Grudge film.I had seriously hoped that Takashi Shimizu would bring some of his style to the film. Alas we are the real victims here not those portrayed on the screen as we have to pay hardearned dollars to witness yet another American Cinema read Hollywood bastardization of a quality film. When will they learn that the true appeal of Asian cinema lies not with the creepy girl and the cheap scare but with the overall feel of the film?

I feel that much more justice could have been done for this one. Aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be 'discovered' in the ending which if you've already seen JuOn before this you already know the whole movie all it was really was a complete remake of JuOn just more closely followed than The Grudge. Though everyone may have thought that it's coming to America was a bit interesting it was expected as the house burning in the end of The Grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot. Save your 6.50 and wait for this to come out on DVD rent it watch it then decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film. But overall I'd say a 4 out of 10. Sorry Grudge fans it's just...They just failed at this one.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Grudge 2...Let's see. Don't get me wrong I'm not a Japanese Horror Film or Horror or Grudge basher. I loved the first one and the Original JuOn. I feel that much more justice could have been done for this one. Aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be 'discovered' in the ending which if you've already seen JuOn before this you already know the whole movie all it was really was a complete remake of JuOn just more closely followed than The Grudge. Though everyone may have thought that it's coming to America was a bit interesting it was expected as the house burning in the end of The Grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot. Save your 6.50 and wait for this to come out on DVD rent it watch it then decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film. But overall I'd say a 4 out of 10. Sorry Grudge fans it's just...They just failed at this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why this movie gets very poor reviews. My only criticism towards this film is the fact that it just isn't all that scary and shouldn't be in the Horror genre.I understood it. When people say they didn't understand I have to question their intelligence. The whole movie is out of order.There was 3 story arcs. One Arc was very boring. The one with the family in America. Jennifer Beals' storyline. This story starts off with Jennifer Beals' character killing her husband with a fry pan. Then it jumps back before that event happened. Her moving in with him and his children son and daughter. The little boy starts seeing a odd person whom is now living with the Flemings in the apartment down the hall acting very suspicious and he continues to be curious of that person after many odd occurrences.For me I was like what is the purpose of this storyline? As you never saw anyone of this family go into the forsaken 'grudge' house. Of course there is a point to them which you find out in the last maybe 5 minutes of the film. Even though this part of the story arc ties in nicely the movie would have been better without it.Another story arc focuses on a loser nerd Allison Arielle Kebbel who attends an International school in Japan. Two 'cool' girls trick her into going in The Grudge house 2 years after Karen Sarah Michelle Gellar set the house on firethey then trick her into going in the cupboard and close the door. She sees a diary with a strange eye at the front. Then Kayako appears Allison freaks and runs away. After this she starts seeing odd things and begins seeing the school therapist.The Last story arc is Aubrey's The stunning Amber Tamblyn which is set a few days after the event Karen setting the house on fire occurred. She is sent by her mother to bring Karen back to America. In Japan she sees her sister Karen who clearly is now insane in the hospital. There she meets a very handsome Asian Eason Edison Chen who is a reporter and whom also has the grudge curse. On walking out of the hospital Karen falls from the hospital roof and obviously dies. Aubrey is determined to find out what caused her sisters death and Eason helps her. Eason goes back into the house to find out more 'clues'. Aubrey is dragged in there by one of the evil spirits. Towards the end of the film Aubrey goes to see Kayakos mother to see if this will help her the mother tells her everyone is making the curse worse and that it wont be stopped. Aubrey grabs her hand for help and she then experiences a flashback. Kayako's mother then realizes that Aubrey has brought Kayako with her and as Aubrey stands dumbfounded Kayako kills her mother.Throughout the movie people start to go one by one. The two mean school girls the school therapist Eason the parents in America  their daughter and eventually Allison and Aubrey.The story all comes together within the last 10 minutes. It shows Aubrey going into the house. She sees Karen's vision and goes upstairs. The diary from when Allison was in the cupboard flips open revealing the drawn eye becoming real and drags Aubrey into the vision. Takeo the husband who originally killed Kayako kills Aubrey the same way he killed Kayako and she dies of Asphyxia.It then cuts back to when Allison was locked in the cupboard at the beginning of the film revealing that 'Kayako' was really 'Aubrey'. The little boy Jake in America runs out of the apartment after discovering his family's deaths. He finds the 'odd' person from the Flemmings apartment in the hallway. This person is finally revealed to be schoolgirl Allison. Allison is taken by Kayako at the end.Sure the whole movie doesn't make any sense until the 10 remaining minutes but it makes you think. This movie wasn't really a horror film to me. I did not find the little boy who kills people with his wails scary at all. I think they overused him a bit in this film. It was great though to see a horror movie actually have some character building in it though. I really actually cared for Aubrey Allison and Eason. In closing the movie didn't really make any actual ground with the whole 'grudge mystery' and how it can be stopped. It also would have been a lot better if the whole movie focused more on Aubrey's storyline and if Sarah Michelle Gellar had more time on screen in the movie.If your intelligent give it a go. I thought it was alright.".

And god forbid even open the door to another sequel.Yes in this movie The Rage and Fury is on the move. No need to visit the house anymore just be close to someone who when inside and you're done. It's not a curse anymore it's kinda like a virus. Go inside the house get scared return back to USA and spread the joy in your apartment building.It's not that difficult to follow but you just don't really care about anyone. The plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head... Milk anyone?? I saw JuOn 2 at the Fantasia movie festival last summer different story completely but much better than this dud. It's not a remake but this time maybe they should have simply done a remake....If you must see it wait for the DVD.".

Now the bad acting was obviously not present during the scare scenes but every time any of the characters spoke a line I cringed especially in the first scene with the 3 school girls. I also found that Amber Tamblyn gave a bad performance. The only performance that didn't suck was Sarah Michelle Gellar. I think the bad performances can be attributed to the language barrier between the Japanese director and the English speaking cast. And here is what bothered me the most about the movie... How is it that a 70 year old Japanese exorcist who has lived in a very rural area of Japan her whole life and has gone quite crazy learn to speak perfect English?".

The ending was nothing new and about the same like I said it was not a boring movie thanks to the kills however it was only mildly scary here and there and it just seemed to Americanized this time too. Sure all the Japanese horror remakes are a bit but this one was more so. This one was better than the American Ring 2 as I found that one really boring but this one is not nearly as good as its Japanese counterpart JuOn 2 as that one has a hospital scene that has to be seen to believe.

The movie suspense and they might not have lot of visuals effects but Takashi Shimizu knew how to scare us. this is not The Ring ripoff it much much better except for the long hair. but it's maybe Japanese culture. any way the movie was awesome.";

Anyway this movie was terrible. Its the same damn thing that has been made about 50 times in the last 5 years. Its not scary and relies on shock value but even in that its terrible. It uses that same lame stop action camera trick that sucked the first time it was used in The Ring. I saw it on a date and we both walked out 23's through. Save your money go rent Alien.

Set two year after the events of The Grudge left off Aubrey Davis Amber Tamblyn goes to Tokyo to bring her sister Karen Davis Sarah Michelle Gellar back to the United States. However this leads to Aubrey exposing to the same ghost that has plagued Karen. Meanwhile in Tokyo high school students Allison Vanessa and Miyuki visit the haunted house and are also chased by the ghost and in Chicago Trish Jennifer Beals moves into the apartment of her boyfriend Bill Christopher Cousins where paranormal events take place at their nextdoor neighbor's.This movie starts out with Aubrey visiting Tokyo to find her sister Karen and discover what troubling her where we get a taste of suspense that quickly captures the thrills and horror of the first movie. The tension builds when Aubrey also encounters the mysterious events in the house Karen was a caretaker in and what follows are one creepy moment one after the other as main ghosts Kayako Takako Fuji and Toshiro Yuya Ozeki take center stage terrorizing not only Aubrey but two groups of people three high school students and a Chicago family.Takashi Shimizu did a great job directing this sequel which grabs the audience's attention with bonechilling scenes and with moments that make you jump. Like the first movie this sequel has disturbing and creepy images that will stick in your mind after the movie is over. The mysterious yet dramatic atmosphere of the movie created an eerie feeling of the ongoing horror and the builtup suspense which are contributed by the cast members' dramatic acting. However I do feel that the separate story lines involving the different character groups is a distraction to the film and makes it difficult for the viewers to concentrate on a single character. This takes away from the character development and the flow of the plot. Overall this is a movie with the right balance of horror and drama but doesn't surpass its prequel. Grade B".

Surprisingly Amber Tamblyn played her character really well. The other casts look okay for a horror movie. It's a good idea to put a couple of Asian actors because it reminds and gave me the same chill as when I first saw the original JuOn. Sarah Michelle Gellar is on for a short period of time but her scene is as great.It's also a pleasant surprise to find out that this sequel is not a remake of the Japanese sequel. It's a totally new plot and twists. Great new touch from director Shimizu proving that you don't need much gore to make an effective thriller.My only problem is that the trailer showed so many scare details that when you watch the movie you have this I knew that was coming feeling into it which I don't think is good for a horrorsuspense flick. Some of the scenes fell flat and predictable because I already saw it in the teaser. But with that aside Shimizu's new take to the story and the way he executes it is enough to make up for that showy trailer which includes a background on Kayako making her more than just a longhaired whitefaced monster and to some extent making her killings more reasonable.All in all check out this movie. It's not as bad as you think it'll be. I give it a 10 because for a horror movie that's supposed to be cheesy this one is really good.".

The first movie is good enough to be worth it but this sequel does not have the same strength and quality. The script is an unlikely story of haunting involving teenagers and the younger sister of the first film protagonist while the curse almost unbelievably moves to the United States. The story simply never has the credibility or ability to get us involved even though there are several scary moments that remind us of the strength of the first movie. Everything always sounds false and forced. Another bad thing is the poor quality of the cast which doesn't do more than it really has to do. The direction of Takashi Shimizu is relatively acceptable but from the moment the script was written and developed in a bad and unrealistic way the film is irreparably damaged. It's a good movie to see if we're able to ignore the lack of logic and coherence of the story and focus on what we're watching but its far from the first film and probably miles away from the original Japanese.".

Take superheroes for example for each XMan and Spiderman there are Daredevil Elektra Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors e.g. The Ring 2 The Eye Dark Water which was fine but pointless and the grudges.The first Grudge wasn't entirely bad. It was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it. Plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy Men in Black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? For the Grudge 2 the critic goes the same way.Tired scares bad acting except for Amber Tamblyn and clichs all over the place. Three stories take place on different places and time. There is Aubrey Tamblyn investigating what drove her sister Karen Sarah Michelle Gellar to death Allison Arielle Kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. Glad to say and I mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.The chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldn't enter a house others that dig too deep. Meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey doesn't that seem just like another bad Japanese remake something called Pulse? Yeah day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge... against Hollywood bullshits.".

Take superheroes for example for each XMan and Spiderman there are Daredevil Elektra Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring which was pitchperfect mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky to bring a ton of lookalike creepywoman based horrors e.g. The Ring 2 The Eye Dark Water which was fine but pointless and the grudges.The first Grudge wasn't entirely bad.

When he wakes up after a brief period of unconsciousness he turns into a scientific marvel. Nothing is as Davey remembers it but he can't figure out why because he only fell asleep for a brief period.Davey is told that his parents reported the young boy missing in 1978 the evening that he went searching in the woods for his younger brother referring to the incident in the past tense because it is 1985. Only Davey is still exactly the same age and everything he was from 1978 while time has passed for everyone else. His little brother is now his big brother Matt Adler. His parents are old. Everyone is confused and the scientific world find the situation fascinating.The scientists turn Davey into their personal guinea pig running tests and probing him and all that junk. And soon they discover that Davey was abducted. Davey understandably a confused little kid can't figure out what's going on and he sure doesn't want to be locked up in some lab where people prod at him all day long and tell him very little. So he breaks lose and hops aboard the spaceship that took him through time before. While it is an escape from the scientists and their security briefly it also holds the answers to what happened to him. It is also an opportunity for Davey to learn everything from this spaceship. And a kid's movie isn't complete without personifying inanimate objects. The spaceship is essentially controlled by Max which is like it's CPU a CPU with a cool sense of humor who likewise tries to learn about human emotions and condition from his passenger Davey. Filmed around Ft. Lauderdale Florida it is still a cool movie for kids...teenagers...whatever having a little bit of something for everyone. Great humor cool special effects and the like.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Flight of the Navigator' might have been produced in the midEighties but it certainly hasn't lost it's charm over the last twenty years and it does stand up well against more recent family film offerings.The story begins in 1978 with twelveyearold David Freeman a happy allAmerican kid who lives with his loving parents and typically bratty eightyearold brother Jeff. One night he sets off into the woods to look for Jeff only to be knocked unconscious when he falls from a ravine. When David awakes in what seems like hours later to him he discovers actually eight years have passed and it is now 1986. Although he is still twelve years old the world has moved on and even his little brother is older than he is. NASA are very interested in David when his EEG scan reveal readings in the shape of a UFO they have discovered and other scans of the boy result in star charts of distant galaxies being spewed out from the computers. But our hero is determined to return to his family so he breaks free and hides aboard the UFO which holds the key to everything.Joey Cramer gives a likable performance as David a boy who enjoys adventures but ultimately just wants to be with his family. I think anyone watching the film would empathise with his character's anger and sense of helplessness when David discovers NASA have no intention of letting him go home. Matt Adler as sixteenyearold Jeff is another notable actor in the film in the way he depicts his character's uncertainty of dealing with his little big brother and his developing protectiveness towards David. Also look out for a younger Sarah Jessica Parker.For those who watched 'Flight of the Navigator' as children in the Eighties there is definitely a nostalgic feeling to it. However I think children of present day would still enjoy the film as it has a little of everything and issues raised as still relevant andor interesting today such as preteen crushes annoying kid brothers the thrill of following a hero on his 'quest' a fun mentor for the hero even if it is metallic! and arrogant scientisttypes. It is important to remember that this is a children's film aimed very much at an eight to twelveyearold demography so it doesn't delve too deeply but the plot is quite unique the characters are interesting and it is a film that is well puttogether. Certainly one to enjoy with the whole family.".

I am just glad I was able to raise my boys without having them get on the roof to shoot off fireworks. I wonder if Joey has any boys and if they have seen their fathers movies. Young people whose parents were actors have a very unique way to know what their parents were like as kids beside the normal pictures and home movies.".

Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography is by James Glennon and Eric McGraw.Young David Freeman Cramer is out in the woods near his home in Fort Lauderdale when he falls down a ravine and is knocked unconscious. Waking up he finds that the world around him has advanced by 8 years but he hasn't. After being reunited with his overjoyed parents it becomes apparent that David has had an encounter with a extra terrestrial life form which of course greatly interests the authorities...It's a family friendly scifi with a difference in that it doesn't have to take us into space for its tale yet this in no way detracts from how enjoyable Flight of the Navigator is. It is told from young David's perspective with Cramer impressionable thus it firmly engages the kids in the audience. The relationship between David and the Phaleon computer system Reubens engages with witty chatter and educational purpose and the effects work should not be taken for granted either. If we are to be picky then the build up is a touch long before the pic goes extra terrestrial and Cartwright and De Young are barely given time to impact as parents coming to terms with a family life turned upside down. But small complaints really and this is a lovely film one that isn't just for 1980s nostalgists. 710".

So I guess I'm going to p!ss some people off with this review.The first half of this movie is not to mince words great. Even to my middleaged jaded eyes it is a great start. Nicely acted nicely paced and nicely directed  I loved the opening shot and the 2 subsequent UFOs that weren't. David the eldest son of a Standard Disney All American Family slips and falls whilst in the woods one night. Returning home he finds eight years have passed. Simltaniously an alien Space ship has crashed into a power pylon later the NASA scientists studying it discover that David has information in his head that directly links him with the alien space ship. They start to analyse the knowledge that has been placed in his brain...Up until this point the movie has been building up a nice eerie edge The scenes where David is reunited with his family have an emotional punch. There is some real tension building up tension which dissolves almost immediately Sarah Jessica Parker and her obvious plot device on wheels turns up and is only just being built up again when David enters the ship via the obvious plot device on wheels As soon as he steps onto the space ship the whole movie just falls flat on its arse.David just flies about a bit then has the star charts which were for no apparent reasonpumped into his brain during the missing eight years read by the spaceship who managed to loose his copy while crashing into the power line...? What!? Oh come on! This is stupid. Even for a Disney kids movie this is stupid stupid stupid filmmaking. The alien robot ship then turns into a cool talking dude shows him the other 'samples' one of which eats David's hat then belches a particularly thin and annoying 'joke' that seems to amuse American movie directors and no one else. David teaches the spaceship about music  a spacefaring race that has examined dozens of other sentient species can speak English and has never heard of music?. Then they fly about for a bit unable to find Florida. When they do get there via Japan David decides that he wants to attempt to travel back in time to 1987. He travels back in time. He doesn't disintegrate. He is reunited with his family for the second time in the movie. Was it all a dream? No! He still has the cute little orphaned alien he picked up with him.OK maybe I'm being harsh here. It's a kids film after all. But it started out so well. It showed great promise. Then it just copped out the second half of the film is just David flying the ship around. There is no threat no mystery no plot no tension. It's boring. And Max the spaceship was for meafter about 3 minutes a winner of the prestigious JaJa Binks most Annoying Character in a SF Movie of the Year Award.".

Then it just copped out the second half of the film is just David flying the ship around. There is no threat no mystery no plot no tension. It's boring. And Max the spaceship was for meafter about 3 minutes a winner of the prestigious JaJa Binks most Annoying Character in a SF Movie of the Year Award.";

This movie isn't even trying to convey a coherent story.Nonetheless it is a bit disappointing that after the first very strong half the movie kind of drifts into an amusement park ride with the main character just flying around in the alien ship. That may be fun to watch for kids who also like Knight Rider but it's kind of tedious for anybody who's a fan of actual storytelling. Ultimately it's the movie's gimmicky but plot less second half that prevented Flight Of The Navigator from becoming a box office hit let alone a classic like E.T.. That's a bit of a pity since the direction and especially the special effects hold up extremely well to this day and could have made for a much more memorable motion picture.If you like adventure movies with a nostalgic 80's feel to them Flight Of The Navigator will not fail to entertain you on a Saturday afternoon.

The pacing is remarkable this flows and flies smoothly. The writing is good and consistent albeit viewers are required to accept stuff that strains suspension of disbelief. The humor is plentiful with no overdone gags or jokes if repetition and sillinessI could have done without the grossout material even if there isn't that much of it and the fact that it was confined to a single scene are apparent throughout this and the entire thing partially also clear in the tone while that isn't that bothersome is directed at children. I must admit that it is done with care. The cinematography and editing are talented. The effects are fantastic and not just for the time with realistic reflection and fluid motion. There is a little language in it maybe harsh at least considering who its intended audience is. There is nothing else that parents may deem inappropriate for their offspring save for a couple of actions that can be imitatedand definitely shouldn't be.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm one of the few here to comment on this movie who didn't see it as a child. I din't see this until sometime in the 1990's when I was in my 40's and it came on the Disney channel so I decided to check it out. I was surprised that it was a Disney movie as most Disney films are pretty well advertised but I had never heard of this before. A Disney family film geared for kids wouldn't have brought me into a theater to see it anyway so if I did hear about I just dismissed it and forgot about it. In the story a 12 year old boy is somehow abducted by aliens and transported hundreds of light years from earth to their planet and then sent back in what amounts to only four hours of his life but on earth eight years have passed and the late 1970's kid finds himself back home in the mid 1980's. The movies first half is darker and more thought provoking and grabs your attention but then the movie becomes light and silly but that's OK as it's a good movie. Randal Kleiser directs. He had a big hit with Blue Lagoon and an even bigger one that he will always be remembered for in Grease but has had a lot of bad movies in his career. Although this is dated it has more of that enduring quality to it like his film Grease has. Kleiser's brother Jeffrey Kleiser is among a team of noted special effects and visual effects creators on this film including Ron Goodman Bret Mixon and Peter Donen. Joey Cramer whose acting career never materialized stars in an ensemble cast that includes Sarah Jessica Parker Veronica Cartwright Howard Hessman and the voice of Paul Reubens. This is a good family fantasy adventure movie and worth a look. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was during the spring of 1995 while on vacation in Fort Lauderdale that I read an eerie headline in the SunSentinel.  An elderly woman was dying of cancer and she proclaimed that she wished to see her son one last time. What makes the story eerie is that her son disappeared from the Fort Lauderdale area in 1978 just like David Scott Freeman in Flight of the Navigator.  On the morning of July 5 1978 Helen and Bill Freeman Veronica Cartwright and Cliff DeYoung awoke to learn that their son David Joey Cramer was missing.  Eight years later in 1986 he returned not having aged a minute.  Meanwhile a flying saucer from the planet Phelan has landed on earth.  It was later determined that all of its starcharts and artificial intelligence have escaped into David's brain.  A team of NASA scientists led by Dr. Faraday Howard Hesseman is determined to research the connection between the alien ship and the time travelling David.  Will David remain a lab rat for the rest of his life or will he escape to freedom?  There's only one way to find out and that is by watching the movie.  Perhaps there are several themes to this movie.  Many families have lived with the tragedy of missing their children and retrieving them is an arduous and time consuming task that often goes unfulfilled.  It can also be seen as a story of alienation someone mired in 1978 may face if he were to suddenly awake in 1986.  During those eight years as David learned his family moved and aged Jimmy Carter was voted out of office Starsky and Hutch went off the air four new kinds of CocaCola hit the shelves some girls began to dye their hair purple and an allmale group named Twisted Sister replaced the Bee Gees as the most popular band of the time.  Take note of the cameo appearances of Sarah Jessica Parker as NASA assistant Carolyn McAdams and of Paul Reubens as the voice of Max.  To answer your question Chad Perman Joey Cramer is alive and well and living in Vancouver.  Having visited South Florida several times I can add one last message of the movie.  It really does feel like eight years when you travel up the I95 instead of taking the Turnpike!".

But I think I can just forgive that. If you are into Disney Family movies and you are into characters meeting new friends but having to leave them for some reason you will enjoy this movie. This movie could be the spiritual sequel to E.T. The Extra Terrestrial along with many other movies that can be it's spiritual predecessor and successor in Disney movies.A 12 year old boy David Freeman was on his way to search for his little brother who would be returning from his friends house and would be going to the woods. David's mother thought that would be dangerous so David should have to get him. David falls into a ditch only to be awoken eight years later. David finds out that this is all because of some extra terrestrial plot and he ends up going on a space ship with a robot. This video is fun for the whole family! What's even better I'm pretty sure that this would be great to look at on a HDTV.What disgusted me or what I should say I disliked because they weren't really disgusting was the following scenes I would say. David eventually attempts to teach the robot laughter music and the robot eventually reads David's mind and starts talking like a child. This aggravated me and I found the robot to be a little annoying and not very serious. But I also found this to be quite entertaining. Eventually the robot will get back to his normal self in the end but at the very end the robot talks like a child again. I also hated that this featured annoying words such as dork geek etc. But you should remember that this was in the 1980s and this is a Disney movie.I recommend this movie for all. Well not for all. There are a few cussing but it's not common. So far I remember hearing the SH word and probably even the D word that ends with mn and I've also heard the word Hell. If you don't want to have to spend a few seconds or a minute explaining to your child what that is don't bother letting that child watch this movie or just don't tell that child what it means. Those words are not common! I hope you enjoy the movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I will tell you right from the start that this review will be incredibly biased because this has always been one of my favorite films since I was a little boy. I know it probably realistically pulls off a 810 MAX no Pun intended but for myself and for anyone who can let go of their reality and witness a terrific science fiction adventure as though you were 12 years old will not be disappointed. The Flight of The Navigator was dead center of the eighties film craze that saw brilliant scifi fantasy epics like Star Trek movies Back To The Future Short Circuit E.T. Batteries Not Included Gremlins...the eighties was a film genre of it's own. This film fits right into that genre perfect and delivers an experience unlike anything ever seen. This was before the days of CGI enhanced films and special effects that were computer generated and in a day and age where things had to be done by hand and puppets. Director Randal Kleiser did something amazing with the budget effects cast and story and created a mesmerizing adventure that I think is one of his more under rated works next to his hit cult classics Grease and The Blue Lagoon.Young star Joey Cramer does a brilliant job as David Freeman the older brother and typical 'almost' teenager who is sent into a terrifying and yet amazing world where everyone around him has aged nearly ten years except him and he meets a friend that's out of this world. Cramer is in some ways the typical 'Disney' kid. But anyone can relate to him and his world and they do such an amazing job of capturing how this experience would feel finding yourself launched ten years into the future but having not aged a single day. You'll recognize regular character actors Veronica Cartwright and Cliff De Young as David's parents both of them doing a great job with their smaller roles and carrying the incredible effect of having aged past their son. A young and very cute Sarah Jessica Parker plays the friendly Carolyn McAdams who befriends David at the NASA research facility and Howard Hesseman is decent in his small role as the lead researcher at NASA who wants to study and protect David at once. Matt Adler is David's older brother but younger technically. Finally although credited at the end as 'Paul Mall' Trimaxion or Max as he's known is voiced by none other than Paul 'Pee Wee' Reubans who you can't miss as the voice. Nowadays the voice of Pee Wee Herman comes across as almost annoying and is more of a bad joke than anything but this film was released when Pee Wee Herman was all the rage and Reubans was a star to children. I almost found Max's voice annoying this time around but it never bothered me as a kid. Most of the parts in the film with the exception of David and Max are fairly small but everyone does a great job and carry the film wonderfully.One of the truly brilliant things about Flight of The Navigator is their is NO antagonist no villains. There are perhaps character with questionable motives but the entire film works without a villain. Instead the film relies on the quest for this boy to find his place in a world moved on without him and to figure out where he's been. Scenes of true brilliance include the actual flight once the ship escapes the creatures inside Max all waiting to be returned home and Max and David swaying and dancing to The Beach Boys...all classic Disney film. The Flight of The Navigator is a sure fire hit with kids and kids at heart. If you've never taken in the adventure...well you need to!! 910".

	schema:headline " An underrated Amicus horror anthology!";
	schema:reviewBody "TORTURE GARDEN is the second in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series this would make eight movies. Although that movie is very different from the others.I look upon the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong.TORTURE GARDEN is a very misleading title for this movie because there is no torture and no garden.The movie has been unfairly maligned by IMDb users. I will put up an argument in its defence.The linking story in this movie is easily one of the best found in Amicus anthologies. It provides a long but highly interesting introduction that had me hooked from the first moment. Burgess Meredith gives a truly magnificent performance as the sinister showman Dr. Diabolo. He persuades a group of fairground visitors that he can show them real horror. Four of the visitors have their futures predicted and this constitutes the framework for the stories.The first story sees Michael Bryant as a somewhat opportunistic young man who allows his uncle to die just so he can get his hands on his money. The uncle has a mysterious cat that leaves coins behind every time someone is killed. Bryant ends up going on a mini killing spree to get the money. In the end he goes crazy and is locked up. He thinks he's free of the cat but is he? Watch and see. This story provides a solid start to the movie. Michael Bryant gives a great performance as a greedy man who is driven to insanity.The second story takes a very different course to the first. In this quirky tale Beverly Adams plays an actress determined to find out why other actors manage to stay young. This story is very much maligned. I admit that one really has to suspend disbelief when viewing this story but I found it entertaining and Miss Adams looked very glamorous in her part.The third story sees Barbara Ewing as a journalist falling in love with a pianist played by John Standing. This strange piano with a mind of its own becomes jealous of their affair and decides to do something about it. This is easily the weakest story in the movie. It not only requires suspension of disbelief but is mostly boring to sit through. The end is unintentionally funny but not really entertaining enough to endure the rest of the story for. John Standing is very bland in his role and his performance is flat and lifeless. However he can't really be blamed for that given the absurd story he has to work with. Barbara Ewing fares better giving everything she's got but even she can't save this story.The final story and easily the best puts the movie back on track. Jack Palance is a fanatic of Edgar Allan Poe's work. He meets a fellow fanatic played by the late great Peter Cushing. Cushing lets him into a secret  Poe has come back from the dead and is writing new stories. The finale of this story is very confusing but interesting to watch. Jack Palance does little more than stand around smoking a pipe in this and the linking story. Another IMDb user has stated on the comments page that Christopher Lee would have been a better choice for the role. I certainly agree with that analogy.Freddie Francis directs the material he is given very well adding a particularly unique effect at the end of each story. When the transition is made from a story back to the linking story a pair of scissors is seen and heard cutting a ribbon. This creates the effect of snapping both the character and the audience out of what is presented as a kind of nightmare. Some excellent camera angles in the first story help to make it seem more macabre than it really is. Some intelligent editing is employed in the third story to try covering up its absurdity.Overall TORTURE GARDEN has its flaws but is a mustsee for fans of the Amicus anthologies fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies. If my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes check it out. You'll enjoy it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Diablo a carnival horrors man shows five people a special entertainment in a private showing.  Each person looks carefully at the scissors held by a mannequin of one of the Greek fates and soon sees a fate that may or may not come to pass.  These visions serve as the basis of the movie as we are entertained to four story adaptations of Robert Bloch stories.  The first man sees a story about greed and a witch's familiar. The second story deals with androidlike beings in Hollywood the third story with a malicious piano.  The last story is based on Bloch's story The Man Who Collected Poe and is about one man's obsession with the master of the macabre.  All four stories are brought to screen with care and style thanks in part to the workmanlike direction of Francis.  Burgess Meredith is exceptionally good as the devious Dr. Diablo in the frame story.  The last story is the best and is highlighted by fine performances by both Peter Cushing and Jack Palance.

Each person looks carefully at the scissors held by a mannequin of one of the Greek fates and soon sees a fate that may or may not come to pass.  These visions serve as the basis of the movie as we are entertained to four story adaptations of Robert Bloch stories.  The first man sees a story about greed and a witch's familiar.

For those willing to stick around and pay 5 pounds more awaits the shock of a lifetime  with a money back guaranty! This is an anthology comprised of four stories plus a wraparound the wraparound is the 'inbetween' story that ties the rest together. I love anthologies both for the hits and the misses my general feeling is that about half of the stories work and the others not so well.The first story features a man very much in debt but a fair bit of luck comes his way after his uncle dies with a little help nonetheless. Turns out the man is the sole beneficiary of his uncle's inheritance but it comes with a few strings attached one being a cat with an unusual diet and psychic powers.The second story features a comely woman who would do anything to make it in the movie business including betraying her roommate. She soon learns of a group within the business who never seem to age and will do anything to protect their secret think Death Becomes Her. The third tale involves a female musical journalist doing a piece on a famed pianist. The two hit it off and a whirlwind romance ensues. However problems arise due to the strange relationship between the man and his piano extra points for the obscure reference to the ancient Greek muse Euterpe! The fourth story is the best of the bunch and it features two extremely avid Edgar Allan Poe collectors. Turns out the Poepassion runs in the family as the one man's grandfather started accumulating Poe memorabilia which his father followed and now he is doing. The other man is envious bur soon discovers there's more to this collection that meets the eye.Amicus did produce a number of different type films including horror The Psychopath which I rated 7 out of 10 and some science fiction They Came From Beyond Space and The Terrornauts.However the production company's strength was the horror anthology. Overall the stories in TORTURE GARDEN aren't very horrific or very shocking but they do provide some disturbing atmosphere and there's a lot of fun to be had here.".

The stories are held together by Dr. Diabolo Burgess Meredith  the owner of a circus sideshow. For an extra charge he'll show you something really frightening. Each patron is presented with a vision of what may or may not happen in the future.The first vision deals with a man who has inherited a cat that turns out to be a witch's familiar. The cat can make the man rich and asks only to be fed in return. The problem is that the cat has developed a taste for humans. Very effective story with several thrills along the way. 710 The second story concerns a woman who will do anything to succeed in Hollywood. Well almost anything. When she discovers that many of Hollywood's elite are androids she balks at the thought of voluntarily becoming one of them. Not overly effective with little or no moments of horror. The saving grace of this story is the beautiful Beverly Adams  who will always be Lovey Kravezit in Dean Martin's Matt Helm movies. 410 The third vision is the worst. A girl is killed by a piano for coming between it and its owner. I think this is the only killer piano movie I've ever seen. Very silly premise. 210 The fourth vision is by far the most entertaining. Peter Cushing and Jack Palance star as Poe fanatics. In fact Cushing is such a fanatic that he has Poe himself as part of his collection. The acting in this story is as expected excellent. Palance holds his own with the horror legend Cushing. The sets are extremely well done for a film of this type. This story could have been fleshed out to make a good full length film. 910 Overall some hits and some misses.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is not very much to add here. Torture Garden is entertaining and has a good amount of atmosphere and some good performances but is also a rather uneven film and there are stronger Amicus anthology films around understandably as this was a reasonably early effort for them. Also agree with the general consensus that the first and last segments are the best and the second and third come up short.The story linking the four segments is mostly very well done it's suspenseful it's fun intriguingly written ties the segments beautifully and succinctly and it has the bonus of having Burgess Meredith playing his tailormade role with delicious relish. Some might find that the carnival setting's somewhat gaudy but to me that was effective it suited the atmosphere and carnivals are so in the first place anyway to an extent. It is a shame though that Diablo's real identity was a little too obvious and the ending can be smelt a mile off.Of the four segments The Man Who Collected Poe comes off the most successfully. It is very macabre very intelligently written and has a good deal of suspense. It is also the bestlooking segment of the four with the Gothic atmosphere evoked wonderfully. Jack Palance is devilishly enjoyable here he's overthetop but also very menacing vintage Palance really. Peter Cushing proves himself to be a great contrast a more subtle performance but very dignified and urbane. Enoch has a very creepy ambiance and doesn't go through the motions at all with the scares. The cat didn't look too cute personally and does bring the right amount of chills as the antagonist of the story.Conversely Terror over Hollywood and particularly Mr. Steinway don't fare anywhere near as strongly. Terror over Hollywood at least had a very intriguing subject but it descend into weird silliness often and while striking Beverly Adams is rather too pretty and lightweight for the overambitious diva when she does try to bring some menace or hard edge it feels very forced. Mr. Steinway is very dull from the get go and goes so overkill in the absurdity factor that it is really difficult to take seriously or be scared by it only the piano's unsettling final attack prevents it from completely falling apart. John Standing is also rather bland here.Visually Torture Garden's not one of the betterlooking Amicus anthology productions and it's less than beautifullooking but it doesn't look too cheap at all either. In fact it's very competently made and gives off a very nice atmosphere. Some of the sets are a touch tacky with the exception of The Man Who Collected Poe and the appropriate carnival setting and the editing occasionally may lack slickness but it's very stylishly shot that takes maximum Gothic effect to imaginative heights and the lighting's not too garish in fact the use of colour is very like watching a Mario Bava film. James Bernard's score is rousing haunting and thrillingly booming Robert Bloch's script is skillful and combines many horror elements with wit and creepy atmosphere without feeling too overstuffed and Freddie Francis directs engagingly at least for the first and last segments and the linking story. And while the acting in Torture Garden is very varied Palance Cushing and Meredith are incredibly strong and are more than enough to make one stick with the film.Overall entertaining and abovedecent but uneven with one outstanding segment one great segment and two misfires along with a compelling story linking them together. Worth seeing also for the strong performances from Palance Cushing and Meredith. 6.510 Bethany Cox".

This is the second of their portmanteau films following Dr. Terror's House of Horrors. This isn't their best but it's still entertaining. It's written by Robert Bloch and directed by Freddie Francis.

Later he discovers the bizarre source of his uncle's wealth a telepathic cat named Balthazar with a peculiar appetite. A weird but unique tale. The next story Terror Over Hollywood is the weakest. An ambitious and unlikable actress discovers the secret of how movie stars stay so youthfullooking. Lame. The third story is Mr. Steinway about a reporter who becomes involved with a concert pianist. Too bad his piano is the jealous type! A little silly but fun. Finally there's The Man Who Collected Poe which is about two Edgar Allan Poe collectors Jack Palance Peter Cushing and the extremes they go to for the sake of their obsession. This is my favorite story in the film.The linking story has a sideshow showman named Dr. Diablo Burgess Meredith taking five people into a back room where they get to see their future. This leads into the other stories and finishes the movie with the expected twist about Diablo that while amusing will surely surprise no one. The best stories are the first and the last but the linking story is fun in its way due to Burgess Meredith's performance. As I said this isn't one of Amicus' better horror anthologies but it isn't bad either. The segments are interesting and feel fresh not just rehashes of older stories. It's a good timepasser.".

	schema:reviewBody "Torture Garden starts with the opening credits running over various shots of a funfair where we finally settle on one of the attractions called the 'Torture Garden'. Inside Dr. Diabolo Burgess Meredith shows his paying customers various phony horrors like execution by decapitation  electric chair for 5 that's expensive even now! he also allows anyone brave enough to witness 'real horror'. Five people take him up on his offer Dr. Diabolo takes them backstage where a dummy named Atrobus is claimed to be the 'Goddess of destiny'  holds the 'shears of fate' in her hand which have the ability to cut people's life threads short or something like that. Dr. Diabolo invites everyone to look at Atrobus Clytie Jessop sitting as still as she can  retrieve a memory of the future. First up is Colin Williams Micheal Bryant in a story called Enoch...Collin's uncle Roger Maurice Denham is dying. Collin's uncle Roger is rich  Collin wants the money. Collin's uncle dies before he can extract the required information about where the money is hidden out of him. Collin searches the cottage  discovers a coffin with a skeleton  black cat inside buried in the cellar. This particular black cat has certain tastes  uses a stash of gold as leverage to get what it wants...Then it's Carla Hayes Beverly Adams turn in Terror Over Hollywood...Carla is an ambitious would be actress in Hollywood. While on a date with a producer named Mike Charles David Bauer she is introduced to leading man Bruce Benton Robert Hutton why does the IMDb list his character name as Paul? whom she falls in love with especially after he gets her the leading role opposite him in his latest film. Carla quickly discovers that not everything is as it seems  Bruce has a dark secret connected with the mysterious Dr. Heim Bernard Kay...Next up is Dorothy Endicott Barbara Ewing in a tale called Mr. Steinway...Dorothy is a journalist who has just finished interviewing the world famous pianist Leo Winston John Standing whom both quickly fall in love with each other. However when she tries to separate him form his Grand Piano named Utopie the 'Goddess of music' it becomes jealous of Dorothy...Finally it's Ronald Wyatt Jack Palance in The Man Who Collected Poe...Ronald Wyatt visits fanatical Edgar Allan Poe collector Lancelot Canning Peter Cushing who when drunk shows Wyatt his collection of unpublished Poe. But the date 1966 on the paper makes Wyatt suspicious who ends up making a shocking discovery...Then we're back to the funfair as the fifth person Gordon Roberts Micheal Ripper provides one last twist of his own or does he...?Directed by Freddie Francis I thought Torture Garden is easily the weakest of the Amicus horror anthologies out of Dr. Terror's House of Horrors 1964 The House that Dripped Blood 1970 Tales From the Crypt 1972 Asylum 1972 From Beyond the Grave 1973  The Vault of Horror 1973 all of which are far superior to Torture Garden. The script by Robert Bloch presents four very poor stories. None of them can be described as horror particularly they are too slow  have little in the way of a payoff at they're ends. Each story is far too predictable  provide little in the way of 'twist' endings which anthology stories need to make them work. The stories just aren't effective I mean a story with a killer piano? Hardly scary is it? In fact I was trying hard not to laugh as director Francis tried to make a Grand piano seem frightening  menacing. Mr. Steinway is perhaps the poorest story I've seen in any Amicus horror anthology I thought Enoch was the best of a bad bunch here as it had more in the way of horror than the rest although a policeman's reaction to a headless body is somewhat puzzling. On a positive note at least none of the stories last that long so it's not overly boring. There is no real blood or gore to speak of. The film was obviously shot in sets which vary from looking very fake to others which are quite nicely decorated. Director Francis doesn't do much with the limited material  Torture Garden is a bland  forgettable film which has little in the way of style even if some of the colour schemes are very late 60's you may want to put on a pair of sunglasses at certain points. Torture Garden has not dated well at all check the clothes out I mean Peter Cushing in a purple cardigan? The acting is OK but Meredith hams it up like you wouldn't believe  is quite fun to watch a special mention goes to Cushing who really does deserve better than films such as this. Overall I was extremely disappointed with Torture Garden as I usually love anthologies especially the Amicus ones. Average at best  for Amicus anthology completest's like myself only.".

	schema:reviewBody "The British anthology horror film dates from the classic Dead Of Night to its last gasp thirtyfive years later with The Monster Club.  From around 1965 to 1975 Amicus was the most productive studio within this subgenera. Torture Garden was one of its earlier and lesser efforts even though it was directed by cinematographer turned director turned cinematographer Freddie Francis and written by Robert Bloch who also wrote Psycho.  Better entries include Dr. Terror's House Of Horror Vault Of Horror and From Beyond The Grave.The titular Torture Garden is a fairground sideshow hosted by the flamboyant Dr. Diablo subtlety not his strong point.  It seemingly consists of a waxworks display but for an extra 'cost' patrons are allowed into the backroom the 'torture garden' proper.  Here a statue of a Greek mythological figure Atropos holding shears ! and strands of thread has the ability to predict the future of the hapless punter.  Diablo coaxes five customers into this chamber to be scryed each premonition being one of the stories in the film.The first notable aspect of the film is its transAtlantic cast.  Most are British including the ubiquitous Peter Cushing but Burgess Meredith stars as Diablo it's actually the best horror I've seen in him and one of the patrons is played by Jack Palance not someone you'd readily associate with horror films.Secondly only the final story and the linking story thanks to Meredith's camp performance really succeed.  The first three stories albeit reasonable are too predictable and as a result lack any real surprises or menace.  Admittedly the final story can also be sussed out early on its raison d'tre is hinted at but its secret is so outlandish that the overall effect is not spoilt.  Cushing and the obsessive Palance help contribute to this section building up a palpable sense of doom.  At first I thought the story would be another retelling of Poe's The Cask Of Amontillado but happily it was different and strikingly original.spoilers to endThe first two patrons readily deserve their fate viewer sympathy is not at a premium.  The third patron could be considered innocent a rarity for such a film but it is hinted at that she is a 'golddigger'.  Finally Palance's fanatical collector invokes little sympathy his sins surmounting to that of the initial patron.  Perhaps a more likeable set of customers would have engaged the viewer more.The film has numerous daft moments.  These include the vivid red 'paint' used for blood the fact that two characters who had no intention of eating at a restaurant still ordered food and drink for themselves anyway and the actress who played the statue who could hardly keep still she was twitching and breathing continually.  Finally the 'smooth' bit of editing at the end for the final 'scare' is just priceless.  To finish any film that pokes fun at the 'Masonic' like inner world of filmmaking and has a moving killer piano ! is alright in my book.".

In his dissection of mad scientist films he states Each decade has it's stock menace an expert in fantasy and grim humor who becomes Hollywood's resident monster and mad scientist. In the 20's it was Lon Chaney in the 50's Vincent Price. He is very true. Often the horror actors were tapped as villains in nongenre offerings and added a flavor of black comedy to serious films often with actor collaborations being laugh riots. But if this is true for horror stars it is also true in the opposite way for nongenre stars like John Carradine Claude Rains and Herbert Lom who often found themselves booted up to 'honorary horror star' status when cast in a genre offering not typical of their output.Well to that list you can add Burgess Meredith and Jack Palance. Who both made for great villains in nongenre offerings and as either heroes or villains in horror subgenres like scifi and costumed heroes. And best of all both actors are at their best here.Five carnival attendeesincluding Palance and British horror mainstay Michael Ripperenter the chamber of the snide showman Dr. Diablo Meredith having the time of his lifewho reveals to them their future by having them gaze into the pruning shears'Torture GARDEN' get it? of a statue of the goddess Atropos. What follows are four stories written by Robert Bloch.The first story based off Bloch's 'Enoch' features a scoundrel who tricks his wealthy unclean amusing cameo by Maurice Denhaminto having a heart attack only to end up discovering the source of his uncle's wealth in the form of a demon cat. This story is rather boring on first viewing but on second viewing the creepy menace builds and one ends up taking in all the little moments of foreshadowing. It's excellent even if the cat is too cute to be menacing. Once hated this story now it's a fave.The second story features a btchy wannabe actressBeverly Adamswho ends up discovering the secret of the Hollywood Ten while trying to seduce a handsome but aging Clark Gable type. Often criticized for it's pacing this segment has a satiric quality that in today's world of plastic surgery for celebrities isn't far off. Ends with a typical Bloch pun.The thirdand worst story features another btchy seductress who tries to seduce a piano player only to run afoul of his piano???possessed by his mother. The ending seems to suggest that it was a real murder committed by the insane hallucinating pianist or is that what they want the onlookers in the story to think? The whole 'posessionimpersonationhallucination' thing combined with the dead nagging mother reminds me of 'Psycho'. Bloch must have really hated his mom. I salute him for that. But this story just sucks. Thankfully it ends soon.The fourth final and best story while a poor adaption of Bloch's story 'Man who collected Poe' is still excellent. Good enough to warrant it's own film. Jack Palance plays Roland Wyatt an obnoxious collector who befriends a necromancerPeter Cushing who collects Poe memorabilia. The references to 'Fall of the House of Usher'and 'Cask of Amontillado' are fun to spot. Palance and Cushing are outstanding as usual. I won't spoil any more of it.'Torture Garden' is no masterpiece but it has many amusing moments great performances from as I said two 'honorary horror stars' a great cameo by Peter Cushing eerie carnival music and lots to enjoy on repeat viewings. It's arguably the worst of Amicus's anthologies but it's still essential viewing for any trueblooded horror fan.".

The top notch cast makes it a worthy viewing John Phillips Michael Ripper Bernard Kay David Bauer Niall MacGinnis Hedger Wallace Clytie Jessop and Timothy Bateson also appear. It's also noteworthy for having American stars Palance and Meredith be top billed. It's not the best of the Amicus anthologies but it's not bad at all either.Seven out of 10.".

A group of assorted people visit a macabre fairground attraction  'Torture Garden'  where they meet 'Dr.Diabolo'  Burgess Meredith  an odd little man who promises to reveal their futures to each of them in turn. All they have to do is stand before a waxwork of Atropos  The Goddess Of Destiny  Clytie Jessop   and all will be revealed.Colin Williams  the excellent Michael Bryant  murders his rich uncle Roger  Maurice Denham  and is then plagued by a strange cat called Balthazar which keeps ordering him to kill.Sexy aspiring starlet Carla Hayes  Beverly Adams  uncovers the existence of a secret Hollywood elite  movie stars who have preserved their good looks by being turned into robots by Dr.Heim  Bernard Kay . Rather than kill her to keep her quiet Heim gives her the same treatment.Dorothy Endicott  Barbara Ewing  becomes secretary to a worldfamous pianist  John Standing  only to fall in love with him incurring the wrath of his deceased mother who has been reincarnated  if you can believe this  as a piano.Ronald Wyatt  Jack Palance  is an avid book collector in particular the works of Edgar Allan Poe.

Finding unpublished works on modern paper Wyatt demands to know where they came from. The answer is startling. Canning has managed to resurrect Poe from the dead...Once the stories are over there is a final twist concerning the true identity of Dr.Diabolo.This is not a bad collection at times it resembles the Hammer television series 'Journey To The Unknown'. As is usually the case in movies such as this the stories themselves are a mixed bag  the first and last ones are the best while the third is absolute rubbish  if you can restrain yourself from laughing as Barbara Ewing is murdered by a piano you're made of stronger stuff than I am . Story number two is 'Twilight Zone' style science fiction and sticks out like a sore thumb. The last one is my favourite with Palance hamming it up as a man obsessed with Edgar Allan Poe. You can feel his envy as Canning shows him round his private collection. Cushing is as ever excellent. And good old Penguin himself  Burgess Meredith  is always watchable.'Atropos' appears in all four stories  keep an eye out for her.Bloch wrote two more movies in similar vein for Amicus  'The House That Dripped Blood'  1970  and 'Asylum'  1971 .".

It had been preceded by Dr. Terror's House of Horrors and would soon be followed by The House That Dripped Blood Asylum Tales From the Crypt Vault of Horror and From Beyond the Grave. Here a carnival attraction the eponymous Torture Garden is run by the leering taunting Dr. Diabolo played with Penguinlike juiciness by Burgess Meredith.

More scifi than horror this section fails to scare but is fun nonetheless. In the film's weakest tale Mr. Steinway a jealous piano takes vengeance on its composer's new lover. A tad silly this segment still manages to elicit some shivers when Euterpe the piano commences to play that funeral march. In The Man Who Collected Poe easily the best of the bunch here Jack Palance eliminates Peter Cushing to possess himself of an incredible assortment of Poe memorabilia and gets a lot more than he bargained for. Palance's overthetop performance contrasts nicely here with Cushing's customary urbanity and the segment is filled with all kinds of neat directorial touches from Freddie Francis. In all four fun tales from the pen of Robert Psycho Bloch if a touch off the mark as compared to some of those other Amicus anthology titles. The film's final moments will be a surprise to only the slowest of viewers but still provide good devilish fun. Do You Dare See What Dr. Diabolo Sees? the film's poster asked back in 1967.

	schema:reviewBody "Amicus is legendary for producing a variety of Horror omnibuses in the 60s and 70s such as Dr. Terror's House of Horror 1965 The House That Dripped Blood 1970 Asylum 1972 From Beyond The Grave 1973 or The Vault of Horror 1973. After Dr Terror's House of Horrors Torture Garden of 1967 was the second Horror anthology produced by Amicus but besides the very lame Monster Club 1980 which was barely saved by the great Vincent Price it is also the least recommendable one. This is not to say that Torture Garden is a bad film though  on the contrary it is vastly entertaining if one is looking for cheesy spooky fun it just isn't scary and I would recommend all the other Amicus anthologies I've seen except for Monster Club over this one.Torture Garden begins in an amusement park where Dr. Diablo Burgess Meredith performs a macabre show. After seeing such spectacles as wax puppets executed on the electric chair the visitors of Dr. Diablo's show one of them played by Jack Palance! are invited to experience 'real' terror  a foresight in their possible futures... Overall the film has a nice atmosphere but too little suspense. The first three stories are pretty forgettable especially the second is extremely silly and not even remotely scary. It is merely the fourth story Jack Palance's segment which also stars icon Peter Cushing which saves the film.The first story takes place in an old mansion where a man who is keen on his uncle's wealth encounters a sinister cat. The story is completely unoriginal but at least it is macabre and has some atmosphere. The second story which revolves around a girl who wants to become famous in the film business and the third story which is about an 'eerie' piano are really REALLY silly even though I won't deny that the third one has some atmosphere too.It is merely the very moody creepy and macabre fourth tale which makes this film worth watching. The last and best segment should be interesting to all Horror fans as it is a great little tale about the writings of the almighty Edgar Allen Poe starring Jack Palance and the great Peter Cushing both of whom play fanatic Poecollectors...The last segment is creepy and great and would easily deserve a rating of 8 out of 10 but overall one good segment does not quite make up for three cheesy and amusing but mediocre ones. Torture Garden is entertaining enough for fans of Horror omnibuses but I'd recommend most other Amicus anthologies especially the excellent House That Dripped Blood over this one. Positive points are a nice atmosphere and look but overall Torture Garden is just OK.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amicus studios are well known for producing a lot of the very best horror anthologies throughout the sixties and seventies films like Vault of Horror The House that Dripped Blood and Asylum are often well revered among horror fans and rightly so but this earlier effort doesn't live up to the studio's good name. I actually had really high hopes going into this one as I was initially attracted to the obscure title and once I found out that the film is an omnibus made by Amicus I was sold. More pleasing elements include the fact that the cast features names such as Jack Palance Michael Ripper and of course Peter Cushing made the film seem like more of a possible overlooked classic and I was finally sold on the fact that it was directed by the experienced Freddie Francis who directed a number of the best films that Hammer had to offer in the sixties. However the stories on display here mostly lack tension and any real scares and despite the fact that none of them are particularly brilliant they also vary a lot in quality and the film just doesn't come together very well.The wraparound story here revolves around a circus the star attraction at which is a show in which the proprietor a Dr. Diabolo tells his customers that he can show them 'real horror'. Cue four tales in which a dummy at the show shows four people their fates. Omnibus films often don't start with the best tale and so I was unfazed when the first story  which revolves around a man who wants his inheritance from uncle but actually ends up inheriting his uncle's cat didn't really deliver the goods. The next story is the strangest and least fitting of the four and takes in SciFi themes. It has something to do with Hollywood performers being preserved in order to achieve fame. Despite not being very good it's slightly better than the first story. The third tale is the weakest and revolves around a piano while the film saves the best until last and we follow someone who discovers a collector of Poe's works and his source... I really liked the style of this film but the atmosphere isn't matched by any tension  and I have to admit that I was more than a little bored by the end. The conclusion to the wraparound doesn't offer much in the way of interest either  and I will say that if you're looking for an Amicus omnibus this one isn't the best of them.".

	schema:headline " Only good if you loved Formel Eins back then.";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me say that the film is of course not about the famous auto racing competition but about a pretty successful German television show back then that focused on music for the most part the disco scene that includes acts and performers like Nena. And just like she got her own movie so does Formel Eins. It runs for slightly over 90 minutes and is one of the most known works by director Wolfgang Bld who is also one of the writers here. There is a bit of a behindthescenes feeling to this one as many performers in here play themselves such as host Ingolf Lck but also talented singers like Meat Loaf or Falco. You can of course argue how good they are when it comes to acting but the fact that they are still themselves probably saves them a bit. However one group who isn't saved at all are the Toten Hosen one of Germany's defining rock music bands for ages. And while I am not a great fan of their music either I must say their acting is even on a completely other level of how shockingly bad it is. They come off like clowns to be honest not hitting a single right note but constantly being over the top and they aren't even in many scenes but they are so bad that it leaves a lasting impression.Besides that there is also a story of course. It is about a young woman played by Sissy Keiling who dreams of becoming a star and performing on the show in the title. It is a bit generic stereotypical and expected and while Kelling is easy on the eyes and probably a better actor than most people in here her talent when it comes to music is highly questionable. The ending that was supposed to be so spectacular maybe even touching was absolutely nothing good at all and it makes me think of this film even lower than I did after seeing everything before that. Of course there is a lot more music than at the ending only but this is obvious to everybody who sees the cast list. Finally I can only say that this film does not get me motivated at all to take a look again at the famous show. I think people who loved the show back then may get back some nice memories by watching these 1.5 hours. Everybody else however will not see the appeal at all I am afraid and this includes myself. It's mostly loud and over the top and not in a good way. I don't recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".

It is about a young woman played by Sissy Keiling who dreams of becoming a star and performing on the show in the title. It is a bit generic stereotypical and expected and while Kelling is easy on the eyes and probably a better actor than most people in here her talent when it comes to music is highly questionable. The ending that was supposed to be so spectacular maybe even touching was absolutely nothing good at all and it makes me think of this film even lower than I did after seeing everything before that. Of course there is a lot more music than at the ending only but this is obvious to everybody who sees the cast list. Finally I can only say that this film does not get me motivated at all to take a look again at the famous show. I think people who loved the show back then may get back some nice memories by watching these 1.5 hours. Everybody else however will not see the appeal at all I am afraid and this includes myself. It's mostly loud and over the top and not in a good way. I don't recommend the watch. Thumbs down.";

Which is greatly illustrated at the end of the movie without revealing too much....Also the story with the lone crusader seeking vengeance for the slaying of his family is very strong. And the atmosphere of the movie really helps as well. The music is very good and helps the atmosphere as does the photo. Its dirty grey and cold just like it should be in a relentless unforgiving  viking movie.This is probably the best viking movie so far not that it has too many contenders sadly enough. I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a very special movie with a special atmosphere and a few nice touches. And also the movie is almost worth seeing only to hear the wonderful icelandic language!I rate this 710 one extra star for originality!".

Design wise The viking clichs of horned helmets shiny swords dragon headed longboats and the odd galloping stallions are replaced with an authentic downtoearth design Fur caps blackrusty cleaversknives small ocean going merchant vessels and those curious Icelandic ponies. It is quite odd seeing the characters ride them. The viking warriors feet almost touch the ground and they ride in a weird trotting style. Which help bring us closer to what life could have been like back then.And did I mention how the director has chosen memorable gritty faces in almost every role? No tall blond semigods here just dirty survivors in a harsh countryisland. 2. Plot wise An Icelandic film about vikings? A chance to show off Icelandic courage virtue and heroism right? Wrong. The hero is from IRELAND rather and his story is about a viking victim getting back at the perpetrators. The plot requires minimum knowledge about IcelandicNorwegian history. It's set during the late 800s AD. While the political power in Norway is being consolidated around one king Iceland is being colonized by settlers hunters traders political refugees...and Irish slaves. Iceland was considered a loose and distant part of the young kingdom.The intrigue be a little hard to follow a first. Relax  it will all make sense later on as characters dwindle in number. 3. Style wise This gruesome and captivating story of revenge is  yes a SPAGHETTI WESTERN. Every trick in the SpaghettiWestern handbook. And I mean it as a compliment.This is on par with Sergio Leone on a good day. And how suitable for the material. Talking is kept to a macho minimum. Closeups of frowning faces and steely eyes trying to penetrate the minds of opponents. Quiet. Sudden violent outbursts. Bittersweet ending. The main character Guest isn't even presented with a proper name. Clint's nameless character in the Dollar movies anyone? This is an Arctic homage to Sergio Leone. Bravo!4. Endurance 24 years on and the film is still standing strong. Some bloods'n gore effects are little on the silly side some sophomore editing. Some synth music and ditto drums upsets the mood a little at times. My DVD version has no stereosurround sound. The picture is laser disc fine not DVD or HD fine. And those were all the flaws. I mean ALL the flaws. Theis film is so frikkin' strong none of the above really matters.5. The director still hasn't made anything nearly as impressive as this film. The 1988 sequel In the Shadow of the Raven had a bigger budgetproduction. But lacks the Leoneish sense of urgency. See for yourself. The last film in his trilogy Den Kvite Viking had moments of inspired castingdesignmood etc a talking wooden Jesus effigy stands out but is totally overwhelmed by a slow and unconvincing plot. Shame. The more reason to love and revere the original! See it before they cast Nicholas Cage in a remake!".

It expressed the everyday unromantic experience of what it must have been like then. In this way it avoided Hollywoodism but when I consider how the filmmakers could have incorporated vast vistas as a cinematic expression of the isolation of these communities I was dismayed. These people lived in immense isolation but all we were given 90 percent of the time were tight shots and landscapes were generally presented as one section of the pebbly beach with some stark rocky islands off shore. And let us consider the opening of the version I saw. There was no attempt at establishing the historical context. Instead we got close shots that could have been anywhere and certainly shot in the style for 'straight to video. Come on! The script was clever with the potential for a great dramatic experience but the director must have been limited by a highly restrictive budget because it ended up looking like 'made for TV'. The synthesized music was occasionally effective but surely deeper chords would have created an ominous atmosphere. The hero did not really have any tense challenges. He seemed to cruise through it all. While I sort of liked him I never had a sense of his jeopardy. In short there was no dramatic tension. In this sense there was an echo of some of Clint Eastwood's movies but without the stylishness. There was an assumption that we were on the protagonist's side but why deprive us of his human vulnerability as he seeks revenge? I feel that the writers deserve a bigger budget to prove to us that they can create a truly cinematic experience rather than a small dimension TV drama. I have not seen the subsequent 2 parts of the trilogy.".

However too much realism is bad as well and I imagine the film would be liked only by a minority of viewers because of it. In fact it feels like old Spaghetti westerns at times with the bad sound and silly music added after the filming.Now I can imagine this done by Hollywood. They would definitely remove what was good with the script because their heroes must always be moral and trustworthy either white or black. The role of the woman would be relegated to something helpless begging for assistance rather than the courageous stance the Icelandic character takes. The fights would be epic touching steampunk with weird contraptions that mass murder tens of people but without blood.

The Icelandic Sagas are full of tales of Revenge Bloodshed Honor that must be gained and upheld and Grudges that wont let go all told in a laconic and ominous manner. Like his heroes Kurosawa and Leone Gunnlaugsson has a good eye for faces. Our hero Gestur has rugged good looks while the Viking thugs are impressively ugly. Helgi Sklason who plays Thord deserves a special mention. He has a terrific thousand yard stare which he displays widely whenever he is angry or has his plans ruined.As for the plot this is a straight remake of the YojimboFistful Of Dollars story save for a few things. In this movie our hero is motivated by revenge instead of monetary gain like Eastwood or unknown motives like Toshiro Mifune. There is also a moral theme running throughout the film which questions if Gesturs really did the right thing after all. All in all When The Raven Flies is a great action movie even if it didn't change the world. The only downsides i can think of is the 80's synthesizer soundtrack which can get damn annoying after a while and the crudely designed weapons the knifes and swords resemble giant butterknives and the axes are obviously just regular woodworking axes but other than that it is along with the Arn movies one of the best historical action movies from the North ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gest goes to Iceland in 894 to avenge the killers of his parents. There are some memorable moments in this film. The opening credits scene revealing the Icelandic coast with the powerful music lets us know we're in for something different. Gest is heavily influenced by The Man with no Name in Leone's westerns and Einarsson does a good job portraying such a figure.The opening scenes are the best especially the 'Tungur Knivur' scene. The film goes on too long and I didn't like the sanctimonious message in the end especially when the director's commentary on the DVD confirmed that he was trying to show the futility of violence.

	onyx:emotionText "Gest goes to Iceland in 894 to avenge the killers of his parents. There are some memorable moments in this film. The opening credits scene revealing the Icelandic coast with the powerful music lets us know we're in for something different. Gest is heavily influenced by The Man with no Name in Leone's westerns and Einarsson does a good job portraying such a figure.The opening scenes are the best especially the 'Tungur Knivur' scene. The film goes on too long and I didn't like the sanctimonious message in the end especially when the director's commentary on the DVD confirmed that he was trying to show the futility of violence. If somebody walks all over you you gotta stand up for yourself. It was also unrealistic. Gest would really have held on to those knives considering it was ninth century Iceland and how the hell was he going to get home.";

The cinematography was uninspired the acting was OK and the action boring. Never once do you get to see the harsh and beautiful Icelandic landscape I've been there only the shore and the vikings' huts. There are some interesting characters but they were never developed. The Irishman seems like a sadistic killer since he seems to kill every viking he meets how could he know which ones pillaged his village? He even throws a knife into a guy's mouth as he yawns what did that guy ever do to deserve that? The action was also terrible the Irishman kills by throwing knives and never actually confronts his enemies. The vikings themselves use strange machete looking swords. If I wanted to make a film taking place in Iceland I would first show off the Icelandic landscape create interesting characters who have motives and then show more of the viking culture itself the weaponry and armor the religion the sailing the longships etc. 'Revenge of the Barbarians' fails at all this and was a disappointment. If you want to see the Icelandic landscape I would recommend seeing 'The Viking Sagas' which is a bad movie but bad enough that it's entertaining. If you want to see something that's actually an interesting movie though Hollywood see 'The Vikings' or for something more lighthearted 'The Longships'. I haven't see this year's 'Beowulf and Grendel' but it sounds like an interesting film. See 'Revenge of the Barbarians' if you want to see how NOT to make a movie about the Vikings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lady Killer represents a combination of talents Hollywood will never see again. There is fast talking James Cagney who starts the movie as a dice playing gum chewing usher who makes wise guy but funny comments to everyone. In Cagney's opening scene he just makes it to a count out of the 25 ushers held on the roof of the movie theater they work at. All wear Warner Bros. uniforms including a cap with the WB logo on it. As Cagney advances in life he becomes a partner in a gambling operation. One of his confederates slugged too hard a maid and almost kills her during a home robbery another criminal activity Cagney's gang is involved in.

Dumbbell was a favorite word of screenwriter Ben Markson who used it to good advantage in another movie he cowrote Gold Diggers of 1933.

Later after Cagney is sprung loose Brannigan the cop played by Robert Elliot almost typecast to cop roles in the 30s who first pulled him in at the train station tells him that if he doesn't find a job he will be picked up as a vag for vagrant and get 30 days in jail.When you look at this scene notice the outline of the Venetian blinds on the office wall and the dark shadows falling on the the faces of the Chief Brannigan and Cagney's character. This scene and the subsequent scene of Cagney trying to keep a low profile in a pool hall unshaven and furtive look as if they were from a film noir movie only these scenes were made more than 12 years before the film noir cycle started.The scenes showing Cagney working as a movie extra show how movies were made in the early 1930s at least according to Roy Del Ruth. There is a scene of Cagney as an Indian chief on an imitation horse riding in front of a back projection screen the movie director shouting with a heavy European accent Ride That A Boy! Later on a 15 minute lunch break box lunch in hand Cagney identifies himself to his future girlfriend Margaret Lindsay as a Chief with the name said in Yiddish Pain In The Ass. I could be off in the translation but Cagney used a Yiddish phrase.The movie plot has one unexpected connection to real life. In 1939 there was a New York gangster named Greenbaum nicknamed Big Greenie. As I recall from reading Burton Turkus's book Murder Inc. years ago Greenbaum fled to the West Coast where he worked as an extra in movies while avoiding Lepke's killers. Greenbaum knew too much and Lepke eventually managed to have Big Greenie killed.Lady Killer was made in 1933 fast by great talents. I saw it playing the laserdisc of the movie part of the double laserdisc of James Cagney movies that Image released in 1992. The second movie on the LD set Blonde Crazy made in 1931 is good also but the advances made in movie making in two years are really something comparing the two movies.There is only one slight flaw in Lady Killer. In every other preCode movie I saw from Warner Bros. when someone reads a telegram you see the telegram message on screen the telegram made by the prop department. When the LA police chief shows a telegram to Cagney explaining the situation he tells him New York authorities asked him to hold Cagney's character. You never see the actual telegram message Warners usual practice then a practice not usually followed by other studios. Maybe Warners' prop department did prepare a fictitious telegram but movie director Roy Del Ruth thought it looked fakey.".

There is fast talking James Cagney who starts the movie as a dice playing gum chewing usher who makes wise guy but funny comments to everyone. In Cagney's opening scene he just makes it to a count out of the 25 ushers held on the roof of the movie theater they work at. All wear Warner Bros. uniforms including a cap with the WB logo on it. As Cagney advances in life he becomes a partner in a gambling operation. One of his confederates slugged too hard a maid and almost kills her during a home robbery another criminal activity Cagney's gang is involved in.

	schema:reviewBody "Lady Killer 1933I love these multipart stories where one set of scenes shifts to a whole new set and then they eventually intertwine. And I also love movies that show the inside of Hollywood with actual recreations of movie sets and movie shoots.Lady Killer has both and James Cagney too. It's fast furious funny and shot with a bright glinting intelligence. Not quite a gangster film it does have crime and some crooked thugs. And not quite a comedy it pulls out quite a few laughs mostly because Cagney is a card. There are two fabulous first ladies and they naturally must view for our man Mae Clark and Margaret Lindsay and a slew of second men who hold up their characters with caricature. In all there is no Warner message here except maybe the virtue can sometimes prevail. It's just a lot of great scenes witty dialog and a play of good guys against bad guys. Look for some stunning rain scenes in California yeah I know and for a huge range of interior and exterior set ups fairly elaborate for Warner Bros. budgets. For Cagney fans it's a riot to see him take on briefly a series of roles as Indian chief Italian lover and prisoner on work detail. The latter of course is close to the real roles that made him famous and his role here is actually a little lighter than that a bad guy who is all wisecracks and cheerfulness. Look for some insider jokes like the poster and mention of the Edward G. Robinson film and the movie ushers wearing hats all with the Warner Brothers logo on it.Great stuff. I loved it even as I knew it wasn't quite a masterpiece. Oh and the new 2010 Warner DVD is sparkling a first rate print!".

Cagney's role as movie usherturned gangsterturned film star appears to be a sendup his Tom Powers role in the previous film. Cagney and Clarke share plenty of knowing looks as her character reads out a list of the fruit in Calofornia Oranges pineapples... and pauses on Grapefruit. Fantastic! More fruity fun occurs later when Mae having betrayed Cagney's character has a pineapple plonked unceremoniously in her lap.Clarke a sexy PreCode girl who is sadly forgotten today deserves special mention here. It is unfortunate her career never really took off as she did some terrific work in early talkies such as WATERLOO BRIDGE. She plays moll and partnerincrime to her crooked chums in LADY KILLER and does a fine job of it. In a fun early scene Cagney finds out that Mae is more than just an innocent doll who daintily dropped her purse on accident. She is revealed to be have a drawer full of purses and is in cahoots with gangsters! Cagney once again kicks poor Mae around again in LADY KILLER yet this time it's oddly fun. After Clarke breaks into Cagney's room and spoils his evening with his filmstar girlfriend the pretty Margaret Lindsay much better here than in DANGEROUS Cagney grabs her by her hair kicking and screaming and throws her out into the hall. Great PreCode fun! LADY KILLER possesses a good script and the plot whilst largely unbelievable is quite fastpaced and offers some good surprises. In no other Cagney film will you see him donning Indian headdress and face paint unleashing a cage of monkeys on a room full of Hollywood big shots and acting as an absurd Italian lover chomping garlic and being pushed into a water fountain by Lindsay. There are some truly outrageous offbeat classic moments in this film with Cagney receiving a slap on the buttocks from a possibly homosexual film executive who then proceeds to take a good long look down at Cagney's...ahem...nether regions! An absolute gem of a film.810.".

When that goes bad and the gang leaves him flat Quigley finds a new line in Hollywood first as an extra soon after as a Famous HeMan of the Screen. But what will happen when the old gang shows up for a piece of the action?The marquee in lights near the start of the film advertises someone called The Prince Of Pep. He might as well be Cagney in this streamlined star vehicle written entirely to showcase his fast patter and easy charm. Cagney's so good they don't even bother to build a coherent film around his character and it hardly matters.If you want to see a great Cagney film there are perhaps a couple dozen better candidates. But if you want to see why the guy clicked so hard in the days of early sound and still packs a punch 80 years later this should be on your short list.Cagney's lines here are priceless. To a dog being held by a theater manager who just fired him Listen Fido this guy's got a wooden leg. Try it sometime!To a group of card sharps who just cleaned him out I think I'll stick to checkers.To the same group after he's figured out their scam You kick back with my fifty bucks or I'll fold your joint like an accordion!Just seconds later he proposes a partnership. You got a sweet racket here. Maybe I can show you a few new wrinkles.Lady Killer was made just before the Hays Code was seriously enforced which makes for interesting viewing. Reviewers here have already pointed out a scene when we see Quigley sneak Mae Clarke's character Myra a peck on the breast. The film takes even greater advantage of the liberal mores then still in effect by letting Quigley get away with his crimes. Sure he goes straight sort of but only because he finds a better racket than potentially homicidal BEs. There's no moment of Quigley coming to regret his wicked past as censors would have required just months later.That makes for a more entertaining Cagney vehicle but a somewhat disjointed film. Director Roy Del Ruth keeps things moving quick but in odd directions in tone turning Lady Killer from a semiserious gangster story to a genially goofy Hollywood satire. In his DVD commentary Drew Casper calls Lady Killer a shyster satire. It might also be called a crooked comedy no one is on the level whichever side of the law they're on.So in Hollywood we see Quigley break big after really slugging an extra in a mock prison break scene and further his path toward stardom by faking fan letters. It's shallow stuff but fun especially as it all plays so fast. Other than the star pacing is Lady Killer's ace in the hole.Clarke should have graduated from the grapefruit league with this performance. She and Cagney resume their fireworks from Public Enemy this time with even more outrageous stunts but Clarke here the first billed female does wise work making sure we enjoy her comeuppance. Even her catty asides to Cagney or the way she shamelessly plays with her hair while shaking him down for more dough is on par with Barbara Stanwyck's starmaking wickedness.But make no mistake Lady Killer is Cagney's baby and he makes it work despite the tone shifts and the odd title Quigley's not a killer himself and doesn't play with women's affections. You root for the guy despite his crookedness and that's all that matters in the end.".

	schema:headline " Well It's a Jim as an Usher with a '45";
	schema:reviewBody "Lady Killer despite it's tough and sinister sounding name is actually a thoroughly entertaining Romantic Comedy released at the tail end of 1933 a time when prohibition had just been rescinded the new FDR administration vowed to lift America from the depression and movie audiences couldn't get enough of James Cagney. Throughout the early '30's Warner Brother's keen to give the public what they wanted kept Cagney busy churning out new Cagney vehicles at an almost exponential rate. These were the formative years for Cagney long before Pat O'Brien had given him the affectionate nickname 'The Professional Againster' due to his many fall outs with Warner's Cagney did as he was told and in this his fifth and final movie of 1933 he did not disappoint neither his fans nor Jack Warner himself.Cagney plays Dan Quigley a theatre usher who is as just as unsuited to his job as he is the white tailcoat and cap he is forced to wear. After receiving several warnings about his rudeness to customers and illegal dice games in the men's room he is fired but Quigley's street smarts mean that he won't be out of work for long.After seeing a beautiful young lady drop her purse he plays the Samaritan by returning it to her apartment obviously looking for a 'reward' though perhaps not one of the financial kind. the woman Myra Mae Clarke at first flirts with him until interrupted by her 'brother in law' Spade Maddock Douglass Dumbrille. Spade invites Quigley to join the poker game that he and a few friends are having and Quigley a keen gambler readily agrees. However he's soon cleaned out and after bidding everyone a fond farewell makes his exit. Upon leaving the apartment he meets another man on the stairs returning another 'dropped' purse to Myra's home. Realising he's been 'played' he forces his way back into the apartment threatening to tell the cops everything if his money is not returned. The gang both blackmailed and impressed by him then allow him to join the gang for a share of the take. It's not long however before Quigley is running the show and Quigley's transformation from Usher to Gangster is complete.Months later the gang under Quigley's leadership own a successful nightclub and carefully choose their next con victims from the wealthy hoy palloy that regularly frequent their joint. After one of his gang critically injures a maid on one robbery and murders a butler on another Quigley draws the line. By his own admission he is a thief and a grifter but not a murderer. With the gang now wanted Myra and Quigley lam out to California but the police arrest him on arrival. Instead of bailing him out Myra thinking she too will be arrested and being prompted by the two faced Maddock skips town.After being released due to lack of evidence a penniless Quigley is left to roam the streets of Los Angeles until a movie talent scout looking for 'tough guy types' signs him up. After making a suitable impression in a prison movie his parts start to increase. He meets Lois Underwood Margaret Lindsay a young studio starlet. The chemistry between the two is there from the start and they are both so down to earth that neither cannot see a problem with a romance between extra and star.However Quigley has no intention of remaining an extra for very long realising that there's big money to be made in this 'picture racket'. After hilariously writing hundreds of his own fan letters and employing a stooge to post them to the studio from various corners of the country the star roles are not too long in coming and Dan Quigley becomes the new star of Hollywood. Sadly Quigley's transformation from Gangster to Movie Star was always going to be overshadowed. With his new found fame comes new found recognition and Quigley's old gang arrive in town looking to use his shady past as a means to blackmail him into helping them commit robberies of the Hollywood elite. Quigley determined to go straight bribes them to leave town but when the homes of several movie stars are robbed Quigley puts two and two together. The LAPD who who still aware of Quigley's past suspect him of guiding the robbers to their targets convinced that 'once a thief always a thief'. It is only when Lois's house is targeted that Quigley decides enough is enough and with his career his romance and his very life in danger decides to sort things out once and for all.Cagney as always is a dynamo of energy throughout this movie and he is a joy to watch as is Mae Clarke as Myra. However Margaret Lindsay's performance as Lois didn't grab me as it should have. I loved Lindsay as an actress but found her character here quite two dimensional and slightly annoying. Douglass Dumbrille makes a great villain as no other actor of the time could play the dis likable 'slimy' characters as well as he could. The best scene for me was the unforgettable scene where Cagney drags poor Mae Clarke by the hair through TWO hotel rooms before booting her butt out into the hallway. Mae Clarke was a real trouper and she sure put up with a lot from Cagney in those early years remember the grapefruit?. My other favourite scenes are when the critic is made to 'eat his words' and the adorably cute little monkey's. The latter perhaps was a scene that needlessly prolonged the movie but funny all the same.Of all the movies Cagney made in 1933 this is not the best I'll reserve that honour for Footlight Parade. But at the end of the day It's still a Jimmy Cagney movie and his very presence in ALL but two or three scenes means that you're never allowed to forget it either.Enjoy.".

	onyx:emotionText "Lady Killer despite it's tough and sinister sounding name is actually a thoroughly entertaining Romantic Comedy released at the tail end of 1933 a time when prohibition had just been rescinded the new FDR administration vowed to lift America from the depression and movie audiences couldn't get enough of James Cagney. Throughout the early '30's Warner Brother's keen to give the public what they wanted kept Cagney busy churning out new Cagney vehicles at an almost exponential rate. These were the formative years for Cagney long before Pat O'Brien had given him the affectionate nickname 'The Professional Againster' due to his many fall outs with Warner's Cagney did as he was told and in this his fifth and final movie of 1933 he did not disappoint neither his fans nor Jack Warner himself.Cagney plays Dan Quigley a theatre usher who is as just as unsuited to his job as he is the white tailcoat and cap he is forced to wear. After receiving several warnings about his rudeness to customers and illegal dice games in the men's room he is fired but Quigley's street smarts mean that he won't be out of work for long.After seeing a beautiful young lady drop her purse he plays the Samaritan by returning it to her apartment obviously looking for a 'reward' though perhaps not one of the financial kind. the woman Myra Mae Clarke at first flirts with him until interrupted by her 'brother in law' Spade Maddock Douglass Dumbrille. Spade invites Quigley to join the poker game that he and a few friends are having and Quigley a keen gambler readily agrees. However he's soon cleaned out and after bidding everyone a fond farewell makes his exit. Upon leaving the apartment he meets another man on the stairs returning another 'dropped' purse to Myra's home. Realising he's been 'played' he forces his way back into the apartment threatening to tell the cops everything if his money is not returned. The gang both blackmailed and impressed by him then allow him to join the gang for a share of the take. It's not long however before Quigley is running the show and Quigley's transformation from Usher to Gangster is complete.Months later the gang under Quigley's leadership own a successful nightclub and carefully choose their next con victims from the wealthy hoy palloy that regularly frequent their joint. After one of his gang critically injures a maid on one robbery and murders a butler on another Quigley draws the line. By his own admission he is a thief and a grifter but not a murderer. With the gang now wanted Myra and Quigley lam out to California but the police arrest him on arrival. Instead of bailing him out Myra thinking she too will be arrested and being prompted by the two faced Maddock skips town.After being released due to lack of evidence a penniless Quigley is left to roam the streets of Los Angeles until a movie talent scout looking for 'tough guy types' signs him up. After making a suitable impression in a prison movie his parts start to increase. He meets Lois Underwood Margaret Lindsay a young studio starlet. The chemistry between the two is there from the start and they are both so down to earth that neither cannot see a problem with a romance between extra and star.However Quigley has no intention of remaining an extra for very long realising that there's big money to be made in this 'picture racket'. After hilariously writing hundreds of his own fan letters and employing a stooge to post them to the studio from various corners of the country the star roles are not too long in coming and Dan Quigley becomes the new star of Hollywood. Sadly Quigley's transformation from Gangster to Movie Star was always going to be overshadowed. With his new found fame comes new found recognition and Quigley's old gang arrive in town looking to use his shady past as a means to blackmail him into helping them commit robberies of the Hollywood elite.

He becomes a star but then his old gang catches up with him and he has to deal with them.Along the way three of the supporting actors combine with Cagney to make this a very fast moving 74minute film. They are Mae Clark as the female villain Myra Gale Margaret Lindsay at the good woman Lois Underwood and Douglass Dumbrille as Spade the former leader of the New York gang. All are very convincing in their roles under the able work of director Roy Del Ruth.You can tell this was a precode film just looking at Lindsay's ample cleavage something that would have been covered up a bit more if the film had been made the following year. Other than that and a few minor innuendos the film is pretty clean morally speaking.One thing you certainly wouldn't see in today's films was the scene showing Cagney grabbing Clark by the hair and dragging her across the room then booting her out in the hallway! This is the same actress who received the famous grapefruitintheface from Cagney in Public Enemy.Anyway yes the film is dated in much of the dialog and attitudes but it's so entertaining so much fun to watch that it would still appeal to a goodsized audience today too.".

Cagney's character starts out the movie joining a gang but it's a gang of confidence men. Then they graduate to robbing houses before someone is shot and they have to leave town. These aren't racketeers or guys shooting it out with tommy guns. So in my view they're criminals for sure but not what I would call gangsters. Not that it matters much in the end. This movie reunites Cagney with his Public Enemy costars Mae Clarke and Leslie Fenton. Clarke is a treat to watch and has great chemistry with Cagney. Lovely Margaret Lindsay plays the movie star Cagney falls for. I'm a fan of hers so of course I enjoyed her in this. Highlights include Cagney dragging Clarke out of his room by her hair and Cagney forcing a movie critic to eat his own review. A fun crime comedy from Warner Bros. with another great Cagney role.".

He and Mae head to Los Angeles where he gets picked up for a series of bit parts because of his scruffy looks.One of the fascinating bits here is seeing how movies were made at the time. He hooks up with star Margaret Lindsay and uses his conning skills to make himself a star. As an aside Lindsey made 12 films that year her second year as an actress. Soon Mae and the gang find him and they pick up where they left off. He tries to get them out of town but they see dollars in LA. They hit Lindsey who is his girlfriend and he strikes back but ends up back in jail.

Dan meets up with a bunch of conmen who try to cheat him out of fifty bucks and he discovers their racket and then decides to join them in other crooked adventures. Dan decides to go to Los Angeles California and is soon discovered by a Hollywood producer who needs a person who looks like a crook and so Dan starts getting some bit parts in films and begins to be discovered as a great actor. Dan also meets up with Myra Gale Mae Clarke who is a big film star and they get along just great until Lois Underwood Margaret Lindsay is found in his bedroom by Myra and the relationship cools off rather quickly.

	schema:headline " PreCode Cagney Romp";
	schema:reviewBody "The early James Cagney comedy Lady Killer chronicles the life of fasttalking grafter Dan Quigley from nobody to somebody. Dan Cagney starts out as an obnoxious dice slinging usher at a Warner Brothers' studio. After he is fired him for insubordination Dan stumbles into the illegal gambling racket. He retrieves a purse that a beautiful young lady has left in the Randolph Hotel. Dan takes the purse to the lady and finds himself participating in a penny ante poker. Predictably Spade Maddock Douglass Dumbrille of Female and his henchmen Smiley Russell Hopton of Car 99 Pete Raymond Hatton of Motorcycle Gang and Duke Leslie Fenton of The Public Enemy fleece Dan but he gets wise to them when he encounters another man looking for Myra's hotel room. Dan uncovers the fleece and blackmails them into letting him join them. Later he crashes his car deliberately into a wealthy woman's limo so he can access to her mansion and then relays information about her valuable possessions to his larcenous cronies. Things take a turn for the worse when a goon in Dan's outfit Duke clobbers an innocent maid harder than necessary. News about the maid's condition prompts Dan's gang to split and he runs for it. Eventually our protagonist lands a job as an extra at a Hollywood studio. As it happens the studio is searching for a new matine idol and Dan finds himself living high wide and handsome. Nevertheless he hasn't forgotten that his former accomplices Myra Gale Mae Clarke Spade Smiley Pete and Duke left him in the lurch and stole the 5thousand for his bail bond. Dan manages to get out of jail but the local authorities aren't happy with him. They promise him 30 days in the slammer if he doesn't find a job. One day a film talent scout William Davidson of Seven Sinners runs Dan down. Dan suspects the talent scout as detectives sent to arrest him so he runs from them. Bumping into a beat cop Dan finds himself cornered by the talent scouts and he receives an invitation to an open casting call. Dan embarks on the new career and we watch him as he goes from a hardknuckled escaped convict with a deadly right cross to a romantic leading man. Golddiggers of Broadway director Roy Del Ruth has fashioned a snappy lighthearted urbane saga that provides some hilarious behindthescenes look at Hollywood and gives Cagney a legitimate reason to brandish a revolver. The turning point of the film occurs after Cagney's old girlfriend Myra catches up with him. She makes an unexpected appearance at his Hollywood apartment. It doesn't help their enmity that Dan is showing off to leading lady Lois Underwood Margaret Lindsay of British Intelligence how he has redecorated his pad. Presumably the villains didn't waste their money on movies. Anyway the gang follows Myra back after Dan banishes her from his presence. Dan gives them his entire fortune to leave him alone. Trouble is they take his money and stick around after they'd agreed to leave town. Dan is furious because they have stolen some of Lois' jewelry. He takes a gun and confronts Spade and the others about the robbery. He takes Lois' jewelry at gunpoint but as he is backing out the door the police arrest him! This is one of the few PreCodes where you see the gangsters wielding Tommy guns and the final quarter of the action is as hot as anything in Cagney's later blockbuster GMen. Clocking in at 76 minutes Cagney's fifteenth movie is terrific especially the scene were the monkeys run wild at a Hollywood starlet's party.".

	schema:reviewBody "For as big a star as James Cagney was in his day he is one of the least remembered or watched in the 21st century. That's because the type of films he made were so set in their time and not of enduring entertainment. Cagney was a very talented actor who could sing and dance as well. He made some very good movies a few of which carry on with audiences. But for the most part the bulk of his toughguy criminal and convict character films are a thing of the past. That said Lady Killer is something unique in that it has Cagney in that role but then transitioning to a guy who goes straight. Hollywood came calling and his Dan Quigley soon makes his mark in films. Some of his former associates in crime catch up with him and try to use him to pull off jewel robberies of the famous of Hollywood. Douglass Dumbrille is Spade Maddock whom Dan eventually helps bring down. Another different aspect of this Cagney character is that he didn't go for killing which some of his cohorts didn't worry about. In many of his gangster films he portrayed a mad or crazed tough guy who would just as soon shoot somebody as argue with them. Some others of the cast here are good as well. This film doesn't have particularly good production qualities. Unlike the films with set stages that came across quite well when Hollywood sent to the outdoors it was iffy in these early years. The problems with staging shooting and editing really show up here in the car chase scenes. Overall this is a light comedy crime film in which James Cagney is a good guy  well better than most of the rest at least.".

	schema:headline " Cagney's Self Parody is Perhaps His Worst Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening twenty minutes works well with Cagney getting fired as a movie usher and getting taken into a gang by a lost pursegambling scheme. At this point the movie starts to make wild jumps that throw all believably out the window. For example Cagney threatens a group of cheap gangsters with exposure and they let him into the gang. In the next scene he is head of the gang and they own an expensive nightclub. How did that happen?A wealthy woman shows up at the nightclub and for no particular reason the gang does a robbery of her house. Why pick a nightclub patron as their target? It doesn't make any sense. One of the gang kills somebody during the robbery. Up to this point the movie has been comical but this makes Cagney into a real criminal who has caused the death of a maid. The movie turns dark and mildly suspenseful for about 15 minutes.The movie then goes completely off the tracks by having Cagney arrive in Hollywood and suddenly be picked to play an extra in a motion picture. The movie turns back into a comedy. Cagney is satirizing Cagney the actor but this completely undercuts Cagney the gangster character in the first half of the movie.The first half of the movie is really a bad remake of Blonde Crazy 1931. That movie has Cagney as a conniving hotel bellhop just as this movie has him as a conniving movie usher. In that movie too Cagney is tricked by a scam into becoming part of a group of gangsters.That movie also makes some leaps but it doesn't run out of ideas half way through as this movie does or fall into a chaotic mess as this movie does.With the minor exception of Mae Clarke the other actors are quite forgettable in their roles.".

How did that happen?A wealthy woman shows up at the nightclub and for no particular reason the gang does a robbery of her house. Why pick a nightclub patron as their target? It doesn't make any sense. One of the gang kills somebody during the robbery. Up to this point the movie has been comical but this makes Cagney into a real criminal who has caused the death of a maid. The movie turns dark and mildly suspenseful for about 15 minutes.The movie then goes completely off the tracks by having Cagney arrive in Hollywood and suddenly be picked to play an extra in a motion picture. The movie turns back into a comedy. Cagney is satirizing Cagney the actor but this completely undercuts Cagney the gangster character in the first half of the movie.The first half of the movie is really a bad remake of Blonde Crazy 1931. That movie has Cagney as a conniving hotel bellhop just as this movie has him as a conniving movie usher. In that movie too Cagney is tricked by a scam into becoming part of a group of gangsters.That movie also makes some leaps but it doesn't run out of ideas half way through as this movie does or fall into a chaotic mess as this movie does.With the minor exception of Mae Clarke the other actors are quite forgettable in their roles.";

	schema:headline " From burglary star to Hollywood star with Cagney";
	schema:reviewBody "All 4 of the films starring Jimmy Cagney released in 1933 are worth seeing for Cagney fans. Besides this one that includes The Mayor of Hell The Picture Snatcher and Footlight Parade. The last is primarily a musical with Jimmy hoofing it a bit in preparation for his staring role in Yankee Doodle Dandy a decade later. The others are not hardcore gangster pictures although there is some gangster element in each. This one has the most gangster element of these. Jimmy accidentally gets involved with a crooked cards ring which graduates to house burglaries and which won't let him alone when he tries to go straight. There's a good measure of humor involved. One striking example is when Hollywood star LoisMargaret Lindsay Jimmy's recent girlfriend teasingly asks for a barrel of monkeys for her birthday. Jimmy takes her literally and brings a cage full of capuchins to her elaborate birthday party. Somebody opens their cage and they quickly take over the party destroying things making a mess of the cake dropping light bulbs on people's heads etc.. Hilarious for the audience and Jimmy but a disaster for Lois. Surprisingly she was shown relaxing with Jimmy at some later date. She wasn't on speaking terms with him after he brought her to his home and discovered MyraMae Clarke on his bed. Myra was the moll for his old NYC gang who had come with him from NYC to LA. Jimmy thought he had bribed them to vacate the LA region but they were back. When Myra refused to leave he dragged her by the hair to the door then booted her into the hall throwing her overstuffed suitcase out which opened to scatter the contents around. Soon after this incident Jimmy who was now a Hollywood star and Lois were forced to kiss for a film. Afterwards Lois returned to her hostile attitude and pushed Jimmy into the fountain pool behind him. He thought it was funny.Now that Jimmy was a Hollywood star his old gang pestered him to invite one of them to Hollywood parties so they could check out the house for burglary. Of course Jimmy didn't want to get involved but they blackmailed him. Eventually they targeted Lois's house stealing some jewelry. Jimmy surprised the gang when they returned to their hideout and took the jewels at gun point intending to return them to Lois. However the police were outside the door having been tipped off where they were hiding and caught Jimmy with the goods the others escaping out the window and fire escape. Jimmy was held in jail pending his trial but both Lois and Myra volunteered to pay his steep bail. Myra got there first but Jimmy was very suspicious why the gang would bail him out. He arranged for a police detail to follow the car containing the gang which followed the car with him and Myra. I leave the result of this car chase for you to find out. Jimmy's relationships with both Myra and Lois had big ups and downs you never were sure what their attitude would be next. Clearly Lois was cast as a good girl and Myra as a bad girl. But which was more appropriate for Jimmy? The second half of this film is definitely more interesting than the first half. In the beginning Jimmy is being fired from his job as a theater usher for various transgressions. He picks up a purse dropped by a woman and takes it to her address. It's Myra. He becomes aware of a card game by several men in her apartment and joins losing all his money. On the way out he encounters a man returning a dropped pocketbook of Myra's. Pretty soon another man comes calling with another dropped purse belonging to Myra. Jimmy smells a racket and demands to be included in the gang or he will go to the police. Under Jimmy's recommendation they start robbing houses then use their earnings to buy a nightclub and casino. They seem to be doing well with that business and gain information about wealthy clients as potential robbery victims. Seems to me if their casino business is doing well why risk a jail sentence continuing to do criminal things that attract the police? Perhaps they didn't think they would be caught and wanted more riches or perhaps they would miss the challenges involved. In any case when a butler died from a blow Jimmy decided it was time to quit this racket and relocated to LA where he was eventually tapped for movie stardom with his rugged looks and thin moustache. Seems the public was weary of handsome matine idols as leading men.".

Her blind devotion to her son along with the absence of any physical display of emotion are together at the root of the Thiel family dysfunction. This interpersonal rift makes the Martin Thiel character appear stiff and creepy and adds to the confusion and suspense of his innocence or guilt in the string of grisly sex murders that pepper this film.The use of fire and rain throughout also enrages the imagination and adds clearly to the loathing an animal fear in Criminal Law. It is easy for the viewer to feel stalked or hunted in these parts of the moviedeliciously!Tess Harper and Joe Don Baker have critical but minor roles and do nothing to spoil the suspense of it. Both get well into their characters though somehow Harper's Det. Stillwell and Shepherd's Dr. Thiel persona seem too similar...a minor overall script chemistry complaint at that.This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie much better than most we see today almost 20 years hence.

	schema:reviewBody "Tangled in its superficiality trying to be something more than just an ordinary thriller and that's what this really is about an psycho out of control Criminal Law wastes everything and everybody. Sadly the movie couldn't warn us earlier like 10 minutes from watching this and you would had the chance to know this might be an disaster and simply walk out of it. No it goes quite well until the plot creates a mess bigger than the Everest and the K2 together and director Martin Campbell director of this was in the latter in Vertical Limit and worst some of us want to climb it until the end but we can't. Why? Because we're not trained enough like the screenwriter from this flick. He and only he can decode this messy picture.And to think of how good this could be! Gary Oldman plays an lawyer who just made his client Thiel Kevin Bacon free from jail accused of rape and murder of a woman. Everybody's happy until a new wave of crimes similar to the one thrown on Thiel start off again. But this isn't like Just Cause the guy won't say he isn't guilty rather than that he's gonna commit more and more murders AND will rub on his lawyer face that lousy privilege between client and defendant his next moves. It's up to this man to find a way to stop this criminal. Pretty exciting isn't it? Criminal Law becomes problematic when it decides to include random and uninteresting subplots about abortion Thiel's family and the lawyer's love interest and then it connects all of this parts together and mess it up real bad. It pretends to be real clever but it never succeeds. Take all that out and trade to saying something about ethics difference between law and justice they tried something about that but it wasn't enough make a substantial dramatic film rather than 'to catch a serial killer' kind of thing and then we would have at least a decent movie a relevant one. By all means this is a poorly executed film that only wasted good actors in giving them bad scenes to perform with. Being the script the worst thing of it we must be ashamed to testify Kevin Bacon giving one of his worst performances of all completely on the automatic pilot and ridiculous playing the villain Oldman has good moments when he's not trying to sustain so many different accents into an American role. And why on Earth do the script have to include an strange sex scene with him awkwardly interspersed with him playing squash? Ridiculous!. Hope that the money received by them was worth it because they could've done better than this. If you enjoy both actors I'll highly recommend JFK and Murder in the First coincidentally in all of three films their characters never get along. Criminal Law I can't and won't suggest. A good idea and a wasted one. Big time! This is what happens when the hands get faster than the brain and the writer is not thinking of what's he doing. 510".

But this isn't like Just Cause the guy won't say he isn't guilty rather than that he's gonna commit more and more murders AND will rub on his lawyer face that lousy privilege between client and defendant his next moves. It's up to this man to find a way to stop this criminal. Pretty exciting isn't it? Criminal Law becomes problematic when it decides to include random and uninteresting subplots about abortion Thiel's family and the lawyer's love interest and then it connects all of this parts together and mess it up real bad. It pretends to be real clever but it never succeeds. Take all that out and trade to saying something about ethics difference between law and justice they tried something about that but it wasn't enough make a substantial dramatic film rather than 'to catch a serial killer' kind of thing and then we would have at least a decent movie a relevant one. By all means this is a poorly executed film that only wasted good actors in giving them bad scenes to perform with. Being the script the worst thing of it we must be ashamed to testify Kevin Bacon giving one of his worst performances of all completely on the automatic pilot and ridiculous playing the villain Oldman has good moments when he's not trying to sustain so many different accents into an American role. And why on Earth do the script have to include an strange sex scene with him awkwardly interspersed with him playing squash? Ridiculous!. Hope that the money received by them was worth it because they could've done better than this. If you enjoy both actors I'll highly recommend JFK and Murder in the First coincidentally in all of three films their characters never get along. Criminal Law I can't and won't suggest. A good idea and a wasted one. Big time! This is what happens when the hands get faster than the brain and the writer is not thinking of what's he doing. 510";

After the trial Thiel gives indications that he was actually guilty and a short time later telephones Chase to arrange a meeting at a nearby park. When Chase goes to the arranged meeting place he's horrified to discover the body of a woman who'd been raped and murdered. Police detectives Mesel Joe Don Baker and Stillwell Tess Harper attend the crime scene and are openly disdainful of Chase who they blame for returning the murderer back into society. When it seems that Thiel might need legal representation for a second time Chase agrees to defend him so that he can make sure that he's held accountable for his crimes. This unethical approach isn't entirely feasible however and so Chase tries to get Thiel to incriminate himself. In trying to do this the two men become closer and Chase starts to recognise certain similarities between them that he finds disturbing.In Criminal Law it's interesting to see the changes that the ultraconceited Chase goes through as he becomes filled with doubt about what he's doing and takes advice from his mentor Professor Clemens Michael Sinelnikoff who advises him about the shortcomings of the justice system by saying that the law is the dark shadow of justice. Similarly the significance of the first part of the Nietzsche quotation at the start of the movie Whosoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster also becomes apparent in an interesting way as the relationship between the two men becomes closer and the mind games begin.The main problem with this movie is that the interest that's established in the effective first act gradually dissipates as the whole undertaking loses coherence as it progresses.

	schema:reviewBody "A woman police officer Tess Harper shoots a running man square through the head at a distance of fifty feet with a shortbarreled revolver. Now if you can believe that you will get more out of this movie than I did.It's not an especially BAD movie in the sense that at least it's not insulting. And in fact the story had real potential. Gary Oldman of the droopy face is a highend Boston attorney hired by filthy rich Kevin Bacon who has been accused of serial murders involving diapers stuffed in the victims' mouths. Don't ask. Oldman is a Harvard graduate and therefore brilliant. He saves Bacon's bacon to general rejoicing.Without too much further ado he finds that Bacon was guilty after all when the murders begin all over again and Bacon practically confesses. The problem is that there is no way to convict Bacon and Oldman out of an excess of chagrin takes it upon himself to investigate the new cases and try to find inculpatory evidence.The acting is pretty good on everyone's part. The dialog has some startlingly effective lines. The performers look and speak as one would expect such characters to  except that the murderer Kevin Bacon stares ghoulishly at every dramatic moment. If he blinked his eyes AT ALL during the movie I must have been blinking myself.I don't know if that unblinking murderous stare was Bacon's idea. I hope not. I suspect it was at the least encouraged by the director Martin Campbell because the fiend who is unable to nictitate is a clich  and the movie is full of clichs.That lifesaving miraculous shot by Tess Harper is only the climactic example. One of the most overused stings has an innocent person creeping about in a dark room searching for something he or more often she shouldn't be looking for. All is quiet. We tremble along with the intruder. Then a clash of dissonance in the score and a hand reaches in from out of the frame and grabs the person's shoulder or she bumps into a figure standing in the shadows or she hears a noise and whirls her flashlight around to reveal the face of a threatening intruder or a pair of arms wrap around her neck from behind. I counted at least four uses of this hoary device before I stopped looking for them.I'll mention just one other. A terrified man stumbles through a public park during a downpour trips over some brush rolls helplessly down the side of a hill and comes to rest on a mutilated human body.Enough.It's too bad because there are signs of intelligence glimmering through this hackneyed murk. Your Honor  ladies and gentleman of the jury  I direct your attention to the anecdote told by the dying librarian in the hospital the little parable about Justice Brandeis and the shadow of the law. Corroborating evidence which I now introduce as Exhibit Number Two is provided by Kevin Bacon's fable the one in the punt of the man caught whipping God's dog. Nobody brings up Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism versus Kant's categorical imperatives although they might have but thank God they didn't.A shame it was all thrown away in the service of titillating the audience through the use of commercial tricks.".

Unfortunately Criminal Law breaks this essential rule. So I have no one to blame but myself for watching it from beginning to end. I wanted to like it...but I couldn't.Gary Oldman plays a defense lawyer who helps a guilty man go free. When he discovers what he's done Oldman spends the rest of the movie trying to get the killer. The opening title is a quote about monster hunters becoming the monsters they hunt an interesting idea that isn't really explored the way it could have been. The idea that a savvy former prosecutornow defending the criminals he used to send to jailis surprised to find that his client Kevin Bacon is guilty is just one of the silly conceits of this silly movie. Another is a lawyer who's willing to chuck his whole career to make sure justice is done especially when it's not at all necessary. Can't the police catch this guy? He's not exactly keeping a low profile.In the course of all this we are treated to scenes of Gary Oldman in a wifebeater whipping up a gourmet dinner for one in an immaculate architectural house Gary Oldman in those painfully tiny '80s gym shorts playing handball or possibly squash Gary Oldman naked having truly embarrassingtowatch sex with Ellen a dreadful performance interspersed with scenes of handball or possibly squash and generally a lot of Gary Oldman in a variety of GQ poses.I'm not sure who to blame for the surfeit of uncomfortable and unconvincing raw emotion in this movie. Is it the writer's fault? The director's? Both Oldman and Bacon are usually wonderful actors. But I can't remember a movie with this much maletomale crying.Criminal Law takes itself far too seriously and we can't take it seriously enough. I was sure Oldman and Bacon were coproducers they weren'tbut it was that kind of movie.".

Oldman  Bacon along with the rest of the cast must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening. As one poster pointed out Karen Young did do a pretty good fight scene with Bacon. She really did 'let loose'.

	schema:reviewBody "I picked this movie because I was in the mood for a crime thriller and I love Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon. I thought it was weird that I had never heard of this movie but now I can see why.Kevin Bacon actually delivers in his usual role as a creepy rapist and Gary Oldman is not bad considering what he had to work with. I did have to snort at some of his overwrought intensity but it did not really seem like that was his fault as much as the filmmakers.I felt annoyed with the movie as soon as the Nietzsche quote appeared in the beginning it struck me as pretty clich. Then Oldman did his whole clear thing with the glass of water and I was like... OK that was a pointless prop he's showing the jury that water is clear just like the facts? That's pretty dumb. But as dumb as the movie was presenting itself to be it was truly I who was dumb thinking that with Oldman and Bacon this was still going to be a good movie.The dumbest thing about the movie is that the majority of scenes are completely pointless or make no sense. First of all the entire premise is stupid. Why did rich attorney Oldman go wandering around in the woods in the rain looking for Bacon in the first place just because he called him? Why did he run to find someone instead of just using the phone in his car? Why did he go to the extent of becoming his lawyer just to get a special in on him? The majority of the film is Oldman brooding and snooping around on his own little time is actually focused on the relationship which is supposed to be the whole point of his scheme. Why wouldn't the police have figured out right away that all the victims had been treated by the prime suspect's mother something that would have shown up in medical records? Even many small scenes had me going wait what? For example Oldman goes to Bacon's house presumably to meet him... snoops around the room until he gets caught by the mom and then he just leaves... so why was he there in the first place?? Why does he meet up with the cop lady in a playground with milk and cookies? Why does he imagine that he is having sex with Bacon's character honestly?? And why does the mom try to protect the son who is raping and murdering her patients??? And what was the point of even having the old man character? And why does Oldman visit him randomly in the hospital??? That was so random... like here's this old man you saw for two seconds in the beginning for no reason and oh yeah he's in the hospital for a few more seconds because why not.. And I had kind of zoned out by the end but how did Bacon even get into the courtroom alone with Oldman with a gun just by firing a few shots??I will say there was some interesting camera work and cool set design.But the most unbearable thing is the amount of dialogue. The few minutes of Bacon being menacing are actually scary but the majority of the movie is just people talking. Talking talking talking with no plot development. But whatever it's not like film is a visual medium or anything.I like how the film ended pointlessly with Oldman just walking out of the room... because I did not have the energy to sit through an attempt at an actual ending anyway. It was actually better with no ending because at least it was over sooner!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "I picked this movie because I was in the mood for a crime thriller and I love Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon. I thought it was weird that I had never heard of this movie but now I can see why.Kevin Bacon actually delivers in his usual role as a creepy rapist and Gary Oldman is not bad considering what he had to work with. I did have to snort at some of his overwrought intensity but it did not really seem like that was his fault as much as the filmmakers.I felt annoyed with the movie as soon as the Nietzsche quote appeared in the beginning it struck me as pretty clich. Then Oldman did his whole clear thing with the glass of water and I was like... OK that was a pointless prop he's showing the jury that water is clear just like the facts? That's pretty dumb. But as dumb as the movie was presenting itself to be it was truly I who was dumb thinking that with Oldman and Bacon this was still going to be a good movie.The dumbest thing about the movie is that the majority of scenes are completely pointless or make no sense. First of all the entire premise is stupid. Why did rich attorney Oldman go wandering around in the woods in the rain looking for Bacon in the first place just because he called him? Why did he run to find someone instead of just using the phone in his car? Why did he go to the extent of becoming his lawyer just to get a special in on him? The majority of the film is Oldman brooding and snooping around on his own little time is actually focused on the relationship which is supposed to be the whole point of his scheme. Why wouldn't the police have figured out right away that all the victims had been treated by the prime suspect's mother something that would have shown up in medical records? Even many small scenes had me going wait what? For example Oldman goes to Bacon's house presumably to meet him... snoops around the room until he gets caught by the mom and then he just leaves... so why was he there in the first place?? Why does he meet up with the cop lady in a playground with milk and cookies? Why does he imagine that he is having sex with Bacon's character honestly?? And why does the mom try to protect the son who is raping and murdering her patients??? And what was the point of even having the old man character? And why does Oldman visit him randomly in the hospital??? That was so random... like here's this old man you saw for two seconds in the beginning for no reason and oh yeah he's in the hospital for a few more seconds because why not..

	schema:reviewBody "Landru aka. Bluebeard may not be one of Claude Chabrol's best films but it's still a good and interesting one that does a lot right. Landru and his life and crimes are fascinating but infamously shocking and complex the film follows the subject very closely and deals with it also in a way that entertains and interests. If you are interested in Landru you're not going to be shortchanged here and there's a good deal to like judging it as a film too.As with all Chabrol films Landru looks great. The colour photography is very handsome and tasteful the period costumes are sumptuous and evocative and the scenery nothing short of exquisite. Chabrol handles the atmosphere cultures and environment of early 20th century Paris masterfully to the extent one feels like they're actually there in the era. He also directs beautifully with charm and tension Landru's scenes with his victims are both charming and chilling like Landru himselfin how he managed to get women to fall for him while being such an irredeemable monster on the inside and his crimes wrench the gut in how shocking they areeven if some details are still ambiguous. The way Landru's written is enjoyable on the whole too considering the subject Landru could easily have been melodramatic but the script opts for the sly and sardonic approach and does so cleverly and wittily without being too cartoonish that the most acidic moments are very juicy and the most cynical parts bite. The cast are stellar with a brilliant Charles Denner who cuts a very magnetic presence whether funny coldhearted cynical urbane or charmonthesurface and even looks eerily like Landru. Some may find that Landru is like a cartoon figure here but to me that added to how chilling a person he was. Michle Morgan Danielle Darrieux Juliette Mayniel and Catherine Rouvel are beguiling and poignant not with a lot to do but you really care what happens to them and Stephane Audran also really comes to life.The film's not without its problems once Landru is captured the pace does slacken and the film loses its charm the trial being on the tedious side rather than suspenseful and would have benefited from tighter pacing and more developed writing. What also would have helped was having Landru arrested a little earlier and dwelling a little less on his methods the film covers them well enough and I did wish that the same amount of detail went a little more into the trial. The music is also a little intrusive at times as well. Overall lesser Chabrol and I did prefer Charlie Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux as a loose? version of the story but still very interesting. The part of the film covering the arrest trial and execution doesn't come over as strongly as the parts detailing his life and crimes but the look of the film the atmosphere the direction most of the writing and the acting make it a most worthwhile film. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "James Stewart was being coy if he said he agreed to appear in this his last film while on holiday in Kenya  it's not a cameo he's in it all the way through and has the lion's share of the dialogue  what there is of it. The film is by Sanrio  the giant corporation that brought us Hello Kitty and who were making films at that time in emulation of Disney. Hani a director with some cult films under his belt was presumably told to go to Africa and make something with lots of cute animals. There are animals galore  nothing but animals in fact for about half of the twohour film  beautiful photography throughout  and that gives it an atmosphere all its own.The pace is mesmerisingly slow and at times it feels like Clare Denis. There's a beautiful teenage girl billed only as Kathy living with her reclusive grandfather Stewart in the forest on the edge of the savannah. The dim light inside their lodge is gorgeous. Lots of cute animals roam in and out  a kind of Daktari Monogatari.A light aircraft crashes in the wilderness and after a desperate time including getting caught in an impressive wildfire the survivor comes across the girl who is given to wandering around with hippy joiedevivre among the lions and wildebeest. The old man repels the new arrival at first but after a further disaster  a rainstorm even more impressive  reaches rapprochement. The whole things seems to convey an existential message.The acting though is awful  Stewart looks uncomfortable when he speaks to someone and gets silence in return  and the storyline is bland but the girl with her husky voice is winning and the animals about the house including Tikki the mongoose  who gets a tragic moment  are great. It's a children's film but there's none of Disney's archness and preachiness only a quiet drifting philosophical melancholy that weaves a memorable spell. This would have been my favourite film for a while as a 12 yearold.".

	onyx:emotionText "James Stewart was being coy if he said he agreed to appear in this his last film while on holiday in Kenya  it's not a cameo he's in it all the way through and has the lion's share of the dialogue  what there is of it. The film is by Sanrio  the giant corporation that brought us Hello Kitty and who were making films at that time in emulation of Disney. Hani a director with some cult films under his belt was presumably told to go to Africa and make something with lots of cute animals. There are animals galore  nothing but animals in fact for about half of the twohour film  beautiful photography throughout  and that gives it an atmosphere all its own.The pace is mesmerisingly slow and at times it feels like Clare Denis. There's a beautiful teenage girl billed only as Kathy living with her reclusive grandfather Stewart in the forest on the edge of the savannah. The dim light inside their lodge is gorgeous. Lots of cute animals roam in and out  a kind of Daktari Monogatari.A light aircraft crashes in the wilderness and after a desperate time including getting caught in an impressive wildfire the survivor comes across the girl who is given to wandering around with hippy joiedevivre among the lions and wildebeest. The old man repels the new arrival at first but after a further disaster  a rainstorm even more impressive  reaches rapprochement.

	schema:reviewBody "Claire Denis' Beau travail alongside Bruno Dumont's L'Humanit is a French film I wouldn't suggest to those who get easily bored in a movie theater. But if one is willing to forget the conventions of narrative cinema and accept the sometimes documentarian sometimes corporeally poetic way Beau travail approaches it's subject this should be a true treat for both the eyes and the mind.The story of the movie is thin as paper Galoup a sergeant in the French Foreign Legion has to deal with his jealousy when a new recruit called Sentain becomes a hero in the eyes of his men. Alongside Galoup's soldiers the only other important player in this bizarre drama is Forestier Galoup's superior who he obviously admires but who doesn't share his resentment for Sentain. Gradually Galoup's envy for Sentain becomes too much for him to take and his downward spiral begins.   Denis depicts with great sense for details how the military routines dominate every aspect of the legionnaires' and especially Galoup's life. This is portrayed effectively in the beginning of the film when the soldiers' crude attempts to dance in a disco are compared to their beautiful elegant movements during physical training. To Galoup military discipline has become the only form of selfexpression and for this reason he hates Sentain who tries to bring a little more humanity to the camp. Or does he? A curious aspect of the film is that we never see any of the things Galoup in his narrative accuses Sentain of. Only in the end Sentain acts against Galoup's strict orders and this could be seen as counterreaction to Galoup's obvious hatred and unreasonable forms of punishment the humane deed Sentain commits is something any soldier who isn't thoroughly programmed would do. So since the story is told from Galoup's point of view it could be argued that he has become paranoid that as soldier without a war or an enemy he is only looking for an object to his emotional output which the military life has distorted into hatred and envy and Sentain because of his one act of heroism happens to be an apt target.The above however isn't the only way to interpret the story. It is quite possible that Sentain acts the way Galoup says he does and this turns the movie into a triangle or a rectangle drama between Galoup Sentain and his men possibly even his superior. The only thing Galoup's seems to or is able to care about is the military and disciplining the legionnaires is his way of showing his affection. But this balance is broken by Sentain whom the men admire and who's actions are approved by Forestier. Since Galoup fears he is about to lose the very substance of his life he reacts the only way is familiar with by tightening his rule. Galoup's behaviour is of course bound to have repercussions but there is no other option he can possibly think of.Besides the way military life takes control of the men Denis' other obvious point is to show how absurd and pointless the army routines seem in the eyes of an outsider. During the film we see countless training numbers and war excercises and witness the soldiers dull everyday life but never do we see them doing anything useful. At one time the legionnaires build a camp in the desert but the only reason for this seems to be Galoup's desire to get some action to the bored men. Beau travail's antimilitaristic theme becomes even more obvious when the legionnaires' life is shown in contrast of the Africans who neighbour them. These people shepherd their herd weave mats sell things make food and watch with astonishment as the soldiers dig a hole in the middle of nowhere. The personal drama in the film becomes even more tragic when Denis shows just how meaningless is the system that produces these kind of human beings. In the terrific final scene of the film we see the whole scale of Galoup's desperation as it becomes obvious that he could never be anything else than a sad retired army officer with no chance of fitting into the civilian world.".

He is a jealous outsider jealous of Sentain. He is jealous of him not in love with him and there is a difference. Galoup Lavant truly loves Forestier but as Galoup points out Forestier doesn't care. Instead when Sentain appears Forestier is attracted to him in a way he was not to Galoup. Well Sentain is charming calm open attractive all the things Galoup is not. Sentain is one of the gang Galoup is an outsider and no matter how hard he tries he cannot get in. Much of the film is dialogue free but Lavant admirably shows what he is feeling with his facial and body gestures. And after all that falls out from this jealous rage Galoup is returned to France but still remains an outsider. No friends in the Legion nor out of it. And the finale Galoup dancing by himself in a very contorted way is one of the most agonizing I have seen. It represents well what Galoup's life is like. You should not see this film if you are looking for a homoerotic experience. It is not about sexuality but the rage of an outsider. As such it is brilliant.".

The cinematography displaying the men against the desert is breathtaking and the rhythm of the narrative sequences builds tension with a brilliant economy of means.

Unlikely Galoup is the only 'human' character in the film it's difficult to tell individual soldiers even Sentain.  After all that 's what the Foreign Legion in popular terms anyway is all about a refuge for the hunted somewhere to hide your identity and past become part of an anonymous mass.For me though there is something missing.  For all the cool gazing on the masculine body the absorbed interest in these very physical rituals in the feminising of their military discipline eg ironing repeating the same tasks day in day out like housewives there is a lack of the homoerotic charge lurching through Melville and Britten.  The gaze of the camera is of course Galoup's the narrative a visualising of what he writes and when he lies on the bed with his gun near the end we can't tell whether the gesture will be onanistic or suicidal.  The rushed hallucinatory climax full of Leonesque standoffs and ellipses are framed by a shot of Galoup asleep and a blazing white light when he awakes as if he like Noodles has dreamed the whole thing has sublimated his homosexuality into a murderous but consummated narrative reduced vast geographical terrain including three volcanoes whose explosive potential mirrors his own suppressed desire to a narrow site for a private rite a selfreflecting dance in an empty nightclub.And how cool is it that the real president of Djibouti is called Ismael!".

The gaze of the camera is of course Galoup's the narrative a visualising of what he writes and when he lies on the bed with his gun near the end we can't tell whether the gesture will be onanistic or suicidal.  The rushed hallucinatory climax full of Leonesque standoffs and ellipses are framed by a shot of Galoup asleep and a blazing white light when he awakes as if he like Noodles has dreamed the whole thing has sublimated his homosexuality into a murderous but consummated narrative reduced vast geographical terrain including three volcanoes whose explosive potential mirrors his own suppressed desire to a narrow site for a private rite a selfreflecting dance in an empty nightclub.And how cool is it that the real president of Djibouti is called Ismael!";

I served most of my army time in the Technician Corps the inglorious greasemonkeys repairing tanks or slacking. But the tedium of army life is our shared legacy with the Foreign Legion or the Special Ops.Denis subverts this in mocking feminism reducing that tedium to the meticulous ironing and creasing of uniforms and laundry. The savage beast is thus shown to be domesticated fussing over a crease. It's been a man's cinema this first century so perhaps we should get accustomed to the scorn and irony of female directors getting back at us. Nevertheless she makes a cutting remark that fastidiousness a matter of order and appearances is accomplished with these creases.Inside the discotheque where the strobe lights and Arab pop beats are equally kitsch and otherworldly the woman is mysterious and alluring exudes promises of sexual danger. In this game of seduction the Legionnaires are rapacious overly eager boys crossing and recrossing before the seductive female gaze and smile. This first part for me is two images. The flickering shot of an Arab girl's face gleaming with strobing colorful lights and the shot of Legionnaires etched in silhouette in an empty street by night.Here lies the brilliance of Denis though. We know the emerging story of a cruel superior taking an unfathomable dislike to the innocent footsoldier from Billy Bud Herman Melville's short story and how that innocence of face invites a hatred that seethes deeper but Denis reworks this entirely in terms of cinema. Looking at the sergeant's face we can read the portents of evil to come but she further paints it with pictures.Ideals don't matter here so Denis aptly carries her tragedy out to a sunbaked rocky desert. Perhaps she understood what she was doing as an opera but in those scenes where we see men flexing their muscles or performing curious rituals out in the open air the bombast of music and image verges on camp. I don't know much about camp though so this doesn't concern me overmuch. She also gives us a tracking shot and a wistful tune in the soundtrack which I find both to be beneath the filmmaking she exhibits in the rest of the film.Elsewhere she gives us images of colonial guilt a popular subject of the European intellectual where for example a process of Legionnaires carry a black man then they switch and he carries a white man on his shoulders. The Djibouti natives of that desert mostly observe this ritual of male aggression with indifference though curiosity or compassion.A lot of what the film does is only fair and although thematically it leaves me unfulfilled the apogee for me is the lasting impression. Of which Beau Travail leaves a strong one.".

	schema:headline " Billy Budd Revisited";
	schema:reviewBody "Every so often a movie comes out that conflicts me and these are the movies that take me quite a while to analyze. Sometimes it will take a second view to see if I missed some vital element or it will dawn on me later and thus I will have grasped what it was that at the moment seemed rather inconsequential. BEAU TRAVAIL Claire Denis' 1999 film is one of these movies. It is an adaptation of Herman Melville's Billy Budd  although adaptation should be expressed in a loose term. It tells the story of an army troop stationed at Djibouti training endlessly under the firm hand of a nearly expressionless Denis Lavant himself a training machine and the arrival of a young soldier played by the very beautiful Gregoire Colin who becomes the catalyst that triggers a response from Lavant. Colin as Sentain is the young rookie everyone loves and admires he has great beauty and is the epitome of masculinity. This ticks Lavant's Galoup to approach Sentain at an oblique angle and a scene in which both men face off resembles that of two lions about to attack and is a sequence of immense beauty because you see the hardened expression on Lavant's leonine face pitted against Colin's frightened yet set facade. This is what cinema is supposed to do tell a story without too much dialogue maybe a voiceover here or there as BEAU TRAVAIL does and then get to its denouement which in this movie is made more ironic than tragic. Where it falters a little is in its portentous score with a male chorus which is lifted from the opera version it's too intrusive and is reminiscent of the score used for 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY but there it had a purpose here I didn't see it. Frequent incursions into dance music also distract a little from the meat of the story. What I do admire is Denis' approach to the material. In bringing a strong homoerotic element to the scene she also manages to do what few gay directors have done create a visually mesmerizing work of art where male passion is expressed through what is appropriate of the gender physical activity. It's what I've always wanted to see an aggressive ballet of masculine energy which unfolds a deceptively simple story of attraction repulsion and envy. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " A very feminine film about masculinity";
	schema:reviewBody "The medium of film is blessed with the fact that with it it is possible to exploit the merits of almost every artform. Film can make use of still imagery like painting and photography and threedimensional albeit in a virtual sense imagery like sculpture. It is music with visuals  theatre without physical restrictions. Hence the possibilities of film are more numerous than any one other artform. However the medium's potential remains largely unexplored as very few filmmakers venture far past conventional dialoguebased storytelling. As a means of storytelling film is inferior to literature. The book after all is almost always better than the film. Dialoguebased storytelling is simply not the medium's fort.   Claire Denis with Beau Travail has reminded us of this by making a beautiful  and powerful film which is told largely  through imagery. The subject of Beau Travail is very masculine Men in the foreign legion  and in particular one man's bitter obsession with another when he feels his 'alpha male' status threatened. The manner in which the film is made however is very feminine. Instead of a logical causeandeffect structure the film has an ethereal fluidity. It is less made up of scenes than it is of dozens of segments  most of them devoid of a narrative   which flow in and out past each other sometimes reappearing later on sometimes not. In one such segment the tense relationship between Galoup and Sentain is shown as the two eyes fixed circle each other as if in some sort of surreal hatedriven ritual. This moment while being far removed from real human behaviour is through its striking symbolism as telling of the characters' inner experiences as any dialogue between them could be. Denis focuses on the details of the mens' lives in long fascinated shots observing almost every element of their lives  how they exercise rest fight dance swim iron eat and hate. She sees the beauty of both the men and the world they inhabit and shows this beauty as an integral if not THE integral part of the film. These many studied observations are small elements that together make up a remarkably rich whole. They form a film which has a depth and subtlety of perception which most male directors could not in my opinion achieve.Written by Dawid Bleja".

Ms. Denis who spent part of her life in Africa sees the similarities of both stories and together with her cowriter JeanPol Fargeau set to show us how the Melville novel impressed her.The group of legionnaires we meet are seen in different stages of their training. The men who come from different walks of life and countries have nothing to do. The only entertainment for them is dancing with the local women in bars. Galoup the second in command of this outpost is the narrator of the story. We realize he is telling the story from a civilian point of view since he is no longer a legionnaire.The man in charge Galoup is a strange person. He starts noticing how one of his men the mysterious Sentain does everything he is assigned to do and more. When a helicopter crashes and Sentain risks his life in order to save a pilot the troop commander Bruno Forrester suddenly sees in Sentain an courageous man. Forrester also observes how Galoup reacts to Sentain's sudden recognition. It's the commander who tells Galoup that backstabbing doesn't fit in the Foreign Legion but it's already too late. Galoup who is consumed in his dislike for Sentain takes his subordinate into the desert as a punishment which unknown to him will backfire on him.Claire Denis has amassed an interesting cast to give life to her vision. Agnes Godard the cinematographer has shot the film showing us great vistas of Djibouti and the Golf of Aden. The film has the feeling of a ballet as one watches the men's shadows on the ground as they meditate after a grueling training session. Even though there is no clear indication Galoup is gay but the way he watches Sentain leaves the viewer to think otherwise. The way Galoup touches Forrestier's bracelet is another indication of what is really troubling Galoup in spite of the fact he is seeing one of the local women.Denis Lavant an intense actor plays Galoup with such control yet it's clear to see what's eating him. Gregoire Colin another actor with a great range hardly utters a word throughout the film yet he comes across loud and clear in knowing what his superior is doing to him and being a better man for taking the abuse. Michel Subor is the troop's commander a man into himself but wise enough to detect all what's happening to the young people under his command.Clair Denis created an exquisite work of art.

	schema:headline " All the ingredients of a superb film...just not mixed yet!";
	schema:reviewBody "BEAU TRAVAIL is a curious film. It is based on the story 'Billy Budd' by Herman Melville and on the operatic adaptation by EM Forster of Benjamin Britten's magnificent BILLY BUDD and has all the right pieces in place to make a fine updated adaptation of the story. Unfortunately the script fails to find the message of the story and so there is much correct atmosphere but little character development.The original story revolves around a warship The Rights o' Man in the French and English war that takes on recruits while at sea. The Captain relates the story of how he was forced to hang the magnificently beautiful and loved new recruit Billy Budd because of an accidental death in part due to Budd's fatal flaw  his stammer. The Master at Arms notices Billy from the beginning as a creature of physical beauty and there is a strong physical attraction to the lad. Unable to cope with his feelings the Master at Arms plots for the downfall of the object of his desire and lust and it is his manipulation that results in Billy's hanging nearly causing a mutiny by Billy's shipmates. Billy is a Parsifal character  a 'guileless fool' who even in his sentencing to death still blesses the Captain of the ship.All well and good. The film here transplants much of this tale to a Foreign Legion outpost in Africa and much of the above is insinuated. The appropriation is so complete that portions of Britten's opera BILLY BUDD are used to set scenes. But there the magic stops. The 'master at arms' does not seem to desire the beautiful recruit but for some unexplained reason seeks to have him gone. Such a shame. It is as though the writer wanted to avoid homosexual overtones of the original and as a result the characters have no where to go. All of the actors are good the scenery is bleak a desert here instead of the bleak sea of the originaland appropriate the music is an eclectic mix that works. All the ingredients are here to make a fine film but it just doesn't come off. The director needed to see the old film version of Billy Budd starring Terrence Stamp to see that pitting the evil sadistic lusty master at arms against the virile sensitive and good young man can and does work well.".

I got all worked up over this one shower scene but the damn movie didn't deliver any money shot. Just some eunuch sudsing himself up before he ran off to have another cigarette.

	schema:headline " This is a visually gorgeous psychologically complex Melville adaptation.";
	schema:reviewBody "This updated adaptation of Melville's Billy Budd fascinates on multiple levels.  Set in a presentday outpost of the French Foreign Legion it focuses on the emotional and professional relationships between the Claggart figure Sgt. Galoup the Capt. Vere figure Commander Forestier and the Billy Budd standin Legionnaire Sentain.  The primary focus is ClaggartGaloup.  In contrast with the original source and most of its theatricalcinematic adaptations this film goes to some length to try to establish the motivation behind Claggart's Galoup's hatred of Billy. Here all the characters are social or domestic fugitives who've formed a new family in the Legion.  When the new popular conscientious but relatively unproven recruit Sentain finds favor not only with his peers but with the fatherfigure Forestier the reliable longserving and relatively unrewarded Galoup a loner who idolizes the old commander suddenly finds himself subject to unexpected and uncontrollable jealousy.  Thus the movie becomes a psychological study of family jealousy which echoes Cain and Able as much as the Melville source.  ClaggartGaloup is not a symbol of abstract evil nor the sexually jealous predator he's sometimes seen as but an emotionally vulnerable character broken by the unfairness of fate's rewards. The movie's plot and characterizations do not reflect the homoerotic tension that some interpreters find in the story but there is certainly a homoerotic element in its visual presentation.  As shot by Agnes Goddard who appears to be developing into one of the great cinematographers of our time much of the movie is visually indebted to Leni Riefenstahl. The sequences of soldiers training in the desert are certainly modelled on Riefenstahl's Olympiad and are equally beautiful. These scenes combined with desert vistas and flashes of ArabAfrican culture make the movie visually spectacular.  The movie has added sociological and psychological interest in its close observation of the details of life in an isolated community of highly disciplined men it made this viewer want to run home and iron all his shirts as a way of demonstrating masculinity.  It's interesting to note that this gorgeous complex film was shot on a miniscule budget in about 3 weeks' time and this makes one wonder where all the money goes that gets poured into so many mediocre  or worse  Hollywood films.".

I had also watched Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Morocco earlier in the day and was intrigued by the idea of watching 2 films set in the French Foreign Legion in the same day. The film pretty much fails on both counts. There are some interesting looking guys who are filmed at times in various states of dress looking hunky and hot in the Mediterranean sun  but this is not a flesh feast or even a good oldfashioned war movie. You can do better in that regard with a documentary about the Navy Seals. As for the storyline  I think I understand what the director was going for  a sort of strippeddown minimalist storytelling that echoes the minimalism of the North African landscape and architecture. But it really doesn't work. Instead one just feels that nothing is really happening and that the few incidents we are shown seem unconnected and often pointless. And of course maybe that is deliberate and meant to evoke the pointlessness of military existence but even if so it's not very entertaining and it doesn't really teach us anything we don't already know.".

And although the film is elegant in both its simplicity and purity I myself found it a shade too simple and pure to be completely effective.Still BEAU TRAVAIL has two things going for it director Denis' cinematic eye and superior performances throughout. One truly senses the location in all its elemental nature and the cinematography is remarkable for its restrained elegance. The cast follows suit with direct and underplayed performances that fold seamlessly into both Denis' atmosphere and the story itself and the result is often quite stylish.But for all its elegance and style I found BEAU TRAVAIL too introspective and subtle for its own good to me it lacks any significant substance with both story and characters slipping through my attention as easily as sand slips through my hand. While this is doubtlessly part of director Denis' intent and while I have admired many a film with a notably elusive touch my ultimate reaction to BEAU TRAVAIL is that it is a rather superficial exercise in style over substance and I cannot say that it leads me to interest in the director's other work.In passing I also note that BEAU TRAVAIL is often marketed as a film with homoerotic context and imagery but I personally did not find it so.

While this is doubtlessly part of director Denis' intent and while I have admired many a film with a notably elusive touch my ultimate reaction to BEAU TRAVAIL is that it is a rather superficial exercise in style over substance and I cannot say that it leads me to interest in the director's other work.In passing I also note that BEAU TRAVAIL is often marketed as a film with homoerotic context and imagery but I personally did not find it so. Final word worth a look but not greatly memorable for all that.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer";

Billy Budd was a tragedy brought about partly by the strictures of military discipline but was really a story of masculinity and power a powerful psychological study of three characters and personalities unable to coexist without damaging or destroying each other.French director Claire Denis transfers the story from the eighteenth century British navy to a unit of the French Foreign Legion in an African outpost. The exotic backdrop of the Foreign legion  with its allmale bonding and strict discipline  is inspired. Having the film narrated by Galoup the film's Claggart character is not. Claggart was fascinating to Melville because he could discern no real reason for his hatred of Budd it was ascribed to his nature and essentially unfathomable. Denis and the actor playing Galoup Denis Lavant seem to lack insight into his motives as well so he's a poor choice to carry the story. Equally frustrating is Denis' lack of focus on Sentain Gregoire Colin the charismatic Budd who's supposed to drive the action. Instead there's a lot of empty posing in the desert. The climax  the first real incident in an overlong film  is over too quickly to be satisfying.".

This cycle filmed in the eighties followed the precedent older cycle six Moral Tales. Where as the latter concentrated on middle aged married man tempted by another woman but who finally in relief returned to his wife Rohmer in the series of Comedies and Proverbs turns his attention towards younger female characters. But because it is comedy the tone is also much lighter and ironic. Here he examines the sexual freedom which in fact he disapproves but never condemns overtly in his films its consequences and how the younger generation is trying to live with a new set of rules.One of these rules never sleeps with the friend of her or his friend as often in earlier time with the traditional moral is finally broken. But there is more than a tale of love and seduction. It is a study of characters and how love creates a web of relationship among this small group of young urban professionals. As the relationships between them evolve the spectator finally feels some sympathy for the protagonists at first not very likable. Especially Blanche who is the center of the entire plot if one can tell of real plot in Rohmer film. Alone selfpitying infatuated with the irritating pretentious serial seducer Alexandre she blossoms when stricken by real love. She is opposed to her friend yet rival Lea physically as well mentally. With dark hair and tall Lea is freer sexually than the small lighthaired Blanche awaiting the great love for two years. The quest of Blanche is the perfect true love not just an adventure. Ironically at first she blindly falls in love with the great local seducer Alexandre.With discreet symbolism Rohmer gives clues about the different players.

In fact the spectator sees the town only through Blanche eyes mainly the pedestrian streets around the center the banks of the river Oise the Ricardo Bofil buildings where she lives. But I don't think the Cergy depicted could be viewed as often said as a reflection of a superficiality of its young 'yuppies' characters. The purpose of Rohmer was to see the impact of modern architecture on love life. But the answer is in the film It changes nothing. On the contrary it amplifies or underlines the love relationship between the different characters.'L'ami de mon amie 'is an extremely enjoyable film full of charm thanks to the direction of Eric Rohmer and the talent of its young actresses then in theirs early twenties like the young women they play. The frozen moment of happiness at the end of the film just before the credits contributes to its charm. But it is problematic Have the protagonist found enduring love? Will their love relationship and in the same time their friendship endure the strain of time? Nothing in fact is sure as irony is always present. But if ironic Rohmer doesn't despise his characters. On contrary he shows a real tenderness and comprehension towards them especially Blanche.One of the lighter films of Rohmer of course very talkative it is characteristic of all its work with good mannered young people in search of love while searching themselves.

Murnau out who he wrote his dissertation. His first article that got published in the year 1948 was titled directly translated Film art of space. In the year 1962 Eric Rohmer published his academic survey called The construction of space in Murnau's Faust. While reading about his surveys and articles it's no surprise that space in Rohmer's films seems to be as important as the plot.Eric Rohmer's career started with problems and it wasn't going forward. But when he got off the ground he proceeded more purposefully than anyone. When the new wave era ended in 1964 the directors of it started eventually finding their own path. Eric Rohmer started his series of six film The Moral Tales and continued with Comedies  Proverbs in the 1980's. L'ami de mon amie My Girlfriend's Boyfriend is sixth and the last one in the series. It builds around the proverb My friends' friends are my friends. The comical situations emerge between two women who unintentionally swap boyfriends.Two women suddenly meet while having lunch. One of the two women is Blanche she is a skinny uptight young woman who is still searching for herself. The other is Lea she's selfconfident and a very feminine person. They both have something going on with men so the main characters have their opponents shy Fabien and a true player Alexandre.While trying to figure out the space of My Girlfriend's Boyfriend I can't miss the futuristic city the characters live in. I got the feeling that Eric Rohmer isn't trying to tell a story of four specific people who live in France. To me he's telling about all the people living in these suburbs of Paris. The space of a futuristic city the city full of postmodern architecture without any past. This theme of the milieu leads to rootlessness. The people of this city have no past each of them like to analyze and talk about themselves. But none of them really know who they are.My Girlfriend's Boyfriend offered these kind of things for me. In addition to its intelligent narrative it is full of hilarious comical situations. Eric Rohmer builds four very interesting characters which will take you on board.My friends' boyfriends are my boyfriends.".

I got the feeling that Eric Rohmer isn't trying to tell a story of four specific people who live in France. To me he's telling about all the people living in these suburbs of Paris. The space of a futuristic city the city full of postmodern architecture without any past. This theme of the milieu leads to rootlessness. The people of this city have no past each of them like to analyze and talk about themselves. But none of them really know who they are.My Girlfriend's Boyfriend offered these kind of things for me. In addition to its intelligent narrative it is full of hilarious comical situations. Eric Rohmer builds four very interesting characters which will take you on board.My friends' boyfriends are my boyfriends.";

There is not quite as much pompous holding forth in this film that one has to suffer through with most Rohmer films set in contemporary times. Although as usual most of the people involved are exquisitely hyporcritical here it's fun the comedy is a little more blatant.

	schema:headline " Slowmoving but psychologically astute analysis of couples' crisis over commitment";
	schema:reviewBody "In French it's called My Girlfriend's Boyfriend and it's set around the time the movie was made in 1987. We meet Blanche played with great intensity by Emmanuelle Chaulet who lives in a new town near Paris CergyPontoise known for its ultramodern architecture. She's an ordinary civil servant working in the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. When she runs into a slightly younger college student at a computer school Lea they strike up a fast friendship. Keep in mind that for those who are looking for a lot of action and sudden plot reversals you will not find it here. Boyfriends and Girlfriends is primarily dialogue driven as well as an intimate character study and if you are willing to put up with the glacial pacing then you will find this film quite compelling. We soon discover that Lea is quite different than her newly found friend Blanche. Lea is a 'player' and she bemoans the fact that her current boyfriend Fabien has no initiative and with him all her games fall flat. She hints that maybe an older man would suit her better. Blanche on the other hand has fallen for Alexandre a slightly older guy who has a Ph.D in engineering and works for the local 'Power and Light' company. From the get go Lea recognizes that Alexandre is not Blanche's type since he's a ladies man and is not serious minded. Blanche however sticks to her adolescent infatuation and when they both run into the handsome Lothario at a local restaurant she's tonguetied and comes to the conclusion that she's made a fool of herself in his eyes. Lea soon announces to Blanche that she's taking a vacation to get away from Fabien. She reasons that perhaps there are more fish in the sea that she can catch. Lea gives Blanche her French Open ticket where she sits next to Fabien and a disinterested Alexandre who's with a friend Adrienne. Later Adrienne a gossip urges Blanche to go after Fabien while her remarks are inappropriate she still serves up the prescient remark that Fabienand Lea are trapped. Soon Blanche and Fabien end up seeing each other. They enjoy windsurfing together a sport which Lea has no interest in. Before you know it Blanche and Fabien find that they like each other more and more. Before kissing Fabien Lea cries not because they're tears of joy' but rather she still has some silly girlish ideas her infatuation with Alexandre. Blanche can't repress her sexual desires for Fabien so she sleeps with him but makes him promise that it's a one time deal and that he shouldn't tell Lea or anyone else about their rendezvous. Soon we realize that Rohmer's strategy is to document the crisis for these four young people in the summer before they commit to one another. Lea makes one last attempt to get back with Fabien but soon afterward at a caf reveals to Blanche that she's left him for good. And after Alexandre joins them at the caf Blanche realizes after listening to Alexandre's banter that she's been deluding herself about him all along. Blanche actually gets physically sick and excuses herself from the table leaving Lea and Alexandre to find out whether they're really meant for one another.In probably the best scene in the film Lea proves that she has the mettle to go 'toe to toe' with Alexandre. Her gambit is to confirm that Alexandre has no interest in Blanche. He immediately denies that he ever displayed any interest in her Did I lead her on? and then bluntly states that she's boring. Alexandre asks Lea if she'd like to come over to his place and Lea smartly replies I'm too young to set up house.Lea and Alexandre's conversation is interrupted by a scene with Blanche and Adrienne. Rohmer establishes that Adrienne is the odd woman out. Unlike the two couples she's basically a fool who's not serious about getting involved in a relationship. Adrienne mentions a young painterhe seems sensitive and Rohmer mocks her by utilizing a fade out to end the scene as she continues blabbing about nothing the only time Rohmer appears to 'fade out' in the entire film.We cut back to Lea and Alexandre's extended conversationLea states she likes to be wooed and wonders why Alexandre never did anything wild months before. He snaps his fingers and humorously offers a 'wild scenario' Let's runaway. I'll kidnap you! Lea doesn't find this wild at all so Alexandre bluntly states come live with me. Lea concedes that she might but it won't be for six months. Alexandre has met his match. Lea offers a deal where they both agree not to see anyone else for six months.Meanwhile Blanche meets Fabien and confesses that she was in love with an image and now realizes that Alexandre wasn't for her all along. The crisis continues for a moment when Blanche misunderstands Lea when they meet she believes Lea has been talking about Fabien but actually was talking about Alexandre all along.Rohmer wraps things up nicely with a pleasant happy ending. Lea and Blanche's friendship remains solid despite being sorely tested by their decision to begin new relationships. The bigger picture is that both couples are now ready to shack up for the longterm. Rohmer suggests that even the philandering Alexandre is ready to commit as he has met his match with Lea. And Blanche and Fabien the ones who refuse to 'play act' find mutual attraction through their mutual 'sensitive' nature.Boyfriends and Girlfriends could have used a little tighter editing especially in regards to the longwinded exposition but with its great dialogue and Rohmer's ability to chronicle each characters' inner turmoil this is a worthwhile film for the discerning and patient film goer!".

The Eiffel Tower is only seen in the remote distance.They focus on looks alone in choosing boyfriends.Blanche Emmanuelle Chaulet  Chocolat and Lea Sophie Renoir are friends. Not BFF but just two twentysomethings that hang and discuss men.Lea has Fabien Eric Viellard and Blanche is enchanted with Alexandre FranoisEric Gendron.Blanche gets herself in a situation where she is involved with Lea's boyfriend while Lea is off sampling others. Although they pretend to be friends the constant flirting takes it's toll and they end up in bed. But she still won't commit out of fear of hurting her friend.So what does she do when Lea announces she has broken up with Fabien for good? She realizes that Alexandre is an unattainable dream and goes off to find Fabien. Meanwhile Alexandre and Lea hit it off.The laughs are plenty as the two friends try to get their love lives together without hurting the other.Nothing deep like watching an episode of Friends but cute and enjoyable with Chaulet and Renoir providing excellent performances.".

Basically the movie follows the time honored plot of exchange of relationships.

The title in French is a pun the boyfriend of my friend would could become my boyfriend. Rohmer is known to be a political conservative but here he is hardly a moralist since he examines the sexual freedom of today's youth without condemning it.

Yes the pace is slow yes the film is loaded with dialogue but these characters are believable. We see relationships develop new ones arriving on the scene and old ones being broken up.  The drama is the drama of real life the characters are ordinary perhaps a bit better looking than ordinary young people living in a Parisian suburb there are no extraordinary things happening to them just ordinary things.  While Rohmer's story is realistic it is still pleasantly realistic.  It is just as romantically heartwarming as say While You Were Sleeping but it does not have to force us to suspend our disbelief.One piece of advice many people will fail to appreciate if you are a nonFrench speaker try to see this in a dubbed version not a subtitled one!

Everything is saturated with intent. The world created is special otherworldly.And then there is Rohmer. The story here is arbitrary one might as well tour a zoo or go on a shopping trip. The images and actor's impression is wholly unremarkable invisible by design. The camera is as unpretentious as possible and with study one can see some significant effort went into this apparent effortlessness. The whole point with Greenaway is to create a skin around his work with paths into the interior. The opposite is the case with Rohmer. He places his world squarely in the ordinary one you inhabit. Everything by its unremarkable nature points outward. All the meaning in this film comes not from the film but from the world we live in with the film providing paths from itself to us.Rohmer is all about framing  framing in such a way that the picture is ostensibly framed but actually everything but the film is framed. So we have films that are parts of cycles larger sets. Each set refers to something that exists beyond art and life proverbs or seasons or such. Not love or any of the normal bumpf that is all invented for the sake of ordinary art  instead the pure simple ordinary stuff of life. There is no one at all with the courage to do this but Rohmer. Jarmusch does it but only for irony. Tarkovsky did it but only by beginning with dream images.This is an intelligence that transcends ideas. Anyone who thinks this story has any content  either sweet or profound  is missing the point.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

It is true that the characters come alive in the last part of the film but it's too little too late. For its standard assumptions and stale premises have already taken their toll on it. however kudos to the cinematography and evocation of placeOf the five main characters Alexandre is the least fabricated. Although meant to be rather detestable he possesses the most individual identity. He has a smaller role but his is the most interesting the least wobbly and the most realand for these reasons emerges as the most likable. True one isn't expected to likeor dislike Rohmer characters and yet they're often interesting and certainly worth hearing and comprehendingand some do have real dimensions. And in this perhaps his most realistic endeavor shouldn't we expect even more actual character?The three females roles are the most scripted. I know they're supposed to be represent flat yuppie types but this approach is more patronizing than honest. Lea and especially Blanche promise far more in the first scenes than they are subsequently allowed to give. Why reign them in? Why immediately tie them down to men to romance to the endless prattle about love matchmaking and daydreams? Can they be given just a few ounces of selfdirection? I mean Blanche at 24 has a career job but why bother to even tell us thatshe bounces from one man to another and her cloying uncertainties and confessional style belie her screen presence. As does her falling for Alexandre which is even more incomprehensible to the viewer than it is to Lea and Fabien. It's as if Rohmer's Blanche falls in love but Blanche's Blanche would never fall in love. And yet that's about her only shown capacityapart from wind surfingin this her central role.Lea and Adrienne are even more annoying. Love seems to be their single occupation. They are shallow cattish malicious gossipy and vacuous. Since there are three women for two men in this incestuous world one has to be get lostand the least pretty does making an early exit. Indeed Adrienne is given no redeeming qualitiesand Lea has very few the storybook ending bailing her out a wee bit. So instead of being Rohmer's usual naive or not so naive leggy sirens they get to be smallmindedit's either Alexandre or Fabien bitchy dolts.".

Because of that I really recommend you stick with this one.The film begins with Blanche and Lea meeting for the first time. They soon become friends and begin spending their lunch hours together. Lea is the more vivacious of the two and she has a boyfriend Fabien. As for Blanche who is more the subject of this film she's rather lonely and has no love life. But over time as Lea and Fabien become more and more distant Blanche finds herself attracted to Fabien. Lea couldn't care lessas she is now falling for Alexandrea man Blanche had been interested in dating. What's next?

When I ask myself Why would he be interested in people like that? I have no answer. Maybe he identifies with them. Maybe he finds them fascinating.I love movies in which nothing much happens except character development but there has to be something interesting about the characters. The most interesting thing in this movie is an unnaturally clear turquoisecolored antiseptic lake that a couple go windsurfing on. I've never seen a lake like that in my life. These shallow people live in a sterile artificial city that looks like a brand new shopping mall and it's a real place not made up for the movie so maybe the lake is artificial too like a gigantic swimming pool on a golf course.Everything about this movie screams emptiness and artificiality so at least it is consistent. Maybe vacant people in a vacant city symbolize something important to Rohmer and his fans but they just bore me. I'm very interested in lots of things but spending almost two hours watching petulant spoiled shallow people irritate and bore each other isn't one of them.I'm giving it a star for consistency which alone is enough to lift it a little way off the bottom of the barrel.".

Furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask hence the movie's title! you'll get a crazedout swinging soundtrack classic bmovie action scenes partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives please remind the time of its origin! yelling scream queens and on and on... All those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness  highly recommended!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Der Frosch mit der Maske aka. Fellowship Of The Frog of 1959 is the first of the popular German Edgar Wallace movies but it certainly isn't one of the best. It has to be respected for inciting the wave of these Wallacebased German crime flicks that became extremely popular in the early 60s. Generally speaking I am a fan of the German Edgar Wallace flicks but I personally always preferred those dealing with a murder series to those dealing with supercriminals like this one. Also Fellowship of The Frog is a bit too naive for my tastes. Sure the German Edgar Wallce films never were nasty brutal or cynical like the Italian genrecinema in the 60s for example. Still the naivet is quite extreme here. This makes the film a pleasure to watch for its sentimental value but for me personally it doesn't go beyond that.Scotland Yard are in desperate search for a ruthless supercriminal wearing a frog mask whose henchmen can be identified by a frog tattoo on their forearms. The police have hardly any success in the search for the mysterious archcriminal even though the investigating chief inspector Siegfried Lovitz is a clever man. Richard Gordon Joachim Fuchsberger a rich man and hobby detective decides to investigate in the case himself with the help of his loyal butler Eddi Aren't...It is Aren't one of the absolute cultactors of the German Edgar Wallace 'krimis' who is responsible for many of the halfdumb but often very amusing gags in the film. Aren't an Edgar Wallace flick regular often played the more comical parts in these films often that of the butler and this is his first role to do so. Siegfried Lovitz is very good in the role of the chief inspector and the Eva Pflug fits in well as the seductive femme fatale. The rest of the performances are not necessarily breathtaking the greatest performances in Edgar Wallace flicks always came from the great Klaus Kinski but they're not bad either. The only awful performance comes from Walter Wilz who is quite terrible as a naive young guy. All things considered Fellowship of the Frog is an important film for its value as the first of the German Edgar Wallace films. Nevertheless I recommend other Edgar Wallace flicks such as Das Indische Tuch aka. The Indian Scarf way over this. Fellowship Of The Frog is a fun film to watch but only for sentimental values. Recommended to fans of the German Edgar Wallace films.".

	schema:headline " Despite its shortcomings its a must see for krimi fans";
	schema:reviewBody "While I enjoy watching these Germanmade krimis I've yet to find one that I just love and can recommend without hesitation. That holds true with Fellowship of the Frog. The best I can say is that it's about average. The plot is twisted and nonsensical like you'll find in most krimis. I won't even attempt to go into it other than to say it involves a masked criminal known as The Frog who with his seemingly endless supply of flunkies is responsible for a string of robberies and murders in London. For reasons only he knows the Frog seems to have set his sights on a young woman named Ella Bennet and kidnaps her brother Ray to get to her. It's up to Scotland Yard and an amateur detective named Richard Gordon to put a stop to this devious criminal.There are several things in Fellowship of the Frog to enjoy. The film gets off to a nice start. It's appropriately dark and foggy with the requisite smoky though unmemorable jazz score playing in the background all helping to create a nice sinister atmosphere. The movie features a couple of faces familiar to even a novice fan of krimis like myself  Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddi Aren't I'm sorry about the apostrophe but the IMDb spellchecker seems intent on putting it there. While both are quite good I especially enjoyed Aren't's unusually quiet performance as the allknowing butler James. However when the second act begins most of the good feelings I was having toward Fellowship of the Frog came to an end. To call the second act slow would be a gross understatement as the movie all but grinds to a halt. I had to go back and play a couple of scenes over to make sure I hadn't missed anything as my mind wandered. Fortunately my persistence was rewarded with a delicious twist near the end that's as shocking as any I've seen recently. It almost saves Fellowship of the Frog from mediocrity.One final note I understand from doing a little research that this movie is notable for being the first of the Edgar Wallace based krimis produced in the 50s and 60s. Because of that fact and regardless of the film's shortcomings Fellowship of the Frog is necessary viewing for anyone calling themselves a fan of these movies.".

The brother is convicted of the capital crime and sentenced to death only to find the executioner is someone very familiar to him.As other have said this is the first of West German Edgar Wallace krimis. It's certainly not the best but it is pretty entertaining. The comical sidekick here played by Eddie Aren't would become a staple of this series to the annoyance of some but personally I don't think this kind of comedy really hurts these films that much because the plots are already delightfully absurd and villains like the Frog are more than a little cartoonish to begin withbut I mean that in a good way. The butlersidekick here kind of anticipates perhaps even influenced? the Kato character in the Pink Panther series in that he is always sparring with his boss to keep him sharp. The bigger liability here however is the American protagonist himself. But Joachim Fuchsberger who was in nearly all these movies would get a lot better in the future entries in the series especially when he got to play an English detective a role at which the German actor was much more convincing.But in addition to the serialcomic strip elements of the plot there is also a little bit of raciness courtesy of Lolita Eva Pflug and some surprisingly gruesome violencethe centerpiece murder and a scene where the Frog very violently dispenses with one of his accomplices. In any event if you enjoy the German krimi series or the later but the closely related Italian gialli you certainly won't want to miss this first one.".

He is one of the key players in the criminal underground here and prefers to kill his enemies with poison. I personally felt early on also the introduction there were a couple scenes that were interesting and they certainly could have turned this into an edgeofseat crime thriller. Instead the inclusion of far too many characters and unintentionally comedic elements made this 87minute film uninteresting for the most part. Quite a shame as there was certainly the possibility of a better film here. Eis and Bartsch adapted this Edgar Wallace work over 25 years after Wallace's death and the duo worked on several of these German Edgar Wallace films.

Unexpectedly the young girl encounters a brighteyed red fox however the untamed wild animal flees in an instant leaving her longing to meet again. Since then a whole winter has passed and still no sign of the elusive fox but with the arrival of spring the girl determined to find the animal finally locates its den and an ambitious effort to grow accustomed to each other begins. As we witness a succession of compelling scenes lost inside the enchanting and breathlessly exquisite landscape we observe the bond between a human and a savage animal grow gradually stronger yet a wish and question emerge. If only we humans could talk to the wild beasts and if we could could we ever become friends?";

I therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes when suddenly two additional actors the girl as a grownup woman and her son are introduced. Another shortcoming is the music which is often intrusive Hollywoodlike and sometimes inappropriate I couldn't bring an English popsong together with French mountain glory.

	schema:reviewBody "THE FOX AND THE CHILD is the latest film from MARCH OF THE PENGUINS filmmaker Frenchman Luc Jacquet. The movie which boasts just one human being in its cast young actress Bertille NolBruneau tells the story of the rather rare though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox.Partnature documentary and partfairy tale the film focuses on L'Infant the child who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting possibly France though the exact location is never mentioned. Over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox who she begins to call Lily once again. And so it goes on. Days turn to weeks and then the summer disappears turning to fall and then winter promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping white winter landscape. Eventually spring comes around again and the young child finds her fox and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal. And so on.I had little to no expectation for THE FOX AND THE CHILD. I had seen MARCH OF THE PENGUINS and was simply in awe at the filmmaking contained in that movie. Luc Jacquet is a hugely talented and indeed rare filmmaker and I was expecting some superb breathtaking cinematography sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife. This was delivered in spades. But here Jacquet has a screen writing credit and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening I expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'March'. A fictional story.The child and the fox And the story is simple. A young seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school seemingly on her own every day seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world. Without the hint of an adult in sight. Brilliant. So she strikes up a friendship with a fox.With a film like this you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience. This is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of I'd say six and up. Or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet Sunday afternoon. Not a 31yearold male who gets his kicks from films like the recent brilliant WANTED and the like. But me being the newbie London critic I put myself in the shoes of an excited eightyear old girl for the 95 or so minutes of THE FOX AND THE CHILD. Now I have a few problems with this film. As a 31yearold lad and loyal lover of all things cinematic I loved the wildlife and landscape photography. It's visually stunning. The direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed  as good as you will find on any of Attenborough's efforts. As an impressionable short attention spanning eight year old I loved about the first half hour  then I lost interest. It's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child particularly the rather dark ending. As a 31yearold male  I was a little frightened in places. Wuss.So it's not a child's film. It's not really an adult film and I felt a little let down. Is it a good family film. Depends. It's educational maybe and the film carries a message. It's definitely not a film I would pay the hard earned green to go see and I'm racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer. It's hard but I know some will go see and fall in love this film. It's very European in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks give it a try. Unsure? Well I'd wait for the DVD for a wet Sunday afternoon in then.  Paul Heath httpwww.thehollywoodnews.com July 2008.".

Here the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains which provide for plenty of beautiful picturepostcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture.But while we indulge in wistful scenery the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset and we have to wait a few seasons to past and 45 minutes into the film before they find a leveler in food. The child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement but the fox well as other notions of course. While I thought the narrative was pretty weak unlike March of the Penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what's happening on screen what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator and a prey.Between the two more tension and drama was given to the latter especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves and granted those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it. Otherwise it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing. There were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren't really quite suitable for children as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly so parents you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers.As a film I would've preferred this to be a complete documentary ala The March of the Penguins but I guess the way it was resented probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature and that some things are just not meant to be and should stay as such. Decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between Bertille Noel Bruneau and the multiple foxes that played Renard.".

The plot is quite slight as you could describe it in one sentence A young girl encounters a fox in the forests surrounding her home and so tries to get closer to it. Of course this one sentence plot is deceptively simple. By trying to get closer to the fox the young girl wants to get literally close enough to the fox to touch but also close enough to it for it to be her animal friend. But as well as that the plot allows room for such subject matter as fox hunting domesticity vs. nature comingofage and the folly of trying to tame forces beyond your control. The crisp highly defined photography of the forest the mountains and its wildlife inhabitants is absolutely astounding. Just utter jawdropping breathtaking knockout beauty that can scarcely be believed. To merely describe the sights seen in this film would be an injustice. They must be seen to be believed. For any children that watch this the film will delight them to no end. For adults this is equally true. The fox of the title  or foxes as there were numerous foxes used to portray just the one  is without speaking or emoting in any human terms quite a fantastic fox. But not a Mister as it's a female fox. Just y'know FYI. But a problem that I DID have with the film is its narration read by  in the English version  Kate Winslet. To me the narration is far too story bookishly read and a bit clunkily written too. As a personal preference I'd have rather the film had no narration at all and just let the wonderful images speak for themselves. Or if not that I wish the narration had at least been written a bit better. Other than that big flaw of the film it's a joyous experience of a film that anyone can enjoy up until a certain dark morbid and tear jerking bit near the end which needs to be there and that if you can catch it you should most certainly give it a go.

The movie I saw did NOT have the mother or son at the end merely a painting of a girl with a fox. Can someone enlighten me on that? Anyway I really enjoyed this movie although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through. Still worth it if they can sit still.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the French countryside a beautiful redheaded girl spies a fox. Its love at first glance. Thereafter the young lass uses much of her free time looking through the meadows and woods for her new friend. At one point the young girl breaks a leg and must stay indoors for quite a spell. Her parents bring her books on foxes which she devours. Soon she is back outside after the winter has passed. Meanwhile the fox has had a scary runin with a wild cat but made it to a hole exhausted but alive. She also finds her mate and delivers two young foxes. Through some instinctive miracle the fox does let the young girl pet her from time to time. Also when a large bird of prey decides on a young fox meal the girl is there to cover the pup with her body until the danger has passed. Will the girl and her fox remain friends forever? This is a stunningly beautiful film with superb photography. Animal lovers will rejoice at seeing the world through a fox's eyes and admire the little girl's avid interest in the natural world near her home. Also Kate Winslet's English narration is quite wonderful too. But alas the scary moments are very real for nature is often cruel. This will upset younger children and sensitive viewers who love creatures but hate the harsh eatorbeeaten world. This reviewer for example couldn't finish the film for there were too many close calls for the fox and her family. But if you are the type who can just celebrate the life of animals no matter what the results this is probably a film you don't want to overlook.".

It is also worth viewing as a touching story of the personal development of a young girl emotionally maturing during her friendship with the fox. Young children will also enjoy the film as a  though somewhat conventional  adventure story.Unfortunately even though many emotions are beautifully depicted using fine literary and cinematographic means the film has an annoying tendency to also work with very oldfashioned heavyhanded narrative techniques. In particular the girl's emotions as well as the lessons she learns from her adventures are often rehashed in explicit comments from an intrusive narrative voice in fact her own voice as she remembers her adventures a decade later. This gets particularly irritating in those cases where those comments are given repeatedly. Usually the intrusive narrator just restates emotions that are obvious anyway but in a few cases her comments are even required to fully understand details of the plot.Besides the plot contains a few gaps that seem hard to fill in you might perhaps call some of them inconsistencies harming the overall credibility of the film. So you will need to take it with a grain of salt and definitely with a larger dose of passion than of reason and logic...All the same viewing the film together with your six to eleven year old children will probably be a rewarding experience providing lots of subject matters to be discussed afterwards.".

It came and went with little fanfare but I enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage. The story while nice is really incidental. If you actually thought about it there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life. I just saw it again tonight here in the States on DVD. Again I gather it has very limited distribution. Blockbusters only had one copy of it and I don't recall it ever playing in the art houses in Cleveland.Seen on my TV the photography is not as breathtaking though it is still very beautiful. The wildlife footage is still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around when you know where it's headed.Still as I said the story is incidental. It's a beautiful film to watch and if you like wildlife footage you should find this fascinating.I saw this movie again tonight almost a decade after I first saw it in the theater. I still find it to be an often astoundingly beautiful film visually. The views of the animals and the landscape are just breathtaking. Not as breathtaking as in a theater but still a joy to behold.The child I still find aggravating. The music is good though and Kate Winslet does a wonderful job of reading the English narration so I wouldn't turn off the sound.I would try to ignore the child though. While she is sometimes beautifully photographed her character is the only disagreeable spot in this otherwise so very beautiful movie.This would definitely be a good movie for children by the way. It teaches a lesson that all humans should learn wild animals are just that. No matter how cute they are they need to stay in nature and cannot be turned into pets.".

Most of all this movie is terribly boring. Literally NOTHING happens. I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like well then the winter comes and then spring and then there's an eagle and a river and one time it is dark and the girl goes into a cave and another time the fox has babies and so on. After about half an hour I began sighing yawning rolling my eyes cursing the reviewer at the radio station and hoping that it would be over soon. But the movie went on and on. When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the movie are a The girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie one year and shows exactly two facial expressions Joy and Seriousness. She is cute no question about that. However a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her alltoohuman presence. I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear drown in the river or something similarly terrible. b The commentary by the girl's adult voice which tells us nothing but negligible obvious boring redundant things. c The music which is desperately lacking subtlety. When the girl is happily jumping around the music jumps around too. When the fox is threatened by an eagle the music becomes threatening too. It reminded me of the very early days of filmmaking and was just too predictable to enjoy. Admittedly many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it at least they got somehow involved. Thus my warning concerns adults only If you are over ten years old avoid this movie. You can get a better and cheaper sleep in most other places.".

For that I have this movie to thank.Being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand I was sure I was going to like it anyway. But I didn't just like it I loved it.The technical mastery is astounding. How did they do it? How did they capture the animals in the way they did?? It's just wonderful.The moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so French and ambiguous it's a happysad one. Again it caught me a bit offguard. As a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people I would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours! Perhaps it's because the ending made me think back to what I left.But for those few hours on the plane I was happy to see something new and original. And that's life. Sure there are those things you love and feel comfortable around...but the great outdoors holds many a mystery. So the next time I see something out of the ordinary while out in the open I'm going to explore it observe it and embrace it. That's precisely what happens in this movie and that's precisely what you should do with this darn good movienature doc too. 810 P.S. It's two months on from the plane journey. We still don't know when we'll see each other again but we will.".

One thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar. This movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it in trying to make a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be. Even after the terrible events with the main fox the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a horrible story it tells. The final narrated dialog was so stupid by which time my wife and I were screaming at the TV! I absolutely hated this movie and would never recommend it to anyone!".

I was taken back to the time I found a tiny sugar glider caught in the barbed wire of Taffy's paddock and taking it home to recuperate for a couple of weeks and then letting it go back into the wild afterwards.

It is easy to imagine this movie being an inspiration for Monty Python later on and it isn't surprising to learn that George Harrison in particlar became good friends with Michael Palin and Eric Idle of Python fame.  Now imagine what a combined BeatlesPython movie would've been like! One scene in Help! which I particularly remember is the Leo Mckern the cult leader dressed in his sari drinking tea and collegially discussing his religious beliefs with an Anglican priest.  Of the Beatles John and Ringo have most of the funny lines and the movie exaggerates the idea of George being tight with his moneyplaying poker with Ringo at Buckingham Palace pilfering rings from a jeweler pretending he can't find his wallet thus forcing Ringo to pick up the tab at a pub.  The caricature personas the Beatles adopted for this movie in particular became the way many fans viewed them which I think George found to be alternately ironic and irritating since he insisted he was nothing like the movie version of himself.".

During this era they morphed from the innocent fab four into the premystical Beatles that came about in late 1965 with the advent of their wonderful Rubber Soul lp.Yes I loved these guys from this era of time. If you're old enough to have experienced the British Invasion then you can show an appreciation of how the music once was short and sweet. To put it simply most pop music that came out of this era was short around 2 minutes and 30 seconds and sweet enough to reveal a new type of rock n' roll that never existed before the advent of the Beatles the Rolling Stones the Yardbirds Chad and Jeremy the Dave Clark 5 etc etc etc.It's too bad that this era didn't last long enough for us to enjoy. Before you knew it it was gone like a morning mist. Even the American versions of garage rock like Gary Lewis  the Playboys and the Turtles disappeared as discontent with the establishment and Vietnam sapped all of the collective innocence out of us.It was an era of music that was in essence nonpolitical Beatles music as well as other bands were geared toward boygirl love relationships and that was all. Barry McGuire then blew us out of the water with his Eve of Destruction around September 1965. This of course caught the Beatles by surprise and they quickly changed their music from the typical love songs and became more creative in their talents by releasing Day Tripper with We Can Work It Out as a flip side.Help! is a remnant of the final days of innocence when Vietnam was just entering the nightly news night after night after night and when the domestic disturbances on college campuses and ghettos was coming to a head.This is what Help! represents to those who study this era. It was still a time when we could still help to avoid the problems that were beginning to plague American culture society and politics. It still showed the Beatles as innocent and funloving mop tops that many people still prefer over their reemergence as mystical drugexperimenting replacements two years hence. I know that I still prefer them as innocent mop tops but reality has shown that they were far from innocent even during their early days in Hamburg.All that aside this is still my favorite era of Beatledom.".

	schema:headline " Weird little throwaway film with great music";
	schema:reviewBody "Because my mother is a huge Beatles fan I saw this movie a lot when I was a kid. It may look weak in comparison to A Hard Day's Night widely regarded as the Citizen Kane of rock musicals. But it's an easier film for a kid to relate to. Instead of a realistic ironic mockumentary about the lives of rock stars it's a harmless escapist fantasy that has precious little to do with the real Beatles. These are the Beatles of myth the four asexual men who all live in the same house which is supposed to pass for an automated futuristic type of home at least to audiences in the 1960s. I suppose that as a kid I got a kick out of the idea of having a vending machine in one's own home. Somehow I never asked myself what the advantage of that would be and the film never does either.Looking back on the film as an adult I have a hard time determining what it is I liked about it. Certainly I can't remember laughing at any of the jokes. In fact I was vaguely aware that most of the jokes fall flat. In contrast the Monkees' TV show modeled heavily on this movie was often quite funny. The superintendent who does a bad Cagney imitation and inexplicably begins every sentence with the words So this is the famous.... left me staring at the screen blankly. This is quintessential British humor revolving heavily around people's nonchalant reactions to bizarre events. It's a brand of humor that has great potential to be funny here it's just strange probably because none of the ideas are all that inspired. The idea of a tiger who likes Beethoven might have sounded good on paper I suppose but it doesn't come together on screen. I suppose it could have been used as the setup for a funnier joke instead it's used as the punchline. At least I was able to get that joke when I was a kid. Many of the other jokes involve references that went over my head such as the line It's the brain drain his brain's draining. Those sophisticated enough to know what the brain drain is are likely to be too old to appreciate such a pedestrian pun.The Beatles themselves do not emerge in this film as talented comic actors to put it mildly. Their line readings are wooden their comic timing is off and their apparent attempts at improvisation are pathetic as in their continual ho ho hoing throughout the film. The Beatles were supposed to have been very funny on stage and in interviews but none of that ability translates to the screen. It may not have been their fault. The characters they play are given no identifiable traits and as a result they come off as interchangeable except for Ringo because of his role in the plot. Instead of giving them distinct comic personas to play the film turns them into straightmen who are the victims of a zany insane world that's conspiring against them. This is presumably what led the real Beatles to complain that the film reduced them to extras in their own movie.So why do I have so much affection for the film? Probably because I was just sort of enchanted by the events. The movie has a lot of the types of scenes that delight kids like the aforementioned automated house as well as a ton of weird gadgets. The various methods in which the Beatles attempt to remove the dreaded ring from Ringo's finger is the best aspect of the film plotwise. It may not make me laugh but there still is a certain pleasure in watching these scenes. Besides I've always liked movies about Thuggees. Along with Gunga Din Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and a somewhat darker film from 1988 The Deceivers Help! convinced me that Thuggees were a real group existing in modern times. How disappointed I was when I grew up and eventually learned that the actual cult was destroyed by British forces in the early nineteenth century. Temple of Doom at least alludes to that fact and bases its plot on the premise that the cult has secretly survived. Help! never explains how Thuggees could be around in the twentieth century you just have to accept it.But the most obvious reason why I still like this film is the wonderful music. It actually has a better soundtrack in my opinion than A Hard Day's Night. Among the songs that Help! popularized are not just the hits like You're Gonna Lose That Girl Ticket to Ride You've Got to Hide Your Love and the title song but also lesser known tracks like The Night Before and Another Girl. The earlier film appropriately focused on their dance music. The songs from this film have a greater focus on harmony and musical virtuosity.".

	onyx:emotionText "Because my mother is a huge Beatles fan I saw this movie a lot when I was a kid. It may look weak in comparison to A Hard Day's Night widely regarded as the Citizen Kane of rock musicals. But it's an easier film for a kid to relate to. Instead of a realistic ironic mockumentary about the lives of rock stars it's a harmless escapist fantasy that has precious little to do with the real Beatles. These are the Beatles of myth the four asexual men who all live in the same house which is supposed to pass for an automated futuristic type of home at least to audiences in the 1960s. I suppose that as a kid I got a kick out of the idea of having a vending machine in one's own home. Somehow I never asked myself what the advantage of that would be and the film never does either.Looking back on the film as an adult I have a hard time determining what it is I liked about it. Certainly I can't remember laughing at any of the jokes. In fact I was vaguely aware that most of the jokes fall flat. In contrast the Monkees' TV show modeled heavily on this movie was often quite funny. The superintendent who does a bad Cagney imitation and inexplicably begins every sentence with the words So this is the famous.... left me staring at the screen blankly. This is quintessential British humor revolving heavily around people's nonchalant reactions to bizarre events. It's a brand of humor that has great potential to be funny here it's just strange probably because none of the ideas are all that inspired.

Unlike 'A Hard Day's Night' 'Help!' takes more of a story approach and is less of a documentary about the lives of the band. Ringo is the star of the show and this was probably down to his excellent performance in 'A Hard Day's Night'. The film is about a cult who is after Ringo as a human sacrifice because of a ring that he is wearing. Along the way they meet different characters and different locations in a James Bond style theme. Like 'A Hard Day's Night' the film contains the wacky humour  some good photography and music clips. The photography is not as stunning as some of the scenes in 'A Hard Day's Night' however. The playing field scene in 'A Hard Day's Night' is a difficult one to beat anyway.I slightly prefer this film to 'A Hard Day's Night' for the story value and it is much more engaging with less slowmoving seeminglyunscripted parts. Overall it is much more focused. Whereas the former is more for Beatles and music enthusiasts 'Help!' is made for a wider audience who can still enjoy the Beatles music but who can also enjoy the story. And if you enjoy this film check out the Monkees television series too.".

The cult believes it to be necessary for their ceremonies while the scientists marveled at the industructable jewelry imagine themselves quite powerful if they were to own it kind of like a Beatles version of the Hobbit. Everyone scrambles around in slapstick format like it was Blake Edwards 'The Great Race.' It is so comical and so simple kids might enjoy the strange atmosphere and slapstick nature of this movie. I particularly like the little joke about the 'Royal Fuse' going out at the substation or when George tells Ringo that he should let them cut off his finger because he'll get good money from the insurance and probably more because he's a Beatle.It doesn't matter that the Beatles couldn't act. They didn't stick them in movies expecting to make cinematic masterpieces. They were just vehicles for their music between scenes you have your standard minivideos featuring the famous 'Ticket to Ride' and title song 'Help! and of course the Beatles popularity. Their stiffboard expressions actually seem much funnier when compared with these insane people running around after them. Ringo in particular as he seems more like the youngest of the bunch and perhaps the most naive. I love how everyone disbelieves that anyone is trying to sabatoge him in the beginning when the cult tries several clandestine and unsuccessful methods of stealing Ringo's ring.The movie does go on a bit too long as most Beatles movies tend to do. After that George Harrison song 'I Need You' plays during their pseudowar scenes the remainder of the film tends to get dragged out a little too far. It would've been better to end it somewhere not far minutes once that song passes. It isn't the best of the Beatles movies Magical Mystery Tour is in my opinion the worst probably because it lacks the visual beauty and psychadellia that Yellow Submarine had.

This was their followup to their amazing A Hard Day's Night a classic that rates as the greatest rockband movie ever made.Help pales in comparison to its predecessor and often is criticized deeply for this failure.In the story Ringo comes into possession of a holy ring that is the honorarium worn by the intended sacrificee of a sect of Khaili worshipers Khaili is the Hindu god of death and destruction. The sect goes through stages of trying to get the ring back to then decreeing that Ringo himself must be sacrificed. The 4 band members are assisted by a member of the sect who isn't into the whole sacrifice ideology. The sect's attempts to get at Ringo grow more and more creative and insane and the Beatles are forced to constantly flee from England to Austria to the Bahamas under the protection of Scotland Yard and The British Army. Mixed in is a mad scientist Victor Spinetti who wants the ring for his own mad devices. The movie is a typical earlymid 60's farce much in the genre of Peter Sellers no surprise as director Richard Lester directed many of Sellers' movies. The problem storywise is that at times it tries to be a James Bond spoof at other times it tries to be a spoof of If It's Tuesday This Must be Belgium and other zany comedies. The movie could not decide which kind of a farce it was to be and loses the battle when compared to the cohesive Liverpudlian comedy of A Hard Day's Night. Lastly the movie is filmed during the height of Beatlemania when the lads were already tiring of all the pressures and lack of freedom and time. In some cases you can see they just shot the scenes as a lark and didn't care whether it was perfect or not. Off screen the Beatles themselves say they were not into the movie they wanted to do a serious movie perhaps a Western and were getting into potsmoking and were kind of stoned through filming. In spite of all this the film is actually quite clever and enjoyable and fits in with many of the sillier comic chase films of that era. If one remembers this movie was meant to be silly and not funny and remembers it is a farce not a creative work of inspired genius it is very enjoyable and fun to watch even after 40 years.".

I believe that this film is much more fun because John Paul George and Ringo are having fun and so will you.";

There's not really a Lord of the Rings element to it being that the ring isn't going to destroy the entire world or not if it gets destroyed. In a way it's a MacGuffin even as there is many a line exchanged about the importance of a finger and how much Ringo might need it or not if chopped off. It could be anything just as long as it has those quickwitted and quickfooted chaps from Liverpool on the run from the dastardly foreign royalhunters and the scientists.To describe all of what happens in Help! would take up more than a page load but to put it really quick some of the highlights Beatles in the Alps Beatles in the Bahamas Beatles in a royal palace and all going back to the temple! Well those aren't really highlights but there's lots of great nuggets of gags and jokes in there. In fact I'd say that the first half of the film while the boys are still wondering why the hell they're being chased all around just for the big red rock on Ringo's finger is purely wonderful spoton comedy where the irreverent goes to very long lengths including title cards surprising exchanges and all in very broad strokes. No need to know what these fellows are really like that's never a point to be made. They're too busy for that what with getting tailed every which way recording songs playing songs dancing sometimes randomly when an alarm clock goes off or getting out of places in outrageous breakoutofwindow fashion and then even getting caught in the middle of a military assault. All of it is pulled off via Richard Lesters's direction with a full understanding of how this being silly and the Beatles going for it allows for so many possibilities and almost all of them are realized.The soundtrack by the way is definitely a favorite from the early Beatles days with the classics of the title track Ticket to Ride Got to Hide Your Love Away and Lose that Girl among others. They all fit in very well with the story too or what's there of it. And the climax which almost becomes anti in the last couple of minutes is actually a given considering all that's happened it caps off a 'why not' attitude to the situations that unfold. Also quite a few excellent quotable lines too. It's one of the best pictures of 1965. Grade A".

There are as many good comedic devices as bad but the best of them predate some of the anarchic humour of Monty Python and some of the group interplay echoes if distantly the drollery of the Marx Brothers.The film therefore moves at a fast tilt from the off with the songs reasonably well spaced out. Lennon emerges with the main plaudits with the classics Help! Ticket to Ride and the mature Dylaninfluenced You've Got To Hide Your Love Away. McCartney and Harrison contribute quality highgloss pop of only slightly lesser standard and all these songs are given entertaining promovideo backings which work well independent of the surrounding whole.The four can hardly be said to be stretched in the acting stakes and more than in A Hard Day's Night seem a bit less individualistic here. Their repartee is shared around so that no one really takes precedence which might of course have been the aim. There's strong support in the mainly British cast with Leo McKern doing a good comedic turn as the chief thuggee and Eleanor Bron quietly effervescent often riffing off Paul.The film does drag a little even over its short playing time as it draws to its end this viewer feeling a little worn down with all the sight gags changes of perspective and general popart enthusiasm of director Lester. That said it can be seen to encapsulate the swinging times of its genesis so that in summing up you know you should be glad ouch!.".

'Help' which came out a year later had the potential to be better still a bigger budget colour exotic locations topnotch British character actors of the calibre of Leo McKern Patrick Cargill Victor Spinetti and Roy Kinnear. Yet despite all these plus factors it turned out to be a major disappointment.Having wisely retained the services of director Richard Lester producer Walter Shenson inexplicably failed to hold onto writer Alun Owen. Marc Behm and Charles Wood's script for 'Help!' is frankly dreadful. The plot  such as it is  concerns a mystic Eastern sect who pursue the Fab Four all over the world in an effort to recover a sacred ring which has somehow gotten stuck on Ringo's finger. For sheer inanity it gives the worst of Elvis Presley's celluloid efforts a run for their money. Much of the Goonish humour seems forced and the cast constantly winking at the audience grows wearing. Sadly missed are Norman Rossington John Junkin and Wilfred Brambell from the first film.John Lennon later likened 'Help!' to the 'Batman' television series. I think it has more in common with 'The Monkees'. Arch plots such as this were routine in that show.The decision to turn 'Help!' into a largerthanlife action comedy is the main reason for its artistic failure. The pseudodocumentary look of 'Night' suited The Beatles down to the ground all they had to do was be themselves. Here they are required to react to bizarre happenings and aren't able to convince themselves let alone the audience. Their frequent cries of 'ho ho ho' leads one to believe they were so high on pot they forgot they were making a film. Lennon's comment about how they 'became extras in their own film' is accurate. With McKern Cargill and Spinetti hamming it up outrageously and Eleanor Bron looking stunningly sexy in Julie Harris' costumes how could it have been otherwise? The best gags in 'Help!' are visual such as The Beatles simultaneously entering four houses and being reunited in a single room and Patrick Cargill getting out of a small plane to be greeted by a massive flight of steps. But the overall impression is one of complacency on the part of the production team. They knew that the film was likely to make a mint so were not too concerned with minor details such as a script.'Help!' only comes to life when The Beatles perform the 'Ticket To Ride' sequence in the Austrian Alps is stunning  love the notes on the telegraph lines  as is the 'Another Girl' section in the Bahamas. My favourite though is 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Away'. Marvellous photography throughout. Its no wonder that Lester later became regarded as the 'father' of M.T.V.An underrated aspect of 'Help!' is the incidental music. Ken Thorne caught the Bondlike atmosphere to a tee and even includes a clever homage to Monty Norman's 'James Bond Theme' at one point.'Help!' is a relic from the time when The Beatles were conquering the world. Its worth watching for the music but it could and should have been so much better.".

In 1966 I was lucky to attend a live Beatles concert in Boston.Sure the plot of Help! is silly. However compare this British film with an American film during 1965 Beach Blanket Bingo starring Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Both movies were aimed at the same youth market. Beach Blanket Bingo is forgettable ridiculous tripe whereas Help! is a much more sophisticated and sublime form of humor. The music in Help! is much better as well. The colorful settings keep the action moving. Certainly this was just another vehicle for The Beatles to showcase their many talents. But it succeeded more than Magical Mystery Tour in 1967.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always loved this movie there's lots of action numerous colourful and inventive grisly deaths the script is blackly funny and very meanspirited it's a romp! I tend to feel a bit nostalgic whenever I watch it it's very 90s and to me is just a very easy and fun horror movie to follow and get into. The only other picture I've seen that was closest to it in tone was Wishmaster which this had to have inspired in some significant ways although this is the more scary and better made movie out of the two. So anyway this is a lot more unintentionally comic than I remembered..but I still love it. I'm really not buying or into the part of the story with the old men training the goofy kid to be a druid warrior and everything just Sands being a devilish badass is enough to satisfy me thank you very much! Not one bit of this movie would've worked were it not for his outstandingly wicked performance. Unlike the first movie which I didn't like half as much as this it's definitely lacking in the protagonist department. I love the beautiful ravenhaired Paula Marshall and the weirdlooking dorky Chris Young is likable if not completely useless in a battle  but they're both kinda weak characters everyone except for Sands is this is completely his show and he shines in his rather terrifying role as he positively glides through the proceedings. This is one of those movies where one actor is absolutely responsible for why a flick works and he really does carry the whole thing and steals every scene that he's in and his presence elevates it above average horror fare to me. Watching it now I'm still blown away by how fantastic and just how scary as fk he is. He's so charming and perhaps even angelic looking but at the same time he conveys such an enormous malevolence and a sense of barely restrained vicious malice. He's such a ruthless bastard as he unleashes terror and death on anyone who gets in his way and makes onesided bargains with the unfortunate holders of the stones that he locates with a fleshmap taken from the corpse of his 'mother' to aid him in his relentless quest to bring about the apocalypse. There's a lot of ghastly fun to be had in those suspenseful scenes just waiting to see what the gruesome punchline will be particularly the excellently tense elevator scene and when he warps the art collector into a cute little work of living art! The real standout to me though is the carnival hall of mirrors where the poor dumb carny is duped into being trapped in the dark side of reality forever. It's shot so well and feels so nightmarish with the scene just before where the helpless screaming midget is shoved into the iron maiden after trying to warn the carny being downright disturbing. The whole sequence should be better recognised as a great scene in horror cinema as far as I'm concerned. I dig the grim humour put into it as well like when the Warlock runs out of gas and is wrecked by the spell unbeknownst to them and when he runs over the bunny shuts up the annoying secretary and horrifically gives the hooker a closer look at her hair! Also that is a rather pitiful bit part for Zach Galligan but hey you can't say he isn't integral to the plot he gives the Warlock his trademark black garb! I don't adore every last thing about it the CGI on the baseball looks total caca. And then there's the two cheeseball cringeworthy lines that Chris Young delivers Welcome to the majors and Welcome to the 20th century asshole! I mean my god shudder! Also it really takes the punch right out of the climax when the ascension of Satan the fallen one the red hot demon himself is halted by a pair of common truck headlights! Seeing the Warlock get his spectacularly gross comeuppance makes up for it though. Whatever other people may think of it this will always be a dear favourite of mine I still find it a horrific blast after all these years. Definitely Picasso where I'm looking from!".

Of course you will have more depth to the warlock character if you have seen it but you will not miss out on anything if you haven't.This sequel is as good as the first movie in the series.Again the role of the sinister warlock is portrayed by the charismatic Julian Sands. And in this movie the character is much more dark and evil far more twisted than the warlock portrayed in the first movie. Julian Sands is so perfect for the role of the warlock.The cast is good and the roles of the druids are good both for the young druids and the elderly druids.The movie has a bunch of cool effects and wicked magics something that have to be seen. However it is not all good though the scene with the knife went horribly wrong. That knife is perhaps the worst CGI effect I have seen to date.For fans of adventure genres or for people who like to play DD games this movie provides good entertainment. And like the first Warlock movie this also have enough entertainment for more than one watching. I never grow tired of it at least!".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought the sequel to Warlock was okay. The first relied heavily on the story which was a about a unfortunate 90's working girl who is tormented by the son of the devil when a witchhunter chases him through time to the present day. It sounds far fetched but it is surprisingly wellwritten. This one is about the return of the Warlock this time he's trying to collect 7 coveted runestones that once collected will spell out the true name of his demon father and ultimately destroy the world hence the title The Armageddon. This one is much campier and much much gorier than the first. I love Anthony Hickox though I just can't help it. He's like Brian Yuzna crazy farfetched stories campy dialogue tongueincheek humor check out Waxwork 2 and lots of overthetop but tasteful enough to usually avoid being unrated gore. A boy learns that he is a descendant of a long line of druids a group who has been covertly fighting the evil and superhuman for centuries. Instead of brawn he must strengthen his mental power in order to face a final showdown of good and evil. Julian Sands once again hams it up and makes you hate him while unleashing his unholy rage in some of the most creative kill scenes ever. I won't give much away but he is reborn through a beautiful woman in a very painful manner and the folks possessing the runestones get put through hell let me tell you. The deaths are very gory SFXfilled and creative just watch what happens to the art collector. He becomes part of his own collection so to speak.If you liked Children of the Corn 3 Hellraiser 3 the Waxwork series and can take campy dialogue with a grain of tolerant salt then rent this movie for solid entertainment for 85 minutes or so.".

This time the Warlock makes a most memorable first appearance and then he goes after these magic stones so he can release Satan into the world.  This makes the druid angle seem rather dumb as I don't think they believe in such things.  However it still is a rather good movie just not as good as the first...in fact this movie might have seemed better if the first one never happened.  The movie though does follow a certain pattern. You see scenes of this kids coming into terms with their special powers to stop the Warlock then a scene of the Warlock finding one of the stones finally whoever has the stone is killed in an unusual way and then repeat. This happens till the end and the big showdown occurs.  I do so enjoy the shotgun scene.  That is about all there is too it but then the Warlock does kill people in vastly different and interesting ways.

I can't believe people enjoyed the first one more like my brother for starters which has left me quite quizzed. W2 is much more gorier if going by the first half of the original with some real over the top blood spilliages like Ms Pacula's demise. This time our evil warlock the great Mr Sands who I must say was born to play this role is here for much more evil purposes like bringing the world to an end where the only hope to end him is a young lad Kenny an older and much taller looking Chris Young from The Great Outdoors who possesses a telekinetic talent but is a bit rusty. He's infatuated with a girl Sam Paula Marshall acting in a Romeo and Juliet play who also possesses the same talent. What I liked too about this one was the humour caused mostly by Sands delivering some killer lines while also looking cool spewing black blood. Him breaking out of his mother's vagina near the start very icky has him saying the most memorable line where you have to hear it for yourself. Director Hickox still fresh off the heals of Hellraiser 3 which also starred Marshall makes a name for himself with these super entertaining flicks the sexual psychological C Thomas Howell thriller Payback came next with some nice ECU shots like one involving a smiling and very much in love Marshall. The battle to the death between good and evil is very suspenseful and I guess was a but overlong but I couldn't go back to ever watching the original as this is super entertaining with a lot of yucky blood and great effects and that great warlock humour.".

Him breaking out of his mother's vagina near the start very icky has him saying the most memorable line where you have to hear it for yourself. Director Hickox still fresh off the heals of Hellraiser 3 which also starred Marshall makes a name for himself with these super entertaining flicks the sexual psychological C Thomas Howell thriller Payback came next with some nice ECU shots like one involving a smiling and very much in love Marshall. The battle to the death between good and evil is very suspenseful and I guess was a but overlong but I couldn't go back to ever watching the original as this is super entertaining with a lot of yucky blood and great effects and that great warlock humour.";

However place it within the genre of comedy and it is up there challenging with the best of comedy films.The basic storyline made it easy to understand i.e. did not have to concentrate which is good because i was crying with laughter too much.It follows the old theme of the evil being lead back to the main characters at the end via the collection of 6 stones randomly placed around the world from Circuses to museums.Excellent acting from the son of the devil made me believe that he actually was the son of the devil and his ways of murdering the stone holders was humorous to say the least except for the one in the circus where that brought genuine fear to my mind.A well written script with such instances as rabbits being run over and hair being pulled off makes for an exciting and humorous viewing of one of my favouritist films of all time.Simply an 8.510 due to effective blood ridden moments great acting and funny moments.Hail the guy that created this masterpiece".

Given all that it was still a very watchable film. I have noted one error in the listed credits. Charles Hallahan is listed as Ted Ellinson the father of the female lead in the story. Actually that part was played by Bruce Gloverbest known from Diamonds are Forever. Hallahan actually played Ethan Larson. The opening scene was somewhat confusing.

But in this sequel some REALLY cool action takes place scenes where the Warlock meets the people against him. My personal favorite was the scene where Julian Sands shot down two old magic dudes with his hand gun. This sequel does contain creepier scenes that prophecizes the reborn ?Warlock and scenes that hints an upcoming bodycount. Overall this sequel is worth watching. 9.510    0.5 for cheesy level but  only half the points are removed due to the other cool scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Hickox is only about a light year ahead of Steve Miner in his vision of modernday witches and magick users but he still gets it wrong. The narrative begins as such 'Throughout time people known as Druids have used their mystical powers to protect the Earth from evil. Once every millennium when the sun aligns with the moon these guardians summon the magic of their sacred rune stones in the quest to prevent the birth of Satan's son...' Druids would be working hard to prevent untoward events yes. But the birth of Satan's son is not a concern to the Druids who also realize and understand that Satan is a Christian heresy and invention and not one that any pagan would hold in high regard. Therefore the entire plot of this movie is moot and negated as far as learning or 'getting' anything from this movie.However it is an entertaining thriller with a few surprises turns and even a twist or two. Classic 'B' movie horror again starring Julian Sands and as sequels go I find this one to be a more entertaining endeavor than the flick from which it spawned. The idea of the Druid Stones is ancient though they had nothing to do with the birth of Satan's son. As legend has it the Druid Stones were the only keys to the seven World Gates leading to seven different areas within the three dimensions of this World IE Primordial Psychic and Ethereal planes. Therefore the signs and omens utilized within the context of this movie are quite good and well used. The story centers around two young people Kenny played by Chris Young Buck of CandyAykroyd's 'The Great Outdoors' and Samantha Paula Marshall who's had a rather...obscure acting career so far. Both are children of Druid heritage and blood and although neither have been trained taught nor raised within the magickal system now they must realize their powers and abilities in order to prevent the end of the world. A bit farfetched if you ask me. What's also a bit farfetched is the very idea that a Druid's power comes from 'God.' Druids were here thousands of years before christians and the Hebrew god YWYH. That was just stupid. Outright ignorant. A small listing of wellseasoned actors makes this movie quite enjoyable regardless of the puerility of story lineplot. This production is full of 'B' movie effects and classic horror fare. The mirror scene with the carny has a very strong 'Dean Koontz' feel to it with the end of that scene finishing out in an almost Hellraiser style. All in all not a bad way to kill ninety minutes.This movie rates a 6.710 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in the late eightiesearly nineties when the horror genre was being fed consistent revenue from a stillgrowing home video market just about any scare film could spawn a franchise. The original Warlock was only a modest success but that was still enough to justify a sequel two years later. Warlock The Armageddon has a more ambitious story then the original a more comedic tone and is simultaneously more fun and less satisfying then the first.Only loosely connected to the first film Warlock II builds a wildly different mythology around the titular villain. There's some typical nonsense about lunar and solar eclipse and how the wall between Earth and Hell is thin during this time. This is a opportune moment for the Warlock upgraded from merely a powerful witch to the literal son of Satan to reemerge. A sect of druids protect the five rune stones the villain needs to bring about Hell on Earth. A prophecy marks two of their children as the true warriors that will prevent the end of days. The film follows the druids training their youngest members for battle while the Warlock travels across the country collecting the remaining stones and committing magicallyassisted murders.Warlock The Armageddon is essentially two movies stapled together. One is campy but incredibly entertaining while the other is campy and boring. The Warlock's killing spree provides the trashy thrills horrorfans are likely looking for. The film beings with the evil witch being reborn in a sick and twisted moment and continues in similarly outrageous fashion. The Warlock comes across each owner of the stones offing them in ways related to their personality. The death scenes are highpitched and ridiculous. A gas station attendant has his eye torn out a snooty art collector is bent into a piece of modern art a hooker gets scalped not to mention a lengthy stop at a carnival sideshow. Julian Sands is having a ball. He hams it up digging into each cheesy one liner the script gives. Sands never winks maintaining the seriousness of the Warlock character while letting the audience know what a good time he's having. Gory silly quasislasher thrills like this are probably what you'd expect from an underachieving sequel to a sortapopular eighties horror movie.The other movie Warlock 2 also is doesn't entertain in the same way. The tale of the druids raising two new warriors is snoreinducing. The audience certainly doesn't care about Chris Young's protagonist a geeshucks young kid named Kenny. His romance with Samantha played by a wooden Paula Marshall is of no interest at all. The storyline involving rune stones and ancient prophecies is horribly clichd. It's the kind of mythological story we've heard hundreds of times before in horror and fantasy films. Any time the movie focuses on this plot line the audience really wishes it would be back to the Warlock killing people.Director Anthony Hickox had previously directed the Waxwork films Sundown The Vampires in Retreat and most pressingly Hellraiser III Hell on Earth. Like Hellraiser III Hickox has made a movie about a formally serious villain suddenly performing overthetop kills and cracking wise about it. Luckily for us the Warlock is a far better fit for this style then Pinhead. Hickox's direction is energetic with multiple tracking shots of bodies flying through the air. His creativity which has always been fun but undisciplined is best displayed during the final fight. The Warlock explodes a building walking back to Earth on an invisible staircase. He dismembers enemies with his hands and shoots them down with his finger. However the climax proves a bit underwhelming. Not only is the bland hero pitted against the far more charismatic Sands the way the villain is defeated comes out of nowhere.I've never gotten around to seeing Warlock III but the lack of Julian Sands doesn't make me quick to check it out. Warlock The Armageddon probably wouldn't be half as much as it is without Sands' camping it up. It's a fairly undemanding flick for horror geeks and certainly would have prospered from a more balanced and creative script. But then again what can you expect from an innameonly sequel to a sortof obscure movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Warlock The Armageddon' is a more than capable sequel to the original film.SPOILERSA druid ceremony is interrupted and five sacred stones are stolen and buried hoping to never be used again. Today high school teen and future warlock Kenny Travis Chris Young is having a series of problems involving his girlfriend Samantha Paula Marshall and the school bully Andy. Craig Hurley Kenny's father Will Steve Kahan tells him of his destiny but he would rather get along with Samantha. The Warlock Julian Sands is reborn and goes off in search of the five sacred stones that are needed to bring his father back to Earth. One of the stones is held by fashionista Paula Dare Joanna Pacula and acquires it forcefully. Kenny learns that he comes from a long line of druids who protect the world instead of destroying it and that only he can defeat the Warlock. Will and his Warlock friend Franks R.G. Armstrong teach him to learn the ways of the druids to fight the Warlock who continues on a bloodbathed path to find the stones. With Samantha coming along to help Kenny takes on the Warlock for the fight of mankind.The Good News I'm really glad this one is a bloodbath. The first one was a very decent effort that featured very few gore effects but this one contained several impressive kills. Being impaled on a series of spikes from a torture chamber having an eye ripped out having more than twenty slash marks all over their body and being dropped over thirty feet onto a skylight then falling trough with blood splattering on the onlookers are just some of the scenes which are more violent in here than in the first one. The elevator scene with the stabbing was the real killing highlight because of the suspense it involved. Because there was a couple false movements where something didn't happen when it was believed to have been then it suddenly happens does shock the first time viewer. However than is the only main jump in the movie. Sands really seems to have fun in the role as he actually kills people in this movie. He almost becomes a sort of Freddyish killer in this movie as he does have a few pretty funny comments to his victims but they just don't seem as good as Freddy's lines. He does kill with abandon so it does come as a surprise when he kills them. The actual method of killing the Warlock was pretty creative with the whole scene carrying out pretty entertaining way. The battle shifts back and forth as no one has a clearcut advantage over the other and it never loses your interest.The Bad News There was a serious lack of jumps in this movie compared to the first one. The first one was pretty clever in how it build up suspense in it through the use of camera scene layout lighting etc. This one simply abandoned that in favor of simply showing images that could've been scarier but instead seems rather dull. If you get used to the violence this becomes a very shockless movie over time. The Freddy lines do need some work as only a few are actually pretty funny. If only they would've taken the same approach then part three would've been the laughfest it could been.The Final Verdict It could've been a whole better than what it was but as it stands this is a very entertaining film. It has a lot more blood and gore than the first one so gore hounds will love this one. Seek it out if you like the first one or if supernatural films about witches and warlocks are up your alley.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity and a brief sex scene.".

During this short period of time the Devil has the chance to take over the earth if  and only IF  his son the Warlock manages to bring together five magical stones and involve them in some sort of satanic ritual. The only individuals that are able to prevent the Warlock from raising the Armageddon are carefully selected druids people that have to die in their human form and get reborn as Godly warriors. What the hell?!? The biggest advantage of lowbrained cheese horror is that you never require seeing the original in order to enjoy the sequels. I recall seeing Warlock long time ago but I don't remember much except that the basic plot outline was entirely different than the events featuring in Warlock The Armageddon. Julian Sands still a regretfully underrated actor once again stars as the Warlock and he emerges  fullygrown  from the womb of poor woman just because she disposes of the first stone. His journey starts in New York and our antihero has to travel all across the USA for gathering all the stones before he's expected in sunny California for the actual showdown. Warlock Armageddon is a surprisingly entertaining Bmovie mainly because it's fastpaced and featuring quite a large amount of gory killing sequences. Julian Sands' performance also contributes a lot to the funfactor of this movie as he portrays his Warlock character as a truly obnoxious bastard who walks up the catwalk in the middle of fashion shows and deliberately runs his fast car over cute innocent bunnies. Naturally the script contains a lot of stupid dialogs and absurdly grotesque situations but still one particular sequence is effectively eerie and disturbing namely when the Warlock enters the traveling freak show to collect his third stone. In the House of Wonders he encounters a creepy midget and some genuine medieval torture devices. The 'heroic' characters are pretty lame and their extended druidtrainings reminiscent to the JediKnight training are the least interesting moments of the entire film. Okay entertainment for undemanding horror fans.".

When I say  Movie  I was convinced it was one of those made for television movies  TVM  since everything was so brightly lit and plastic looking . Unsure what I was getting I picked up the TV guide which informed me the movie was WARLOCK THE ARMAGEDDON . Id seen the original WARLOCK and found it disappointing but after seeing the sequel the original was some kind of masterwork in comparisonThe first problem is with Anthony Hickox directing . After seeing HELLRAISER 3  HELL ON EARTH I had some reservations about Hickox ability as a director and after seeing this I do hold the view that hes not much cop as a director . As I said everything about this movie is far too brightly lit and plastic looking just like youd see in a TVM while the cast are either poor actors or theyve been poorly directed . Hickox also insists on filming sequences in slow motion for no other reason than it seemed like a good idea at the time . I also think we could have done without blood splashing everywhere The script too is very bad with the characters being nothing more than cyphers . It lacks any type of idiosyncratic dialogue too . Take this scene for example where the warlock approaches a New York taxi driverWarlock  I want you to transport me to Chicago Taxi driver  Get the fck outta my face buddy So there you go the only written scene that features anything resembling characterisation revolves around a stereotypical view of NYC cab drivers . But my major problem with the script involves the plot  Im not sure it actually has one . What happens is that the Warlock is born  From a scene stolen from XTRO  and he goes on a journey which involves him killing people in a bloody way every five minutes . I criticised the original movie for not using its great potential but this sequel had no potential to start with I suppose gore hounds might like it but anyone expecting a coherent story and good acting should give this a wide berth".

I'm not a believer of any religion and this is why I enjoy movie like God VS Satan.This movie have good visual effect for that time and like almost people here said Julian Sand play well the son of Satan. The way that Satan's son die truck lights can be arguable but in general the way that this movie goes is very nice. For me the only sad thing finally what is the old name of God????!!?!?So if you like fantasy movie with a bit of horror witchcraft and God vs Satan I highly recommend this one. The first Warlock was very nice too but this one appear to me a little bit more serious. If you read other reviews you'll see only bad comments about this movie but no one have suggestions for another movie in that kind.".

I'm not a believer of any religion and this is why I enjoy movie like God VS Satan.This movie have good visual effect for that time and like almost people here said Julian Sand play well the son of Satan. The way that Satan's son die truck lights can be arguable but in general the way that this movie goes is very nice. For me the only sad thing finally what is the old name of God????!!?!?So if you like fantasy movie with a bit of horror witchcraft and God vs Satan I highly recommend this one. The first Warlock was very nice too but this one appear to me a little bit more serious. If you read other reviews you'll see only bad comments about this movie but no one have suggestions for another movie in that kind.";

Chief Dan George is Old Lodge Skins a native American who made himself memorable to American Audiences plays tutor and mentor to Jack Krabb. Faye Dunaway plays Mrs. Louise Pendrake who is both stepmother and temptress to the maturing Krabb. Martin Balsam plays Mr. Merriweather who literally goes to pieces throughout the film. Jeff Corey befriends Crabb as Wild Bill Hickok. Finally there is Richard Mulligan who plays Gen. George Armstrong Custer both as a serious military man and then as a lunatic officer.

I saw him at the Academy Awards 98 this year and his complexion has changed a bit given the thirty years difference. From Little Big Man to Rain Man Hoffman will be forever be immortalized as a Hollywood legend.  Little Big Man is an exceptionally well done movie the cast the direction and the great acting of Hoffman chief Dan and of course the sexy Faye.  This is more than a movie it was an adventure of a lifetime.  You are pitched into his world and feel his every joy and every agony as he progresses through every stages of his life.  Some say cats have nine lives but I think Little Big Man must have at least a hundred.  This movie centers around the hostilities between the White Men and the Indians with climatic event The Last Stand.  Without giving away the movie I must say the line Run Sunshine run!!  Run!! captivated my soul.  The movie is like a good book you just can't put it down.  I recommend this movie to everyone.".

Little Big Man was great.I've gone back to the movie several times since that first viewing and it continues to entertain and affect for me a film that has emotional resonance well after the first viewing is rare and though it does not always point to greatness it often does.Every element of the film is fantastic. The acting by Hoffman and Dan George in particular is amazing as is Penn's direction. The story picaresque and always fascinating. There simply is no weak component to this movie.I must also commend the film as a literary adaptation. I am not the most supportive critic of the Thomas Berger novel upon which the film is based. I find its thematics confused it cannot decide whether or not it wants to revise western mythology or further it and in that way it fails for me. Calder Willingham's adaptation removes the ambivalence inherent in the novel and thereby writes one of the first and greatest revisionist Hollywood Westerns.Little Big Man is a great movie as I have said and it deserves much more notoriety than it receives. This is I fear a film that too few people of my generation know. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it as an excellent and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.".

I find its thematics confused it cannot decide whether or not it wants to revise western mythology or further it and in that way it fails for me. Calder Willingham's adaptation removes the ambivalence inherent in the novel and thereby writes one of the first and greatest revisionist Hollywood Westerns.Little Big Man is a great movie as I have said and it deserves much more notoriety than it receives. This is I fear a film that too few people of my generation know. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it as an excellent and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.";

The character of Jack Crabb has such dimension and so grows from one incarnation to another that he is worth watching from beginning to end. This was Dustin Hoffman in his prepretentious I'm such a big star I won't listen to anyone period and he is an absolute joy because he just plays the character as it should be played. I love that he can be cowardly one moment confused the next heroic the next. He goes through phases in his life. Of course the neatest part of the whole movie is the portrayal of the Indians. They are multidimensional and wonderful in their acceptance and joy with their world. Maybe everyone should see this movie to see how these human beings have been driven from what they were to what they are now. I have a top ten list of movie moments and on it is the scene where old Lodge Skins goes off to die because it is a good day. As he lies there a drop of rain hits him in the eye and he decides that sometimes the magic doesn't work.The death of Sunshine is also so sad. I visited the Custer Battlefields a few years after seeing the movie and while the place is interesting historically I just couldn't look at it in the same way. The narration of the ancient Jack to the overmatched reporter is a delight. I know that this is a novel not pure history but Thomas Berger must have known these people and this delicate beautiful movie is certainly his legacy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Little big' is an oxymoron. Little big man' the film is another cinematic oxymoron a tragicomedy.Most of Penn's movies are doubleedged swords presenting serious subjects with a twinkle in the eyeThe Miracle Worker' seems to be an exception to the rule. Penn seem to have a strange knack of picking subjects that seem to be governed by forces greater than themselvesleading to alienated situations. My favorite Penn film is the 1975 film Night Moves' which ends with the boat going round in circles in the sea.This work of Penn and novelist Thomas Berger follows the same pattern. The main character Crabb is buffeted between the Red Indians and the whites by forces beyond his control. Only once is he able to control his destinyto lead Custer to his doom because Custer in his impetuosity has decided to act contrary to any advice from Crabb. The religious and social values of both seem vacuous. The priest's wife may seem religious but is not. The adopted grandfather cannot die on the hilltop but has to carry on living. The gunslinger is a cartoon. Historical heroes like Wild Bill Hickok are demystified into individuals with downtoearth worries.It is surprising to me that many viewers have taken the facts of the film and novel as accuratewhen it is obviously a work of fiction based on history.  The charm of the film is the point of view taken by the author and director. The comic strain begins from the time Jim Crabb's sister is not raped by the Indians right up to the comic last stand of Custer. The film is hilarious as it presents a quirky look at every conceivable notion presented by Hollywood cinema the brilliant acumen of army Generals the Red Indian satisfying several squaws the priest's wife turned prostitute who likes to have sex twice a week but not on all days the quack who has turned to selling buffalo hides as he sees it as a better profession even if he has lost several limbs etc.The film is a tragedya tragic presentation of the Red Indian communities decimated by a more powerful enemy tragic soldiers led by megalomaniac Generals heroes reduced to fallible individuals all heroes including the Red Indians whittled down to dwarfs.The film is a satire of a dwarf who claims to have achieved a great revenge on Custer a dwarf who could not assassinate Custer the dwarf in many of us. It is a great film but often misunderstood. Penn is a great director whose greatness cannot be evaluated by this one film but by the entire body of his films. What he achieved in this film outclasses films like Tonka 1958 and Soldier Blue 1970 two notable films on similar themes. Chief Dan George Dustin Hoffman and cinematographer Harry Stradling Jr have considerably contributed to this fine cinematic achievement but ultimate giant behind the film is Arthur Penn.He has presented yet another example of looking at a subject and seeing two sides of the coin that appear as contradictions but together enhances our entertainment.".

There he works as a shopkeeper gunfighter and finally used as an Indian Scout. The latter landing him under the command of General Custer Richard Mulligan who's putting together an army to fight the Indians at Little Big Horn.Critique Extremely enjoyable epic western directed by Arthur Penn. Praised for its depiction of Native Americans it has biting satirical and political touches saddled with farcical historical accounts of the Indian Wars. The once controversial aspects were meant to represent the ideologies of the time but it has not lost any of its grit. What I like the most is its unique interpretation of Indians. Never in the long cycles of American westerns were Indians presented as almost alien coming across as a mythical people whose ignorance of political maneuvers and technology proved their downfall. A very bitter and sad farewell swansong to what war and genocide has taken away. Atypical cast delivers strong passages but you won't forget the 2standout roles of General Custer as portrayed by the maniacal Richard Mulligan and 'Old Lodge Skies' played by the philosophical Chief Dan George. QUOTES Old Lodge Skies There is an endless supply of white men. But there has always been a limited number of 'human beings'. We won today we won't win tomorrow.".

Hoffman is a survivor from Little Big Horn Custer's Last Stand and this is an invented life up to that point told from memory to man with a tape recorder at the age of 123.And the old old! Hoffman is pretty terrific mostly in the narration but including some pretty caked on makeup too. Most of the movie is a young Hoffman as both Indian and White Man alternating depending on how he gets miraculously saved from one disaster after another. It's a farce yes but there are overtones of tragedy throughout the annihilation of a race can only be so funny for so long and there are some truly violent scenes mostly of Indians being slaughtered by the Army.It might help to know this is a metaphor of sorts about the brutality of the Army in Vietnam which was raging at the time. It does make it all less frivolous. But it's also just fine as a crazy retelling of the last great famous Indian War and the events more or less leading up to it. Hoffman is terrific in his usual way and the support around him funny especially the old Indian Chief played by Chief Dan George. The two other big stars appear only briefly Faye Dunaway in a couple scenes and Martin Balsam in one. It's really Hoffman's film and Penn's too with a grand and complex range of scenes inside and out night and day city and wide open country.It didn't strike me as a brilliant film or even as funny as it could have been but it's endlessly engaging and there are some witty and funny moments sprinkled all through. It is long and I might not call it slow even though it feels like it drags here and there for sure.".

But it's a major step down from the book one of the finest American novels of the '60s. The difference is in the handling of the characters. The movie presents Custer Wild Bill Hickok Rev. Pendergast and his wife the patent medicine seller and the rest as comic turns not as fullfledged people in their own right. Maybe this is how Penn with his theatrical background instinctively saw the material and it gives the movie too much of a Blazing Saddles feel. The script or perhaps what Penn uses of it boils much of the dialog down into oneliners doubtless the task of condensing such a sprawling story into a movie of less than three hours didn't help. Even Chief Dan George as Old Lodge Skins the best developed character here often comes across as merely a lovable schlemiel. Much of it's funny but it doesn't cut very deep.The book is more human giving each character Jack encounters three dimensions and avoiding the trap of rendering any of them either all good or all bad. The moment in Penn's film that best evoke the book is the scene where Custer catches Jack approaching to kill him and instead of killing his stalker lets him go. Throughout this wonderful novel characters do unexpected things that seem at first to be totally out of character and thus serve to remind us of the complexity of human beings. As someone suggests here the film may intend to say something about the random unpredictable nature of the universe. The novel does something a lot more difficult and downtoearth It reminds us that it takes a lifetime to know even a few of our fellow humans. And especially for Jack who has to navigate two distinct cultures.So if you liked the movie by all means read the book. You'll finish it loving this tall tale way more.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great films of the early Seventies one I saw when it first came out and a number of times since. I remember how horrified I was to see the massacre at Washita Creek the first time one hears of events like that or reads about them but actually watching an event like that the way it might have happened had a lasting impact on me. Another film of the era that also dramatized the sheer horror of men at war and senseless killing was Patton which also came out the same year as Little Big Man. These were among the first films I saw that desanitized the inhumane aspects of war and genocide and showed them for what they were truly brutal and insane sides of the human condition.There's another holdover as well I've used my summary line above quite often over the years and had forgotten the origin of it until watching the film again yesterday. Chief Dan George was simply magnificent in the picture he conveyed the Indian philosophy perfectly in scene after scene and is probably my favorite Native American actor. I'm always intrigued by Indian names and along with Old Lodge Skins my favorites from this story include Shadow That Comes in Sight Ruben Moreno and Burns Red in the Sun Steve Shemayne. The one very unique idea presented in this picture had to do with the notion of a homosexual Indian as portrayed by the character Little Horse Robert Little Star. I'm sure I would never have given that a thought after watching hundreds of Westerns it just never came up before. The other trait that I'd never encountered was the idea of a 'Contrary' the Cheyenne Younger Bear Cal Bellini who did everything backwards sort of the Bizarro version of the Red Man. This was one Western that made you think outside the stereotypes.Now I have to admit some of the scenes done for comedic effect seemed to go way against the grain of the movie as a historical drama. Perhaps most representative of that was Jack Crabb's 'SodaPop Kid' characterization. In fact Jack's life went through so many highs and lows that it's almost impossible to imagine that all of it could have happened to one person in a single lifetime. Given a choice I think mine would be getting my back washed by Faye Dunaway. You know by some strange cosmic serendipity another 1970 Western I recently watched featured a similar scene. In The Ballad of Cable Hogue the roles are reversed and Jason Robards gets to wash the back of Stella Stevens in what must have been an extreme exercise of sheer will power. I wonder which film maker thought of it first.You know I've seen a few treatments of Custer's Last Stand and read with interest some of the other postings for this film regarding General George Armstrong Custer. Some were heated in their denunciation of Richard Mulligan's portrayal but from what I've read about Custer he was fairly egocentric to the point of being megalomaniacal. I thought Mulligan brought the kind of audacity to the role that Emilio Estevez brought to his portrayal of Billy the Kid in Young Guns. He oozed a supreme self confidence that totally fogged his judgment leading to one of the great military disasters of American History. Along with 'Sometimes the magic works' Custer's 'poison up from the goonads speech' is one of the most memorable scenes in the picture for me.It would be tough to come up with another movie that raises so many conflicting emotions in the viewer and I think that's a particular skill of a good director. Arthur Penn did a superb job of blending dramatic and comedic elements together in a story that's as thought provoking as it is entertaining. I'd recommend Little Big Man to anyone who would like a different kind of movie one that takes the stereotypes and stands them on their head in support of an intriguing and downright offbeat Western.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've ever felt that AmericanWesterns always took themselves a bit too seriously then 'Little Big Man 1970' serves as a breath of fresh air. Arthur Penn's sweeping Revisionist Western tells an outrageouslyentertaining talltale of Cheyenne Indians and white men Old Lodge Skins and Gen. Custer the Battle of Washita River and the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Dustin Hoffman once again proving his versatility after legendary performances in 'The Graduate 1967' and 'Midnight Cowboy 1969' plays the 121yearold Jack Crabb who recounts his fanciful life story to a gullible historian. 'Little Big Man' despite being set in the late 19th century is very much of its time the clever mixture of satire comedy and tragedy is something that only the 1970s could have produced and there is a notsosubtle allusion to the Vietnam War which was being fought at the time of the film's release the film's depiction of the Battle of Washita River  which in actually more closely resembles the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864  is a clear allegory for Vietnam's infamous My Lai Massacre.It's often been observed that the narrative style of 'Little Big Man' is comparable to that of 'Forrest Gump 1994' and this is a fair assessment the two films share episodic storytelling told through recollection unexpectedlyreoccurring minor characters meetings with famous historical figures and a humble hero quietly shaping the course of history. 'Forrest Gump' being one of my alltime favourite movies these similarities certainly didn't go unnoticed and it's interesting to consider where director Robert Zemeckis might have acquired some of his inspiration. With Jack Crabb's enthusiastic narration all the components of the film combine to produce a glorious mosaic of his life. We experience his highs and lows his triumphs and defeats his friendships and antagonisms his lifestyle is never the same for any extended period of time and this coupled with the film's quirky sense of humour keeps the film moving at a roaring pace.I really enjoyed how Arthur Penn successfully twisted the usual conventions of Western cinema approaching serious subject matter with a mischievously tongueincheek mentality not long after Jack vows to fight bravely for the Cheyenne Indians he finds himself exclaiming God bless George Washington! at the first sign of danger Jack's enthusiastic bid to become a gunfighter fall flat when he discovers he hasn't the heart to actually kill a man Gen. Custer is revealed to be a cocky arrogant fool who blunders his own army into disaster Jack's blind mentor believing himself to be invisible leads him through a horrific massacre scene arriving at the river completely untouched. In any other film Old Lodge Skins played with astonishing warmth by Chief Dan George would have died on top of the hillside. Instead Penn knowingly goes through the usual motions culminating towards a devastating climax that never arrives. It starts to rain and Old Lodge Skins rises disappointedly to his feet declaring Well sometimes the magic works sometimes it does not.".

'Little Big Man' despite being set in the late 19th century is very much of its time the clever mixture of satire comedy and tragedy is something that only the 1970s could have produced and there is a notsosubtle allusion to the Vietnam War which was being fought at the time of the film's release the film's depiction of the Battle of Washita River  which in actually more closely resembles the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864  is a clear allegory for Vietnam's infamous My Lai Massacre.It's often been observed that the narrative style of 'Little Big Man' is comparable to that of 'Forrest Gump 1994' and this is a fair assessment the two films share episodic storytelling told through recollection unexpectedlyreoccurring minor characters meetings with famous historical figures and a humble hero quietly shaping the course of history. 'Forrest Gump' being one of my alltime favourite movies these similarities certainly didn't go unnoticed and it's interesting to consider where director Robert Zemeckis might have acquired some of his inspiration. With Jack Crabb's enthusiastic narration all the components of the film combine to produce a glorious mosaic of his life. We experience his highs and lows his triumphs and defeats his friendships and antagonisms his lifestyle is never the same for any extended period of time and this coupled with the film's quirky sense of humour keeps the film moving at a roaring pace.I really enjoyed how Arthur Penn successfully twisted the usual conventions of Western cinema approaching serious subject matter with a mischievously tongueincheek mentality not long after Jack vows to fight bravely for the Cheyenne Indians he finds himself exclaiming God bless George Washington! at the first sign of danger Jack's enthusiastic bid to become a gunfighter fall flat when he discovers he hasn't the heart to actually kill a man Gen. Custer is revealed to be a cocky arrogant fool who blunders his own army into disaster Jack's blind mentor believing himself to be invisible leads him through a horrific massacre scene arriving at the river completely untouched. In any other film Old Lodge Skins played with astonishing warmth by Chief Dan George would have died on top of the hillside. Instead Penn knowingly goes through the usual motions culminating towards a devastating climax that never arrives. It starts to rain and Old Lodge Skins rises disappointedly to his feet declaring Well sometimes the magic works sometimes it does not.";

There was never a lack of old hands like Sid's father telling you you had it easy because of some difference in the rules he didn't enjoy 10 years earlier. DOR is translated by Foley as drop on request. In 1983 the terminology was DE which meant dis enroll. I always wondered what happened to the candidates in my class who DE'd. The ones who graduated I kept running into in the fleet sometimes in places like the Philippines. The most unrealistic thing about the movie was the premise that local girls want to marry officer candidates. Not so in Pensacola or Newport RI where OCS was in those days. The locals actually called us behind our backs cockroaches because we wore all black and had to run away to our barracks by 10 pm. The second most unrealistic thing was the foul language. That comes later in the fleet but not in OCS. No we did not have martial arts duels. All in all however the essence of the experience if not the specifics is found in the movie. One of our marching songs went left right left right  you HAD a good job and you LEFT  you're RIGHT! We really did have nowhere else to go. I say 10 stars. The VHS version gets only 8 because of changes to the soundtrack songs.".

His will as well as the love of the beautiful Paula Debra Winger and the guidance of Foley makes him stay the course and lifts him 'up where he belongs'.Richard Gere is great in adding layers to what could have been a poorly drawn characterisation. Mayo is not always the 'good guy' and is more often than not a complete prick. Nevertheless he undertakes a journey of selfdiscovery where he refuses to become a carbon copy of his father and takes hold of his own destiny turning himself into the man he wants to be.

She not only finds a way out in her love for Mayo but the hope of a better future somewhere else. Louis Gossett Jr. also stands out as the foulmouthed domineering Sergeant Foley who proves to be pivotal in Mayo's journey.With a great soundtrack strong performances and the most rousing and emotional final scene in a film since 'Rocky' 'An Officer And A Gentleman' deserves its place among the classics of film history.".

	schema:reviewBody "First there is not and never was an Aviation Officer Candidate School AOCS in Washington state. I would assume it was used because the true locale for AOCS Pensacola FL wasn't suitable for some reason. Officer candidates going to AOCS already have their degrees and are undergoing training physical and educational to earn their commission. No it's not four years like the Naval Academy but then again it's not four years of hell at the Academy as another reviewer attempted to posit. Any officer commissioned through AOCS is an officer just like an academy grad and both ultimately can end up with regular commissions vice reserve commissions.Next the training at AOCS was fairly accurately portrayed in the movie. Lots of running swimming academics inspections etc. all intended to result in the individual becoming part of a team. Another reviewer obviously not a Republican LOL detests this movie just because of his perception that it endorsed the philosophy of the Reagan years. Utter balderdash of course. What this movie portrays again fairly accurately is the growth of a loner into someone who realizes as Spock so eloquently stated in one of the Star Trek movies the needs of the many outweigh the needs or the wants of the one or the few. Mayo learns to be part of a team he learns to care for others and cease being a user of people in his life...an example he learned from his father.The terminology during the 80s when I went through AOCS was still DOR...Drop On Request. It was an out exercised by very few people mostly because those of us in AOCS were already motivated to come into the Navy and specifically into Naval Aviation. The rigors as stated previously are presented fairly accurately although a little melodramatic in places e.g. the altitude chamber. Never in all my years in the Navy did I see anyone freak out in the chamber which is a required test along with swim quals every four years to remain qualified to fly.The legend of the Pensacola Debs was presented to us early on in AOCS. Yes there are stories many of them true of men meeting their wives while going through training in Penasacola but I'd wager there's not a higher incidence in P'cola than there is at any military base or college town for that matter. Odd but you put men and women in the same room and some will pair off and some will marry and remain together forever. The bar in the film TJ's was based on a bar in Penascola named Trader Jon's. Trader had a running deal that if you caught him wearing matching socks you'd get some prize...can't remember if it was money or drinks. Let's just say he never paid off as far as I know. Trader died a few years back but I'm pretty sure some of the stuff from his bar is probably at the Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola.The Drill Instructor portrayal by Louis Gossett is VERY true to life! While they cussed us screamed at us pushed us physically and looked for what would trip us up they also in retrospect wanted us to succeed. One thing they never did and would have been severely disciplined for was hit us so the fight scene while improbable works in the movie. PTing us into the ground though...you bet they did! This movie works for me because I lived the life both during the AOCS part and during a career in the Navy in aviation. The portrayals are pretty much spoton and believable. Sure there's dramatic license but there is in any movie! Anyone who believes Full Metal Jacket tells it like it is is delusional there's plenty of dramatic license there too. Relax enjoy the movie. It's about personal growth love and sacrifice all in all good things. Not the best movie ever made but certainly not the worst!".

It is impossible to think of anyone else in the role which is one indication of how good Gere was. Lou Gossett Jr. steals the show and gets a deserved Oscar as Gunnery Sergeant Foley.  Debra Winger is also delectable as Paula Zach's working class girlfriend.      I had read that Winger had a real problem doing the nude scenes with Gere and felt very uncomfortable being undressed in front of the camera. Supposedly the scene in which she is crying while making love to Zach isn't because she's feeling passion it is because she is feeling humiliated.  The movie also had to snip out a couple of seconds of Winger flexing her hips a bit too much during a bed scene.  Still one of the steamiest bed scenes in film history. The most riveting moment of the movie is when Foley is going to kick Zach out of the program and Gere frantically and desperately screams DON'T YOU DO THAT!  I AIN'T GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!  All of Zach's arrogance is drained out of him and he is just a desperate kid begging for the only chance he'll ever have.  Powerful moment.  In the end Zach gains maturity.

By not sheltering it's lovers from the harsh nature of humanity the film manages to have a significantly greater impact as it works toward a deservedly optimistic ending.In a role turned down by both John Travolta and John Denver Richard Gere lends a brooding intensity that electrifies what could have been a bland protagonist.

I really hate that term because I know every guy has seen a socalled chick flick and went away at least liking it.  Ok maybe AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN is one of those type of films but one thing is certain....it kicks TOP GUN's A!!! This is film is about the rigorous training to become a pilot while GUN shows a bunch of guys involved in dogfights that play like video games I heartily agree with Leonard Maltin.  SPOILERS AHEAD Richard Gere in one of his best roles second only to PRIMAL FEAR plays Zachary Mayo a loner who goes to Navy Candidate School to become a pilot because simply that's all he wants to do.  He finds a real challenge in the drill instructor Foley played unforgettably by Louis Gossett Jr. who won an Oscar.  He also finds love for the first time in his life in the form of a poor factory worker Debra Winger.  His best friend Worley David Keith finds love too...but it doesn't turn out the way he wanted. Much of the film alternates between in his growing relationship with Winger and the rigourous training he endures which become more important to him than ever when Foley order him to quit after doing so illegal....he however refuses to give up for anything in this world the famous emotional climax is when he confesses I've got nowhere else to go.. Personally I see this film as most certainly not a chick flick but a film that has something for both sequences in equal doses more females will appreciate the romance while more males will root for Mayo as he overcomes many obstacles most notably Foley.  I must confess however that my favorite sequence in the whole film is the last one showing Gere carry Winger out of her factory.  There is a much more emotional scene however that I will definately not give away I've never met anyone who wasn't moved by it when you see it you will find out!.      In addition to the cast the film also features great direction by Taylor Hackford and a wellwritten if having the standard number of minute flaws screenplay by Douglas Day Stewart.  The lovely score is done by Jack Nitzsche and it also features the classic love song Up Where We Belong by Joe Cocker  Jennifer Warnes which I must say is way better than Berlin's song from TOP GUN though both won Oscars.  Still the performances are what makes this film and it succeeds making it one of the most romantic films of all time.  Fav. Quote Only two things come out of Oklahoma  Steers and Queers.".

It is no surprise that Louis Gosset Jr. won on Oscar for best supporting actor he was very convincing!! This movie is a good example of great characters and the dynamics between them. They were all great!! Richard Gere plays a likable loner. But he is less arrogant than he is untrusting and I think Foley finally gains some respect for him when he realizes this. The most memorable scenes for me were when Seegar couldn't make it up the wall the first time and she caves into tears at Foley's caustic and very funny! comments. The scenerio were she finally makes it over due to Mayo's newfound concern and trust of others is also great and shows his maturing. But I think Louis Gosset Jr. shines the most when he challenges Mayo to a fight I believe he did this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out a wonderful scene indeed!! Debra Winger was some serious eyecandy in this flick and Lisa Eilbacher has the cutest doll face. Great characters and cast!".

	schema:headline " The best of its kind";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1982 An Officer and a Gentleman was the obvious inspiration of films like Tom Cruise's Top Gun and Days of Thunder. An Officer and a Gentleman was the first and best by far.The plot similarities are obvious They all include the angry young man who needs to prove his gifting the uncompromising mentor the encouraging babe the craft the arena and the doomed buddy. In An Officer the angry young man is Richard Gere as Mayo the mentor is Louis Gossett Jr. as Drill Instructor Folely the babe is Paula Debra Winger the craft is aviation basic training the arena is a Naval academy and the Puget Sound area of Washington shot on location and the buddy is Sid Worley David Keith.Thankfully the film doesn't get bogged down telling the backstory of Mayo. Instead it ingeniously shares his past in a matter of minutes at the very beginning. It's all we need to know to understand why Mayo is the way he is. And then we're off to basic training where he's tested. Does he have what it takes? Can someone as lowborn aloof and untrusting as Mayo make it as an officer?Debra Winger and Lisa Blount shine here as Mayo and Worley's babes. Winger is alluring in a humble girl next door type of way she outshined Lynda Carter as Wonder Girl on Wonder Woman which is hard to believe but Blount is even more alluring  yes despite the negative aspects of her character. I'll just put it this way she really fills out a pair of jeans lol. Both couples get intimate way too quickly but maybe this is one of the flaws of the Puget Debs and explains why they have a problems getting marriage material if you know what I mean. Besides this time has to be condensed in a twohour film.BOTTOM LINE If you're in the mood for a film of this ilk An Officer and a Gentleman is the best of the lot.GRADE AINSIGHTS ABOUT THE ENDING SPOILER ALERT Don't read further unless you've seen the filmAn officer is a military leader. Drill Instructor Foley's job is to weed out those who can't hack it as an officer. It's an important job because people's lives in combat are dependent on the quality of the leaders and Foley takes his job seriously.Foley rightly pegs Mayo as a lowlife loner from the outset  a wannabe officer  and therefore puts on the pressure. This is especially so on the one weekend where he has Mayo to himself. Foley does everything he can to make Mayo break AND quit but Mayo doesn't. He breaks indeed but he refuses to quit on the grounds that he has no where to go. At the end of this scene you can see that Foley develops respect for Mayo which you get a glimpse of earlier when Mayo does extremely well on the obstacle course.Later Mayo disregards breaking the record on the obstacle course which he was definitely able to do in order to encourage Seegar the female recruit to finally make it over the wall. Foley sees that Mayo's no longer the aloof and selfish loner he was when he rode in on his motorcycle. He's matured he's developed character. It was already there of course but the boot camp training has brought it to the fore and Foley sees it.After Worley's tragic death Mayo confronts Foley while he's drilling the platoon. Foley informs Mayo that they all know what happened and even tells him they're sorry about Worley. He didn't have to do this and it shows that Foley isn't just an honorable man but also that he cared about Worley. After all Worley was only one week away from graduating! In a sense he was one of Foley's kids. In other words Foley and the platoon were grieving too. But Mayo was closest to Worley and he's crazy with shock  grief at this point. He insists that he's going to quit to which Foley tells him to meet him for a fight. Sure there's some testosterone in his words but he actually does this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out.And Foley doesn't kick his axx as some claim. It was essentially an even match and Foley barely walks off the mat which is the only reason he technically wins. But that's inconsequential. The purpose of the fight was to run Mayo's steam out so he didn't make a rash decision in an obvious moment of grief  anger. Foley accomplished his purpose. Once Mayo was no longer blinded by rage he makes the right choice and graduates.This is why he thanks Foley at the end.".

In An Officer the angry young man is Richard Gere as Mayo the mentor is Louis Gossett Jr. as Drill Instructor Folely the babe is Paula Debra Winger the craft is aviation basic training the arena is a Naval academy and the Puget Sound area of Washington shot on location and the buddy is Sid Worley David Keith.Thankfully the film doesn't get bogged down telling the backstory of Mayo. Instead it ingeniously shares his past in a matter of minutes at the very beginning. It's all we need to know to understand why Mayo is the way he is. And then we're off to basic training where he's tested. Does he have what it takes? Can someone as lowborn aloof and untrusting as Mayo make it as an officer?Debra Winger and Lisa Blount shine here as Mayo and Worley's babes. Winger is alluring in a humble girl next door type of way she outshined Lynda Carter as Wonder Girl on Wonder Woman which is hard to believe but Blount is even more alluring  yes despite the negative aspects of her character. I'll just put it this way she really fills out a pair of jeans lol. Both couples get intimate way too quickly but maybe this is one of the flaws of the Puget Debs and explains why they have a problems getting marriage material if you know what I mean. Besides this time has to be condensed in a twohour film.BOTTOM LINE If you're in the mood for a film of this ilk An Officer and a Gentleman is the best of the lot.GRADE AINSIGHTS ABOUT THE ENDING SPOILER ALERT Don't read further unless you've seen the filmAn officer is a military leader. Drill Instructor Foley's job is to weed out those who can't hack it as an officer. It's an important job because people's lives in combat are dependent on the quality of the leaders and Foley takes his job seriously.Foley rightly pegs Mayo as a lowlife loner from the outset  a wannabe officer  and therefore puts on the pressure. This is especially so on the one weekend where he has Mayo to himself. Foley does everything he can to make Mayo break AND quit but Mayo doesn't. He breaks indeed but he refuses to quit on the grounds that he has no where to go. At the end of this scene you can see that Foley develops respect for Mayo which you get a glimpse of earlier when Mayo does extremely well on the obstacle course.Later Mayo disregards breaking the record on the obstacle course which he was definitely able to do in order to encourage Seegar the female recruit to finally make it over the wall. Foley sees that Mayo's no longer the aloof and selfish loner he was when he rode in on his motorcycle. He's matured he's developed character. It was already there of course but the boot camp training has brought it to the fore and Foley sees it.After Worley's tragic death Mayo confronts Foley while he's drilling the platoon. Foley informs Mayo that they all know what happened and even tells him they're sorry about Worley. He didn't have to do this and it shows that Foley isn't just an honorable man but also that he cared about Worley. After all Worley was only one week away from graduating! In a sense he was one of Foley's kids. In other words Foley and the platoon were grieving too. But Mayo was closest to Worley and he's crazy with shock  grief at this point. He insists that he's going to quit to which Foley tells him to meet him for a fight. Sure there's some testosterone in his words but he actually does this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out.And Foley doesn't kick his axx as some claim. It was essentially an even match and Foley barely walks off the mat which is the only reason he technically wins. But that's inconsequential. The purpose of the fight was to run Mayo's steam out so he didn't make a rash decision in an obvious moment of grief  anger. Foley accomplished his purpose. Once Mayo was no longer blinded by rage he makes the right choice and graduates.This is why he thanks Foley at the end.";

Richard Gere portrays Zachary Mayo a young man and son of a career sailor who has risen from residing above a house of ill repute in the Philippines to becoming an officer's candidate destined to fly jets.Gere is terrific as Mayo and works incredibly hard to combine the complex emotions of the character with his seemingly simplistic facade.  Gere is supported by a great cast including Debra Winger as the young factory worker who yearns of a better life with Mayo David Keith as a cadet who's not all that he seems and the legendary Louis Gossett Jr. as Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley Mayo's adamant and hardedged drill instructor who remains Zach's total bane of existence.  Gossett won a welldeserved Oscar for this role and he remains the true highlight of this film.Some have called An Officer and a Gentlemen outdated improbable and too melodramatic and perhaps it is all of these.  But it is so entertaining and so enthralling I find it easily to become enveloped by the picture's story and characters.  You want them all to succeed and you feel for them when they fail.

Forming friendships and taking on a romance with a local girl he may just make the grade. But he has to convince not only his tough no nonsense drill instructor but also himself.An Officer And A Gentleman has been bogged down over the years by being labelled as a chick flick a film they say that is for the soggy handkerchief brigade. Not so say I. Yes love is a critical strand here not only finding it after years of being closed off from it but also to keep it after seizing the day. But it's as much a film about determination as it is love in finding strengths from within to achieve ones goals against seemingly badly stacked odds. It really is a film that essays that triumph of the will spirit so lacking in many similar pictures that followed this 1982 piece. There are some incredibly great sequences here chiefly during the training programme from Mayo's continuing conflict with Sgt Foley to a devastating turn of events with a friendship. This film royally packs an emotional punch.The cast are uniformly excellent Richard Gere as Mayo is pitch perfect and it pays to notice that he was a 32 year old man playing an early 20s rookie it's a testament to his undervalued ability that nobody noticed. Debra Winger was nominated for a Best Actress Award for her portrayal as Mayo's love interest Paula Pokrifki. It's believed that Gere and herself didn't get on off screen it isn't noticeable tho because the chemistry sizzles and the resulting end product is one of a joyous return. Honours have to go to Louis Gossett Jr. tho rightly winning the Best Supporting Actor Award his performance as instructor Sgt Foley is towering and one of the best of the 1980s. David Keith and Lisa Eilbacher also turn in strong performances and Taylor Hackford's direction is smooth and without intrusion. The involving screenplay and tidy editing are also noteworthy and the theme song Up where We Belong took home the gong for Best Original Song.Some critics have called the film sexist oh come off it people. It may come as a shock to them but a lot of women do want to be carried off by some dashing hunk similarly a lot of us men are more than willing to be the ones carrying the maiden! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "In the eight years I've been posting reviews on IMDb I usually like to review the classics over the more recent fare of films primarily to see if the older movies still ignite flames even to this day forward and partially in my young life I missed a lot of the more adult movies because at one time I had a zero interest in them. Even though An Officer and a Gentleman came out in 1982 six years after I was born I only just recently stumbled across it recently sorry for my tardiness just because my elders talked so much about it so I just wanted to know what the hype was about and to see if it will leave me with a lasting impression.For those who never seen the film it stars Richard Gere as a young man named Zack Mayo who has recently checked himself into the Navy OCS located in Washington. From the early scenes we discover that Mayo's life was not a very pleasant one. At a very young age his mother killed herself and was forced to stay with his father Robert Loggia while stationed in the Philippines. His father's nurturing was absent since all he had on his mind was drinking and chasing prostitutes. Zach wasn't really prepared for the tough regiments that the OCS had to offer as he struggling in terms of handling commitment let alone following authoritative figures.Mayo is under the tutelage of gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley Louis Gossett Jr. and it comes to no surprise that their encountering is just on the horizon. Mayo seems to excel quite well on the physical initiatives that the Navy has to offer but academically is quite the other story. This leads to Mayo forming a friendship with a fellow classmate named Sid Worley David Keith as he will do everything he can to get Mayo into the Aerodynamics class in exchange for immaculate belt buckles and boots whenever there's a barracks inspection. The main setting for this movie is set in the OCS there's also a vital subplot that involves Zach Sid and a couple of girls Puget Debs who they meet when they're off campus during their weekend. The two ladies are Paula Pokrifki Debra Winger and Lynette Pomeroy Lisa Blount who a scrounging for military meat in hopes for a quick marriage proposal. These Puget Debs play riskier attempts to get their catch like faking their pregnancies or other things like that. Paula hooks up with Zach while Lynette is onto Sid.The rest of the way it's Zach trying to get through 13 weeks of OCS training and while getting adjusted to Paula. Since Zach is the titular character fans seem to pretty much know the outcome of the story but that doesn't deprive itself from being entertaining. After 33 years I can safely say that An Officer and a Gentleman has aged quite gracefully. There are a lot of wonderful scenes with many authentic scenes that just can't be beat. Who could forget when Zach confesses to Sgt. Foley I got nowhere else to go plus the final scene where Mayo is now an ensign finds Paula and walks out with her to the applause of his colleagues. The pacing was also very well structured. Even though the film was almost at the two hour mark there was never a boring moment and that was because the romantic scenes never interfered with the OCS scenes and it flowed in a more natural way. We also deeply care about the characters and we hope that Zach and Paula stay a couple and hope they live a happy life after the credits roll. Overall this movie gets a 910 that's highly recommended even if you're a late bloomer like me it's better late than never if you haven't seen this movie. It still holds up today since its release back in 1982.".

When she killed herself Zack followed his father to the Philippines where he got on in life the hard way. Now he is an adult he is determined to make more of himself than his father did to become a naval aviator to become an officer and a gentleman. Before he can do that though he must pass the thirteen week course at the Aviation Officer Candidate School where those who don't have what it takes are weeded out. His instructor Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley doesn't think he has what it takes but he will push him and the rest of the class to the limit to find out. Zack befriends fellow student Sid Worley and the two of them start dating Paula and Lynette a pair of local girls despite Foley's warning that the local girls are all trying to get married to a pilot by fair means or foul.This film may be well known as a romance largely due to the famous final scene but it is far more than just that. In fact the most important relationship in the film is that between Mayo and Foley Foley may be pushing Mayo to quit but without him he'd never get through the course what at first appears to be bullying turns out to be the impetus needed to get through the gruelling training programme. Louis Gossett Jr. certainly earned the Oscar he won for his performance as Foley and Gere is at his best as Mayo whose character develops from a selfish loner to that of somebody willing to help his classmates at his own expense. The rest of the cast are pretty good too most notably David Keith who plays Sid and Debra Winger who plays Paula. For the most part we can guess how the story will ultimately end but that doesn't make it an entirely feelgood film there is tragedy too and that comes as quite a shock. Overall an enjoyable film well worth watching especially if you are a fan of Richard Gere.".

In fact the most important relationship in the film is that between Mayo and Foley Foley may be pushing Mayo to quit but without him he'd never get through the course what at first appears to be bullying turns out to be the impetus needed to get through the gruelling training programme. Louis Gossett Jr. certainly earned the Oscar he won for his performance as Foley and Gere is at his best as Mayo whose character develops from a selfish loner to that of somebody willing to help his classmates at his own expense. The rest of the cast are pretty good too most notably David Keith who plays Sid and Debra Winger who plays Paula. For the most part we can guess how the story will ultimately end but that doesn't make it an entirely feelgood film there is tragedy too and that comes as quite a shock. Overall an enjoyable film well worth watching especially if you are a fan of Richard Gere.";

What makes An Officer and a Gentleman  work for me is the performances and we all know that even though Gere and Winger give great performances the film belongs to Louis Gosset Jr who won a well deserved Oscar for his role as Foley. The difference between Gosset and R. Lee Emery in Full Metal Jacket is Emery was a former gunnery sergerant in the Marines and Gosset never had milatry experince to my knowledge which makes the film all the more enjoyable. Throw in some comedy a few fight scenes and some sex scenes and you have a great crowd pleasing film that anyone can enjoy. I give the film  stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Night Of The Hunter' is recognized by most critics and hard core film buffs as one of the most extraordinary movies ever made but sadly it's still frequently overlooked by the many movie fans probably because it's so difficult to categorize. Yes it's a thriller but it's also a child's nightmare. A Noir but also a fable. Robert Mitchum gives one of his very best performances as Harry Powell the charming but evil preacher with love tattooed on one hand hate on the other. Powell is one of the most memorable screen villains of all time and 'The Night Of The Hunter' is worth watching just for Mitchum who is mesmerizing.  Shelley Winters is surprisingly effective as the widow Powell woos Peter Graves has a small role at the beginning as her first husband and Lillian Gish plays the saintly Ms. Cooper guardian of unwanted children.  Because this movie isn't set in isn't the real world many viewers don't know exactly how to react to it. Charles Laughton's small town America is a stylized dreamlike place in some ways not unlike David Lynch's twisted world depicted in 'Blue Velvet' and 'Twin Peaks'.  It also reminds me of Flannery O'Connor's Gothic South in her classic novels 'Wise Blood' and 'The Violent Bear It Away'. Some of the scenes involving Powell menacing Winters' children deliberately invoke James Whale's 'Frankenstein' and the sequence depicting the children's journey down the river is charming but blatantly artificial. While I'm a big fan of outsider film makers like Russ Meyer Coffin Joe and Alejandro Jodorowsky I also greatly admire those who work within the system but still manage to subvert Hollywood with doses of surrealism. I'm thinking of movies such as 'Kiss Me Deadly' 'Shock Corridor' and 'The Manchurian Candidate'. Each of these films are unique but they also remind me of each other and of 'The Night Of The Hunter'. I highly recommend them all and wish that there were a lot more movies like them today. 'The Night Of The Hunter' is essential viewing for anybody interested in American movies!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a shame Charle Laughton the distinguished actor didn't direct more films. As he clearly indicates with The Night of the Hunter he had a rare gift for guiding a production into achieving greatness. This film which didn't receive the attention it got when it was released has turned out to be something discerning movie fans saw from the start a classic.Charles Laughton was basically a man of the theater then came the movies but he was at heart someone who was equally at ease working on the stage or performing in front of a camera. Mr. Laughton undertook to direct this screen play written by another distinguished American writer and critic James Agee based on the David Grubb's novel.The result is a magnificent film about to what extreme a man will go in order to steal from two young and innocent children something their father had left for them in trust. The evil character of Harry Powell a charlatan preacher taking advantage of poor and unsophisticated country folk is one of the best creations in the novel. Harry Powell doesn't care what he must do to get his hands in the money. He marries the children's mother a widow who was hoping for some happiness in her life only as part of his overall scheme of things.The film is a poetic account of the story with great emphasis on the kindness the children receive at the end from Rachel Cooper a woman with a heart of gold who took John and Pearl into her home when they needed it.Robert Mitchum is the evil Harry Powell. It's without a doubt one of Mr. Mitchum's best screen work. As guided by the director the actor gives a performance that still surprises whoever watches the film for the first time. Shelley Winters plays Willa the widow who can't sense the danger connected to the man she marries. Lillian Gish is another luminous presence in the film because she projects nononsense kindness and sweetness toward the children she takes into her home.The film also is enhanced by the brilliant black and white cinematography by Stanley Carter. The film still shows a pristine look fifty years after it was released. Also the musical score of Walter Shumann adds another layer in the film's texture.The Night of the Hunter is ultimately a work of art that moves the viewer because of the tremendous work its director Charles Laughton gave to the movie.".

Mr. Laughton undertook to direct this screen play written by another distinguished American writer and critic James Agee based on the David Grubb's novel.The result is a magnificent film about to what extreme a man will go in order to steal from two young and innocent children something their father had left for them in trust. The evil character of Harry Powell a charlatan preacher taking advantage of poor and unsophisticated country folk is one of the best creations in the novel. Harry Powell doesn't care what he must do to get his hands in the money. He marries the children's mother a widow who was hoping for some happiness in her life only as part of his overall scheme of things.The film is a poetic account of the story with great emphasis on the kindness the children receive at the end from Rachel Cooper a woman with a heart of gold who took John and Pearl into her home when they needed it.Robert Mitchum is the evil Harry Powell. It's without a doubt one of Mr. Mitchum's best screen work. As guided by the director the actor gives a performance that still surprises whoever watches the film for the first time. Shelley Winters plays Willa the widow who can't sense the danger connected to the man she marries. Lillian Gish is another luminous presence in the film because she projects nononsense kindness and sweetness toward the children she takes into her home.The film also is enhanced by the brilliant black and white cinematography by Stanley Carter. The film still shows a pristine look fifty years after it was released. Also the musical score of Walter Shumann adds another layer in the film's texture.The Night of the Hunter is ultimately a work of art that moves the viewer because of the tremendous work its director Charles Laughton gave to the movie.";

While in prison for his crime he sleep talks and betrays himself to the religiously unhinged Rev Harry Powell. Powell leaves jail with Harper dead in his cell and sets out to infiltrate the family and get the money.  However when he kills John's mother he and his sister go on the run from him.One of these hindsight is 2020' films that gains a reputation with time this film deserves the praise in gets in many areas and deserve to be very fondly remembered or at least a lot more fondly than it was received by critics and audiences of the time.  The plot is basic but full of religious imagery that works very well whether it's Powell's twisted preacher or the runs of scripture that many of the characters cling to.  The film presents itself with a very strong tone of foreboding and darkness that makes the material and characters feel more dangerous.Most of the credit for this belongs with Laughton as director who uses shadow really well and frames the film with clever shots.  Some that come to mind is the shadow of Powell on his horse on the horizon or the woman in the car underwater and so on.  It stills feels clever and inventive now so it must have been seen as very different in the fifties.  How he didn't win an Oscar I'm not sure  wonder what else was up in this year.Mitchum is tremendous in the title role his role is larger than life and was also slightly playing with fire in it's portrayal as a reverend as corrupt or evil.  Chapin is really wonderful as young John and has a much better character than some of the others in the cast.  Winters is good in her performance.  The only downside of the film is the 10 minutes at the end which feel like they are a happy ending that has just been tacked on and doesn't fit with the tone of the film.Other than that this is a very strong film in terms of theme plot acting and cinematography.  It deserves more than it got at the time and I'm glad that modern audiences are finding this film all the time.".

Who can forget that famous underwater scene wherein a dead woman's body sits upright in a car with her hair flowing along the current like seaweed accompanied by background music that is so dreamlike? One of my favorite images is the one wherein Willa Harper Shelley Winters lies in blissful repose on a bed as Harry Powell Robert Mitchum stands by a window in an unadorned room with angular walls that slope upward as if in a church.One of the most haunting and famous sequences has the two children John and Pearl in a rowboat as they make a Homeric odyssey down a river lorded over by giant spider webs frogs and rabbits. And then there's that electrifying scene with Rachel Cooper Lillian Gish in silhouette sitting in a chair holding a shotgun as Harry Powell sings Leaning On The Everlasting Arms. Cinematic brilliance extraordinaire!Consistent with its expressionistic visuals the story is presented from the POV of a child's nightmare. John and Pearl symbolize innocence and the bogeyman comes in the form of an adult a godlike man who cons the gullible townsfolk including the children's mom. Our good reverend Powell is less interested in saving souls than he is in finding all that loot stashed away somewhere. Thus the film's underlying theme is at least as relevant now as it was fifty years ago the film has not aged one bit.Production design is sparse true to the film's visual style and to the setting in Depression era West Virginia. The casting is perfect. Robert Mitchum has just the right look and voice for the part of Harry Powell. I like how he calls to John and Pearl ... chilldrenn? Lillian Gish is wellsuited to represent ... reality.And those two kids likewise are ideally cast. Love the way Pearl with her round face and those ragamuffin curls refers to herself in that Southern drawl as Pell. And the film's horror combines with humor in many scenes one of which has Pell sitting on the ground with scissors in hand nonchalantly cutting up paper currency into paper dolls.Acting is generally exaggerated again consistent with what one would expect in a nightmare. Evelyn Varden as Icey Spoon love that name hams it up in a gossipy mother hen sort of way. And Shelley Winters effectively jitters her way through the film ghostlike her character lost in delusion.The film's original score is haunting and mournful and could hardly set a more appropriate tone Dream little one dream dream my little one dream oh the hunter in the night fills your childish heart with fright fear is only a dream so little one dream.With its brilliant photography its unpopular but deeply truthful theme and its nightmarish story Charles Laughton's The Night Of The Hunter is high up on my list of twenty best films of all time.".

She's there to be a contrast to Mitchum. Her actions speak her faith a lot louder than Mitchum's phony ramblings.Another role I like in this is that of Evelyn Varden. She and husband Don Beddoe employ Shelley Winters at their drug store and she's all full of concern in a showy pharisee like way for the kids. She's totally taken with Mitchum but when he's unmasked as a phony her rage is something to see on screen.Sad that Charles Laughton didn't do more behind the camera than this one film.

	schema:headline " An interesting failure";
	schema:reviewBody "The Night of the Hunter 1955This interesting failure was directed by Charles Laughton in his only directing foray and stars Shelly Winters and Robert Mitchum. You may also recognize Lillian Gish and Peter Graves. There's some dispute on how to characterize the film film noir horror melodrama and I will be so bold as to say that this is one of the flaws in Laughton's vision  he didn't get his vision clearly on the screen. The story is something like this. It's the Depression. Ben Graves is married to Willa Winters and they have two kids. Ben is involved in a robberymurder and hides 10000 telling only his two kids where the cash is. Ben is caught and sentenced to hang. His cellmate is Mitchum's character Harry Powell. Powell knows the ten grand was never found Ben mumbles enough in his sleep to tell Powell the kids know the location of the loot. Ben is hanged Powell serves his time and hightails it to the widow's home.He marries Willa and starts working on the kids to tell him where the money is hidden. He murders Willa and the two kids hop on their rowboat and float down the river with the reverend in hot pursuit. We follow the story to the end Powell gets his just reward the money is returned and some people live more or less happily ever after in the Depression.What makes the movie both a failure and worth watching is Laughton's vision of the tale and Stanley Cortez's cinematography. I'm not sure who did the sets and the lighting but I'll take those designs as my clues that Laughton was making a moral tale along the lines of Homer's Odyssey with German Expressionism very much in the forefront. In some scenes Willa's bedroom is a normal room. In other scenes the room becomes a cathedral and hell at the same time. The ceiling becomes highly arched with inset windows and that part of the set is over lit almost whited out. This is where Brother Powell holds forth on his sermon of hate and love communing with his god. In the foreground of the set Willa is in her bed set on total blackness she's lighted but in and on a void. The former natural realism of the bedroom is totally gone and we know we're in another universe where Powell is god master of love and hate life and death. And where Powell is master there's not that much difference between love and hate and not that great a gulf between life and death. The set shows us who's where in the grand scheme of things. Spoilers below for those who haven't seen the movie so don't look.But the problem is we just have a serious of beautifully composed and filmed scenes. Laughton had magnificent visions but his storytelling lets us down. Nevertheless The Night of the Hunter is worth watching for the same reasons as Metropolis and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari  Laughton was a genius in getting beautiful images on the screen.I'd say that those who think this is a film noir have missed the boat.Film noir in my take on it had more than darkly lit scenes to create the genre. The text of the film was cynicism shown by a bunch of losers who know they'll never win but have nothing to lose by going through whatever motions they can scare up a motive for. No one can be trusted loss is inevitable and all misdeeds will inevitably be punished.In The Night of the Hunter Laughton goes more to Expressionism. The sets he uses are highly stylized The transformation of Willa's bedroom for example where it becomes a cathedral and a void heaven and hell. Powell's introduction to the family is by the casting of his silhouette on the wall of the children's bedroom. His constant song is Leaning on the Everlasting Arms and in one mesmerizing scene he sings it in round with Rachel Gish the devil counterpointed by a saint. The theme of The Night of the Hunter is more akin to madness than to cynical loss. Powell's pursuit of the children again in my opinion has less to do with horror than with his mad obsession with the money. His attempts to do them in are not based on his evilness but on his callous regard for money. In horror movies there is a monster who destroys simply because it's in the script. Here Powell destroys because he's insane driven by his lust for money.Another key to the Expressionist bent of the movie is Mitchum's performance. Often his acting is completely believable and natural but there are many scenes where Powell is off kilter the acting is strange. Powell has crossed from our reality into his and we need to understand with his understanding not ours. Mitchum's ability to swing from completely realistic acting to symbolism gave me new respect for his talent.SPOILERS Powell has HATE tattooed on the knuckles of his left hand and LOVE on the knuckles of his right. Some will know the ancient word for left is sinister and for right is droit. Powell also has a switchblade knife. And he hates sex and sexuality. We see him in a burlesque theater watching a woman do a sensual dance on stage. The camera drops from his face to his waist and the steel blade pops out of his pocket. Is this phallic? You bet. This is our first symbolic hint of the reverend's proclivities. It turns out he hates all women on his wedding night with Willa he coldly refuses sex with her.In the scene where he murders her the symbolism is running rampant and you may notice that he stabs her with his blade held in the hand tattooed with LOVE. The reverend is a twisted man indeed.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Night of the Hunter 1955This interesting failure was directed by Charles Laughton in his only directing foray and stars Shelly Winters and Robert Mitchum. You may also recognize Lillian Gish and Peter Graves. There's some dispute on how to characterize the film film noir horror melodrama and I will be so bold as to say that this is one of the flaws in Laughton's vision  he didn't get his vision clearly on the screen. The story is something like this. It's the Depression. Ben Graves is married to Willa Winters and they have two kids. Ben is involved in a robberymurder and hides 10000 telling only his two kids where the cash is. Ben is caught and sentenced to hang. His cellmate is Mitchum's character Harry Powell. Powell knows the ten grand was never found Ben mumbles enough in his sleep to tell Powell the kids know the location of the loot. Ben is hanged Powell serves his time and hightails it to the widow's home.He marries Willa and starts working on the kids to tell him where the money is hidden. He murders Willa and the two kids hop on their rowboat and float down the river with the reverend in hot pursuit. We follow the story to the end Powell gets his just reward the money is returned and some people live more or less happily ever after in the Depression.What makes the movie both a failure and worth watching is Laughton's vision of the tale and Stanley Cortez's cinematography. I'm not sure who did the sets and the lighting but I'll take those designs as my clues that Laughton was making a moral tale along the lines of Homer's Odyssey with German Expressionism very much in the forefront. In some scenes Willa's bedroom is a normal room. In other scenes the room becomes a cathedral and hell at the same time. The ceiling becomes highly arched with inset windows and that part of the set is over lit almost whited out. This is where Brother Powell holds forth on his sermon of hate and love communing with his god. In the foreground of the set Willa is in her bed set on total blackness she's lighted but in and on a void. The former natural realism of the bedroom is totally gone and we know we're in another universe where Powell is god master of love and hate life and death. And where Powell is master there's not that much difference between love and hate and not that great a gulf between life and death. The set shows us who's where in the grand scheme of things. Spoilers below for those who haven't seen the movie so don't look.But the problem is we just have a serious of beautifully composed and filmed scenes. Laughton had magnificent visions but his storytelling lets us down. Nevertheless The Night of the Hunter is worth watching for the same reasons as Metropolis and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari  Laughton was a genius in getting beautiful images on the screen.I'd say that those who think this is a film noir have missed the boat.Film noir in my take on it had more than darkly lit scenes to create the genre. The text of the film was cynicism shown by a bunch of losers who know they'll never win but have nothing to lose by going through whatever motions they can scare up a motive for. No one can be trusted loss is inevitable and all misdeeds will inevitably be punished.In The Night of the Hunter Laughton goes more to Expressionism. The sets he uses are highly stylized The transformation of Willa's bedroom for example where it becomes a cathedral and a void heaven and hell. Powell's introduction to the family is by the casting of his silhouette on the wall of the children's bedroom. His constant song is Leaning on the Everlasting Arms and in one mesmerizing scene he sings it in round with Rachel Gish the devil counterpointed by a saint. The theme of The Night of the Hunter is more akin to madness than to cynical loss. Powell's pursuit of the children again in my opinion has less to do with horror than with his mad obsession with the money. His attempts to do them in are not based on his evilness but on his callous regard for money. In horror movies there is a monster who destroys simply because it's in the script. Here Powell destroys because he's insane driven by his lust for money.Another key to the Expressionist bent of the movie is Mitchum's performance. Often his acting is completely believable and natural but there are many scenes where Powell is off kilter the acting is strange. Powell has crossed from our reality into his and we need to understand with his understanding not ours. Mitchum's ability to swing from completely realistic acting to symbolism gave me new respect for his talent.SPOILERS Powell has HATE tattooed on the knuckles of his left hand and LOVE on the knuckles of his right. Some will know the ancient word for left is sinister and for right is droit. Powell also has a switchblade knife. And he hates sex and sexuality. We see him in a burlesque theater watching a woman do a sensual dance on stage. The camera drops from his face to his waist and the steel blade pops out of his pocket. Is this phallic? You bet. This is our first symbolic hint of the reverend's proclivities. It turns out he hates all women on his wedding night with Willa he coldly refuses sex with her.In the scene where he murders her the symbolism is running rampant and you may notice that he stabs her with his blade held in the hand tattooed with LOVE. The reverend is a twisted man indeed.";

Mitchum plays his role brilliantly and even the children play their parts well but some of the older actors are guilty of overeagerness and put in comically hammy performances. The score is guilty of being similarly over the top as it announces Mitchum's entrance there's no doubt that you really aren't supposed to like him. But it is unfair perhaps to criticize it for sticking to the styles of the times.The second half is a different matter as the children run away to escape the evil preacher's clutches. From this point onwards it turns into a form of social commentary Gee look at the problems they had back then complete with seasonal workers and a sort of orphanarium. On top of the theologizing such a message is a bit unnecessary and only serves to slow down the film's pace and delay it's inevitable conclusion. It even turns into a TV Christmas movie of sorts before announcing its end and such an offkey conclusion spoils the great work put in in the first half.Overall it's very good and is definitely worth watching with some good performances and cinematography but as it draws towards its slow end and Christmas scenes you'll be left wondering what might have been.".

The subject is a psychopathic preacher who believes that God is telling him to murder women usually widowers and take their money.From the opening two shots and the first few lines of the preacher the characters history and intent is laid down. As quickly the first few scenes with the children show the circumstances that will bring about the main premise. After that you are allowed to wallow in Robert Mitchums role as the over acting preacher. Laughton directs very well with some visually rich scenes and wonderful shots. However there are a couple of cheesy moments of dialogue and a few almost laughable scenes. Despite this it's a very good movie with some stunning acting from Robert Mitchum.".

	schema:reviewBody "To Roger Ebert 'The Night of the Hunter' is one of the Great Movies. To Pauline Kael it's one of the most frightening movies ever made. To me well... it's neither. It definitely has its moments. Brilliant actor Charles Laughton's one and only directorial effort is a very offbeat stylized film that takes a lot of chances. Unfortunately not many of them work. The main problem I think is that the story it tries to tell is at odds with the presentation and performances. The latter suggest a kind of Twilight Zoneish children's fable dreamlike at times not meant to resemble real life. And yet the story reminds one more of another film starring Robert Mitchum 'Cape Fear' gritty realistic even meanspirited. The two just don't blend together into an effective whole. There is humor here and it is perhaps the most effective part of 'The Night of the Hunter.' Small town religion and Americana circa 1930 are spoofed throughout sometimes pretty heavyhandedly but it's hard not to laugh when Shelley Winters' character exclaims I feel clean! My body's aquiverin' with cleanliness. Winters herself looks like she can barely keep from laughing after delivering the line. Mitchum has his share of funny moments too. It's when he's supposed to be menacing that the movie comes up short. His Preacher Harry Powell can't touch 'Cape Fear's' Max Cady in terms of malevolent creepiness. Powell is a conartist posing as a man of God who discovers that two young siblings John and Pearl Harper know where 10000 is hidden. It was given them by their nowdead father who had them swear never to reveal its whereabouts to anyone even their mother Willa Winters. Powell marries Willa for the express purpose of getting his hands on the money. The lack of any graphically believable violence is in this case a fatal flaw. When Powell finally comes after the children his manner is more like a boogeyman in an Abbott  Costello movie than a genuinely deranged killer which he's supposed to be. Now I know all the artfilm critics would call me a numbskull for not appreciating the 'poetic' approach Laughton and his cinematographer take but again it just doesn't work for this kind of material. After the children escape there is a lovely almost surreal scene where they drift down a river in a skiff and the setting becomes even more like one in a dream or fairy tale. The art direction is beautiful and for a few moments it is a magical film. The story takes a different direction during the last part of the movie as John and Pearl are taken in by elderly woman Rachel a sort of biblequoting occasionally shotguntoting Mrs. PiggleWiggle. She runs an orphanage of sorts and protects the brother and sister when Powell comes after them though not through any particularly imaginative means. He is eventually arrested and sentenced to hang. There are a few more bizarre scenes such as the townspeople rising up in anger to lynch Powell once they discover his true past. They tear up a drugstore and march down the street carrying torches as if they were going after Frankenstein's Monster and we expect a vicious hanging scene then the police simply smuggle Powell out a back door and drive him away. So much for the lynch mob. Rachel and the kids celebrate Christmas while Rachel spouts more homely homilies she's got a million of 'em. The end. Like I said I don't know maybe I'm completely insensitive and unperceptive but the best I can say about 'The Night of the Hunter' is that it's a very mixed bag. Billy Chapin I wonder whatever happened to him gives a fine performance as the boy John who really is the character that holds the movie together. I think lurking somewhere in the myriad of ideas that make up 'The Night of the Hunter' is a great movie but Charles Laughton just couldn't find it.".

John knows where the money is hidden but Harper has sworn him to secrecy a move John quickly resents when posing preacher Harry Powell Robert Mitchum comes to town. Powell shared a cell with Harper who immediately after hiding the money was arrested for murder and armed robbery. Ben is executed and the wicked Powell released from jail moves in on Willa Shelly Winters Harper's gullible widow hoping to draw out the secret of the money's location. As tensions mount it becomes progressively clear that the only hope for the children's salvation rests with regional matriarch and philanthropist Rachel Cooper Lillian Gish who always keeps her doors open for displaced youngsters.It's not often that I'm stumped by the question of why a classic is a classic but thanks to Night of the Hunter I know it's not unthinkable. Yes the cinematography is amazing even by the standards of film noir but the pace is rushed the plot is a walking disaster and the characters  if we can call them that  more closely resemble flotsam.The movie opens with Gish's disembodied head floating on a backdrop of stars the drifting heads of children listening with rapt attention to her formulaic Bibletalk. Even if we grasp the intended irony of the moment  a dreamy segue into a deadly nightmare  there's no escaping how Godblastedly cheesy the image looks how it feels more like a presage to Sesame Street or an eighties sitcom than a purportedly moving work of horror. As an intro it destroys any precedent for subtlety. We're less than a minute into the movie and it's already abundantly clear that our storytellers have absolutely no faith in our ability to figure anything out for ourselves.The trend continues with the introduction of Harry Powell. Eschewing what could have been a very creepy experience  encountering the dark side of Powell in a slow subtle and actiondriven manner  Powell hits us over the head with a string of didactic monologues our occasion for discovery smashed right at the outset. Ben Harper by contrast is dispensed with so quickly we're barely aware of his presence. He's a completely wasted opportunity a perfunctory McGuffin for an even more perfunctory plot. The movie would have been much more powerful if John had gone through the story haunted by the memory of a loving father who died in a desperate act to provide for him. Instead Harper's only function is to set the story in motion and as soon as he does this he disappears from view and from memory.Willa Harper is even more obnoxious. A pivotal factor in the story Willa's fanatic devotion to Powell is the main instigation of everything else that follows but because we never get a sense of who Willa was prior to Powell's arrival her devotion feels unfounded her behavior seems unreasonable and as a consequence everything else in the story feels like it's balancing on thin air. Why is this woman so easily brainwashed? Why does Powell consistently come out on top? Every single plotpoint is at best the product of characters acting mysteriously and at worst the product of characters behaving in a manner completely opposed to reason. How an entire town can get swept up in the patently obvious lies of a figure like Powell is beyond me especially to the extent that they side against their own. There's nothing particularly strategic about Powell's methods nor is he notably charismatic or even all that bright. He constantly loses his temper performs actions so rash and brainless you'd expect immediate rejoinder and holds among his many beliefs the boneheaded conviction that the best way to track down a fugitive is to ride through open country and sing at the top of his lungs. Yet Powell always gets way because the rest of the universe is too stupid to stop him and it's precisely this idiocy that drives the story forward not the heroes and certainly not the villain.Which brings me to the last point acting i.o.w. what the devil is everyone smoking? I respect Robert Mitchum a great deal but his performance as Powell is woefully overthetop inyourface and not the least bit compelling. Gish is great but the credits start rolling before she's even gotten her feet on the ground. Shelly Winters is a tremendous actress and she does her best as Willa but again the character is so poorly written that she comes across feeling like a mariner who's been thrown off the edge of a ship floundering for all she's worth but no match for the deadweight of the screenplay which drags her to the bottom and feels no remorse. Worst of all is Chapin as John suffering from prolifically delayed reaction time always lagging at least a secondandahalf behind whatever he's supposed to be responding to. Expressions of shock and anger seem to come out of nowhere a clear indication of his being taught to look and act in a particular way at a particular moment without anyone telling him why. I'm not blaming the kid for this. I'm blaming Charles Laughton who found children so dislikable he dumped them all on Mitchum who did his best to direct them but was clearly not up to the punch.All in all I'm at a loss as to why this movie continues to garner such widespread acclaim save the unfortunate reality that the herd mentality of movie criticism discourages any kind of dissension so we continue trumpeting the virtues of fossils long after they've outlived their usefulness.".

She is certainly capable of better than this horrible performance which evokes no emotion whatsoever beyond disbelief. And Robert Mitchum! He certainly shows some chops but my goodness has there ever been a more ignorant and stupid character in film history? He'd fit right in with Dumb and Dumber! How could anyone in his position who ostensibly had gotten away with murder and robbery on several occasions NOT see that the money was hidden in the doll? He oozes menace in some scenes but then is reduced to popping up like something in a carnival shooting gallery and whooping his way into a barn when Lillian Gish shoots him. Seriously if you want subdued menace in a BELIEVABLE character how about Tony Perkins in Psycho or Sterling Hayden in almost anything? The only actors who manage to pull off believable performances are Billy Chapin and a wonderful Peter Graves who in the few minutes he has on screen outacts old Bob handily. Think about it you actually sympathize with a robber and murderer because Graves turns in an almost Fondaesque performance. Oh and I can't leave out the wonderful old James Gleason as Uncle Birdie. He's both likable and pitiful and has far too little screen time. In addition to lame dialogue and poor directing the sound track is an evil entity of its own. Laughton uses it with the subtlety of a jackhammer to announce that Rev Powell is a bad guy or Rev Powell is on that train etc. I'm all for overshadowing but these hints are more like headlines.Most of the remaining cast of characters are almost cartoons. Evelyn Varden does a particularly egregious bit of overacting as Icey Spoon. In fact the film itself could be a parody of film noir! Come on Lillian Gish actually SINGS A DUET with the menacing man sitting outside her house waiting to kill her! I have no idea why people feel compelled to rave about the greatness of this film. It doesn't hold a candle to REAL 1950's film classics like Kubrick's The Killing or Hatful of Rain or On the Waterfront which has more feeling and menace and credibility in the cab scene than Night of the Hunter has in its entire fabric. Face it folks there's a good reason why this was Charles Laughton's ONLY directorial offering.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Night of the Hunter 1955Makebelieve made believable and mythic.Why Charles Laughton diverged from his gifts as an actor to play the role just this once in a lifetime as movie director I don't know. But I wish he had more often. Night of the Hunter is not only a welldirected engrossing moving film. It's utterly original. It isn't afraid to be tender and even sentimental and it isn't afraid to have a very bad man doing bad bad things. It has a mythic river the Ohio not the Mississippi but with the same aura of escape as Huck Finn's river that creates a flow literal and metaphoric. And it has innocent children who do you see abide. Laughton puts this together visually as if we are inside a children's storybook. It's all fake like the Wizard of Oz is fake but unlike Dorothy and her friends these are real people facing very real consequences. Boy is this a good movie to rock the boat of evangelism. Of course Robert Mitchum as the evil preacher is a psycho but why can no one see it but us? Even the children don't quite know it until he starts very quickly abusing them. The only one who does see right away is the other religious icon in the film a truly angelic older woman helping orphans in the Depression. When she hears Mitchum start to go into an eloquent and clumsy parable she practically rolls her eyes. Oh do we all love that! At last someone who will save the day.And she does this woman played by none other than Lillian Gish in a role very nonsilent and very compelling. This story belongs to her reallyshe starts the movie off as a storyteller before it transitions to the preacher up to no good. Mitchum's voice is in full power here big and yet caressing until it barks. Or it singswhat a voice! Even the other characters comment on it and yes it's really Mitchum singing. When Gish and Mitchum meet and maybe most of all when they sing a perfect ethereal duet it's like a clash of many worldsgoodness and evil piety and charlatanism Silver Screen and Golden Age. By the last I mean that the kind of movies that Gish made decades earlier and the kind that Mitchum was making right then are implicitly face to face. Even the false and exaggerated stage sets and lighting are more 1920s German Expressionism than film noir though the latter is unavoidable with this kind of theme and dark style in 1955. Remember that Laughton loved the stage and cinematographer Stanley Cortez had a long career working on dramatic films including The Magnificent Ambersons.There are people those used to the increasingly realistic movies since the late 1960s who can't abide by this style of moving making with its deliberate artifice mixed with convincing characters. The trick is to let go of the expectation that the movie is trying to be naturalistic just as you let go when you watch Citizen Kane. The moment when Mitchum is chasing the children through the brush to the boat on the shore is key. Mitchum is taking far too long to get through the brambles and the kids are struggling forever to just get in the boat and push off. After all this suspended franticness the mood shifts in one heartbeat to the dark water silently carrying the kids off to safety. The girls stretches out with her doll and the boy puts his head down on his arm.The other thing this movie does two decades after when it is set is provide hope against even the worst of evil. Here is the idea that life is a beautiful illustration and we just need to see it that way to inhabit it safely. There really is a Lillian Gish out there somewhere there must be. We just have to close our eyes and follow the river.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Night of the Hunter 1955Makebelieve made believable and mythic.Why Charles Laughton diverged from his gifts as an actor to play the role just this once in a lifetime as movie director I don't know. But I wish he had more often. Night of the Hunter is not only a welldirected engrossing moving film. It's utterly original. It isn't afraid to be tender and even sentimental and it isn't afraid to have a very bad man doing bad bad things. It has a mythic river the Ohio not the Mississippi but with the same aura of escape as Huck Finn's river that creates a flow literal and metaphoric. And it has innocent children who do you see abide. Laughton puts this together visually as if we are inside a children's storybook. It's all fake like the Wizard of Oz is fake but unlike Dorothy and her friends these are real people facing very real consequences. Boy is this a good movie to rock the boat of evangelism. Of course Robert Mitchum as the evil preacher is a psycho but why can no one see it but us? Even the children don't quite know it until he starts very quickly abusing them. The only one who does see right away is the other religious icon in the film a truly angelic older woman helping orphans in the Depression.

This movie is very dated. Don't get me wrong I thoroughly enjoyed it until the novelty wore off but then I got extremely bored about the time the kids started drifting down the river and then all of a sudden it seemed like an entirely different film altogether and then Mitchum came back and nothing particularly climactic happened and then I was like what???!!!??

	schema:reviewBody "I'd heard so many great things about this movie that it was a major disappointment to finally watch it.Not that it isn't an interesting film. Mitchum portrays menace perhaps better than any other actor ever his wedding night lecture to Winters made my skin crawl the cinematography is fascinating and oddly reminiscent of the 1930s and Laughton certainly had a decent eye for the striking image the expressionistic composition of the bedroom shot where Winters is rabbiting on about their marriage while Mitchum stands at the window preparing to kill her is terrific and the underwater shot of Winters's body is justly famous though marred by a poor edit as the shot jumps awkwardly between toosimilar POVs. I'm even willing to forgive the overthetop acting since it fits in well with the 30sstyle filmmaking.But too much of the movie is absurdly overdirected the opening shot of Heads In Space is just plain silly and what is with all those shots of animals during the trip downriver? and Mitchum seems to have a real problem with the charm which the role requires I never for a second believed he could con anyone into thinking he was anything but a stone killer. The kiddie songs on the soundtrack are annoying and distracting especially the one that's supposed to be sung by Pearl who apparently sings much more articulately than she talks by the way Pearl Harper? Please!. And Mitchum's failure to catch the kids first in the basement and then in the river is utterly unconvincing.I find the kids' behavior after they flee completely implausible. This smart kid never thinks to call the cops? And when Powell passes them as they hide in the barn it never occurs to the kid to double back and head for home thus increasing the distance between them and the guy who wants to kill them? And since he's obviously following the river wouldn't it be a pretty obvious thought even for a kid to get away from the river rather than continue down it? And I didn't even think about the fact which another review reminded me of that these kids were carrying thousands of dollars in cash. Geez they could hire a cab to take them somewhere.And don't you think the kid might have considered telling the nice old lady who takes them in that they're being stalked by a knifewielding maniac especially when he shows up at the front door? And is it really plausible that Pearl should have forgotten that he tried to kill them and run to him with open arms? And after seeing the guy chase the boy around with a switchblade the old lady just chases him off but doesn't call the police even though the guy announces that he'll be back? No she waits around for him to come back shoots him with a shotgun then calls the police! Incidentally the police ask her the same very good question and I don't think they'd be satisfied with the smartass answer she tries to blow them off with. I know I'm not.And Mitchum's defeat is rather an anticlimax after all that buildup about what a big bad guy he's supposed to be.The boy's reaction to Mitchum's arrest is as others have said completely implausible given that we receive no indication that the boy ever felt anything warmer than intense suspicion for Mitchum's character. He certainly does not see him as a surrogate father which is what we are required to believe in order for the scene to make sense. And there's no way a judge would allow the prosecutor to ask the boy if that is the man who killed your mother. The boy has no direct knowledge of the crime.And you know there's a reason most directors outside of zany screwball comedy don't have their actors address the camera it cuts the thin thread that suspends the audience's disbelief. Another reason is that it looks really really stupid.And the denouement is let's face it just ridiculous.There is too much of interest here to rate this as merely mediocre but it is too deeply flawed to be counted a success.610.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has a lot going for it. From a technical aspect the cinematography is topnotch the actors are among Poland's best including the great Boguslaw Linda in the lead role and the plot is fast paced and entertaining. The themes of this movie lend themselves to a lot of thinking about the role of UN Peacekeeping Forces.During the hight of the Bosnian War Poland occupied fourth place in the rankings of contributers of military contingents in Yugoslavia even though they had not yet been admitted as a member of NATO. Peacekeeping troops were very limited on what they were allowed to do even when they found themselves or civilians in dangerously grave situations. At the time this movie was made they were often unarmed. It is important to point out that at the time of this film's release the war in Yugoslavia was reaching a point of conflict not seen in Europe since the Second World War and human rights violations including ethnic cleansing were reaching a level on par with genocide. This movie revolves around a Major in the Polish Army who makes the decision to deliberately disobey UN policy in order to attempt the rescue of fellow Polish soldiers. This decision puts his men in harms way and some of them are killed because of his decision. However his decision to violate UN policy allows him to save the live's of an entire village of people and isn't that one reason why Peacekeeping troops should be employed? In the end the bad guys lose. Winning wasn't easy nor was it achieved without sacrifice. Success primarily came about because someone decided to get tough. To me the movie gave a clear message that the UN needed to take more of a get tough policy regarding the Bosnian Crisis especially in the matter of how much force can be used to protect civilians.It is interesting to note several events that happened within a year of this films release. One Poland was admitted as a member of NATO. Two the UN changed their policies and rules of engagement governing the use of force allowing peacekeepers to use all necessary means to protect civilians in their immediate vicinity and prevent violence against UN staff and personnel. Third the US and NATO intervened with a more forceful approach that caused Yugoslavia to cease it's conflict. This is one of the few movies I have seen that dealt with current current when the film was made military issues not made in the USA. I found it fascinating to see a film that expressed viewpoints regarding peacekeeping from another country.Granted it may not compare to some of Hollywood's military blockbusters but this is a wellmade thoughtprovoking movie. I wish I had discovered it years ago. I highly recommend it.".

Arguably they are civilians in uniforms.  Faced with a real enemy they are forced to handle their fears and endure the shock of shooting at people and being hurt themselves.  The finale makes you think whether fighting against the 'bad guys' makes any sense anyway  what difference does it make?  The 'good guys' get hurt in the process too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like this movie very much. From the very first watch I fell in love with this excellent and very serious work. The theme  civil war in the former Yugoslavia  is one of my favorite. There are so many bad American films where the Serbs are always mean bloody killers where brave US soldiers save the poor civilians that I am tired of them. This film is far better one. There are no good or bad Serbs here instead there is a gang of ferocious bandits who rape and kill everybody around. The squad of Polish UN Peacekeepers comes to the mountains to save the fallen helicopter crew. Here we see the Polish film stars Boguslaw Linda Zbiegniew Zamachowski among others. The squad faces many terrible battles several soldiers are killed in action and the scene of devastating Gypsy village is horrible realistic. Gloomy dark music adds to it very much. I must admit that the main idea is very good  there is no winner in any civil war. This bloodchilling portrait of brotherly killing is so astonishingly true to life that you simply feel no other thing but a deep dull pain at heart. I do recommend this excellent film to those who are interested in the Balkan War history.".

I liked the film  the action is swift and the characters' portraits are realistic. The events taking place are quite truthful if someone gets shot he screams and bleeds if his wound is fatal he does not talk for another hour but he dies almost instantly as it usually happens in real life... Although it is not a masterpiece it CAN still provide some entertainment   Apart from being an action movie it also reveals the intricate peacekeepers'specific dilemmas. All in all it is worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The ONLY good thing about this movie is Miroslaw Baka Cichy.  It's a wonder that Boguslaw Linda Keller gets such a high percentage of leading roles in Polish movies every year.  It's also sad how Polish movies are desperately trying to imitate American films now that model American films for certain genres have become more available to Polish viewers in the 1990s.  This awful picture is a combination of a rogue notbythebook military officer out to set the world right and nonsensical international espionage.  And they managed to drag poor Goya into the title! P.S. See Miroslaw Baka in Krzysztof Kieslowski's Krotki film o zabijaniu A Short Film about Killing.".
