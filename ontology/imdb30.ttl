Having overcome the barriers created by your dissection of characters and plot I was surprised to find the film both rewarding and enjoyable despite Mandy Moore's hair color. The cinematography was fresh as was the use of music. The characters had emotional dimensions of complexity and interest in contrast to the flat facades too often presented in today's films. Henry's deep neuroses were believably quirky and contributed to the intrigue of an unpredictable character. His intense dialog with his dead friend and partner gave vent to his inner confusion and added a charmingly bizarre facet of interest to the film.

The Director Justin Theroux was at the showing and answered some questions and he said some interesting things. First the whole movie was done on a 1M dollar budget and they shot it in 23 days. As for the movie it was a very different movie from the music to the cinematography with a fresh taste to it. The main character Henry Roth played by Billy Crudup was an amazing role. I wouldn't be surprised to hear awards galore for Crudup. Equally as impressive was Mandy Moore I expected very little out of Moore but she delivered an amazing performance that will surprise many and officially launch her acting career and establish her as a top talent. It's a story of mental disorders and people falling in love in unlikely circumstances. At times it can get scary as the writer does an amazing job of keeping you guessing. It's without an amazing movie and I'd recommend it to anybody.".

Billy Crudup does a great job as the selfhating and worldhating pessimist in this movie. His wonderful portrayal of such an awful yet complicated character makes it all the more enjoyable to see him come around and finally warm up to someone. I've seen Mandy Moore in films before and thought shes always been a better actress then people give her credit for and this film goes to show that. This is Justin Thoreaux's directorial debut and a wonderful one at that. The writing is superb and the directing and acting only lend to the wonderful script. Tom Wilkinson gives another wonderful performance as he always does. If you want to see a film that'll make you laugh despite hating the characters at times but some how still miraculously fall in love with them and root for them then this is definitely the movie for you. It isn't your usual romantic comedy and putting it that genre is a stretch in itself but it is one of the smartest and most warm hearted movies you'll see this year.".

I also appreciated that Henry never uses the truth about Lucy's fianc as a means to win her affections.

	schema:reviewBody "Saw this at the premiere showing at Sundance where it played well for the crowd and apparently Harvery Weinstein liked it so much he bought it. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie as it featured a actor turned first time director and an unlikely pairing of serious actor Crudup and former pop star Mandy Moore. The movie feels part Garden State with a similar tale of depressedanxiety ridden guy meeting girl and romance. However Crudups character Henry who is a children's book author is far from being the lovable depressed dope he's edgy and seriously troubled from what is hinted at as an abusive childhood. Henry's only friend is Rusty his collaborator and book illustrator played by the always reliable Tom Wilkinson Rusty knows that Henry is on a path of self destruction an forewarns him that he may not always be around to help keep him sane. Rusty becomes ill and thus enters Lucy the new illustrator the transition as you would expect is not an easy on for Henry and he makes a mess of what is obviously a blessing in disguise. With Lucys persistence and willingness the two work on the book and romance is kindled however an old flame of Lucys proves a problem as does Henrys demons. Crudup as Henry is quite good but the character has such a sharp tongue and dark disposition at first that it was hard to not hold resentment against him for much of the film. However as the film goes on and Henry shows more of his likable eccentric quirks your hoping for him to change and that works in the films favor. Mandy Moore brings life to this film that made all the difference to me. As soon as her character Lucy enters the film the whole movie changed for the better. Without her sweet smile and persistent patience with Henry this film wouldn't work in the least. The director Justin Theroux who you probably know from Charlie's Angels 2 as the Irish gangster does a great job in his debut and works magic with the soundtrack and adds in some unique visuals along the way to enhance the viewing. All and All audiences should find this movie to be a good indie romance comedydrama the type one would expect from the indie world with rough edges and darker subject matter then your typical Hugh Grant Julia Roberts type stuff.".

Henry's only friend is Rusty his collaborator and book illustrator played by the always reliable Tom Wilkinson Rusty knows that Henry is on a path of self destruction an forewarns him that he may not always be around to help keep him sane. Rusty becomes ill and thus enters Lucy the new illustrator the transition as you would expect is not an easy on for Henry and he makes a mess of what is obviously a blessing in disguise. With Lucys persistence and willingness the two work on the book and romance is kindled however an old flame of Lucys proves a problem as does Henrys demons. Crudup as Henry is quite good but the character has such a sharp tongue and dark disposition at first that it was hard to not hold resentment against him for much of the film. However as the film goes on and Henry shows more of his likable eccentric quirks your hoping for him to change and that works in the films favor. Mandy Moore brings life to this film that made all the difference to me. As soon as her character Lucy enters the film the whole movie changed for the better. Without her sweet smile and persistent patience with Henry this film wouldn't work in the least. The director Justin Theroux who you probably know from Charlie's Angels 2 as the Irish gangster does a great job in his debut and works magic with the soundtrack and adds in some unique visuals along the way to enhance the viewing. All and All audiences should find this movie to be a good indie romance comedydrama the type one would expect from the indie world with rough edges and darker subject matter then your typical Hugh Grant Julia Roberts type stuff.";

The film tells the story of a neurotic children's book author Henry Roth Billy Crudrup who is forced to work with a female illustrator Mandy Moore instead of his usual collaborator Tom Wilkinson.The highpoint of the film is undoubtedly the acting. Billy Crudrup Almost Famous is fantastic as Henry displaying all the quirks one would expect from such a character. His performance seemed like a mix of John C. McGinley on Scrubs and Timothy Olyphant from The Girl Next Door. Mandy Moore is also very good and manages to create a real character instead of a generic loveinterest. This is easily her best acting performance to date. Tom Wilkinson shines as Henry's collaborator and only friend though it must be noted that his performance is somewhat similar to his Oscar nominated performance in Michael Clayton. Dianne Wiest Martin Freeman and Bob Balaban are also delightful in smaller supporting roles.The screenplay on the other hand is unfortunately the film's low point. The character's dialogue itself is fine actually it is very good. The problem of the script is the rather generic plot which too closely follows the boymeetgirl blueprint for romantic comedies. The film's ending is something that would be expected more of a Hollywood studio romantic comedy rather than a quirky indie.First time director Justin Theroux shows real promise here. While it is true that some of the transitions and editing between scenes are a bit too arty and selfconscious other things such as camera placement and shot composition are handled with all the skills of an experienced professional.Annoyances aside this is an easy film to recommend. Moore and Crudrup are infinitely watchable and Thereoux is good enough to deserve more directorial jobs. In the end the collective talent in front of and behind the camera elevates the middling plot into a very enjoyable film.".

Can't remember any big roles from him before but he really shines in this one. Mandy Moore wasn't too bad either. The only thing stopping me giving this movie a 9 or a 10 is the fact that I couldn't quite see the relationship with the two main characters growing to the measures I think it was supposed to.

It's hard to describe this movie... I guess you could call it a romantic comedy but it can also be under the Drama category as well. Billy Crudup was excellent as the cynical bitter author with deep psych issues. And yet despite his character I was still attracted to the guy and not just for his looks! The chemistry between Mandy and Billy was definitely there. So I am confused as to why some people didn't believe the two could have fallen in love? I say this because although their romance doesn't come full out until near the very end certain gestures and looks especially by Billy Henry convinced me that he was so very attracted to Mandy Lucy and was doing everything in his power to hide it or make it go away. Anyways I would really recommend this movie if you're looking for a different take on those typical romantic comedies. It certainly left me a bit teary eyed.".

Sadly just as the two friends are working on a Christmas book Rudy develops a brain tumor and dies. Now their editor is in dire straits. He must finish this book to save his own neck and that of Henry too. So without much choice this editor finds another illustrator Lucy Mandy Moore who is talented enough to continue the look of Martin's character. But horrors! With Henry a problem child who discourages Lucy at their initial meetings how will there be any hope of a finished book? Lucy is offered even more money to endure Henry's whims money she desperately needs. Also there are two other problems. One an old flame of Lucy's Jeremy Martin Freeman returns to try to win her back making Henry jealous yes jealous! Also Henry keeps talking and consulting Rudy every day in his mind. When will he let go? This obviously is a complicated film with honorable themes. Henry's distinct personality disorders are to be pitied yet his prickly and seemingly uncaring attitude make it difficult for others to like him. Lucy is no different. As the two main characters Crudup and Moore do wonderful work indeed. Wilkinson shines as well in fact I don't believe this gentleman could give a bad performance ever. All of the supporting crew including Diane Wiest are fine also. As for the Manhattan sets they are always welcome while costumes photography script and direction have their strong points too. In fact the story is a great look into the reality of life in Henry's world. Therefore those seeking a glimpse into the affliction of OCD would benefit from a view.

And second I am a hopeless romantic comedy enthusiast.I think that she is definitely developing her character from out of a refreshing character. She never chooses bad parts that have gratuitous elements of violence vulgarity or tasteless sex scenes. The man Crudup in this is amazing and yes very misogynistic and mocking of the women in his life. I found the OCD aspects believable and interesting to watch.But the chemistry that develops in his life with hers is really amazing and believable as they are cast well together. I do see that the character of Lucy makes sense in her attractions to men like this. I love the way he argues his apologies. The scene where she and he are in a bar and Lucy puts a stop to his sarcasm is point blank perfect. I know someone much like him.From my point of view the suffering that Billy Crudup went through with his abusive mother comes out competently in the screen play. The line about wht life us by the mentor figure Rudy near the end is priceless.Whatever one thinks of the arts expop stars throw it all away this movie is worth seeing repeatedly.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a surprise. I bought this film expecting an average love story with clichd scenarios and cheesy dialogue. Well it turns out I loved this film a lot and I can't believe I'm saying this Mandy Moore was great in this. I'm kinda partial with singers turning into actors so I'm not really a fan of the thing but Mandy Moore in this film is an exception. She was great I love her. She's not like those other singerturnedactors who has only one expression in their face and it never changes throughout the film. Like Norah Jones in 'Blueberry Nights' and all those rappers in gangster films. She was pretty good here. Her leading man is Billy Crudup. I can describe him in one word Phenomenal. He plays Henry Roth 50 First Dates homage? a neurotic eccentric crazy wacky children's books author who dislikes driving a car and likes to get his chest splotched by a stack of books. He reminds me of Woody Allen's character in Annie Hall They are very much similar. They're both neurotic they both look like they'll break down in a jiffy and they both dislike driving. Fantastic.This is the director's excellent directorial debut. The dialogue was great it contains some very memorable lines the chemistry between Mandy Moore and Billy Crudup sticks with you like super glue the acting is superb Tom Wilkinson huzzah and the cinematography is better than awesome. The editing magnifique.Dedication is a 9 out of ten.".

Yes it does have the label as a romcomdrama.. but it's really more the latter with the weird characters and storyline giving it the drama connotation. And to her credit she comes off pretty well in the role. It's not a completely dramatic role by any stretch of the imagination but it gives a good sense of what she might be capable of if she would get the opportunity. And while it's true she still has many years of acting before her seeing as she's just past 30 years old.. she has spend half her life so far involved in roles that no one will care about anytime into the future. Maybe it will never happen.. but I get that funny feeling if it would we'll be pleasantly surprised and have much more of a reason to follow her future career.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is barely watchable. I had the displeasure of seeing Just My Luck the day before I saw Dedication and I am saddened to say the former was more entertaining. I had the misfortune of attending the New York Premiere of this train wreck. I wrote a scathing blog about the experience on myspace. Here is a fun excerptThe line wasn't all that bad and we passed by Ms. Moore herself on the red carpet. Having lived in New York and seen my fair share of celebrities I was less than star struck. Still this had to be better than getting a root canal. Right? Wrong. At one point during this train wreck of a movie I actually longed for the sterile walls of the waiting room and the GQ magazine with Matt Damon on the cover. Sitting through a movie hasn't been this downright painful since well Saved. So we walk past the red carpet and into the lobby and the whole affair seems to be built upon understatement. It was like being caught in an excitement vacuum. I was actually setting the bar and that was only after I realized the popcorn and soda were free. Our seats were great too Mandy Moore and the rest of the cast were just a few rows back. Earlier on I mentioned I was forced to sit through this flick. Well my little buddy Jesse imagine a young Woody Allen and I had the idea to walk out about half way through. Unfortunately that would have meant walking past the entire cast. I think Jesse wanted to make a statement but I just didn't have the heart. My reasons for wanting to bail were based on relief of painful boredom not malice and haughtiness. Instead I went for an extended bathroom break. Mandy didn't even notice. I think she was too busy dying inside. Honestly the look on her face was a mixture of embarrassment and dread. The irony is Mandy Moore did a pretty good job. Her acting really wasn't bad. No the acting was the lesser of the evils. This thing was doomed the day writer David Bromberg sat down at his keyboard and decided he had a good idea for a screenplay. The idea being that some old man Rudy and a thirty something Henry are trying to write a children's book. They come up with a character named Marty the Beaver who is in fact a beaver. The idea for Marty struck Rudy played by the usually engrossing Tom Wilkinson while he was at an Xrated theatre looking for inspiration. Get it? Beaver? Yes I'm serious. They bring this idea to a publisher and it inexplicably sells. Marty becomes the next Barney although he is rude crude and his teeth are falling out of his face. Justin Theroux gets behind the camera this time and based on the shots and editing you almost feel like your watching the sequel to Requiem for a Dream and not a romantic comedy. The soundtrack is thumping and would be good if this was an action flick and you actually gave a damn about the characters.Seriously if you liked this movie god help you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like the central protagonist this 2007 movie is a misbegotten mess. Making his directorial debut actor Justin Theroux gets carried away with every film school trick in the book with selfconscious camerawork annoying jump cuts and a music soundtrack that apparently has to comment on every scene. With a strangely cryptic firsttime screenplay by David Bromberg the movie boasts an impressive cast that includes Tom Wilkinson and Dianne Wiest but it asks us to empathize with an obsessivecompulsive misanthrope whose actions alienate everyone around him. The ploy is too challenging since the character is more cruel than unfiltered and his relentless bitterness rarely crackles with the wit necessary to get away with such boorish behavior. Moreover subsequent attempts to humanize him feel increasingly contrived as the story progresses.The story revolves around Henry Roth a prickly phobic children's book author an intentionally ironic profession for such an uncaring jerk who bonds only with his longtime collaborator a curmudgeonly illustrator named Rudy. They finally achieve success with a book about Marty the Beaver's campaign to save Christmas but then Rudy dies. Henry's pokerfaced editor Arthur Planck wants a sequel and consequently hires a young artist named Lucy to take Rudy's place. Lucy has her share of problems  a mother who is also her landlord and willing to evict her and an errant lover named Jeremy who wants her back after dumping her. The movie's title is derived from the dedication to Lucy in Jeremy's abouttobepublished book. Motivated by a large bonus offered by Planck Lucy is willing to subject herself to Henry's nasty comments but of course a romance develops. This is where the film falters badly as the love story is sketchily developed with little discernible chemistry between the two stars.The cast provides whatever redeeming value the film has. The usually audacious Billy Crudup does what he can as Henry but it's an uphill battle. Better here than in last year's execrable Because I Said So Mandy Moore brings a certain poignancy to her scenes but her downbeat character is so depressing that the only logical response to their romance is indifference. Wilkinson easily steals his scenes as Rudy both pre and postmortem while Bob Balaban plays Planck in his typically lowkey fashion. Wiest plays Lucy's mother in just a couple of tersely acted scenes while Amy Sedaris Peter Bogdanovich Christine Taylor and Bobby Cannavale show up in cameos. The 2008 DVD is bereft of any extras not even the theatrical trailer which gives you an indication of what the studio thought of its prospects.".

Would he have been as gung ho if he'd known he'd get so wet?Label this one 'Die Hard' in a tunnel or 'The PoSlydon Adventure'. In fact director Rob Cohen probably screened 'The Poseidon Adventure' a few times while prepping his film. That's my favourite of the absurd '70s catastrophe flicks and 'Daylight' strikes the same notes often successfully. There's water and fire rats and stereotypes it's dank and dark and you're never sure which midlevel movie star will die next. And credit where it's due there's even plenty of pathos in the we all gotta work together vein and touching scenes of quiet humanity that stop an inch short of treacle. I was moved more than usual by a Stallone picture.The movie made squat at the box office back in December '96 but it's worth a DVD rental for its solid craftsmanship. The FX and sound design are money. As for the acting the lead characters Stallone Amy Brenneman Viggo Mortensen aren't especially memorable but some of the lowerbilled performers Stan Shaw  Colin Fox to name two escape the movie with some dignity. The only real villain is human idiocypeople go where they're not supposed to go and do things they're not supposed to do. 'Daylight' is formulaic but it's still better than most disaster crap I've seen.".

Separate events that come together in a New York city tunnel when the latter crashes into the former starting a chain reaction explosion that sends a fireball sweeping through the tunnel and sealing it at both ends. A handful of survivors are left trapped with burning toxic waste and only enough air to last a few hours. Only a few meters short of entering the tunnel himself cab driver and disgraced former fire chief Kit Latura recognises a disaster when he sees one and thanks to a drill he ran years ago knows that the standard rescue methods will not work. When his replacement dies ignoring his advice his former colleagues turn to him and he agrees to enter the tunnel and try to rescue the survivors.From the opening ten minutes we know just where we are. The brief pictures of characters does enough to set up their roles within the disaster genre and it is not long before one massive explosion and we are back in the disaster films that were so popular in the 1970's. To many this will be a bad thing because while meeting all the genre requirements this film also repeats all the old problems as well  I guess it is about what you like if you like the genre then you'll enjoy this. The plot is the basic stuff focusing on one small group and throwing up one obstacle after another for them to get over. At each stage we'll have losses tragic deaths heroic sacrifice emotional panic headstrong jerks etc etc  it does everything you would expect. Of course this also brings with it the problems of being rushed the characters being cardboard cut outs the drama being staged and never being able to stop without making things look bad and the fact that the film is a bit too close to being a cloying weepy for comfort.None of this stops it being exciting enough to be worth seeing though. The modern effects are impressive and the sets etc are convincingly real. The actors hardly have a lot to work with but they do well enough to make it work well. Stallone holds back from being an invincible action man and he is better for it producing a good lead. The support all fill their genre roles but most of them do it well enough so that they are actually emotionally engaging rather than just being fodder. Hedaya Sanders Brenneman Mortensen and others are all solid enough to make it work  sure they are a bit corny at times but this is more to do with the genre writing than the acting.Overall this is a disaster movie very much in the genre mould set in the 1970's and it has all the weaknesses you would expect from the genre. The writing is where the clichs come in but these are almost carried by the solid acting and enjoyable special effects. A genre movie then but one that is enjoyable if you like that sort of thing  just don't expect anything original or new and you'll be OK.".

Sylvester Stallone gives one of his best performances in Daylight leading a group of civilians to safety after a New York tunnel engulfs in flames. Stallone works his magic as a former EMS chief sent in to save these civilians.When I heard Stallone's name mentioned as part of the cast of Daylight I knew it would be a nonstop thrill ride however what I didn't realize it would be a thriller that had depth mixed in with everything else. Daylight is a credit to Stallone's ability and this remains one of his best roles to date.Adding to this awesome film are Stallone's costars which include Amy Brenneman Viggo Mortensen Jay O. Sanders and Stan Shaw. I enjoyed watching this ensemble work together because they seem to need no direction when on screen. It was as if they were really trapped in the tunnel. From the fear to the heroic actions they took these actors were top notch.Despite most thrillers Daylight stands out as being the finest assembled film. The casting works like magic the special effects are magnificent and the script is perfect.I concede that Daylight is predictable. However I disagree with those who say it hurts the film. My point is it doesn't matter whether a film is predictable rather how it is presented. Daylight is presented with quite unique special effects a plot with depth and endearing performances.In addition to the excellent performances Daylight had some of the best special effects I have seen. The explosion at the beginning of the movie was a work of art. I was in awe of how well the special effects were pulled off because I don't believe that Daylight would have worked as well as it did if they were done with less than 100 percent effort.Daylight will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you holding your breath hoping these citizens come out alive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Daylight is hands down Slys best work of the 90's and ranks in his top movies made. It ranks under Rocky and Rambo. Many people think Sly is one of the worst actors ever. But he really redeems himself in this film with above average acting. He plays Kit Latura a taxi driver who used to work in search and rescue missions. Well on one night a truck with explosive toxins falls and explodes. Collapsing and destroying the New Jersey Tunnel. Leaving only a few people alive inside the death trap.Sticking to his favorite role Sly wants to be the hero of the movie. Due to the cowardliness and pessimistic of the emergency and aid teams its up to Sly to go in the tunnel and save the trapped civilians and get them out of there safely. On this journey you will encounter exciting thrills and suspense dealing with Stallone facing the toughest obstacles ever. Both physically and mentally.You really start to feel bad for Stallone with all the crap he deals with in this movie. I feel that they did a good job with character development on Kit Latura. The character development for the other survivors are bleak to very descriptive....it ranges. The film has a very effective music score and pertains to the scenes well. The Special effects is above average for a 1996 movie.Overall this is a very entertaining film to watch. With explosive and hold your breath thrills. I totally recommend this films to Stallone fans and i also recommend it to those who want a good hero save the day actionsuspense movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possibly the most insufferably tedious Sylvester Stallone movie ever made which is no mean feat. The star made a dozen movies during the 90s and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade.First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects two comedies which like Rocky V are probably better than their rep but still quite weak and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them from 19901996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit an action movie as mindless as the rest but not one without a sense of fun or watchability.It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger but when you're able to costar with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz delivering two of his best pictures backtoback just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him.As for Daylight then it does to be fair to it deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short predisaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side could you?".

It's extremely thrilling and tense from start to finish and the last 10 to 15 minutes are especially good!. i really liked all of the characters and rooted for them all it also had a creepy vibe to it because the tunnel looked very creepy.The Special effects are amazing I can't believe this has gotten so many negative reviews and only a 5.4 rating on IMDb! in my opinion it's a fantastic moviethat i personally loved every minute of!. Sure it has flaws but it's an action movie and a very damn good one at that!. It is kinda sad though as quite a few sad things happen in this. The Direction is excellent!. Rob Cohen does an excellent job here keeping the movie tense and thrilling from start to finish awesome camera angles and some really cool camera tricks as well! awesome job. The Acting is AWESOME!. Sylvester Stallone is AMAZING as always and gives a fantastic performance here and is up there with one of his best he is extremely likable cared for all of the people and as always was TONS of fun to watch! Stallone Rules!.Amy Brenneman is very cute and does fine here i liked her a lot!. Jay O. Sanders does what he has to do well as the father and was pretty likable. Viggo Mortensen is good and adds some charm to his short role here. Dan Hedaya is decent in his limited role. Karen Young is good here and had okay chemistry with Jay O. Sanders. Danielle Harris is GORGEOUS! and is fine here and wish she had more screen time but i really like her as an actress so it didn't bother me too much great to see her again!. Claire Bloom and Colin Fox are both good together and had good chemistry together. Sage Stallone is good here and did what he had to do well. Stan Shaw is good here as the policeman and i felt sorry for him. Overall this a non stop thrill ride from start to finish and i say SEE it now!  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Once behind the wheel while being towed through the Holland Tunnel there was a jolt a clang and Maeder's old Ford lost a wheel that rolled placidly down the left lane before wobbling and flopping to a halt. It must have held up traffic for half an hour but that's nothing compared to what happens to the Holland Tunnel in this typical disaster flick.Boy if things can go wrong they surely will. Fortunately there is always the short chance of a lastminute escape light at the end of the tunnel so to speak and only a few dispensable characters must be left behind to pump up the sentiment quotient that the formula requires.Some hazardous material blows up in the middle of the tunnel that links New York City and New Jersey. A huge fireball whooshes out of both ends of the traffic conduit killing everyone except the handful of survivors who Sly Stallone in his magnanimity volunteers to reach from the outside and lead to safety.You've met most of these trapped characters in one form or another.

It must have held up traffic for half an hour but that's nothing compared to what happens to the Holland Tunnel in this typical disaster flick.Boy if things can go wrong they surely will. Fortunately there is always the short chance of a lastminute escape light at the end of the tunnel so to speak and only a few dispensable characters must be left behind to pump up the sentiment quotient that the formula requires.Some hazardous material blows up in the middle of the tunnel that links New York City and New Jersey. A huge fireball whooshes out of both ends of the traffic conduit killing everyone except the handful of survivors who Sly Stallone in his magnanimity volunteers to reach from the outside and lead to safety.You've met most of these trapped characters in one form or another. There is the beautiful young woman terrified but still able to make wisecracks and perform improbable physical feats.

I enjoy apocalyptic and engineering disaster movies but this one save for the set and the great effects was incredibly bad.We start with villains who for reasons I must have missed in the first 10 minutes are driving crazily into the Holland tunnel and crash into a truck carrying lots of brightlycolored drums of hazmat.  That is to say nothing of the fact that hazmat especially on an open flatbed truck would never have been allowed in the tunnel to begin with.  The explosion fire collapse and total carnage that follows has to be seen to be enjoyed if not believed.  Apparently this flatbed truck of flammables is able to create an explosion that not only runs to both lengths of the tunnel and collapses the entrances and not the middle of the tunnel it also destroys the main ventilator building the service tunnel and most of the other tube how did that happen?  The sheer volume of fire and destruction is mightily fun to watch but it's completely unbelievable and impossible.  Even though the tunnel is filled with heavy traffic somehow most of the vehicles aren't in the section of the tunnel most of the movie is set in.  Even stranger the crispy corpses are nowhere to be found in the vehicles you can see.If you're a fan of computergenerated effects that will keep you guessing how'd they do that? you'll love this movie for that reason alone.  For example the explosions that occur above water while Stallone and the fair maiden are below water are very impressive.  But if you are the kind of viewer who questions even 110th of the questionable events in the movie you will need to take your Valium.  I am still trying to understand how the walls of the tunnel were continuously on fire and shot regular fireballs into the tunnel for no apparent reason.  This movie is a strange cross between The Poseidon Adventure The Towering Inferno and Independence Day  any of which you'd probably enjoy a lot more.Of course no NYC disaster movie can be complete without characterizing the city engineers as buffoons who care more about traffic than human lives but I guess this movie needed more of an antagonist than the situation had presented in order to improve the bizarrely thoughtout plot.".

It could easily have been the best disasterrescue film ever made for Clarke at least thought things through being aware for instance that people need oxygen in order to breathe.  The attitude Daylight' has to oxygen is just bizarre.Clarke also observes the golden rule introduce us to the ragtag bunch of survivors AFTER disaster strikes not before.  Daylight' breaks this rule and demonstrates why it should never be broken.  The characters have nothing in common apart from the fact that they will one day be thrown together by a freak accident  so when the film shows us their lives one by one we feel not so much like an audience following a story as a class memorising stuff for a future exam.However the one character we should have been introduced to before the explosion  the one played by Sylvester Stallone  we didn't meet until afterwards.  I don't get it.As it is Sylvester Stallone is just one of a dozen or so people who spend every minute of their lives bellowing shouting screaming and bellyaching at everyone else.  This constant highdecibel panic is ugly dramatically enervating and to be honest not in the least bit realistic. People trapped together in danger of their lives do NOT as a rule spend the entire time at each others' throats.  When the mayor of New York wanted to let the survivors die in order to keep the city's transport system alive I for one was on her side.Then there are the flagrant violations of the laws of physics.  A giant fireball whips through a sealed tunnel and leaves ten people and a dog with enough oxygen to live on.  The pressure of the Hudson river compresses the air in the nonairtight tunnel so that its pressure is greater than that of the river that pressurised it.  It's like the way boulders behave in Road Runner cartoons.  Except that in the cartoons it's a deliberate joke.  A dog dives underwater itself impossible and not only doesn't die but doesn't get wet.  With one bound Sylvester Stallone is free.  That type of thing.Unless you want to dive to the very bottom of this genre I wouldn't bother.".

It was an enjoyable experience at the time though I was let down at the numerous clichs the story bombarded us with. Now over 14 years later I am still impressed by the action the film has to offer but the predictable nature of the narrative brings the overall quality of the film down.The opening scene introduces an illegal shipment of highlyvolatile chemicals being smuggled through the Holland Tunnel New York to New Jersey. A stolen car driven by eccentric diamond thieves who look and act a lot like the Splatterpunks from RoboCop 3 crashes into the transport truck carrying said chemicals with a resulting explosion that incinerates almost every living thing in the tunnel before causing it to collapse at both ends. Disgraced EMS Chief Kit Latura Stallone witnesses the explosion and throws himself back into the game and into the tunnel to rescue the handful of trapped survivors.Daylight goes through all of the expected motions. It does make a strong effort to make us care about the characters but the real stars of the show are the incamera stunts very rare these days and the Oscarnominated sound effects which lost to The Ghost and the Darkness. There's plenty of exciting setpieces the best of which is Kit's descent into the tunnel via a series of unstable ventilation fans. But the character drama moments are upset by inconsistent acting and questionable behavior. There's nothing exceptional about Daylight but it's an entertaining if relatively disappointing actiondisaster nobrainer.".

And every time I see Viggo Mortensen's ahem less than stellar back catalog I have to wonder what prompted Jackson to cast him in LOTR. The gamble sure paid off he was a perfect Aragorn but as for his role in this rarely have I seen an example of a character being completely pointless to a story's progression but then that's the trouble with this whole movie. There's very little point. The set up's poor it never manages to get you emotionally evolved in the characters so you're never that bothered that they're all in mortal danger and it's a singularly bad performance from Stallone. It leaves me to wonder why it ever saw daylight at all. My advice  give it a wide berth!!!".

SETH not wanting this to happen takes steps to prevent this. He first kills Dylan. He then has himself transfered into a body.

	schema:reviewBody "The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel. Since the real star Dolph Lundgren would not be able to reprise his role from the original there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax writeoff. Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White. To their credit they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. For once his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times and it does not get irritating. The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. And therein lies the problem. You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action. You go because you want comedy however unintentional.Unbeknownst to many people Universal Soldier was followed by two directtovideo sequels. I have only seen the first which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career the sight of JeanClaude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief. The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned directtovideo sequels and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. After years of investigation and explanation the Unisol project is still going ahead with some minor modifications. For one the new Unisols are stronger and more damageresistant than their earlier cousins. For another all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH. In the early parts of the film SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. The Unisol project is on the chopping block which essentially means that SETH will be turned off. SETH somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. His only problem is that every so often a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. Two individuals possess the code in question. SETH kills the first in short order and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly. A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichs. When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weaknesses. Gee SETH you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. In the original we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols how they work and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. Here the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate. At least in the original a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. Here one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform and presumably his body getting up every time without stopping for breath.I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. If you can see it on the cheap knock yourself out. This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre.".

It made absolutely no sense had no plot just a bunch of stuff that happens and a bunch of people get blown up. For example this girl in the movie whom Luc just met like 3 hours ago at the most is telling him at the end of the movie that she can't live without him. PLEASE!!!

When will Van Damme just give it up already how many times can his movies bomb before studio executives stop sending him scripts? Honestly who greenlighted this movie in the first place? Did they see moneymaking potential somewhere? Personally I don't think there was a script I think they just hooked Van Damme up with Michael Jai White anyone remember Spawn? and Bill Goldberg and said you guys are basically gonna kick the crap out of each other and we'll try to incorporate some kind of plot line into all the violence. Van Damme is at his usual acting worst in this picture but surprisingly Michael Jai White and Bill Goldberg do an above par job of acting. The fight scenes are mesmerizing particularly the flawlessly executed fight between Van Damme and Jai White. Goldberg has some pretty good fight scenes himself and he even gets to incorporate some of his trademark wrestling moves. Van Damme proves that he is still at the top of his martial arts game even though he is graying and getting older. Nevertheless he is still a pleasure to watch in action it's just his acting that makes you look at your watch couple of minutes when there is not action going on. The romance between Van Damme and the reporter is so contrived and shallow that it will make you nauseous as will the whole subplot if you can call it one with Van Damme's daughter. But if you can look past a silly plot and horrible acting you will find a great no holdsbarred action movie that boasts some incredible fights and lots of explosions and gratuitous deaths. My only other complaint other than a lack of script and an overabundance of bad acting is that the sets looked too cheap. They looked as they were borrowed from some straighttovideo movie set...hmmmmm? Anyway I wouldn't pay 6.50 to see this but I would recommend seeing it when it's at the cheapie theater.".

Universal soldier II is a nice action film but lacks a lot of basic A film characteristics. van damme shows some good fighting but mic rodgers didnt shoot'em right. he needs to learn some stuff from john woo's  van damme's HARD TARGET except of the scene when van damme fights S.E.T.H. this scene is the greatest scene in the film. it was also nice to see bil goldberg's humor as a big hardass unisol being kickassed by van damme in various parts of the movie. i was sad as the plot took a turn when the main computer S.E.T.H took control over the facility and sent over the unisols to take over the world or whatever. i think it could have been better if the scripters would have think twice. in conclusion wait for video but don't miss this film at all after all van damme is van damme.".

Universal soldier II is a nice action film but lacks a lot of basic A film characteristics. van damme shows some good fighting but mic rodgers didnt shoot'em right. he needs to learn some stuff from john woo's  van damme's HARD TARGET except of the scene when van damme fights S.E.T.H. this scene is the greatest scene in the film. it was also nice to see bil goldberg's humor as a big hardass unisol being kickassed by van damme in various parts of the movie. i was sad as the plot took a turn when the main computer S.E.T.H took control over the facility and sent over the unisols to take over the world or whatever. i think it could have been better if the scripters would have think twice. in conclusion wait for video but don't miss this film at all after all van damme is van damme.";

I won't call this a sequel either cause it had almost nothing to do with the first one so u didn't have to see the first one to understand this one. This was just a basic action shot em up flick very violent a lot more action in this one than the first one but US 1 seemed a little more interesting than this one. Goldberg was ok in this movie much better than I expected though and Michael Jai White was actually very good man he can fight good moves. Luckily though I didn't waste my money on this movie cause me and my friend had passes so we got in free. Overall this movie was good to go see if u are a die hard Van Damme fan or Universal Soldier fan however the ending stank it was the worst part of the movie other than that it wasn't a bad flick.".

Even though it barely lasts it goes on for just over an hour I must say some of the action in this movie is truly spectacular and right up there with some of the best i've ever seen and believe me I've seen a hell of a lot of action movies even though i'm only 16. In this movie there are some brilliant fights gun fights explosions especially the one at the very end and chases.Also Bill Goldberg is brilliant in his movie debut as the main Unisol and VanDamme although slightly beginning to fade is still preety much on top throughout. Heidi Schanz is also likable as his unlikely sidekick. I even chuckled at one or two rare comedy scenes in the movie. The plot is a bit weird and virtually the whole movie takes place over the space of one night but if you want to watch a movie and be entertained or your a diehard action fan then this is the one for you. I found out on here that this movie was in the bottom 100 on IMDb which is very unfair because as far as i'm concerned because there isun't a huge amount wrong with this movie and I've seen way worst movies than this. Actually this isun't a bad movie at all.So I'm going to give this movie and 8 out of 10 because I was never bored thoroughly entertained and it had some truly spectacular action scenes. My only complaint would be it being a little too short and a slightly better background on VanDamme's character.".

	schema:reviewBody "UNIVERSAL SOLDIER THE RETURN  1999 12 out of fourBy Blake FrenchUniversal Soldier The Return is of the worst sequels released this decade as clear and simple as that. The film is so riddled with mindless action sequences and inane character motives it is comparable to watching someone play a conventional video game in which the player must shoot down as many bad guys as possible before the time limit runs out. In the movie hundreds of machine guns pick off countless characters before we even get the chance to learn their names. That kind of makes it an emotional feat when the tragic death of the old canine in My Dog Skip has greater impact than the death of a legion of fellow American's in this film that plays like a mechanical stunt show.Universal Soldier The Return begins with an action scene so perpetually lame I thought it was actually fake. I was right. The scene was a training session to test the skills of a selection of Universal Soldierscombatants resurrected from the dead who are turned into a super duper fighting machine for top secret military purposes. One of the soldiers is Luc Deveraux JeanClaude Van Damme who is helping to train a new breed of these combat weapons. A supercomputer called SETH controls the warriors but when the universal solder program is to be shut down due to inconvenient budget cuts SETH takes things into his own hands and destroys anyone in the way of its own plans of evolution. What story there is involves JeanClaude Van Damme and other brainless characters running for their lives through hightech laboratories and futuristic hallways within a massive corporation that SETH is positioned in. The rest of the story is nothing but an excuse for such high energy action sequences to take place. The filmmakers take nothing else at value there is no character development even if audiences are familiar with the original Universal Soldier the overwhelming majority will still find themselves confused with the many technical terms that the underwritten script explains by the underwritten script. The best development we receive is an attempt to target Luc's emotional side by touching on a tired clich subplot involving the death of his wife...but even that comes off as only a tired clich.The writing is as smart as the character development the dialogue is about as straightforward and bland as it nowadays comes. No meaning or truth evolves from the characters on screen here. The only shadow of a brain comes from the movies science fiction style but even that leaves us with more questions than answers. The performances are as repulsive as the quality of the rest of the film. JeanClaude Van Damme never could act but at least he does not try. Instead he wields large fire arms over his head blowing other characters to kingdom come. The other actors smell whenever on screen especially the profusely annoying Heidi Schanz who if I never see on screen again it will be too soon. Michael Jai White is the one actor who the filmmakers take advantage of whenever on screen he appears as a hulking diabolical villain as he recites his lines with a deep consented voice. What about Luc's daughter who is undoubtedly used as a plot puppet? Or the action scenes that feel contrived and mechanical? Or an explanation of why any military base would want to create a source of intelligence that outsmarts their own? Sometimes no matter how bad a movie is we must look hard for a silver lining but there is almost always something positive that can be made from a feature film. In the case of Universal Soldier The Return the good news it that its only 82 minutes".

	schema:reviewBody "Superior Belgian acting combined with an ingenious Hollywood script makes for a superb moviegoing experience. JeanClaude Van Damme is back in this outstanding sequel to Universal Soldier. This movie has everything rising conflicts an intense climax and a nononsense denouement. It has an attractive Belgian born hero who gets right to killin' and doesn't waste the viewers' time with wit correct grammar or clear understandable English. It has a suppressed perhaps even dubious romance between the two lead characters so as to keep us wondering when they will climactically embrace. I often found myself on the edge of my seat clinching the arm rests in anxious anticipation crying aloud to the character Just kiss her damn it! The movie has the audiencedemanded token movie complication of a best friend turned into bad Sciborg who becomes a threat to our protagonist and must be eliminated but miraculously comes back at the end to save our protagonist when our hero faces certain death! The bad guys though I realize this is a passe barbaric description and that such distinctions are merely a matter of perspective and it is entirely nonPC in this postmodern day and age were completely convincing in that they made me believe they wanted to take over the world and kill everybody. It has brilliant comic relief. For example when one antagonist would be foiled in his mission he would frustratingly utter about the protagonist Boy I really hate that guy. Throughout the movie it became funnier each time he said it until finally about the seventh time he said it I was rolling in the movie isles. It also has unpredictable twists and turns for example I never expected for the bad guys to kidnap the hero's daughter all the way up until the point when the movie established that the hero had a daughter I was completely taken off guard!. The intensity of this movie is evident when the opening scene takes us through a room filled with every hazardous chemical known to man which are contained in small tanks with such terrifying esoteric technical labels as acid. This is ingenious symbolism interwoven into the film by the director that represents the danger and high stakes involved. It communicates This movie is bad A! The writers obviously performed countless hours of meticulous indepth research in order to portray mankind's most advanced hightech recent developments in AI and computer technology or at least they heard about someone else whose cousin knew some lady whose husband did do such research. Either way it shows and they deserve the credit. The movie obviously brings up pertinent issues and moral dilemmas dealing with our computer age and combines this with the originality of its warning to wit someday your computer is going to go bad and decide to annihilate mankind. This unsettling realization has certainly made this reviewer a believer and from now on I'm going to keep a closer eye on my computer. One can only hope that this movie has the box office success that it deserves so that Hollywood won't hesitate in churning out even more classics of this sort fortunately whether it is a success at the box office or not Hollywood knows what is great movie making and I don't think low box office sales will stop them from continuing to make great films like this. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as did my friend who is a scatologist who said It is one of the most interesting specimens I've ever encountered! Such a sublime intellectually stimulating work deserves nothing less than 5 out of 5 stars! Rod 'n Reel Reviews".

	schema:reviewBody "Universal Soldier The Return is a good action packed sequel film that casts JeanClaude Van Damme Bill Goldberg Michael Jai White Heidi Schanz Xander Berkeley Kiana Tom and Daniel von Bargen. The acting by all of these actors is very good. Van Damme was very good in the film as always. White and Berkeley were very good in this film arguably their best performances. Bill Goldberg was excellent in this film. The action is really awesome and the fight scenes are really exciting. The film isn't as graphic as the prequel but its violent none the less! The music by Don Davis is good. This is a good and thrilling film. If you like JeanClaude Van Damme Bill Goldberg Michael Jai White and the rest of the cast I've mentioned above and exciting nonstop action films then I Strongly recommend this film!".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie I saw is called Universal Soldier the Return.  I thought it was a fairly good movie. But what makes it a good movie?  Of course there are tons of factors depending on what you like.  Two of the things that I look for in a good movie are the special effects and lots of action.  This movie has both of these two attributes.  That is why I liked this movie.One of the things that make a good movie is lots of action.  Universal Soldier the Return is jam packed with this.  One of the best action scenes in the movie is at the end when Van Damne is fight Seth the leader of Unisols.  They have a long hand to hand combat match.  The reason why this is a good action scene is because it has fist and foot fighting.  The scene has a lot of it too.  Another good example of an action scene was in the beginning.  The Unisols and Van Damne are training.  The Unisols are chasing him and his partner on jetskis.  They were firing guns at eachother and it was so good because eventhough guns are bad they make good action scenes. This scene had lots of them.Another one the many things that a good movie needs are good special effects.  This movie doesn't have as much special effects as it has action but it has good special effects instead of a lot.  There is a part of the movie were they use special lazers on dead war soldiers to cut their skulls open to make a hole on their heads.  Then they put a microchip in their heads to control them.  The special part of it is that they don't use lazers to do that and they don't have  that technology yet. Another good example of special effects is in the main control that controls everything.  It talks and has its own mind but the cool part is that it has a giant microchip in it with purple clouds of lightning in it which you can see.  It is cool how they make the clouds and lightning purple and they put the image right in the screen so it is very visible.  Both of these contribute to making the movie a good movie. It was good ByMatt Soo Hoo".

Always a loner Kelly felt up until he meets Anse and later Arapaho beauty Wahleeah Andra Martin he was best on his own but Anse is a gentlevoiced noncombative polite young man who does what he's told to the best of his abilities. Soon Kelly and Anse run up on the Sioux led by Gall John Russell and his fiery antagonistic nephew Sayapi Ray Danton while journeying back to Kelly's cabin traveling through the snake into the high country of Montana where the springs get quite green. Saving Gall's woman Wahleeah who wishes to return to her own people from certain death Kelly earns brownie points and is allowed to leave along with Anse. The Calvary with the likes of Claude Akins and debuting Warren Oates as well as Rhodes Reason and Gary Vinson want to drive out the Sioux by taking an accompaniment of soldiers through the snake but Kelly warns against such foolishness. Kelly though understands that the White Man will eventually take the land due to strength in numbers.Clint Walker is hired for his screen presence and build the camera of director Gordon Douglas shoots Walker's Kelly as if he were a towering legend with the expected closeups of his nonviolent peacedesiring conflictweary face more than any serious acting chops but I never felt he wasn't adequate in the part. It isn't like Kelly needed the method touch or anything. Edd was probably casted to secure the teenyouth market he is the moral compass that questions the choice of Kelly to allow Wahleeah to return to the Sioux as she clearly is held by them against her will. Kelly has that dilemma upon himWahleeah escapes from the Sioux stealing one of their ponies in the night successfully making it to Kelly's cabin. Kelly makes a stance towards Gall regarding Wahleeah because she's still in bad health due to her past injuries Kelly refuses to allow Gall to escort her away when Wahleeah is in no shape to travel. Sayapi is the main heavy of the film as the prideful aggressive hostile Sioux warrior questioning Gall's judgment and bravery soon responsible for tragedy involving Anse who intends to take Wahleeah to her people despite Kelly's orders to keep her in the cabin earning Kelly's vengeance. Of course there's the battle at the end as expected by these kinds of western adventures where the Sioux engage Kelly and the remaining survivors left of the Calvary with guns firing dust kicked up and bodies hitting the ground. Yellowstone Kelly is surprisingly violent with plenty of knife and gun violence especially when Kelly goes after Sayapi and the Sioux in his company. This wouldn't be complete without fisticuffs so Walker tolerates the heckling of Akins and Oates up to a point until he has no choice but to lay the smack to them yep a water trough and window are used to subdue the rude soldiers who mocked Kelly by calling him an Indian Kelly respects Native American tribes and he doesn't even make much of a fuss when the soldiers first rib him in a bar but a stagecoach dust up pushes him too far.The script doesn't actually bang the patriot drum with some sympathy towards tribes affected by White Man's colonization of their land. Russell as Gall follows the lead of many Caucasian actors dressed in red face as he carries a manoffewwords pillar of strength approach to the Sioux leader not to be disrespected and not quick to rush into anything without thinking of the consequences. There's a great scene where Sayapi seems ready to approach Kelly against Gall's wishes when Gall grabs him by the throat in a clinch and makes the kid fall to the groundthis tells you that Gall is in charge for a reason. Gall's built for it while Sayapi goes too far and winds up just as he does by film's end. There's something that stayed with me regarding how Kelly tells Gall to take his men and go because the land no longer treats them wellthe script has a lot of this saying that the former occupants of a land that had been there's for ages is taken from them with White Man telling them to find somewhere else to call home.".

No doubt it was hard to be a newcomer with those guys there. That's why I missed his films but the long wait gave me the thrill of seeing Yellowstone Kelly now when westerns are so few and we have seen most of the old ones. An unpretentious film but with a top director Gordon Douglas an excellent script by Burt Kennedy good actors like Edd Byrnes Ray Danton Andra Martin Claude Atkins and a great performance by John Russel as the chief Gall. It is a plain western story with a sensual romance between Clint and Andra Martin where they barely touch each other but Wahleeah Andra Martin is very specific about  who looked at her and who she looked at guess!. The scenery the music and the action scenes also help to place what would otherwise be a conventional routine western one step higher.".

The film dwells a bit on a sub plot that has Kelly saving an Indian maiden's life as well as playing wet nurse to a tenderfoot who seeks to win the trapper's friendship and respect. There is a fine battle scene between the soldiers and the Indians one of the best of its type and is the film's high point. John Russell Ray Danton and Claude Akins are among the cast names that contribute greatly to fine story. Andra Martin is striking as the Arapahoe girl and a point of contention between Kelly and the Sioux warriors. Edd Byrnes is okay as Kelly's young helper. Outstanding camera work and music score make this forgotten western one of the genre's best pictures.".

	schema:headline " ToughMinded B western Transcends Its Budget' WellLiked.";
	schema:reviewBody "This unpretentious and wellpaced film min my judgment almost redefines the 'B' movie. It uses the talents of solidplot novelist Clay Fisher action director Gordon Douglas's skills script additions by Burt Kennedy lucid cinematography by Carl Guthrie costumes by Marjorie Best set decorations by William Wallace and a good cast of supporting actors. The storyline is a very simple one. Luther Kelloey has saved the life of a Sioux chief Gall. Because of this during the troubles in their country he is still allowed to set his traplines. After some trouble with toughs at a fort he enlists young tenderfoot Anse Harper as his helperbefore discovering he is hopeless at everything then Kelley heads upcountry. Once there they save an Arapaho woman fleeing her enemies. Answe worships her she falls in love with Kelley but he fights the urge as he nurses her back to health. Then all discover that it is the Sioux chief who wants her back. Anse dies and finally he has to lead soldiers against the Sioux to save the illled patrol and he kills Gall's nephew the real troublemaker in the situation in battle. He then advises the Sioux chief to leave the Yellowstone country telling him it no longer smiles on them and they follow his advice. The film stars popular and very large Clint Walker in the best of several western he was allowed to make in the 1950s as who did not Anse is welldone by Edd Byrnes John Russell is the Sioux chief Ray Danton the deadly nephew and Andra Martin the lovely Arapaho woman. Claude Akins as a skeptical sergeant Rex Reason Gary Vinson and Warren Oates are also featured. This is a very authentic western physicallybeautiful. The viewer learns a lot about what it takes to survive in the West through the very Eastern eyes of Anse also Kelley's very sound advice is doubted not heeded or contradicted by soldiers with the result that they need him to save their hides. This is not a great picture but I suggest as a writer its authors gave it clear motivations a solid story line for its underbudgeted producers to realize. The dialogue is above average terse never show and Douglas's camera has quite a bit to work with in the way of interior dialogue exchanges action scenes and angry confrontations. The highlight comes when Martin tells Walker You have LOOKED AT ME. From that moment we know he likes her she wants himand all they have to do is fight a major battle against angry Sioux warriors to win their future...Many viewers have found this to be a very unpretentious and entertaining 'B' effort.".

For me is Douglas one of the most underrated USfilmmakers of the fifties and sixties because he did great jobs in very different genres. Formicula for example is a thrilling horror stuff The Detective a fine policemovie with Frank Sinatra. His best pictures did Douglas in the westerngenre and I think Rio Conchos Barquero and Fort Dobbs should have a place in the hall of fame of western. His best picture at all for me is Yellowstone Kelly from Warner Bros. an also underrated western which tells the story of mountain man Luther Kelly who has a romance with a young Sioux maid on dangerous ground. A long time he don't accept the voice of his heart and so his young sidekick a greenhorn impressive portrayed by Edward Byrnes must die. Big Clint Walker also appears in Fort Dobbs is wonderful in the role of Kelly and in the supporting cast you may find excellent actors like Claude Akins Ray Danton and Warren Oates at the beginning of their career. The action scenes are wellmade the Technicolorphotographed landscape is so beautiful like Max Steiners score. If you like western this picture for sure will become one of your alltimefavorites.".

	schema:reviewBody "Magnificent locations a pleasant adventure Yellowstone Kelly is a typical nice western movie of the 1950s and in my personal opinion it is a relevant instance of a better way of making cinema better than the current one I mean.The movie has merits and defects. Among the merits apart the already quoted beauty of the photography the fastpace of the narration a number of wellelaborated action scenes the presence of Andra Martin as the Arapaho girl Wahleeah. In fact beautiful Martin manages to create with few but skillful touches a soft erotic atmosphere rather unusual in western movies of that epoch. However it should be noted that her splendid blue eyes are a relevant clumsiness of the movie. Clint Walker in the role of the trapper Yellowstone Kelly is a nice guy though certainly not a great actor. As always in mature 1950's  westerns the war between whites and Indians is provoked by either hotheads or rogues in the present case a stupid ambitious cavalry officer this remark is just intended to contradict the false commonplace that in those years Indians were always represented as bloodthirsty savage assassins.The story is placed around the WyomingMontana border however the final part was evidently filmed in the wonderful area of Sedona Arizona. I'm not able to decide whether this could be considered a defect of the movie probably not. The worst flaw in the film is the fact that all Sioux perfectly understand and speak English ?. There are several other inaccuracies. For instance I may be wrong but I bet that the Blue Soldiers had never been equipped with Winchester carabines.I saw Yellowstone Kelly at the theatre when I was a kid the pleasant impressions I retained have been confirmed by my recent new view at the TV. I recommend this movie especially to people nostalgic of good old western flicks.".

He plays a scout and trapper who shares a tenuous relationship with the Sioux which is placed in jeopardy when Martin an Arapaho held captive by the Sioux decides to run away and seek sanctuary with him in his cabin. Things are complicated further by the presence of Byrnes a greenhorn kid who has come to stay with Walker and learn how to live in the stark wilderness. Meanwhile cavalry Major Reason wants Walker's help and resists taking no for an answer. Walker a towering hunk who dwarfs everyone around him and sometimes even the landscape lends a solid performance. He has one roughandtumble fight sequence in which he clearly performed his own stunt work. Clad in a red shirt and with a long shock of black hair he is quite a sight to behold. In what must be one of his most alluring and sexy appearances in film he has a nighttime sequence in which he reclines in bed shirtless with his hair deliberately tousled as he chitchats with young Byrnes. Byrnes enjoys an engaging role lightly comedic but with more serious elements than he would tend to be given elsewhere. His character displays an obvious respect for Walker try counting how many times he says Mr. Kelly! and like Walker sleeps presumably in the raw despite allusions to the harsh weather! Russell plays the Sioux chief and provides dramatic weight and a dose of dignity that helps him to overcome his anachronistic hairstyle. Danton plays his nephew with a similarly goofy parted on the side wig and poses a nice threat as he obsesses over Martin. Martin with gleaming greyblue eyes and covered in buckets of body makeup is unlikely as an Indian maiden though this was the rule of the day then. She comes off as more of a Caucasian captive than a fellow Indian so quickly does she adjust to washing plates in a bucket and keeping house! Like the two gentlemen she also prefers to sleep in the altogether which had to have seemed a tad daring in 1959! She undergoes a brief but pretty harrowing medical procedure in her first scene. However some of her dialogue is a hoot You have looked at me Reason adds just that much more handsomeness to the film though his role isn't anything special. He has two soldiers in his outfit who would go on to greater fame Akins and Oates. Director Douglas liked to populate his films with goodlooking men and here he had quite a bonanza which does make viewing easier for those inclined. Additionally he had quite an eye for location scenery and it is nicely exploited here as well. It's not a milestone film but Walker in his prime is always worth watching and the rest of the able cast along with the location work helps make this a pleasure to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "One good thingWB popped for some scenic Arizona locations at the same time they didn't stint on extras to flesh out the big battle scene. However reviewer Dinky is spoton about the negatives. As a drama the film is definitely inferior to the underrated Fort Dobbs 1958 that features the same production team. Writer Kennedy for example specialized in tight emotionally complex Westerns such as the legendary Ranown series with Randolph Scott. Here however he has to accommodate a host of WB contract players including Sunset Strip hipster Edd Byrnes. This results in an overcrowded overstretched slice of eye candy that dissipates impact over a series of climaxes.Arguably the movie's most interesting feature is the way the relationship between Kelly Walker and Anse Byrnes is handled. Now if the masterly muscular Kelly is added on one hand to the submissive prettyboy Anse on the other the sum is two iconic stereotypes of the gay community. Of course production could have plunked a hat on Byrnes like everyone else and lessened his looks. But that would have outraged fans of the teen idol whose trademark had become a comb. So the visual earmarks remain. At the same time the screenplay puts this suggestive twosome into a wilderness cabin for the winter where the bighair half does womanly duties like cooking and cleaning while the macho trapper brings home the bacon. So together you've got an unmistakable situation for perceptive 50's audiences that putting a woman Wahleeah into the mix doesn't erase. Plus these visual hints are compounded with the homo erotic bed scene that Dinky describes so well. My point is that toying with this taboo could not have been lost on the filmmakers causing me at least to wonder what their reasoning was. After all the Western is about the most macho of all movie genres. It's worth noting that the movie's overall quality is not affected by this one aspect. In fact none of this would be worth remarking on if the movie were not from the uptight 1950's when the topic of samesex attraction could not even be mentioned e.g. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof 1958. So in that sense the film remains something of an oddity for its time. But the movie itself ranks a lot higher on the list of glamorized Westerns than on the list of compelling ones.".

At first the movie seems to be about tough experienced Clint Walker and naive bumbling Edward Byrnes. Then the movie seems to be about Edward Byrnes falling in love with Andra Martin who may simply be using him for her own purposes. By the end of the movie however the movie seems to have become a romance pairing Clint Walker with Andra Martin.None of these three relationships seem plausible and none of the participants seem to have convincingly deep feelings for anyone else. The script manipulates its characters but never succeeds in giving any of them an internal life. Particularly shortchanged are the Indian characters none of whom look Indian and all of whom are saddled with dialog of the many horses have I variety.The acting is passable but has the superficial quality of a TV show. This is not surprising since the cast largely consists of loanouts from Warner Bros' TV series Clint Walker from Cheyenne Edward Byrnes from 77 Sunset Strip and John Russell from Lawman. Even Andra Martin has a connection to Warner Bros' television being married at one time to Ty Hardin from the Bronco series.Though this movie lacks the homoerotic undertones of Gold of the Seven Saints it does have a scene of sexual ambiguity showing Edward Byrnes bedding down for the first night in Clint Walker's log cabin. Both men are shirtless. Curiously this is the only time in the entire movie Clint displays that famous chest of his. Clint lies faceup on his bed while Byrnes lies facedown on his. They engage in a long disjointed conversation all the while exchanging glances at each other.This scene follows a bit of dialog in which Walker says he'll have to make a separate bed for Byrnes. Byrnes says this won't be necessary a remark which can be interpreted in two different ways.".

Rio Conchos The Detective and I can even tolerate Edd Byrnesin small dosesbut I really wasn't expecting much from Yellowstone Kelly when I first saw it a few days ago. Turned out that I got a lot more than I bargained for.First off Walker is a hell of a screen presence. I haven't seen Cheyenne in many many years and I kind of forgot just how much he can fill up the screen and not just physically he has the kind of commanding presence that John Wayne has and although Wayne's a better actor Walker's no slouch himself. He does a firstrate job here and Burt Kennedy's script doesn't make him the kind of stock hero type that many B westerns tend to make of their stars.Second off the sceneryas pointed out by other reviewersis spectacular. It has the kind of power that John Ford brought to the screen with his Monument Valley locations yet it doesn't overwhelm the overall film as Monument Valley tended to do. In addition Gordon Douglas' westerns are noted for their balls to the wall action scenes as in Rio Conchos and this film doesn't disappoint in that department. There are several of them from barroom brawls to fullout Indian attacks and they're all extremely well done.Then there's Andra Martin. She's not given much to do actually but she is one of the most strikingly and exotically beautiful women to have ever graced the screen and she does the most here with what she's given and she's actually quite good.A good supporting castClaude Akins and Warren Oates stand out and even Edd Byrnes is far less annoying than he usually ishelps greatly. If there's any downside to this picture it's the casting of white actors in Indian roles. John Russell and Ray Danton are good actors but they don't even come close to being convincing as Indians and as this practice usually does actually hurt the picture.Overall though I was more than pleasantly surprised with Yellowstone Kelly. Walker turns in a firstrate performance the scenery is beautiful the action is well done and on top of everything else there's Andra Martin. A very good combination. Walker made another western that I haven't seen Fort Dobbs and if it's half as good as this one was I'll have to check it out.".

Back in the day I was going to see it at the age of 12 but did not want to deal with the unbelievably long lines or the screaming teens who came to see Kookie.This was not Edd Byrnes first feature film but the first after his success on 77 Sunset Strip. The bobbysoxers were nuts about him back in the day and crowded out us connoisseurs of the western. I remember the long lines and the stories about how one could not hear the dialog with the adolescent females going gaga for Kookie.The real star in the title role was another Warner Brothers TV veteran Clint Walker. He plays a mountain man trapper and scout the last of a breed. He's allowed to do his thing on Sioux land because he saved John Russell's life who is the chief.After taking on Edd Byrnes as a young assistant the two visit the Sioux where both of them catch the eye of Andra Martin who is an Arapahoe captive and Russell's personal squeeze. Another brave Ray Danton would like to replace Russell in her tepee. When she runs away and follows Walker and Byrnes to their cabin Russell and Danton come calling with the tribe. These kind of things start wars as the Ancient Greeks would be the first to tell you.As much as Kookie got all the publicity and was the reason for Yellowstone Kelly's box office this film belongs to the stoic Clint Walker who if he had come along a decade earlier would have been a great cowboy hero. Walker is smart and stoic in the title role.I have to say that Andra Martin as a blue eyed Arapahoe was most disconcerting. Just like Burt Lancaster in Apache.Despite that Yellowstone Kelly was a well made action western that any fan of the horse opera will love.".

In this thoroughly innocent Boy's Own western from director Gordon Douglas Walkerwith a couple of barrels for a chest is Yellowstone Kelly and Byrne is the boy who has taken a fancy to him a thoroughly innocent fancyI might add. They team up setting up house together in Indian territory where they run up against John Russell's somewhat wooden effete Indian chief and his hotheaded nephew a very unlikely Ray Danton.This is a good oldfashioned film if a little topheavy in male bonding with too many actors who are fundamentally nothing but eyecandy and it's beautifully shot in some pretty spectacular scenery.

	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't believe something like this came from Serbia. The movie is amazing. The story the animation the design the mood... It's thrilling! Before I start indepth reviewing first I'll say  thank god it's NOT a kids' movie. I'm really into animation and I hate how big worldfamous cartoon studios make so many children cartoons that on the mention of word 'cartoon' people think of something for kids. This is NOT a children musical it's an animated movie for grownups. Some scenes may even be inappropriate for childrenOK now where do I start? OK story first...The story is fantastic. The movie never felt boring the story really keeps you interested. Don't worry I won't give out too much don't wanna spoil the movie so I'll just keep it simple  It's a futuristic story. It's NOT some SciFi adventure with impossible inventions and space traveling action  it's just happening in the future things are still simple it's just about an ordinary girl Edit who is a psychology student and who after 6 failed exams decides to implant a memory chip inside her to help her pass the exams. She also has a job at some state security agency or something in taking care of an autistic math genius who discovered an important formula but no computer was able to calculate it. Once she sees the formula and the chip remembers it weird things start happening to her and it gets more and more exciting. D The characters are very good and the humor is really great and refreshing for the dramatic and kinda emotionallyhard story. So the story is 1010. Next.... DesignAnimation The movie is pure eye candy! The camera angles the colors the imaginativeness... Really great. Animation is a combination of 3D and traditional 2D animation. 3D is mostly for backgrounds in some scenes where camera changes the angle and so but characters and objects are always 2D. Which I really liked cause cartoons sometimes can seem too 2dimensional you know no rotating camera just translating left right so that's a plus if you ask me. As for 2D animation it's perfect. It was done by professional comic artists so it's no wonder. You can see that in some parts they increased frame rate with CG in betweens but the movie was made on a really low budget and was done by literally 10  20 people no wonder it took them like 5 years to finish so I'm OK with it. The design and backgrounds of the movie are fantastic too! As I said pure eye candy! Backgrounds are also handdrawn which gives the movie it's artistic feeling and always fit the mood of a scene. To AnimationDesignArt I give 1010. Music.... It's very good too. It was beautifully composed and every score fits the scene perfectly. There is one 'featured' song too from artists outside the project which was also chosen very well and fits the movie. The main theme is epic! especially the version which starts with piano the other remix is played in the movie tho. 910So all in all it's a movie worth to watch. I guarantee you'll like it. Trust me I myself was totally skeptical towards it since I hate scifi and futuristic stuff and it blew me off!".

Before I start indepth reviewing first I'll say  thank god it's NOT a kids' movie. I'm really into animation and I hate how big worldfamous cartoon studios make so many children cartoons that on the mention of word 'cartoon' people think of something for kids. This is NOT a children musical it's an animated movie for grownups. Some scenes may even be inappropriate for childrenOK now where do I start? OK story first...The story is fantastic. The movie never felt boring the story really keeps you interested. Don't worry I won't give out too much don't wanna spoil the movie so I'll just keep it simple  It's a futuristic story. It's NOT some SciFi adventure with impossible inventions and space traveling action  it's just happening in the future things are still simple it's just about an ordinary girl Edit who is a psychology student and who after 6 failed exams decides to implant a memory chip inside her to help her pass the exams. She also has a job at some state security agency or something in taking care of an autistic math genius who discovered an important formula but no computer was able to calculate it. Once she sees the formula and the chip remembers it weird things start happening to her and it gets more and more exciting.

	schema:reviewBody "As a big fan of animation I eagerly awaited to see this first Serbian animated film. Did Edit i Ja deliver? Well it depends...Aleksa Gajic is a young and gifted animator who is present in Serbian manga community for a while. I liked his work before and after seeing the first trailer in 2007 it looked like a promising project. Indeed it was decent from a animators point. Some said that the solid basic drawing wasn't reproduced in a animation cycle properly and that the whole film looks more like an flash app. It's pretty true however considering this is the first kind of such a project in Serbian cinematography I think it looks pretty OK and the visual team can undoubtedly get all the credits. It is nowhere close to a Japanese anime but even that took decades to evolve into a level we all know and take for granted. Edit i ja has a lot of potential for further evolution. Story a fiction fantasy from a futuristic Belgrade is also a bright spark of this anime. A girl bonds with an implant chip which begins to awaken and become a living entity.However the good impression made by the visuals and the story was ureutterly ruined by a horrible voice over recordings. In an animated film the voice plays one of the key roles since it gives a soul to characters involved. With a few exceptions the voice crew ruined this promising title. I don't know whether the production team paid them low fees or it's just the fact they are bad orators the team made up of more or less famous actor cast sounded like a bunch of people dragged in from the street with very little motivation and placed in front of the mike. No enthusiasm what so ever.So overall Edit i ja remains a good attempt which has a lot of further potential. Still it could and should have been better.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was pretty interesting just for the fact that it's Serbian cyberpunk! In 2074 Belgrade. Edit is a really smart but bored young woman who is so bored by her classes she's finding it difficult to pass some really important exams. She's also living a student life with her mom who resents her and her father who seems pretty out of it all the time. She also spends her days with an autistic man as her job. When she's not doing that she's hanging out with her friends. One of the things I didn't like about it was that as with a lot of anime it over sexualizes Edit incredibly. Basically everyone does including the autistic kid her boyfriend her friends the scientist. It really detracts from the story for me. After the film sufficiently shows edit is a victim of the system who never feels satisfied with her purpose in life and her boyfriend just wants to have sex all the time  it starts to pickup where she gets her hands on some illegal tech that will allow her to have perfect recall of things she sees and therefor reads. It's her hope that with this tech she can pass her exams with flying colours. This is where things get interesting it starts exploring biopunk tech concepts with the idea that this chip begins to feed off of her in a sort of symbiotic relationship with one another. This culminates in her having an AI presence from the tech bonded within her. She begins to learn more of herself by interacting with this construct and her life also goes careening into a ditch. There's subsequent action that was pretty cool. The animation was really unique and cool. The language was very neat I'd never heard Serbian before and it's a pretty cool language! The exploration of what such tech could do to us with the possible ramifications were really interesting. There was some interesting eastern philosophy brought into it and the context was good. I liked Edit as a character I liked most things except the over sexualization that was pretty overt. I ended up rating it a 7. ".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll try not to spoil anyone's fun here so I'll stick to the wellestablished facts and not disclose more than is generally known about the film already. Julka Julia Jentsch seemingly has it all. She is a well established young artist she has a devoted friend Adrian to help her with her work and a loving husband Maciej Stuhr who leaves her only with the wish that they might finally live together and not divided by their disparate vocations Julka works in plastic arts her husband is a composer and they spend most of their times in different countries  her in Poland him in Germany. Yet one day out of the blue Julka's family faces shocking news  her mother an acknowledged writer has cancer. As her condition grows worse so does Julka's connection to the family  suddenly her cozy world begins to change. What will come out of it all? Szumowska's movie based on her own experiences of which you may probably learn from other sources was well received by the Polish critics some of whom even went as far as to claim it an artistic masterpiece. A vast majority however seem to have misread the work while personal tragedies are no doubt the main source of the depicted events what the whole movie is about is not losing one's relatives and trying to cope with it but rather losing one's world and trying to get back to it. I won't tell you if the movie ends well but I can say that Julka's troubles are definitely infantile at times even terrifyingly uninvolving. I didn't enjoy Jentsch's performance but I couldn't really say if it's her own inability or Szumowska's own direction that led her to become so bland. Anyway the movie ain't bad but it has its drawbacks  like the fact that it seems to end somewhere in the middle with no grand resolution explicit or implicit. Be cautious. You were warned.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'll try not to spoil anyone's fun here so I'll stick to the wellestablished facts and not disclose more than is generally known about the film already. Julka Julia Jentsch seemingly has it all. She is a well established young artist she has a devoted friend Adrian to help her with her work and a loving husband Maciej Stuhr who leaves her only with the wish that they might finally live together and not divided by their disparate vocations Julka works in plastic arts her husband is a composer and they spend most of their times in different countries  her in Poland him in Germany. Yet one day out of the blue Julka's family faces shocking news  her mother an acknowledged writer has cancer. As her condition grows worse so does Julka's connection to the family  suddenly her cozy world begins to change. What will come out of it all? Szumowska's movie based on her own experiences of which you may probably learn from other sources was well received by the Polish critics some of whom even went as far as to claim it an artistic masterpiece. A vast majority however seem to have misread the work while personal tragedies are no doubt the main source of the depicted events what the whole movie is about is not losing one's relatives and trying to cope with it but rather losing one's world and trying to get back to it. I won't tell you if the movie ends well but I can say that Julka's troubles are definitely infantile at times even terrifyingly uninvolving. I didn't enjoy Jentsch's performance but I couldn't really say if it's her own inability or Szumowska's own direction that led her to become so bland. Anyway the movie ain't bad but it has its drawbacks  like the fact that it seems to end somewhere in the middle with no grand resolution explicit or implicit. Be cautious. You were warned.";

The plot of 33 Scenes is dramatic enough Julia loses her mother her father and her highflying career prospects all over the course of what seems like a few weeks. But the more drama she takes on the less you care. Is it because it's hard to sympathize with a spoiled brat in the first place? Or is it because the movie takes forever to get to the point? My inclination is to blame it on dubbing director Mina Kindl who was in charge of the German version I have seen. The voiceover is entirely lifeless and partly out of sync especially Julia's. It sounds like it was recorded in a basement studio with the actors reading from the original script without even looking at the screen. There simply is no connection between image and sound. I sat through it but it felt like watching a silent film and listening to an unrelated talking book in parallel. I'm wondering what the Polish version is like. As it stands avoid.".

The storyline has absolutely no originality. It's almost like the screenwriter read Percy Jackson and the Olympians and decided to turn the series into a more adult movie.Luckily there are several aspects that save Wrath of the Titans from being horrible.

At the heart the original Greek mythology about Gods overthrowing Titians is quite intriguing. It's just been done far too oftenI must note that this movie should have been longer. The opening was far too short. You barely see the town in which Perseus and his son live before it gets ripped apart. With no buildup it is impossible to care for the characters. This makes the movie little more than Greek Myth brought to life with no depth. It is truly unfortunate. A movie like this has so much potential. It was all wasted with a horrible screenwriter.If you like Greek Mythology or enjoyed Clash of the Titans this is a movie you might want to see. If that is not the case it's not something you will want to see in theatres or at all. There have been much better actionadventure movies so far this yearThe Grey and Chronicle are two.

He's been imprisoned in Tartarus for eons which explains why he's wrathful. What is never satisfactorily explained or even addressed was how this mountainsized lava monster ever procreated since he's supposed to be the father of much smaller and more humanlike gods like feuding brothers Zeus Poseidon and Hades.2 Don't go in with any preconceived ideas based on actual Greek mythology. It's a 2011 story featuring characters left over from 2010's Clash of the Titans.3 Warner Bros. threw a lot of money at this and most of it shows up on the screen.4 It's pretty much nonstop fighting vs. chimeras cyclopes a minotaur and assorted gods and demigods not entirely at the frenetic pace of Transformers where things are flying by too fast to figure out who's doing what to whom but too much so for my taste.5 The story is not going to win any Pulitzers Nobels or Hugos but it's not entirely predictable and anything that contemplates the total extinction of the gods gets a big plus from me.6 Despite having some pretty good actors in here Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes Bill Nighy Danny Huston and yes Sam Worthington they don't really get much chance to practice their craft but they're not just phoning it in either.7 Based on the damage he absorbed Perseus should have been dead or permanently crippled on over a dozen occasions.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm one of the 3 of the population of Americans that actually enjoyed the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans. It wasn't a masterpiece in fact I wouldn't even call it good. But there was a charming simplicity to it all. It involved generic characters getting from Point A to Point B in an hour and a half. Sure it was plagued with problems but for me it's a serious guilty pleasure. But that's another review for another time. The most glaring problem with Wrath is that it's essentially the same thing as the first one with a few tweaks here and there. Sam Worthington plays Perseus. He's strong powerful and dull as a rock. It's just Worthington's generic bland good guy. He's not a terrible role model he's just not that particularly engaging. The only character that's more boring is Queen Andromeda played by Rosamund Pike. These two characters share such an awful contrived romance that it makes Anakin and Padme from the Star Wars prequels look like Romeo and Juliet.But as I said before this sequel is merely a retread of the first movie. Sure the first one was predictable but at least it gave us a bit of time to know each of the characters. Here there's no development because they just assumed you know these characters because you watch the first movie. That's a problem I find many sequels running into and here it really weakens it.The special effects here are used in a way that makes me want to sterilize the people who came up with them. The filmmakers operate under the impression that if you throw a ton of special effects onto the screen it will give your audience something to look at. The problem with that logic is that the factors of character development and motivation are canceled out by the pointless action sequences to such a degree that the audience becomes bored by these fight scenes. The special effects don't dazzle audience members like they did in the past when they're used in such a repetitive fashion.With really bad movies like this when all hope is lost I try to focus on the positive aspects of the film. And there are a few good things found here. Liam Neeson Ralph Fiennes and Bill Nighy are pretty entertaining as the gods of Mt. Olympus and I do like that there is some though not a lot of development with these guys. The movie sort of touches on the messed up issues of family in Greek mythology and it was interesting. Whenever I found myself watching Sam Worthington and his band of bland beatniks try saying that five times fast I was wishing that I could be watching Liam Neeson and the others because they were interesting! Unfortunately not even the awesome acting of Liam Neeson can save this stinker kind of how Optimus Prime couldn't save the Transformers sequels.Final verdict If you're a fan of rich cinematic genius like Citizen Kane or 12 Angry Men this is not your kind of movie. It's too long too forced and too choppily edited. I'll admit there were people in the theater that watched it and seemed to get really invested and if you think you can go ahead and watch it. For me there were just too many things that didn't add up for me to enjoy this one. I don't regret seeing it but repeat viewings are not in my future.".

	schema:headline " Terrible story  the Gods must be spinning on Mount Olympus";
	schema:reviewBody "The story is absolute rubbish. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of mythology would cringe at the terrible things they made the Gods do. There are so many bad things about the plot.1. How could they make Ares and Hades fight against Zeus and then make Hades change sides for hardly any reason? 2. How could they make Zeus die? 3. Why is Perseus speaking with an Australian accent? Come on Sam at least fake something neutral! 4. Since when did Andromeda become some tomboy warrior amazon? 5. Why would Ares be jealous of that silly little fisherman Perseus when all he was doing was fishing? What pointless animosity. Since when were the Gods thugs?6. Why is Pegasus so dark?I thought the 2010 Clash was a terrible remake of the 80s version. The 2010 Clash had no charm romance or dignity of the Gods. But Wrath is worse. The story is so rubbishy and the dialog so terrible that it's gone light years away from the right direction. The acting and casting aren't good. Rosamund Pike isn't appealing enough for a princess. Her cold blank expression is annoying. Sam Worthington looks even more nondescript let alone heroic than before. He isn't even 1 percent God. And why did he start speaking in his native accent? Are the Gods from Down Under? And the sudden kiss at the end is so out of place even Andromeda looked shocked. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are too good to be in this bad movie.Don't watch this one  it's an example of silly people just throwing money away on effects when the plot stinks.".

	schema:headline " You Love it or you Hate it. Simple as that.";
	schema:reviewBody "All right I agree with most people when they say 2010's Clash of the Titans was not a great movie but I didn't hate it. I didn't walk out of the theater with a feeling like OMG that movie kicked ass!. It was OK I thought the film had pacing issues and the 3D was well... about as bad and pointless as people made it out to be. So is the sequel Wrath of the Titans an improvement?I'm happy to report that yes Wrath of the Titans is better. It's not a great film by any means it is flawed but if you're looking for 99 simple minutes to kill by looking at some pretty darn impressive action sequences then you are in luck. Also if you thought the 3D in Clash was bad that's not the case with Wrath. Don't expect anything along the lines of Avatar but I gotta say the 3D was used pretty nicely and didn't come off as a total gimmick.My biggest issue with the film however is one that I had with the previous film. The film sometimes feels a bit slow and that it takes a while to get started and there's not really much investment in the story or the characters. Some of the characters are mostly there to provide comic relief but even that is very hitormiss. For the most part Sam Worthington played his role pretty good a fine example of underrated acting. It's nothing great but it's far from abysmal. Liam Neeson was also rather enjoyable to watch but hey it's Liam Neeson. Everybody else isn't particularly interesting but they're not unforgivably boring or useless. There's also a small romance in the film between Worthington and a female side character but it comes off as pointless and unneeded. I just don't see why the majority of popcorn action flicks require a relationship when we go to see explosions and amazing special effects it's just not necessary.Flaws aside I enjoyed Wrath of the Titans. I am aware of the hate that this movie is receiving and I can understand some of the quibbles that one may have against it but hey at least it's better than it's predecessor.".

And certainly the producers seemed to have heeded the call with this sequel retaining the fine cast from the original Sam Worthington Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes while opting for fresh writers and a new director.It's still as important however to keep your hopes down for 'Wrath of the Titans' especially for those expecting a sweeping mythological epic. Taking over the reins from French director Louis Leterrier is Johnathan Liebesman and going by his previous works 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning and Battle Los Angeles the man is at best an efficient but uninspired director who pays more attention to visceral pleasures than to anything resembling depth.That is certainly true of his work here which vastly improves the action sequences of the original but little else. As if singularly devoting his time to create mindnumbing bigbudget sequences Liebesman invests little in the story and in his characters God demigod and human alike. Both are mechanical at best and engineered with a specific purpose of taking his viewer from one jawdropping sequence to another never mind the inconsistencies or the leaps of logic along the way.So despite the exposition the plot of the entire movie can be summed up in a one line to save Zeus Neeson from his conniving brother Hades Fiennes and jealous son Aroes Edgar Ramirez the demigod Perseus Worthington leaps back into full battle mode since retiring ten years ago to a quiet life in a small fishing village. Before facing the worst of them all Perseus will have to go up against a host of hideous looking monsters a fierymouthed Chimera with two heads at the front and a snake's head at its tail a trio of towering Cyclops giants a Minotaur and a band of halfman halfrock soldiers with four arms and two bodies that twist around on a pair of legs.There's no denying that the creatures this time are much more inventive and the action sequences choreographed much more skilfully adding up to a much more thrilling time than what its predecessor offered. Saving the best for last Liebesman also crafts an epic finale with a gigantic lavaspewing monster known as the Kronos that also involves a whole legion led by warriorqueen Princess Andromeda Rosamund Pike. The victory call at the end may be a tad overdone but the climax alone is worth the price of admission and surprisingly impressive even in post converted 3D.Pity then that the rest of the movie often pales in comparison and perhaps the most jarring of all is the poorly defined interfamilial conflict between Zeus Hades and Aroes. Screenwriters Dan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson working off a story that's also credited to Greg Berlanti give Aroes little motivation behind his father's betrayal other than his envy of Perseus nor do they manage the sibling tension between Zeus and Hades convincingly. Worse still they try to turn Hades into a less straightforward character by casting him as a reluctant pawn in Aroes' scheme midway into the movie and the subsequent reconciliation between Zeus and Hades is laughable even with the considerable acting talents of Neeson and Fiennes.Certainly both thespians are well aware of the thin material here but kudos to the pair for trying to imbue their Godly characters with the gravitas they usually bring to their roles. Among the more interesting additions to the cast are Bill Nighy as the loony weaponsmaker Hephaestus whom Perseus approaches for help to gain entry to the underworld labyrinth Zeus is held captive as well as Toby Kebbell as Poseidon's son Agenor and the only other character besides Hephaestus to have a sense of humour in the entire movie.Indeed the movie takes itself too seriously for its own good ignoring its own campy origins in favour of a selfserious sensibility to its storytelling that only further exposes its plot and character flaws. This is and perhaps has always been about watching Gods demigods and monsters go at each other with sound and fury and thankfully this sequel easily betters its predecessor on this regard alone. That's not likely to be enough to make the Gods happy though but for those of us mortals looking for bigbudget mindnumbing spectacle this will do just fine. www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:headline " Turn off your brain and you might enjoy";
	schema:reviewBody "Not a good movie. Here's what happensZeus asks Perseus for help yet again and Perseus says something along the lines of Noooo I'll never leave my son. So five minutes later after a random demon attacks his village what does he do? Yeah you guessed it. After he leaves his son he rides his trusty steed Pegasus who appears out of nowhere for no reason to a military camp. Meanwhile Zeus Poseidon and Hades are meeting in the underworld along with Zeus's son Ares. Surprise surprise evil Hades betrays his brothers and teams up with Ares who is jealous of Perseus for having his father's admiration. Zeus is captured and his powers are sapped to allow his father Cronos to escape imprisonment in Tartarus.Anyway Poseidon escapes and dies shortly after giving Perseus his trident and his next epic quest to save Zeus.An irrelevant quest follows with the introduction of some pretty undeveloped and pointless characters. They head out on a boat with the son of Poseidon to find the person who forged the Gods weapons and also Tartarus. Pegasus is apparently left with the other horses in the military camp his only purpose to have Perseus fly to the camp instead of walking because walking a long distance is not interesting.The crew reach an island and after walking a pretty long distance through a forest run in to a Cyclops. Confusion ensues as he seems to be doing two things at once... turns out there's two of them. Perseus does what he does best survives when he would clearly die and they all become the best of friends.The Cyclopes lead them to Bill Nighy he tells them all about the prison Tartarus. It's so intricate and complex to stop Cronos escaping! Remember that at the end when he gets out no problem. The squad make there way to the prison and are attacked and outmatched by Ares Bill Nighy and Sam Worthington couldn't care less.They travel through the labyrinth entrance to Tartarus we've been told it messes with your mind. This is shown through the friends being angry at each other like schoolchildren for a short while. Perseus is separated from the group and encounters the most pathetic Minotaur which of course throws him around for a while instead of killing him. It charges and gets it's horns stuck in the wall. Instead of killing the Minotaur while stuck he breaks off its horns... Our hero defeats the monster of course and is somehow reunited with his friends even though he fell pretty far away from them and it's a huge labyrinth.Zeus talks his brother Hades in to being good with two sentences even though he's pretty evil. The gang turn up for the rescue.The only way to defeat Cronos it seems is to join Zeus' lightning bolt Hades' pitchfork and Poseiden's trident all powerful which would have came in handy in the first film in to some super weapon. Ares should probably be aware of this since it involves his close family but decides to throw the pitchfork at Zeus now Percy has the trident and pitchfork. He might have thought to throw it in to the surrounding lava and they could never beat Cronos but oh well.Now something happened which completely broke the movie dying Zeus is taken to the military camp and left alone. If only Zeus' power relied on prayer and there was thousands of soldiers around Zeus would be pretty darn powerful. Nope. Nobody thought of this. Not even Zeus. Hades shows up though and gives most of his power to revive Zeus. Didn't the first film show us that Hades gets his power from peoples fear? Hades should be pretty powerful if everyone knew Cronos was coming to get them. Nope. Either everyone is pretty fearless or Hades is on a diet.Anyway while this is happening random monsters Lord knows where they came from attack the soldiers who die in the hundreds. They could have just said a few prayers for Zeus and they'd be fine he dispatches the monsters easily after being revived with a few prayers the soldiers might as well have gone for a lay down.Perseus rides Pegasus to meet Ares for a fight. Even though he has Perseus' son hostage he doesn't even make him drop his weapons just starts fighting. Just the kind of fight you would expect Perceus is thrown around instead of just killed and of course ends up winning because of the bad guys overconfidence. Ares of course brought the final piece of the super weapon puzzle for Percy to use. He could have left it literally anywhere else and the weapon couldn't be finished.Zeus and his new BFF Hades team up to kill the demons apparently they're all killed within two minutes. Cronos emerges. Apparently the labyrinth was no use for restraining him only there because somebody wanted a Minotaur in the movie. So Cronos kills people in as boring a fashion as any massive volcano man. We're supposed to be impressed. Perseus flies in on Pegasus with the finished weapon. flying through fire and lava but not being harmed not even acquiring black ash on the face like you would expect. he flies in Cronos' mouth for some reason and drops the weapon.

	onyx:emotionText "Not a good movie. Here's what happensZeus asks Perseus for help yet again and Perseus says something along the lines of Noooo I'll never leave my son. So five minutes later after a random demon attacks his village what does he do? Yeah you guessed it. After he leaves his son he rides his trusty steed Pegasus who appears out of nowhere for no reason to a military camp. Meanwhile Zeus Poseidon and Hades are meeting in the underworld along with Zeus's son Ares. Surprise surprise evil Hades betrays his brothers and teams up with Ares who is jealous of Perseus for having his father's admiration. Zeus is captured and his powers are sapped to allow his father Cronos to escape imprisonment in Tartarus.Anyway Poseidon escapes and dies shortly after giving Perseus his trident and his next epic quest to save Zeus.An irrelevant quest follows with the introduction of some pretty undeveloped and pointless characters. They head out on a boat with the son of Poseidon to find the person who forged the Gods weapons and also Tartarus. Pegasus is apparently left with the other horses in the military camp his only purpose to have Perseus fly to the camp instead of walking because walking a long distance is not interesting.The crew reach an island and after walking a pretty long distance through a forest run in to a Cyclops. Confusion ensues as he seems to be doing two things at once... turns out there's two of them. Perseus does what he does best survives when he would clearly die and they all become the best of friends.The Cyclopes lead them to Bill Nighy he tells them all about the prison Tartarus. It's so intricate and complex to stop Cronos escaping! Remember that at the end when he gets out no problem. The squad make there way to the prison and are attacked and outmatched by Ares Bill Nighy and Sam Worthington couldn't care less.They travel through the labyrinth entrance to Tartarus we've been told it messes with your mind. This is shown through the friends being angry at each other like schoolchildren for a short while. Perseus is separated from the group and encounters the most pathetic Minotaur which of course throws him around for a while instead of killing him. It charges and gets it's horns stuck in the wall. Instead of killing the Minotaur while stuck he breaks off its horns... Our hero defeats the monster of course and is somehow reunited with his friends even though he fell pretty far away from them and it's a huge labyrinth.Zeus talks his brother Hades in to being good with two sentences even though he's pretty evil. The gang turn up for the rescue.The only way to defeat Cronos it seems is to join Zeus' lightning bolt Hades' pitchfork and Poseiden's trident all powerful which would have came in handy in the first film in to some super weapon. Ares should probably be aware of this since it involves his close family but decides to throw the pitchfork at Zeus now Percy has the trident and pitchfork. He might have thought to throw it in to the surrounding lava and they could never beat Cronos but oh well.Now something happened which completely broke the movie dying Zeus is taken to the military camp and left alone. If only Zeus' power relied on prayer and there was thousands of soldiers around Zeus would be pretty darn powerful. Nope. Nobody thought of this. Not even Zeus. Hades shows up though and gives most of his power to revive Zeus. Didn't the first film show us that Hades gets his power from peoples fear? Hades should be pretty powerful if everyone knew Cronos was coming to get them. Nope. Either everyone is pretty fearless or Hades is on a diet.Anyway while this is happening random monsters Lord knows where they came from attack the soldiers who die in the hundreds. They could have just said a few prayers for Zeus and they'd be fine he dispatches the monsters easily after being revived with a few prayers the soldiers might as well have gone for a lay down.Perseus rides Pegasus to meet Ares for a fight. Even though he has Perseus' son hostage he doesn't even make him drop his weapons just starts fighting. Just the kind of fight you would expect Perceus is thrown around instead of just killed and of course ends up winning because of the bad guys overconfidence. Ares of course brought the final piece of the super weapon puzzle for Percy to use. He could have left it literally anywhere else and the weapon couldn't be finished.Zeus and his new BFF Hades team up to kill the demons apparently they're all killed within two minutes. Cronos emerges. Apparently the labyrinth was no use for restraining him only there because somebody wanted a Minotaur in the movie. So Cronos kills people in as boring a fashion as any massive volcano man. We're supposed to be impressed. Perseus flies in on Pegasus with the finished weapon. flying through fire and lava but not being harmed not even acquiring black ash on the face like you would expect. he flies in Cronos' mouth for some reason and drops the weapon. Before it explodes to kill Cronos he seems to blow Zeus against a rock which is apparently fatal.Percy rides back and Zeus stands up he looks fine but for some reason he's going to die Percy could say a prayer and he wouldn't but whatever. Zeus dies Worthington shows no emotion.Movie ends with an awkward fatherson chat. Looks to be setting up a sequel about the kid. I can hardly wait.The one lesson this film teaches is that you should pray to Zeus and you wont have to get yourself killed.";

Neptune shows up gives him his Trident and a name Agenor Toby Kebbel who is his son and has to be found in order to find Hephaestus Bill Nighy.But Agenor is in Andromedas' jail.

The Journey to Tartarus and the Battle with Cronus is a family affair for Perseus and he must needs ride Pegasus once more into the gaping maw of potential death.And as this movie showed a world that was mostly collapsing dirt volcanoes and gods turning into Dust the CGI aspects were rendered that way.

	schema:reviewBody "Two years ago I eagerly anticipated the release of the remake of one of my favourite films of all time Clash of the Titans. What I was given was a mess of a film in bad postproduction 3D which needlessly messed with the original story of Perseus and his defeat of the Kraken...and turned my beloved Pegasus black.When a followup was announced being a huge fan of all Mythology even if it is tweaked for Hollywood's sake I felt they could only improve on a second attempt after the epic failure of the first goaround.I was wrong.Wrath of the Titans picks up a decade later with Perseus raising his only son alone after dismissing Zeus' offer of riches and power after his heroic defeat of the Kraken and the unexplained death of his wife who I would have thought would have been Io but should really be Andromedabut remained unaddressed. As mortals lose their faith in the gods the gods in turn lose more and more of their power and consequently the walls which imprison the Titans in Tartarus are weakening and the end of days is imminent.Zeus turns to his son to warn him of the threat and ask his help but Persues declines.That is until he learns from Poseidon that Zeus' other son Ares turned against him and led him into a trap in Tartarus and Zeus is imprisoned by Hades  transferring all Zeus' power to Kronos the leader of the Titans and Zeus' father in exchange for immortality.And thus Perseus learns that in order to save humanity he must rescue his father and defeat Kronos and teams with Poseidon's demigod son Agenor and Queen Andromeda who as I mentioned by all accounts and purposes should already be his wife.The story itself has much potential but sadly the execution just falls flat. With far too many convenient twists and escapes even by Mythology's standards I found the events extremely difficult to swallow the narrative being even too ridiculous for the likes of me. The whole film just sort of stumbles along like an adventure in special effects with the actual storytelling as somewhat of a secondary element. Something which is becoming far too common these days.Even though it has just been a couple of years since Sam Worthington was thrust into the spotlight in Avatar and the last Titan film he looks like he has aged two decades having lost all of the sexy hardbodied spunk that is befitting a demigod. He was a relatively unconvincing Perseus the first time around and the sequel just confirms the notion.Everyone else's performance including the return of Liam Neeson as Zeus Danny Huston as Poseidon and Ralph Fiennes as Hades are just fine but acceptable performances in a mediocre film hardly lessen the disappointment.After having been so mortified by the disrespect Clash of the Titans showed the original production one wouldn't think it could get worse. But at least that film aroused some sort of emotional reaction in me. The sequel didn't even manage to do that. It simply disappointed. No doubt I may be first in line for the third installment already currently in preproduction as hope always prevails...but that may be tentative while what will most assuredly be mediocre box office could throw a spanner in the works.But hey at least the 3D was better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just finished watching wrath of the titans and have to say it was better than expected. I was expecting a somewhat average film after the disappointing remake of the original. All the characters played their roles very well especially Zeus and Hades. The version I saw was 3d and the use of it was much better this time around scenes with falling rocks Pegasus flying and other scenes had a strong presence with the 3d. A couple weaknesses I saw in my opinion were the character representations of Hephestus and Hades toward the end. Hephestus was seemed to be way scrawnier too good looking not serious enough and too weak for a god. He was a solid character just wish they made him more represented to how he was in myth. Also without spoiling the character change of Hades toward the end was a little interesting but felt it shouldn't have been done. The effects were in this movie were awesome especially for Cronus. It also has some great fight scenes that really get you blood pumping. All in all though it was a great action film with some solid comedy relief and just a great overall film especially for those looking for flashy effects 810".

All the characters played their roles very well especially Zeus and Hades. The version I saw was 3d and the use of it was much better this time around scenes with falling rocks Pegasus flying and other scenes had a strong presence with the 3d.

	schema:reviewBody "Perseus is back in this sequel to the 2010 poorly received remake of the 1984 classic Clash of the Titans. A decade has passed since his heroic defeat of the Kraken and things have changed a bit for Perseus and friends. However just when he was about to have a good life evil calls him back again to fight once more in an attempt alongside the gods to defeat the evil Titan lord Kronos from devouring the gods and obliterating all of mankind. Wrath of the Titans takes place a decade after the conclusion of the 2010 remake so there's a slight change in life. Perseus is now a father and due to the death of his wife Io a lone parent of 10yearoldsoontobehero Helius. After refusing the offer to given a rank between the gods of Olympus he lives a quiet life as a fisherman with his son. Besides Perseus Princess Andromeda is now Queen Andromeda and a fighter. Meanwhile the gods are facing a crisis. Hades god of the underworld and Ares god of war have teamed up with Kronos leader of the Titans. They had made a deal with him and to release him from Tartarus. To power up Kronos they captured Zeus and drained him of his energy to feed Kronos thus awakening him. If they successfully awaken Kronos Kronos would then proceed to kill Zeus and his friends and obliterate all of mankind in an attempt to rule the world once more. Just like its predecessor this movie offers a lot of intense action sequences. This is one improvement from its predecessor having more intense fighting scenes. There are many fights here conducted between Perseus and many different creatures from the Greek myths. There's a fight between Perseus and the Minotaur in the labyrinth a battle with a gigantic Cyclops and many more battles with twoheaded winged creatures twobodyinone monsters and of course the lavafueled gigantic debriscoated Kronos for the climax. And add in the outstanding visual effects to enhance the action sequences. Anyone who's looking forward to violence will be pleased with this perfect blend of exciting action scenes and sophisticated visual effects. Talking about effects let's talk about the 3D. The first film being heavily marketed as a must see 3D event had dreadful 3D effects. Added as an afterthought the 3D is just painful and does nothing to the film except charge the viewer some extra bucks. I was skeptical of watching it in 3D for this movie but it seems the producers and crew have spent more time and paid more attention to the 3D effects of the film. The 3D here is a vast massive improvement from the dreadful 3D effects of the first film. Occasionally some of the items shown pop out of the screen. If you hated the 3D of the first film reconsider before deciding to watch this film whether in 3D or not because the 3D here is just excellent. When it gets to story this movie lacks at it. It has a simple plot that the movie rarely hangs on to. But that's not a problem the movie does not aim to be a film with an intriguing complex sophisticated mindboggling plot it aims to be a spectacular eclectic mix of special effects and action scenes. The dialog is fairly simple the acting was fair and the plot was just not complicated. Nevertheless Wrath of the Titans is a considerable improvement from the horrible 2010 remake of the 1984 classic. It has plenty of action sequences accompanied with dazzling visual effects for teenage boys to enjoy excellent 3D effects for enhanced excitement and a little bit of focus on the storyline to get things going. If you're anyone of the people who want to have some fun watching countless violent scenes and dazzling visual effects have this movie a go. But if you're anyone who's more interested in seeing a movie with an intriguing plot and some more focus on the storyline give this film a miss. Rating 710Final Verdict Wrath of the Titans is a vast improvement from the poor remake of the 1984 fantasy that offers plenty of action sequences dazzling visual effects satisfying 3D effects and a little bit of storyline to get things going.".

The writers should NEVER be allowed to script a movie again and be made to work at McDonald's at minimum wage. The characterisation was all over the place you couldn't care less about any of them. Sam Worthington was way too Aussie. Liam Neeson was just going through the numbers. So for that matter was Ralph Fiennes. Rosamund Pike was emotionless. Cold as a fish. Bill Nighy was well Bill Nighy  with a very northern accent for some reason. What's with the regional accents? Very mythological indeed! The movie would have worked better with more care given to the dialogue less modern phrases and treated a bit more classically. I almost expected a rap song to play through the end titles. So if you want an adventure movie this might work for you. If you want something with a bit of intelligence  give it a miss.".

All the good actors and special effects in the world can't save it. There's a lot I'd like to say about this but ah heck there's not enough story to ruin. Here goes.One thing I liked was they brought the equivalent of Burgess Meredith's character into this one played awesomely by Bill Nighy but that sadly doesn't save the rest of this mess. For the rest they go right back to the formula that bugged me in the original and that I liked that they did away with for the remake a bunch of random events that kind of mix into a main story at some point.Opening scene they take away the wife Perseus had at the end of the first one. They also make his motivation not that he doesn't want to be a god or not have anything to do with the gods but now it's that he thinks he's too human to be a god... So basically EVERYTHING the first one does this one turns on it's head. Basically this should've just been its own movie it was 100 pointless to make this a sequel. Something that really bugged me was why not keep Perseus awesome sword from Zeus and shield from the scorpion in this one? Who would get rid of such great weapons? Aries is treated like a god even though he is only a half god like Perseus which just makes no sense. In this one they put the princess back into the action like in the original which actually makes sense for this one and would be cool if she ever actually did ANYTHING. The love interest is nonexistent through the movie and then jumps out of nowhere in the last 3 minutes of the film. Where the first one had a lot of great characters and motivation in the team and really felt like a buddy journey film this one was just a bunch of red shirts that die off fairly quickly and are very forgettable anyway. The titans were very underwhelming even boring. The only cool one was the first one that was on EVERY commercial and billboard. The last Titan moved so darn slow that I have no idea why they even had to hold it back it would take the thing a freakin year just to move a mile. Then we get to the gods. They introduce weapons that are super important yet were never even seen in the first one. Maybe a line or two of dialog as to why they didn't use them in the first one? They only use them on other gods? ANY bad excuse would've done! Also in the first one the gods had freaking AWESOME war armor even though they never fought. So why in this one where they DO fight did their armor look like it was designed by Arnie Grape? The hardest part of watching this movie is trying to figure out which is worse the writing or the directing. Sequels like this should just not be made.".

The action was for me most of the time mindblowing especially the last third of the movie. Story is much better even though dialogues are weak it's more light hearted.

This Spaghetti ZorroMusclemen in middle budget is filled with noisy action  thrills  spectacular fights  horse pursuits by Zorro and swordplay . This Zorro is decently starred by Pierre Brice  he took a chance and jumped from modern action and Western genre to costumed Italian adventure . That same year  1963  German producer Horst Wendlandt searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief Winnetou on a Western movie titled Apache Fury adapted from novels by Karl May and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival . Pierre got the role and portrayed Winnetou in ten more movies with his costar Lex Barker as Old Shatterhand. Here Brice steals the show as a mildmannered poet  Ramon  and as the brave Zorro . Soon after ZorroPierre Brice team up with Maciste to bring about a proper resolution to the crown succession  this is Alan Steel . Sergio Ciani made lots of romanepicItalian films also called Musclemen movies or Sword and sandals as well as costumer swordfight and a few adventures  and Spaghetti Western . Steel's luck changed when Italian director Gianfranco Parolini persuaded him to star Sansone 1961 along with Brad Harris and later on  he continued to play several others . On numerous occasions Steel was asked to play the legendary Greek hero  as well as the equally wellbuilt demigods  even though the film titles often fused or confused them in their titles . Steel played the mythic Maciste in great number of movies was randomly assigned the identity of Hercules  Goliath  Samson or Aron for U.S. viewing . As he played a great number of Peplums  such as  1962 Ursus Il Rebel Gladiatore  1962 Rocha  son of Sanson  1964 Sansone e Il Tesoro Degli Incas  1964 Maciste against ghosts  1964 Ercole Contro Roma  1964 Sansone Contro Il Corsario  1963 Golia e Il Cavaliere Mascherato  1964 Ercole Sansone Maciste e Ursus  and 1964 Three avengers .

Other piratesword flicks followed starting with Pirates of Malaysia 1964 starred by Steeve Reeves which was part of the height of the career of fictitious tales of historic or legendary characters including Robin Hood  Catherine the Great  Zorro  Sandokan and Maciste . He subsequently directed a Fumetti titled The mask of Kriminal 1966 . After directing a war film and two spaghetti westerns  Lenzi turned to the Giallo genre with Orgasmo 1969. During the 1970s Lenz filmed a number of Giallo and thrillers  among them  So Sweet So Perverse Seven BloodStained Orchids and Eyeball . Lenzi turned to the police thrillers called Polizieschi which rejuvenated his confidence and his popularity . Titles like Almost Human  Free Hand For a Tough Cop and Brothers Till We Die were the most popular and brutal of the thrillers . Lenzi is an expert on wartime genre as he proved in Desert commandos  Battle of commandos  From hell to victory  Young Lions and Bridge to hell. Prior to the Polizieschi  Lenzi directed Man from Deep River  which was the start of the Italian cannibal subgenre . Later on  he directed two very gory jungle cannibal features  Eaten Alive and Make Them Die Slowly which was banned in 31 countries  made Lenzi distance himself from the cannibal genre . This attractive adventure Zorro versus Maciste is rated 5.510".

Malva the evil one gets Garcia the captain of the guard to intercept the king's troops and confiscate the scrollcase containing the king's will.  To this end Garcia employs Samson Alan Steel to steal the scrollcase and deliver it to Malva.  Of course Samson does not know what she has in mind.  Meanwhile Isabella enlists the aid of Zorro Pierre Brice to get the scrollcase himself and thus thwart Malva's evil plans. I really enjoyed this film because it contains lots of action and vibrant colors as well as a nicely done soundtrack.  Alan Steel is at his best and Pierre Brice is perfect in his role as Zorro.  Lenzi has created a worthy film and it will survive many viewings.  It is a shame that this is unavailable on VHS or DVD.  Well maybe soon!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Masked Avenger has been a staple of movie and TV fare ever since the 1920 Douglas Fairbanks classic THE MARK OF ZORRO inevitably his popularity led to the character being picked by other countries as well often in lowbrow productions with perhaps the most successful of these being the 1974 film entitled simply ZORRO starring Alain Delon. Anyway this is one of those dimeadozen efforts I missed out on a couple of others not too long ago but since this got shown over last year's Christmas period I opted to have it taped for later viewing as is often the case with such undemanding and modest pictures it proves instantly forgettable but reasonably entertaining nevertheless. Opening with a stagecoach robbery the film does feel like a Western most of the time which is not in itself a bad thing another palpable incongruity is the fact that Zorro's alterego is not that of a foppish aristocrat but rather a vaguely sycophantic valet apart from which in the guise of one Tony Russell he sports graying hair albeit retaining the trademark dashing features! Again predictably he is made to rout a usurping governor and the girl who idolizes him and whom he secretly loves not only despises the valet for his apparent treason but is even engaged to marry an eminent town member who resents her affection for Zorro and naturally ultimately sacrifices himself for the good of the cause his sidekick then is a young inventor that is not very adept at derringdo  while the villain's burly lieutenant provides the obligatory comic relief. It is futile to give more details about the plot since to be honest I cannot recall more than I have already described  I do know however that the title is a reference to nothing in particular  nor are any of the action setpieces throughout exactly outstanding I will just say that the film supplies the right ingredients for an evening's relaxation and leave it at that".

I saw it again recently and of course noticed several things I didn't see the first time. The story is about a young lawyerfamily man Dean Jones who runs for DA against the corrupt DA currently in office Keenan Wynn but the latter gets ahold of a ring which has an inscription that when read can turn Jones into a sheepdog. The same gag of Jones becoming a sheepdog at the worst possible time is repeated a bit too much and most of the gags are obvious and dependant upon banana peellike  slapstickhumor. Dean Jones is a fine actor but he kept playing the same character over and over in the Disney comedies of the 70s. He never seemed to know what was going on and was constantly the butt of the joke. Not surprisingly the Disney slapstick films soon wore out their welcome. The Shaggy DA though is one of Disney's better offerings. It features a pretty good cast. Tim Conway as an ice cream man is especially in good form and Vic Tayback adds some life as a mobster who is in cahoots with Wynn. The humor is dated and certainly not aimed at intelligent kids but for the most part it does deliver with the laughs.".

For what that was and how it turned out one should see the prequel to The Shaggy DA the famous Walt Disney classic The Shaggy Dog.To refresh one's memory back then the Dean Jones character of Wilby Daniels was played by Tommy Kirk who because of a cursed ring said to belong to Lucretia Borgia back in the day who allegedly dabbled in the black arts Kirk would enter the body of a large sheep dog who was owned by the new next door neighbors of his family. When the ring got returned and Kirk performed a heroic act the curse was lifted.Or so they thought now Wilby Daniels is played by Dean Jones who now is a lawyer running for District Attorney against corrupt DA Keenan Wynn and married to Suzanne Pleshette with a son Shane Sinutko. Just as the campaign gets going the ring is once again stolen from the museum and when the magic words inscribed on the ring are uttered Jones is shifting from human to canine and back.Eventually chief villain Keenan Wynn gets the ring and he's in control of the situation when he discovers what it does to Jones. It becomes a family project to get that ring back and expose him before the electorate. Also along for the ride is Tim Conway an ice cream truck vendor whose shaggy dog's body Jones transfers to.The Shaggy DA has a lot of laughs in it and its good entertainment it doesn't however have the poignancy of the teen angst that Tommy Kirk brought to the original Wilby. It does have the usual cast of Hollywood veterans that the Disney studio always managed to find work for. It's one of the reasons the Magic Kingdom films from the late Sixties and Seventies are a lot of fun it's like watching some of the classic films from the studio system days seeing all those familiar faces. I'd still recommend the film especially to family audiences with younger viewers but it's not as good as the original.".

I know that in the 1959 originalDaneils finds the ring and he reads the inscription and turns into a dog. That maybe the answerbut the fact remainsnot everyone who reads the inscription turns into a dog.

After the robbers return a second time to take everything else that they had left Wilby decides to run for District Attorney so he can clean up the town and lock up the criminals for good.Meanwhile the same robbers who broke into his house have also stolen the famous Borgia ring from the local museum. Unfortunately for Wilby every time someone reads the inscription he turns into a sheepdog again. This of course happens at the most inconvenient times and the result is a silly familyfriendly comedy.The Shaggy D.A. is a sequel to the 1959 Disney film the Shaggy Dog. Though it's not quite as funny as the original there still is a lot to like about this version of the story. The acting is pretty much on par with what we've come to expect from these Disney films and the characters are pretty interesting even if they are onedimensional. The transformation from human to dog doesn't seem to work as well here as it did in the 1959 film for some reason but it's fine. If I had a complaint about this movie it's that it goes a bit long and the same gags are used a few times too many. Other than that it's nice to find a film that doesn't resort to 7th grade humor that seems to be in every family film these days.The bottom line is this is a decent movie if you'd like to have a good time with the kids but adults will be a bit bored from it fairly soon. It's not as good as some of the other Disney comedies from the 1960s and 1970s.".

Crooked senator Wynn is determined to get his hands on the magic ring that will enable the metamorphosis but predictably the old dog has a few new tricks up his sleeve to counter every attempt.Conway plays the icecream vendor caught up in the calamities Vic Tayback as a racketeer in cahoots with Wynn and Dick Van Patten has a minor role as Wynn's chauffeur. The sultry Suzanne Pleshette plays Jones' domestic retreat despite having little to offer the film still adds a much needed spark.No surprises it's inoffensive a bit of gunplay but no actual violence slapstick comedy that would appeal to the young family audience.".

	onyx:emotionText "Typical Disney 70's fare with the usual cast Jones Conway Wynn associated with the studio at the time here focusing on the kid from the original Shaggy Dog 1959 movie all grown up Jones and still having issues with his canine transformations. Crooked senator Wynn is determined to get his hands on the magic ring that will enable the metamorphosis but predictably the old dog has a few new tricks up his sleeve to counter every attempt.Conway plays the icecream vendor caught up in the calamities Vic Tayback as a racketeer in cahoots with Wynn and Dick Van Patten has a minor role as Wynn's chauffeur. The sultry Suzanne Pleshette plays Jones' domestic retreat despite having little to offer the film still adds a much needed spark.No surprises it's inoffensive a bit of gunplay but no actual violence slapstick comedy that would appeal to the young family audience.";

Dance is the only language they need. Like a gravity is holding them close together they're turning around each other whole night long. When the clubs switches on the light and turns off the music they feel like thrown back in a cold reality. Out of the club he asks her To my place or to yours? Freya is disappointed by this dumpy question. So she makes him another offer. They start a fascinating journey through the early morning.";

Gable and Pidgeon know each other well and besides stealing each other's film they fake stories so they can scoop one another and satisfy their bosses. They were way ahead of their time there. The funniest scene is Gable staging an airplane dropping a bomb over the house of a family. It's a toy airplane. Hilarious! Loy plays Alma Harding trying to break air travel records so she can get money for an expedition to the Amazon to find her brother who is presumed dead. When Pidgeon fakes a delivery of serum by Alma a childhood friend it goes wrong when the plane catches on fire after crashing. Gable saves her life and gains her trust. Whether or not it's justified is another matter.Everyone is great in this movie including Walter Connolly who plays Gable's frustrated boss Pidgeon Loy and Gable. Gable is irresistible with that smile of his and Loy is excellent as a determined woman who nevertheless succumbs to Gable's charms. Pidgeon plays a more boisterous part rather than his usual gentlemanly ones and he comes off very well.This is a fasttalking film where the action moves along at a rapid pace. A great example of a '30s comedy tinged with romance that you won't want to miss.".

Pigeon also has a large role in the film but his is pretty much the subordinate role and almost no attempt is made to mask the fact that he will not get the girl.The film's plot basically has Gable and Pigeon as rival photographers for newsreel companies in NYC. Loy is a daredevil female pilot think Amelia Earhardt who they both try to woo on a professional and personal level. Her main angle is that her brother was lost in a crash in South America and she's trying to raise money to send out a rescue party.The characters aren't too convincing or realistic but this is an actionromance so that doesn't really matter. The dialogue is fun and Conway's direction makes the film flow very smoothly. The most impressive photography in the film is the aerial footage where Gable and Loy are photographing a burning ship at sea.... the effects for this were quite well done for the time.Overall a pleasing not too memorable adventure film. I expected a sort of Red Dust type of film but found Gable's character somewhat less interesting and the story somewhat more than in that film.".

In this case the business is newsreels.This film was produced just a year before Gone With The Wind but what a difference with cinematography and general sophistication between the very 1930ish Too Hot To Handle and the decades ahead of its time GWTW. And the aerial stunts Gable supposedly portrayed here just aren't believable.Nevertheless it's an entertaining flick despite its flaws. And one of the chief flaws is the likable scoundrel Clark Gable...and he was likable but not lovable...so why exactly did Myrna Loy's character fall in love with him? Did women in the 1930s really have a total lack of good taste? Just when you think the film is preposterous things begin to look up. Myrna Loy's brother is missing in South America and our pals Loy Gable and Walter Pidgeon head for the Amazon where they encounter South American natives all of whom happen to be African????? And what those African transplants fall for is just plain hokey where in blazes does Gable's compadre get a movie projector in the middle of the jungle let along the electricity to run it. Preposterous.The acting of Gable Loy and Pidgeon is all great. But the script is pathetically foolish. And speaking of acting  kudos to character actor Walter Connolly who turns in a heck of a performance as Gable's newsreel company boss.Perhaps if they had simply had Latinos playing the South American natives one could forgive the inconsistencies in this film. But this blunder is all too much.There's nothing wrong with this film...except 78 years of sophistication. Entertaining? Yes. Believable? No. NOT a flick for your DVD shelf!".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay this isn't Shakespeare. Clark Gable and Myrna Loy were the number one box office draws of 1938 and it seems that what made them famous was not believability but that their films were so much fun. Gable's films were always high on the action romance and fun while Ms. Loy became famous for her wonderful banter in the THIN MAN movies. So in this case you merge the two into a very light adventure film filled with laughs and some marvelous dialogand a romance that doesn't always work. It's certainly NOT the best film they did together nor is it the worst and fans of both are sure to enjoy the film because it is pure 1930s MGM formula. Now modern viewers might not find the film so magicalafter all the plot is pretty tough to believe and the characters seem pretty cartoonish. But given my love for this genre and these actors I don't mind terribly. Sure it's not supermemorable but it was more than worth the energy I spent watching the film.Clark is a get it at ANY cost cameraman for a company specializing in newsreels. He meets Loy my accidentally causing her plane to crash. Instead of being mad she unbelievably praised Clark for saving her life hey lady it was HIS obnoxious actions that CAUSED the plane crash in the first place!. The rest of the film is on againoff again romance between them with Walter Pigeon trying to horn in between them. It's not at all believable and awfully silly but the action and comedy bits are pretty cool so they make up for the deficiencies and result in a decent and watchable flick. But for persnickety people like me who delight at spotting problems with movies take a look at the Amazonian villagers. They are all Black Americans who look and dress EXACTLY like extras from a TARZAN movieand look not one bit like South American Indians!".

Hunter's nemesis is Bill Dennis Walter Pidgeon and every scene is a competition to see who can top who or who can put one over on the other. If Clark Gable is present then Myrna Loy must be in here too and she is... as Alma Harding. A fun fast paced goodnatured contest between the two reporters. Alma's brother is missing and she talks Hunter Gable into helping to find him. Did you spot Marjorie Main as the secretary in the newsroom? She was only 48 in this one... she would go on to be nominated for Ma Kettle ten years later! Gable had recently gotten HIS Oscar for It Happened One Night. Myrna Loy received an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement. Even Walter Pidgeon was nominated for TWO Oscars in the 1940s. What a cast of pros! Obviously they never left the back lot of Hollywood but for the general public who had never traveled very far this would have been very exciting and exotic. Of course Hunter gets caught up in his own web of deception but he must figure out how to win back the lady as well as his job. This is a fun exciting story and worth every minute. Shown on TCM now  then. Directed by Jack Conway MGM bigshot who made TONS of stuff with Gable and Loy. Catch this one when you can! You won't be sorry.".

It is just a little sad that Leander's Gloria Vane was prevented from wearing a really shoulderfree evening gown as those loudmouthed boors accused her of.

She plays a glamorous stage diva and we first see her on stage in London singing her flirtatious number 'Yes Sir'. She then takes the wrap for a fraud committed by her British officer lover played by Willy Birgel who is on the verge of sailing for Australia and for her pains she is transported to Australia herself as a convict. In prison accompanied by her fellow female inmates she sings a beautiful sad song directed to her rascally lover 'I have such a deep longing for you'. She is released from Paramatta prison in order to marry a handsome farmer played by Viktor Staal  but she runs away from him only to discover that the Birgel character is on the verge of marrying the governor's daughter. Heartbroken she tries to return to prison then to the stage but is booed by the Australian audience for her gloomy act  a real irony this since the song she's singing 'I'm standing in the Rain' is a real beauty haunting and melancholy making full use of Leander's lovely contralto voice. Zu Neuen Ufern is a very emotionally involving film a pointer to the films Detlev Sierck would later make in the US under his anglicised name Douglas Sirk.

With 1933 not only did the Hays Code strongly influence the American film industry but so did the Nazi regime in Germany the country where Expressionism was actually born. With Ufa studios as the center one had to be correct with the regime's demands and at the same time by using some skills and clever methods one could deliver something powerful enough to absorb a variety of audiences. This movie the meaningful title of which can be translated as At New Shores is a clear manifestation of such an attempt. Made by Detlef Sierck better known to Americans as Douglas Sirk a master of Hollywood Melodrama just to name IMITATION OF LIFE AT NEW SHORES is not only a wonderful mixture of comedy drama and musical but foremost a vehicle for an eminent actress the name that aroused certain 'discomforts' even for monstrous Goebbels himself Zarah Leander.Most aspects appear to be authentic here and delivered in a fragile manner by the cast but there are actually to this day two people who make their portrayals worth deeper analysis Willi Birgel as Sir Albert and Zarah Leander as Gloria Vane. Let me make some points about them before I move to the artistic aspect of the movie.As a matter of fact this is a movie which made the Swedish actress a star at Ufa Studios after her first German film PREMIERE which was not at Ufa. A debut at the studio and a true ZARAH LEANDER film at first sight. As a newcomer at the time 1937 she makes her entrance as an artistic personality a character capable of loving and waiting a suffering 'product to identify with' for female audiences bringing to light certain mechanisms of social hypocrites mind you that the story is not set in Germany in order not to evoke some controversial interpretations or misunderstanding but... in England and foremost in Australia  the safest choice of locale seen as a 'new land'. She is a character of a typical woman of her films echoes certain features widespread at the time bringing everything to pinnacle of melancholy. The Paramatta sequence as well as the trial accurately address the social conventions and question their morality. It is however foremost afflicted and influenced by women's emancipation women's rights  a handkerchief for sensitive female viewers necessary. Here Zarah's Gloria Vane draws parallels to many femme fatales of the time including ROMANZE IN MOLL or DER WEG INS FREIE Way To Freedom which clearly draws parallels to this film along with its title. More to say the camera seems to celebrate her face as it was in case of Garbo at Hollywood. And yet...Zarah is twice an artist with her deep voice she does not play so memorably as she sings memorably I will develop this aspect with music of the film.It is however not the woman who suffers most and jerks our tears to the very end. It is Sir Albert a seemingly noble man of prospects in life of promising marriage with beautiful Mary and despite everything a character of strong personal conflicts destructive torments. Willi Birgel being Zarah's favorite costar delivers a unique portrayal of shadowed character never remaining in the shadow of our attention. Although we mostly see him from her pretentious perspective the actor manages to draw a vibrant personality. Now let me move to general artistic merits of the film.Great cinematography supplies a viewer with exceptional visual experience. Wolfgang Paul in Der Tagesspiegel 1974 and Thomas Kramer in Reclams Lexikon Des Deutschen Films 1995 observe certain details on that point. The cinematography strongly influenced by German Expressionism makes a lot of scenes memorably echo haunting whispers within the screen art introduced by Murnau or Pabst. Mind you the shadows at Alfred's tragic night or his leave for Australia and Zarah's image at the harbor practically the iconic image of the movie's content. Two more aspects actually serve undeniable aid in evoking the film's mood MUSIC and RAIN. Music is in the hands of Zarah Leander she delivers her lines in singing her songs aid the melancholy of the whole atmosphere as well as provoke contradictions. Additionally the costumes deliver visual taste. Mind you two songs end with an almost religious reference to Alleluia and Amen. The song the film is probably most famous for Yes Sir clearly delivers the sentiments of the time the 1930s rather than the 19th century when the action of the film is set. But...no need for historical accuracy in a movie like this. And rain...something typical for romantic sorrows tearjerking sentimentality soap operalike impressions. In one of her songs she sings about standing in the rain drawing a clear metaphor to tormented states of mind and heart. That bears resemblance with the storytelling of many of her films not only this one.All in all an interesting film to see an important work of art from the historical and dramatic standpoint. The hidden meaning within the name 'Gloria' along with the surprising and jubilant conclusion at the finale still lead the viewer towards the new shores of classical movie viewing and its interpretation.".

	schema:headline " A quality effort from German director Douglas Sirk prior to his arrival in America";
	schema:reviewBody "Douglas Sirk isn't a director I've explored much. Having only seen a few of his '50s American melodramas and knowing he had roots as a German filmmaker I wanted to go back and get a feel for that part of his career. I'd also never seen any films by any director made in Germany during the reign of the Nazi regime i.e. 1933 to 1945 other than Triumph of the Will the infamous megapropaganda documentary by Leni Riefenstahl. So this film had a lot of historical interest for me. What I did not expect however was a quality film in its own right. And interestingly that's exactly what it turned out to be.To New Shores was a 1937 film directed by Sirk when he was still known by his real name Detlef Sierck. He had directed seven features and three shorts prior to this film all for the famous German film studio Universum Film AG or UFA for short. The history of UFA is dark and controversial as they became deeply entrenched in the Nazi machine. Prior to the rise of National Socialism in Germany in 1933 UFA had produced some great films namely the films of Fritz Lang such as Dr. Mabuse The Gambler Die Nibelungen and Metropolis. When the Nazis came into power UFA benefited heavily from it. The Nazis' fascist modus operandi extended to the film industry as well where they essentially made UFA the official film studio of Nazi Germany UFA churned out the country's propaganda films including Triumph of the Will in 1935 and forced out the other film studios leaving UFA with little to no competition in the German film industry. Additionally the Germans' conquering and occupation of so many other countries across Europe was opening new markets to UFA. In a country under German occupation the influx of cultural materials such as films was heavily regulated by the occupying government so the Nazis could control exactly what films were available to the people of an occupied nation. And of course they made sure that UFA's films were everywhere. Put simply UFA profited immensely from the Nazis' tyranny in Europe during those years. So naturally there's often a sense of moral corruption associated with this particular film studio in terms of its complicity with the Nazis during this part of history.Douglas Sirk too could be criticized for his contributions to the Nazi machine. Filmmakers like Fritz Lang and Billy Wilder a screenwriter at the time bailed out of Germany upon Hitler's rise to power while directors like Ernst Lubitsch and F.W. Murnau were already working in America. But Sirk didn't leave at least not right away. For a time he stayed and worked for UFA and by extension for the Nazis. That being said in 1937 after this film and one more he finally left Germany supposedly because of political sentiments and because of his Jewish wife. It's also worth noting that when he got to America he made Hitler's Madman and overtly antiNazi film.To New Shores stars Zarah Leander a Swedish singer who apparently was Germany's biggest star actress during the Nazi years and this her first film with UFA was evidently the film that propelled her to stardom along with Sirk's next film La Habanera which also starred Leander. Admittedly it's a strong performance. She does quite well.Interestingly the propaganda in this film is actually minimal all things considered. I found myself surprised that the Nazi government let a film be produced with so little propaganda value. Of course it was 1937 and the war hadn't begun yet but still there's not much here in terms of propaganda. The film is a criticism of social injustice like much of Sirk's work seems to be All That Heaven Allows is the main example that comes to mind though as I said I haven't seen many of his films. Presumably in order to get the film past the censors Sirk had to set the film in England and so all the characters are English despite speaking German. As a result the social injustice and cultural decadence depicted in the film can be seen as a criticism of English society specifically which I'm sure is what the censors were counting on when they passed the film. I do not think however that this is how Sirk intended the film to be interpreted. I think Sirk was concerned with social injustice in general and if anything in Germany specifically although he could obviously never convey that kind of message under the strict regulation of the Nazi censors. Nevertheless much of the cultural criticism in the film has far more implications for Germany than it does for England and the prison camp to which the female protagonist is sent will inevitably evoke associations with Nazi concentration camps during the war.Watching To New Shores I was reminded very much of Roberto Rossellini's 1942 film A Pilot Returns. Both films were made in collaboration with the fascist government that ran their respective countries. Furthermore the films are very similar in style and tone. To New Shores has much less in common with the German cinema of the '20s and even early '30s than it does with for instance the concurrent French poetic realism films by directors like Marcel Carn Jean Renoir and Julien Duvivier.Overall it's a quality film with solid entertainment value and a fairly engaging narrative. I never expected that UFA would have churned out a real film like this in the years just before the war. In comparison to Sirk's later work in Hollywood To New Shores lacks both the stylized aesthetic and the intense melodrama that marked those films. It's definitely a melodrama but it's more subtle and understated than films like All That Heaven Allows and Magnificent Obsession. It's not great cinema but it's a respectable effort that is probably well worth the watch.RATING 6.67 out of 10 stars".

The Nazis' fascist modus operandi extended to the film industry as well where they essentially made UFA the official film studio of Nazi Germany UFA churned out the country's propaganda films including Triumph of the Will in 1935 and forced out the other film studios leaving UFA with little to no competition in the German film industry. Additionally the Germans' conquering and occupation of so many other countries across Europe was opening new markets to UFA. In a country under German occupation the influx of cultural materials such as films was heavily regulated by the occupying government so the Nazis could control exactly what films were available to the people of an occupied nation. And of course they made sure that UFA's films were everywhere. Put simply UFA profited immensely from the Nazis' tyranny in Europe during those years. So naturally there's often a sense of moral corruption associated with this particular film studio in terms of its complicity with the Nazis during this part of history.Douglas Sirk too could be criticized for his contributions to the Nazi machine. Filmmakers like Fritz Lang and Billy Wilder a screenwriter at the time bailed out of Germany upon Hitler's rise to power while directors like Ernst Lubitsch and F.W. Murnau were already working in America. But Sirk didn't leave at least not right away. For a time he stayed and worked for UFA and by extension for the Nazis. That being said in 1937 after this film and one more he finally left Germany supposedly because of political sentiments and because of his Jewish wife. It's also worth noting that when he got to America he made Hitler's Madman and overtly antiNazi film.To New Shores stars Zarah Leander a Swedish singer who apparently was Germany's biggest star actress during the Nazi years and this her first film with UFA was evidently the film that propelled her to stardom along with Sirk's next film La Habanera which also starred Leander. Admittedly it's a strong performance. She does quite well.Interestingly the propaganda in this film is actually minimal all things considered. I found myself surprised that the Nazi government let a film be produced with so little propaganda value. Of course it was 1937 and the war hadn't begun yet but still there's not much here in terms of propaganda. The film is a criticism of social injustice like much of Sirk's work seems to be All That Heaven Allows is the main example that comes to mind though as I said I haven't seen many of his films. Presumably in order to get the film past the censors Sirk had to set the film in England and so all the characters are English despite speaking German. As a result the social injustice and cultural decadence depicted in the film can be seen as a criticism of English society specifically which I'm sure is what the censors were counting on when they passed the film. I do not think however that this is how Sirk intended the film to be interpreted. I think Sirk was concerned with social injustice in general and if anything in Germany specifically although he could obviously never convey that kind of message under the strict regulation of the Nazi censors. Nevertheless much of the cultural criticism in the film has far more implications for Germany than it does for England and the prison camp to which the female protagonist is sent will inevitably evoke associations with Nazi concentration camps during the war.Watching To New Shores I was reminded very much of Roberto Rossellini's 1942 film A Pilot Returns. Both films were made in collaboration with the fascist government that ran their respective countries. Furthermore the films are very similar in style and tone. To New Shores has much less in common with the German cinema of the '20s and even early '30s than it does with for instance the concurrent French poetic realism films by directors like Marcel Carn Jean Renoir and Julien Duvivier.Overall it's a quality film with solid entertainment value and a fairly engaging narrative. I never expected that UFA would have churned out a real film like this in the years just before the war. In comparison to Sirk's later work in Hollywood To New Shores lacks both the stylized aesthetic and the intense melodrama that marked those films. It's definitely a melodrama but it's more subtle and understated than films like All That Heaven Allows and Magnificent Obsession. It's not great cinema but it's a respectable effort that is probably well worth the watch.RATING 6.67 out of 10 stars";

Of course you know what's going to happen by the end but the movie is entertaining and the obviousness doesn't matter.  I heard that Tracy wouldn't play in this on stage which seems a shame as he's so good on the screen as the cranky scientist taking up residence in Hepburn's cellar. Hepburn is fabulous as ever and the brittle widow is a perfect part for her. Of course no one who marries in the movies 'without love' stays that way. If they did we wouldn't have had these kind of movies in the golden age of Hollywood!".

Ball's delivery is priceless.Hollywood didn't know what to with Morison for most of her films either B movies or small parts in A movies in fact her fabulous role in Kiss of Death was cut by the censors. Instead she became a tremendous musical stage star on Broadway and in London her best role being Kate in Kiss Me Kate. At this writing she's 96 and still with us.An entertaining film good watch.".

Instead there were too many other uninteresting people involved here and there was too much running in and out through doors like in a drawing room comedy on the theater stage. The whole movie is carried by the two leads Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. I like it that Hollywood already in the 1940s could make a love story with leads who were no longer young especially that the woman is no longer young and who did not have the traditional perfect handsomepretty looks but instead more individual looks. The couple makes the movie worth watching once in spite of all its shortcomings.".

Based on Philip Barry's play Katharine Hepburn who starred in the show on Broadway recruited her offscreen sweetheart Spencer Tracy to act in the film adaptation. They play intellectual patriotshe's a government scientist and she's his assistantwho get along quite nicely as friends but aren't interested in romance. Because of logistics during wartime Kate gets the bright idea that it would be easier if they married so he can continue his important experiments and she gives a hilarious nervous monologue proposing a marriage without love.The Hays Code didn't allow double beds in a bedroom or for an unmarried couple to lay down next to one anotherone person's feet had to be always on the ground. Without Love was pretty daring for its time since it stretched the boundaries and filmed some pretty risqu bedroom scenes using the excuse that Spencer Tracy's character was a chronic sleepwalker. To modern audiences those scenes might seem a little silly but try and imagine how it felt seeing them in 1945!While this isn't my favorite TracyHepburn pairingthat award goes to Adam's Rib and Guess Who's Coming to Dinnerit's definitely worth watching. They're awfully cute together in this one and the romance doesn't include constant bickering like some of their other films. It's nice to see them actually get along plus Felix Bressart Kennan Wynn Gloria Grahame and Lucille Ball round out the supporting cast nicely.".

Because of logistics during wartime Kate gets the bright idea that it would be easier if they married so he can continue his important experiments and she gives a hilarious nervous monologue proposing a marriage without love.The Hays Code didn't allow double beds in a bedroom or for an unmarried couple to lay down next to one anotherone person's feet had to be always on the ground. Without Love was pretty daring for its time since it stretched the boundaries and filmed some pretty risqu bedroom scenes using the excuse that Spencer Tracy's character was a chronic sleepwalker. To modern audiences those scenes might seem a little silly but try and imagine how it felt seeing them in 1945!While this isn't my favorite TracyHepburn pairingthat award goes to Adam's Rib and Guess Who's Coming to Dinnerit's definitely worth watching. They're awfully cute together in this one and the romance doesn't include constant bickering like some of their other films. It's nice to see them actually get along plus Felix Bressart Kennan Wynn Gloria Grahame and Lucille Ball round out the supporting cast nicely.";

Tracy is a renowned scientist in Washington and unable to find a hotel crashes at the pad of Keenan Wynn's whom he helps get home while drunk. Wynn is engaged to nasty socialite Patricia Morison who exemplifies everything that Tracy hates about women. But he meets his match in Hepburn who is as antifemale as Morison is female. Toss in feisty Lucille Ball as a self proclaimed bad girl whom Tracy hits it off with from the start proving that men and women can be buddies.This is a prewomen's liberation comedy that takes the battle of the sexes to another level after Tracy and Hepburn's conflicts of Woman of the Year. All of the archetypes of the female species are there from the nastiness of Morison's socialite to Ball's good old gal up to Hepburn's sensible but fun loving earth mother. Even the crotchety housekeeper gets a certain archetype as well. Hepburn was delightfully independent in life never intruding in on Tracy's real life marital situation but standing by him when he really needed her. In this their friendship transfers over to their characters who decide to marry simply for partnership and common interests but find that they really can't live without love.Returning to the world of Philip Barry after both Holiday and The Philadelphia Story Hepburn joins Tracy who played this role on Broadway. MGM hit gold a third time with a popular team after the box office intake of the PowellLoy and RooneyGarland teams.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow! A movie with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn! But don't too excited! Who directed? Harold S. Bucquet no less. Bucquet started off as an assistant director way back in 1922 then graduated to shorts in 1935 and finally to features with Young Dr. Kildare in 1938. He died on February 13 1946 so Without Love was his last fling. At its best Without Love is moderately entertaining but alas it's at its least interesting when Tracy and Hepburn are on screen  thanks partly to Bucquet's rigorously dull direction with its long static takes. And partly to a rather odd screenplay by Donald Ogden Stewart which delivers all its brightest and most lively lines to the support cast particularly Lucille Ball and Keenan Wynn! Admittedly Tracy does deliver a few bright comebacks. But that's about all we can say on the plus side. Production values are rigorously Bgrade and it's hard to believe that Karl Freund was in charge of photography. To sum up Without Love is an A feature with B production values.".

His secretary a temp named Colette is completely the opposite to Florence. But in her physical unattractiveness Bernard finds a refuge to his peculiar dilemma. Despite of what may seem as a logical explanation he is not plagued by an inferiority complex. What drives Bernard is the psychological force of the middleage crisis. Some people wonder whether  what they have is as good as it gets. Bernard actually knows that. The second he is near Florence he knows that that is true gazes of his friends reassure him in that.With Colette however he feels completely at ease. There is no need for selfassertion and he is free to choose. Naturally there is much more to this film which is full of  surprises and unexpected events.  The only country where such a complex and somewhat surrealistic plot could have been brought to life where careful avoidance of turning the film into a soap opera a pointless comedy or a tedious drama meets with the bittersweet taste of love and desire is France and the philosophy of love the satire and the superb acting   Depardieu Bouquet and Balasko make a lovely team  are also typically French here.

These thoughts can be disorienting since Mr. Blier employs a non linear style to present his tale. Thus the film loses a bit of its immediacy for the viewer that might not be paying attention to what is being said at any particular moment.By juxtaposing an actor that is the antithesis of handsomeness Gerard Depardieu against the exquisitely gorgeous Carole Bouquet Mr. Blier achieves a coup because we are trained to believe that only beauty can bring happiness. The plain Colette being played by Josiane Balasko is a strong presence in the movie. She achieves all what she set out to do in making Bernard a slave because she understands him intellectually as well as sexually.The film evidently came and went without much fanfare. Paying a visit to this beautifully photographed film by the great Philippe Rosselot will delight fans of Bertrand Blier. It also helps that the director has included some sublime music by Franz Schubert in the background.".

The three main actors were excellent. Carole Bouquet asking Are there any more questions? while having dinner with friends was just sidesplitting. Josiane Balasko acts her part as the lovesick woman well. Depardieu as usual is an excellent mixture of his vulnerable and tough guy self.The cinematography was first class and the music score resplendent.

Depardieu as usual is an excellent mixture of his vulnerable and tough guy self.The cinematography was first class and the music score resplendent. Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this film to any lover of international cinema and surrealistic films.";

It sounds like fun but anyone expecting a lightweight romantic farce will be disappointed to find something closer to an intellectual exercise in style designed around an exaggerated sense of melodrama and several odd operatic gestures characters thinking out loud in public or engaging in thirdperson soliloquies and so forth.

Some of them have divided French public due to their shocking contents notably Les Valseuses 1974. Trop belle pour toi appears like an exception in his work. It means that taste of Blier for provocation is less pronounced. However it doesn't make the movie better for all that. It doesn't work for several reasonsfirst it's hard to follow the plot because Blier introduces sequences that are earlier or subsequent to the present scene. For example we realize too late that Colette  Balasko after she left Bernard married with a man and she had children. The movie ignores certain sequences that are however essential to the development of the plot.Then the movie irritates due to its main characters it goes without saying that dialogs are the key to the good development of the plot. But here you are under the impression that the characters don't exchange their words. They're talking in the emptiness and don't seem to care about the others' opinion!Let's add that the movie sometimes creates a certain boredom because of some lifeless sequences that drag on notably during dinners in Depardieu's ravishing house with his wife  Bouquet and all their guests.In short trop belle pour toi is a cold and no soul movie and it left me unsatisfied in spite of good ideas in the making  Cluzet who expresses his anger with Schubert's music in the background played very loud. Even a trio of outstanding actors don't succeed in saving the movie.Remark Carole Bouquet won an Oscar in France in 1990 for her performance in this movie. Good for her.".

But these soldiers are badly led and totally reluctant to carry out their duty. Theyd rather  frag  their commander and go home than earn medals . And war isnt shown as a glorious thing  its brutal  dehumanising and most of all terrifying.  Also watch out for the very humane portrayal of the enemy officer. Is it sympathy for the Japanese or the Vietnamese that hes shown this way ?I could point out all the things I love about this film but itd take too long. The only two things I disliked about TOO LATE THE HERO  was a couple of plot holes. First ones the fact that the Japanese are good at stopping the enemy from escaping the jungle but are totally hopeless at letting them enter it in the first place ! A major strategic mistake Id have thought. Secondly Lawson decides he wants to carry out his mission after all which turns him into a bit of a cliche. But dont let that put you off.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a personal one for me. I was a high school student at George Dewey H.S. Subic Bay Philippines from 196870. My buddies and I were extras in the movie when it was made out there. We would cut classes and our principal would come out to the movie set to take our names down. We got in trouble when we got back but this was a once in a lifetime deal. We were paid 12 a day. It was cheaper to use offduty sailors and marines as well as the high school guys as extras than to pay for extras to be flown in from the U.S. We picked up buses from various parts of the base early in the morning and were taken to the naval magazine where the movie was being filmed. We were out from 600 A.M. to about 400 P.M. I remember the prop people built this fantastic set with huts and a fake stone church that was used as the Colonel's headquarters. It was nicer than the huts the Filipino people lived in and they wanted to keep them after the movie was finished. They had to be torn down though because of insurance purposes. They had brought these British Army uniforms for us to wear but they were new and looked too good so they ran over them with trucks to give them a rough look. To this day I remember many wild times on the set. Once when Cliff Robertson arrived at the base and was in the Colonel's headquarters the director Mr. Aldridge yelled at myself and a buddy because we were playing our acoustic guitars too loudly on top of the fake stone church and it could be heard during the scene. I guess Hendrix music was not around in WW2. Another time between takes Michael Caine and his buddies were on the steps of a building and he started to sing Hey Jude by the Beatles. Everyone sang along. It was great and to this day whenever I hear that song it takes me back to that great time! that was 37 years ago One of the side actors brought along his girlfriend and she ran around on the beach in her bikini. That was indeed a great sight as sailors marines and high school kids took breaks from the set to hang out on the beach. I remember meeting the British actor with the broken nose who was in Flight of the Phoenix with Jimmy Stewart. He was in the movie and seemed to be a nice guy. A Philippine patrol boat parked at the beach dock. They were kind enough to let us dive off their boat into the water during lunch breaks. Some of the guys earned 18 a day by lying in an open field being dead bodies. These were the soldiers from the movie who were shot by the Japanese snipers. There was a fire on the set one day and shooting had to be stopped. They repaired the set and the movie went on. Parts of the movie were shot near our base hospital on the mountain at Cubi Point in the jungle. These were the scenes where the commando team was in the jungle on the mission. The movie people would party at the Officer's Club at Cubi. It was not well received by all the officers. The movie guys had long hair and dressed very casually and the marine fighter pilots did not care for this group. I did not hear of any fights though. My buddy next door to our quarters had Michael Caine and some others over for a home cooked dinner. It was well received. It was a great time to be in the Philippines back in those days. After we finished our tour out there we went back to a naval base at Pax River Maryland. I went up to New York to visit my aunt and she took me to see the movie. It was pretty good. I especially enjoyed it since I could see all my buddies walking around in the background with rifles or just hanging out. It was a great movie and I must say it was filmed in the real jungle setting with snakes and all. No Hollywood backset here!".

No extras included except for the trailer but the movie alone is in my view a tiny masterpiece and well worth the effort.By the way if you're looking for a similar movie forget it. It's the only one in its genre. Think about it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Too Late the Hero is a cynical war adventure with a set of rather unsavoury antagonistic characters caught in an unforgiving hot  environment where they risk being embushed at any time by Japanese soldiers.  It manages to stay interesting for two hours until building up into a fabulous exciting finale.  Not a big soldiers action film like The Dirty Dozen or Platoon Too Late the Hero is nevertheless my favourite of the genre although it took a couple of watchings to appreciate the simple yet original intelligent plot development the realistic yet interesting and even at times amusing dialogue and characters for instance Caine telling Robertson in his cockney accent now what's got you jumping about like a frog with a bullet up his ass.. and the suspenseful and wellmade action sequences.  It is not always easy for this kind of film to retain a kind of unsentimental realism and be entertaining at the same time.  Yet Too Late the Hero does it.  While they are not particularly sympathetic characters there are none in the film except maybe for the Japanese major Cliff Robertson and Michael Caine manage to become likeable antiheroes in their own way each giving excellent performances American Robertson wondering what the hell he is doing among a rough bunch of Brits fighting the Japanese on a Pacific island until he decides to find his destiny as a hero and Caine as a brash cynical rude insubordinate and altogether hilarious cockney mainly concerned about saving his skin.  Too Late the Hero does not dwell into making an elaborate antiwar statement.  It takes for granted that war is hell and any sane man would just worry about surviving like Caine Robertson or most of the other soldiers on an increasingly suicidal mission  not as the leader of the group brilliantly played by Denholm Elliott who appears suspect and foolish for trying to maintain traditional combat values and discipline.  The interactions between Robertson and his unfriendly British companions add to the interest and credibility of the film while the unusual chase through the jungle and its exciting conclusion contribute to its originality. Not the best war film ever but a unique one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Too Late the Hero is directed by Robert Aldrich who also cowrites the screenplay with Lukas Heller and Robert Sherman. It stars Michael Caine Cliff Robertson Henry Fonda Ken Takakura Denholm Elliott Lance Percival Ronald Fraser and Ian Bannen. Music is by Gerald Fried and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc.Lawson Cliff Robertson is an American naval officer who specialises in Asiatic languages thus he is sent to a Pacific island to assist a group of British soldiers on what seems a routine mission. The mission is to simply knock out the Japanese army's key transmitter but as the men get deeper into the jungle terrain it becomes obvious that the odds of survival are minimal at best. With inner fighting escalating and a hostile enemy closing in fast it's a time for heroes to be born and friendships to be laid bare.Often and wrongly considered a weak attempt by Aldrich to cash in on the success of his Dirty Dozen movie three years earlier Too Late the Hero had been written some ten year previously. Although some way away from the gutsy grandeur and bulging biceps of The Dirty Dozen TLTH is still a potent war movie. Often claustrophobic in mood and acerbic in war character observations film holds narrative attention from first reel to last. Bursts of violence drift in and out of the plot to keep things on the boil but it's the excellently drawn characterisations of the major players that stops this from merely being another run of the mill insanity of war movie. It's also nice to find the Japanese are portrayed as an intelligent foe and not the irksome machine gun fodder so rife in other films of the ilk. It helps to have Takakura turning in a stoic performance as part of the latter too.Some other astute reviewers has given this film a tag line of it being a unique war film not a truer line has been typed on the internet forums. This film tho not bringing anything new by way of the psychological aspects of men under duress always remains a thoroughly engrossing picture. Helmed by the criminally undervalued Aldrich film boasts a ream of excellent performers making it unique by bringing to life a screenplay that's not pandering to any conformity's of the genre it relies totally on strength of dialogue and character formations to capture our interest. Really the only charge from dissenters that might stick here is that it's arguably just another Vietnam allegory that the 70s seemed intent on giving us. Arguably mind.It's a bloody suicide mission!That the cast list contains Michael Caine brilliant here with gritty swagger Cliff Robertson Denholm Elliott and a barely used Henry Fonda is of obvious interest from the start but the ace card in Too Late The Hero's pack is with its supporting players Ian Bannen Harry Andrews Ronald Fraser and a serious turn from comedy specialist Lance Percival where all of them in the sweltering confines of the Phillipines location manage to pull the viewer into the mix and fully realise the crispness of Aldrich's excellent screenplay aided superbly by Biroc who manages to convey via his photography some apt sweaty jungle madness. Yes! This is not a film for those wanting guns a blazing at every turn it's simply not that type of GungHo picture those bursts of action while hitting hard are swamped by the focused action of the human mind at work the kind where greed mistrust and a basic survival instinct are the order of the day.The setup of the two opposing armies on this island is a bit daft so some suspension of logic is needed from the off while there's no escaping the fact that there are a number of war movie clichs within. Yet this is still potent stuff a film with things to say and corrosive in its telling. Making for once the negativity of such material still a rewarding viewing experience. 810".

Previously having done the 'Dirty Dozen' a hard act to follow a kind of 'Motley Crew' in came this film.A group as I say of misfits though not criminal are pitted with a neurotic officer played well by Denholm Elliott with American Lieutenant Cliff Robertson the obligatory American to get the 'States audience to watch it one would imagine Just like his star part in 633 Squadron along with the annoying but definitely watchable role for Michael Caine one of his best in my opinion even though it's not a million miles away from his true cockneyed accent! Nor the kind of parallel with the great film 'The Long and the Short and the Tall' with Laurence Harvey playing the loudmouth.The plan is thus for the groupplatoon to eliminate a Japanese radiocommunications station on the 'other side' of the Pacific island they both occupy. The jungle terrain of the interior is brought to life with the atmosphere of the sweat and later blood throughout the film as the platoon battle forward.Robertson's Lieutenant is quite an eyeopener too. Much like the reluctant William Holden's 'officer' in the 'Bridge Over the River Kwai' although he's not a 'fake officer' like that part he's still an incredible workshy lazy enjoying the sun sea etc as he's had the cushy job of only getting his commission due to the fact he's an interpreter. Now he has a rude awkening as being an interpreter with regards to this Japanese radio problem he's dutybound for his talent to accompany the platoon into the interior of the island and with a gun. The nice thing about his role is that although we had the impression his 'cush gig' is over he actually makes a fine officer with tactics and strategy etc all along being at odds with Caine Pte Hearne and the 'off his rocker' Hornby. Elliott As Hornby cops out Robertson makes good. Hearne takes on as platoon medic making sarcastic and insulting but sometimes valid comments all the way. He's got about as much class as a syphillitic roadsweeper! he says about one of his compadres! The platoon are also made up of some great British character actors putting in fine performances too. Ian Bannen as the Scots roughneck but keeping the likes of the slimy equally excellent Ronald Fraser in line is worth watching and of course the great Percy Herbert. Although some on IMDb have said they found the scenes too talky I think they had this mix of action and words just right.The memorable scenes are the opener which shows the remnants of the first platoon in the film 'coming in' across a wide opening from the jungle trying to beat their Japanese pursuers to their lines exhausted bedraggled and zigzagging to avoid the Jap machine gun fire whilst all along their Brit chums on their line are shouting them on to get across. This is also where the film ends with the remnants of this present platoon and quite a shock twist. We see the only remaining members making for their lines and not knowing who is going to make it  the two that do are Caine and Robertson. Harry Andrews as the CO is then seen looking down at the only surviving platoon member  and lo and behold it's Caine who gets up. All along I was thinking obviously the American is going to make it but I was glad it was Caine  not because I am British or biased but because I didn't think it was the typical ending I expected. Perhaps some Americans may say the same about Caine as he's British and it was a British platoon I don't know. But it was an enjoyable film all the same and one of the best as I have said lesserknownpublicised WW2 flicks.".

A minor problem was the occasional mumbling.One of the things I liked here is that there was a more realistic way of looking at World War II. In recent decades we've had U.S. liberals and other clueless Leftists tell us how valid and noble that war was as opposed to other wars that came later that were supposedly totally immoral unclean nasty and vile. However there is no such thing as a pure or sanitized war. The lack of discipline morality and even courage among some of the British troops in this film is a refreshing break from the kind of silly overglorification of WW II  especially the way this stands in contrast to the overvilification of wars fought by America in the decades after that.Judging by Caine's memories from his autobiography related to filming TLTH a documentary on the making of the film would have been fascinating to watch.".

It's rare to find this many good character actors in one movie.I didn't realise as I watched but apparently Too Late The Hero is meant to be an allegory for America's war against Vietnam. Trying to draw parallels between Vietnam and WWII really doesn't work.Despite a vehement antiwar streak the movie seems to delight in its action sequences almost daring us to cheer as the nominal bad guys get shot or blown up.It's this inconsistency in tone that destroys Too Late The Hero. What point is the film trying to make? Is Denholm Elliot's character a cowardly villain or a shotaway crazybrave hero? Why does Cliff Robertson's character refuse to accept a simple change of plan at a crucial moment? Is he a coward or a bythebook officer? Why does Michael Caine's character alternate between antiauthority and gungho heroics? What quite simply is Ronald Fraser's character's problem? If he's that much of a coward surely he'd have found a more effective way of invaliding himself by now? What makes Lance Percival's character follow a murderous and cowardly comrade into a Japanese trap? There are too many questions going unanswered even before the film's 5050 Chance of Survival finale. If you're looking for a more realistic portrayal of British soldiers fighting in South East Asia during WWII watch the 1961 BW film The Long and The Short and The Tall. If you're looking for a more realistic portrayal of American troops in Vietnam the choice is endless. Too Late The Hero was recently given away as a free DVD with a UK newspaper which gives a good indication of how lame it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few war movies have been made in which the lead actors play characters who are reluctant to be in the military or to take on their assignments. Not only are they not heroes but they seem almost unpatriotic. We viewers including those of us who are veterans can understand that no one in his right mind truly wants to be in combat. But that doesn't mean one is a coward. A healthy dose of fear is not only common but natural. Survival in war isn't a matter of patriotism or not. Most of the time men in combat follow orders because they must. There aren't other good choices. So it's not very common to see or hear outright backtalk by men in combat. There also have been a few movies in which whole units or groups of combatants appear very lax and near to the point of insubordination. At that point the ability of leaders to hold units together becomes precarious. Other than for comedies or spoofs of military life most war films have not had such lax settings of troops. Too Late the Hero is an exception to both of these situations. Cliff Robertson plays Lt. Sam Lawson who as a Japanese language specialist enjoys a life of ease and insubordination well behind the front lines in the Pacific. He is sent on a mission to an island occupied both by British and Japanese forces. The two forces have a sort of demilitarized zone between them. The British camp is under Col. Thompson played by Harry Andrews. It is a lax operation but capable of springing into action at a notice. Lawson is the only Yank in this bunch and is assigned to a squad of men who are to knock out a Japanese radio station. There's a little more to it than that. But the squad consists of several wisecracking in fighting and unenthusiastic Brits. They are capable but they don't like being there or going on missions. Denholm Elliott plays Capt. Hornsby who is in charge of the mission. Michael Caine is the costar of the film and plays an enlisted medic Pvt. Tosh Hearne. A host of good supporting actors makes up the rest of the members of the squad and some other Brits at the camp. The plot and script of this film are very good. The antagonism among the men is very interesting. One wouldn't expect it among comrades during a precarious combat situation. To say more about the story as it unfolds would lessen its enjoyment for viewers. Although the bickering and insubordination seem unbelievable at times this movie has some very good drama. And the action is very good. The filming location in remote areas of the Philippine Islands lends authenticity to the movie.This film gives a decent portrayal of jungle combat which was a hallmark of the Pacific theater of operations during WW II. The other hallmark was the number and breadth of naval engagements including aircraft. Too Late the Hero has the production quality top acting and story that makes it a good film to have in any war movie library.".

In two of the battle scenes the bulk of the men line up unarmed in a big row and stand around while the Japanese shoot at some men running across open terrain from the cover of bushes.  A few men in weapon pits fire back with machineguns and mortars but by and large the rest of the men just stand there doing nothing while the two guys running in get blasted.  Say nothing of the fact that they were lined up for the Japanese to drop some mortar fire back on them they certainly could have done something to save the men from the Japanese outside.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt that this film was sort of a backhanded antiVietnam war flick. Nor do I believe that portraying the average GI Joe or Tommy Aikens as anything less than a hero some sort of evil traitorous Commie thing to do like the legions of today's right wing media carpersbottom feeders would have you believe. Nor do I mind when filmmakers use composite battles or blow some minor engagement out of proportion. Also in war movies it is usually easy to see them use weapon props that were not available at that time like using Walker Bulldog or Patton tanks in a World War 11 movie. That happens a lot cause the big props like currently used ships tanks trucks guns etc. are usually provided by the Pentagon for next to nothing they will even dig up vintage uniforms so the real troops will look authentic extras. Of course if you see a jet fighter in a WW l movie or an automatic rifle in a Civil War movie that is a little too much. What irked me about this movie is the lack of any plausibility in the first place. The action starts on an island that is half held by the British and the other half by the Japanese. There is a big no man's land between the two forces where patrols have to run a gauntlet to return to their lines while the garrison looked on almost indifferently as their men get cut down by the Japanese. This in the spring of 1942 when the Japs had just driven the British out of Burma and Malaysia and the US out of the Philippines and other Pacific possessions. His scenario is more reminiscent of some World War I meme where the British and the Germans would coexist more or less peacefully along some quiet sector of the front exchanging shots insults and occasionally declaring a truce to trade for tobacco and tea. All that is crap. The Japanese in such a situation would either attack until they drove the British out or killed them or the British would have to do the same to them until every last Jap soldier was dead. The Japanese would either fight to yours or his death PERIOD in every case!Also there was some AngloAmerican rivalry to the point of sabotage. Really? this was England's lowest point in the war and almost anyone Englishman could see that America's entry into the war meant ultimate victory at a reasonable cost for both countries. There was absolutely no way the British could have done it without us. Sure there was some rivalry on a high command diplomatic level between our two nations. But as alliances go. the AngloAmerican alliance was one of the most successful of all times and most ordinary soldiers felt positive about it. I don't think any British soldier would be so contemptuous that he would intentionally sabotage or withhold information that would help the Americans unless he was a total psychopath especially after all the help we gave the British before we were officially at war. Judging from Aldrich's famous Dirty Dozen the ultimate template for all bad boy rebel fighter movies he seems to think war is some big scam and the brass and regular forces are a joke. And the real experts and heroes are all hoodlums straight from death row. This is an example of the right attitude for those rebel bad boy times but it is a reality buster of the first magnitude. Wars are won by plodding brass hats leading average not too heroic or talented guys into big battles that don't work out perfectly but are not all Petersburg 1864Flanders 1917 bloodbaths either. The fighting scenes didn't impress me too much and the hassles of the Japanese setting up loudspeakers to spook the fleeing allied soldiers on the march through a jungle is really silly. However the acting was pretty good and some of the characters were interesting for this was a character driven movie to say the least. But its cynical abuse of history and it's dog eat dog portrayal of our troops in battle just strikes me as plain wrong and totally misanthropic. But maybe after Iraq our other misadventures of recent it seems a hair more plausible.".

	schema:headline " Uneven WWII Drama seems more like a Vietnam Morality Play";
	schema:reviewBody "Veteran director Robert Aldrich tried to rework the success of The Dirty Dozen with a blatantly antiwar remake Too Late the Hero. Unfortunately an able cast is wasted in this very antiwar effort which plays out more like an antiVietnam allegory than a tale of wartime heroics.In the spring of 1942 American Lt. Lawson Cliff Robertson Up from the Beach sits lazily on a Pacific island doing everything possible to avoid hazardous duties. Captain Nolan Henry Fonda in a onescene cameo disrupts his comfort with a hazardous assignment. Lawson is flown to the New Hebrides for a cooperative mission with the British. We find that the British hold one end of the island the Japanese hold the other. Lawson and a patrol will penetrate enemy territory to destroy a vital radio station.At first the film seems utterly predictable. Lawson is a type we've seen before  an unlikely soldier who redeems himself heroically by the final act. But with the introduction of the English characters and their Japanese counterparts all audience expectations are shattered. Captain Hornsby Denholm Elliott the unit commander proves to be a bungling  and homosexual  idiot and the men have no faith in him. Pvt. Hearne Michael Caine Play Dirty is obviously dissatisfied with Hornsby's indecisive leadership and after his incompetence results in unnecessary deaths Hearne breaks into an open rebellion. Before long the mission goes downhill and Lawson and Hearne find themselves united in a mutual struggle for survival behind enemy territory.Aldrich alltooclearly means to convey a heavyhanded message that war is bad  very bad. He's got several points to make officers are corrupt coldblooded incompetents. In one scene Hornsby is seen to shoot wounded prisoners without flinching. In the past typical Japanese characters have been portrayed universally as evil murderous dogs. Here Aldrich tries far too hard to humanize them. First he introduces a sympathetic Japanese character Major Yamaguchi Ken Takakura in the second half of the film. Yamaguchi is tall handsome and compassionate  even though he is taunting the fleeing Allied soldiers over loudspeakers spread throughout the jungle. He urges them to surrender promising good treatment  and seems utterly sincere. Secondly Aldrich makes the English out as the villains. Pvt. Campbell Ronald Fraser is a coward who runs from battle but also loots the bodies of dead soldiers  both English and Japanese. He stirs up dissension and even murders one of his own men who won't cooperate with an attempt to surrender to the Japanese.Please don't misunderstand me. I am not trying to say that all of the Allied troops were heroes or saints as many historians and movie makers will try to tell you. Nor do I believe every Japanese soldier was a murderous villain. I tend to oppose war and find it utterly despicable  there are good men and bad men on both sides some enjoy the killing and some would prefer to be anywhere else but in combat. But Aldrich goes to ridiculous extremes to show imperfections among the Allies he nearly demonizes all of them in some way and makes the Japanese look for compassionate and friendly than most of them were. We're supposed to see Allied soldiers during WWII as substitutes for the American military during Vietnam and anyone will agree the two simply cannot be compared sidebyside. The ensemble cast is what holds this piece together. The actors are all very capable and seem sincere despite the lunacy of much of the script. Robertson seems a comfortable lead although Lawson's character is never totally fleshed out. As the film begins he's obviously a coward but steps into the role of leader far too easily in the second half. He doesn't seem to struggle with his previous notions of warfare or leadership his role has suddenly shifted without explanation. Robertson is so good though that this can be overlooked somewhat and is forgivable. As Hearne Caine is the real star of the film. He's just as cynical as Lawson but is open and blunt about it. He knows that Hornsby is incapable of leading and isn't afraid to point it out to him even if it means a threat of courtmartial. Throughout his arguments seem legitimate and Caine always come across as completely sincere. Finally Denholm Elliott is exceptionally fine as Hornsby. He doesn't seem to know his role as a leaderofmen too well and this often results in the deaths of his men and ultimately a botched mission.The jungle locations are beautifully photographed by cinematographer Joseph Biroc but never come across as particularly dark and foreboding. Here gory death and destruction takes place among beautiful trees ferns and flowers. Again this is a film meant as an antiVietnam statement and the jungle locations are a perfect setting.Unfortunately as I've repeated ceaselessly Too Late the Hero can't seem to decide supposed to be a movie about a jungle patrol in the New Hebrides in 1942 not a movie about a patrol in Cambodia in 1968. The social commentary on the Vietnam War is delivered too heavily and blatantly distorted. The characters garnish little sympathy and there is not enough action to keep the slow talkative pace flowing. As a drama it almost succeeds as the action spectacular the trailer claims it is barely serviceable. If you would like to see a wellmade moving film that uses WWII for an allegory on the Vietnam War and war in general see BEACH RED made in 1967. It's a much more evenhanded and a lot fairer than this piece  hands down.4  maybe 5 out of 10".

It's interesting to note that although the majority of the cast are British this film is actually American produced and from the same director who gave us The Dirty Dozen. It took a bit of getting used to! Michael Caine and Cliff Robertson lead a cast of established actors in a story concerning a suicide mission against the Japanese in the Asian jungle. The tension hardly lets up throughout as our heroes face overwhelming odds regarding success of their operation don't they usually?. Henry Fonda is wasted in a one scene appearance opposite Cliff Robertson at the beginning. An actor of Fonda's calibre should have been given more to do. The violence is quite graphic and the situation in general is hardly sugarcoated by any kind of glamour. It paves the way for some great action scenes along the way as Caine and company get themselves stuck in. Denholm Elliott  very effective as rather nervous characters  is memorable as the unhinged commanding officer. Thanks to him the whole situation with the Japanese becomes that bit more challenging  We have Harry Andrews bringing up the rear with his customary senior commanding officer role and he doesn't let the side down. Ian Bannen is very good as the hardedged private with a slightly manic aura  shades of Robert Shaw. I understand that the climax was filmed twice for the American and British film markets respectively. Personally I'm damn glad we got the latter climax. Robert Aldrich keeps a steady pace on the direction .".

Thanks to him the whole situation with the Japanese becomes that bit more challenging  We have Harry Andrews bringing up the rear with his customary senior commanding officer role and he doesn't let the side down. Ian Bannen is very good as the hardedged private with a slightly manic aura  shades of Robert Shaw. I understand that the climax was filmed twice for the American and British film markets respectively. Personally I'm damn glad we got the latter climax. Robert Aldrich keeps a steady pace on the direction .";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm filled with admiration for Robert Aldrichand Lukas Heller who cowrote the scriptthat he was able to craft such a delicately balanced film. I've never seen a war film with the same unique tone as Too Late the Hero.The film starts with music from Gerald Fried that doesn't reveal anything about the plot the audience doesn't yet know if they're in for a comedy drama or sarcastic commentary. The visual is equally as startling on an island in the South Pacific soldiers are literally laying out on the beach working on their tans. A very bronze Cliff Robertson is summoned to his superior Henry Fonda and given a new assignment which he promptly refuses. He clearly has a callous attitude about his part in the war for he'd rather take his shore leave than accept his transfer to the Philippines. Henry Fonda delivers a very impassioned speech about seeing the bigger picture and he sends Cliff to the jungle.Cliff's apathetic attitude is met with a host of different personalities as he joins his British allies in his new post. Michael Caine is not optimistic that he'll make it out alive and oftentimes considers deserting Denholm Elliott is extremely gungho about the war effort Ian Bannen is a loose cannon and could be interpreted as not entirely well and Percy Herbert isn't particularly loyal. Their assignment is to enter the Japaneseoccupied jungle destroy the enemy's radio and return to the safe area.It's an extremely dangerous mission but when they first set off as Cliff gets to know his fellow soldiers the tone still balances the extremely fine line of not taking the war seriously and not making the situation comical. As they venture further into the jungle and start fighting the enemy the tone of the film grows darker. Every section of the film changes the tone from careless to ominous to hopeless to realistic and every section is properly motivated by an excellent script and constant obstacles.War films aren't for everyone and more often than notjust as in every genrethey're not very good. The good ones are worth watching and Too Late the Hero is excellent. Michael Caine fans are in for a treat since he's not only dreamy blond and in uniform but also gives a very good performance. And if there's anyone out there who thinks of Cliff Robertson as Spiderman's uncle they should rent this film to see him in his younger days. Watching this movie is an experience. You'll run through so many emotions that you'll be depleted by the time Ken Takakura shows up even with so much more of the film to watch. At that point it'll be hard to believe the film can and does get more suspenseful and finally when the ending has stripped you of all your energy you'll feel utterly exhausted. But then you'll probably tell your friends to go see it.".

Nigel Andrews in Monthly Film Bulletin.COMMENT The main impediment to a favorable review of Robert Aldrich's film is its length. It could be trimmed by at least 30 minutes to advantage. I would start in on Ronald Foster's part then I'd eliminate some of the closeups and needlessly repeated reaction shots in individual scenes and trim the long sequence of the microphone pursuit which despite Aldrich's commendable use of the sound track goes on for far too long. Fortunately the film comes to an exciting climax with its obstacle race across the plain and some of the photography here is absolutely breathtaking. In fact most of the film was obviously lensed on location. There is not even a single frame of stock footage  which is a pleasant and most agreeable surprise. But on the debit side the story is uncomfortably akin to an earlier Aldrich war movie The Dirty Dozen which has a more entertaining script and higher production values than this one. Also that film's cast was far more interesting. Despite his prominence in the credits Henry Fonda makes only a fleeting appearance and neither Cliff Robertson nor Michael Caine have a strong enough screen presence to overcome some of the weaknesses in their material  although they both make a game try. Admittedly reliable old Harry Andrews is back as the British C.O. and the rest of the players are competent but unfortunately lack the sort of sparkle the film needs.".

The plot has been Indianized the main events in the original happen in Monte Carlo and here they happen in Goa which is kind of the Monte Carlo of India. Several other aspects of the plot have been Indianized for example the two protagonists in the original are returning a lost dog in this they are returning a lost child. But several things are not changed at all including the character of the marriedformoney Paresh Rawal played by John Candy in the original the suave Casanova Upen Patel played by George Hamilton in the original and the inspector Akshaye Khanna played by Giancarlo Giannini.Despite having seen the original I found this version to be highly entertaining. Especially impressive was Shahid Kapoor who has excellent chemistry with Kareena. Akshaye Khanna does not have a very strong part but still tries very hard. Overall the movie does not disappoint.".

However he and Paresh Rawal have nothing new to offer in terms of their roles. In fact Item Girl Payal Rohtagi also gave a decent performance.The songs in this film save for the first one are probably the worst part of this film as they completely destroyed the flow of the film and were played when you least wanted it. In fact one could easily hear the collective sigh of the audience when yet another HIMMESBHAI song was played.The comedy is nothing special though a few scenes especially those involving the interrogation of the Suspects was hilarious. Some of the scenes even though they were predictable had me falling out my seat laughing.Also a really funny person throughout the movie was the Stupid Junior Cop who was Akshaye Khannas sidekick all his one liners were absolutely hilarious.The sets of this film were actually quite good although the crude labeling of the Casino was very annoying come one people are gambling inside we all know its a casino.Which brings us to Murder Mystery...the lesser said the better there were a dozen plot holes it was shoddily done and completely unimportant I'm sure almost no one in the audience cared who the killer was....hell it was so bad that the killer actually cracks a joke about the killing after being caught WTF.Save for the first ten minutes when this movie tries to be a thriller this movie is actually funny.A good comedy maybe even a spoofbut the obtrusive songs and the fact that this movie was not supposed to be comedy and a thriller affect its ratings.Watch this movie if you want to see a good comedy with the background of a murder mystery.PS maybe subhash ghai saw the box office of the recent comedies and repackaged this movie as a thriller to con us whatever be the reason this movie will definitely reflect negatively against him.".

That is the fatcat parasites who live in lavish settings in the resort city of Goa India. Gambling seems to be one of the main tools for separating fools from their money. As the film progresses one sees other means of separating the money exotic dancers gigolos corruption in the film industry and so on. Playboygigolo Rocky seems to be at the center of everything we'll see how long that lasts. He seems to enjoy staying with Sonia Chang at 36 China Town the addressname of her mansion.Meanwhile in Mumbai Raj made a music video which a director likes. However he blew his savings making it and no longer has the 1 million he needs to bribe the director to get a lead role. Priya thought she had a boyfriend interested in marrying her. Instead he wants from her father a couple of million to start a business if the business goes well perhaps another million will lead to a marriage.Priya and Raj after a rocky start 'adopt' a missing child in order to collect a 2.5 million reward. They just have to travel to Goa to collect it from the child's putative mother Mrs. Sonia Chang. Unfortunately for them the ultrawealthy Sonia gets murdered 60 minutes into the film.An alternate thread follows two hopeless gamblers through their ups and downs. Major losses goodsized wins bad blows to family fortunes are detailed. Sounds like possible homicide motives.Priya and Raj find 36 China Town. The lights are dim and the doors unlocked. Bad signs? They go in anyway. They discover the body. They call in the murder anonymously but Raj gets apprehended by Inspector Karan when he goes back to the scene. He manages for a bit to keep Priya and the baby out of it.Meanwhile one of the gamblers finds body parts in one of his suitcases. Great stuff. Priya gets noticed then arrested. The gambler and his wife get arrested when the body parts are discovered. Karan sorts things out. He finds the other gambler and asks to talk to his wife as well. Ah the construction of lies is such a convoluted thing! Kana arrests the second gambler as well.Kana lets his seven suspects go and tells them not to leave Chinatown's Silver Jubilee.Lovely ending. Three stars goes to four.ScoresCinematography 810 Pleasant to the eye for the most part. The reverse video passages seem both needless and repellent.Sound 410 Yikes major problems here. First the subtitles are absent in passages. Second where they are present they tend to be sixty or so frames lagging behind the video. Third conversations tend to have the hollow sound associated with badly miked actors.Acting 710 Reasonable. Liked the performance of Akshaye Khanna as I did in Aap Ki Khatir.Screenplay 710 Needs compression. The story does move along but has too much filler.Musical Numbers 710 Mixed bag. The single biggest reason I watch Bollywood films is the presence of good musical numbers. The dancing the vibrant singing the frequent humor and the goodhearted silliness are a treat. In this film though there is way too much use of audio filters that cancel out the quality of full frequency singing. The filtering delivers castrated mush the usual richness is defeated. It's like dropping back to 1960s audio quality. Some of the later ones were better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Talking about success of 36 China Town is also talking about repeated success of its directors duo Abbas Mustan who started off as directors in Hindi films more than 15 years ago with a flop Agneekaal 1990. Such a high success rate that is increasingly getting rare in the Hindi film industry is a miracle in itself. The reason that I can think of is with each of their film they reinvented themselves. Therefore in this musical masala thriller flick their audience not just getting a taste of a regular AbbasMustan stuff but something extra and therefore that bit of surprise element is always there. Like always their scripts are very ordinary and plot quite common but their presentation treatment and handling make all the difference. In this flick for example they crafted a thriller that is the core but as usual is not great and neither is their suspense but surely this is not a genre film and therefore they bring the elements of comedy the highlight of the film Romance Foottapping Music as well as sufficient skin show make all the difference. Therefore we have Kareena Payal Rohatgai Tanushree Dutta Ishaa Koppikar Sambhavana Sheth all displaying either their legs or their cleavage the male counterpart is taken care of solely by the modelturnedactor Upen Patel a confident debut though need to work hard on his dialog accent. Also direction flaws are galoreHow can a body of a 6 female be fitted into a luggage of 3? How can the same luggage thrown inside the AC. compartment of a running train that too from the train's window? how can two people see that a tunnel is approaching while traveling in the same train? and how come police not able to find passport of Kareena Kapoor at the murder site when someone has dropped it there. But come on how many of us really care for such silly logics? Dialogues by Anurag Prapanna  Jitendra Parmar definitely tickle your funny bone at places. Himesh Reshammiya is rocking here too with another hit soundtrack under his belt. Editing by AM's Bhai is crisp as usual. Imagine a whodunit flick which is treated in a lighter vein with lot of drama but no melodrama plus hardly any action is what makes this fare a surprising watchable stuff is all can be said about the film..".

Kareena and the rest of the female cast do well too and Upen fits the character well  not a bad attempt for a debut.the best part was the audience were intact within the movie as there were only 3 main sets  the casino 36 china town and the police station! outline story  shahid and kareena find a missing child and as they go to the house to deliver him the mother is murdered! all is not as it seems as 5 other footprints are found! which means there were 7 people involved... whose guilty and who's innocent?".

Upen Patel is OK.Direction pretty crisp.The suspense is built up nicely and the end is shocking.. some said disappointing but OK for me as i like the movie overall except for a brief 30 minute period of the start which made me squirm and desire to go home.

Giving a thrilling film is not easy and giving a thrilling film in a comic angle is like not possible at all. I have seen many thrilling films mystery thrillers but i have never seen a film like this before which satisfied me with thrilling segments and comedy as well. The director of this film is known for his work in many suspense thriller films such like Baazigar Ajnabee Humraaz and etc. They've established themselves as a best directing duo by these marvelous and outstanding films. Usually we can only expect suspense from them but this time they've tried something innovative. As i described before 36 china town is indeed a suspense thriller film but has mixed up with sublime comedies here and there. It tells a story about how several people have been mistakenly implicated in a murder plot which eventually gets solved by a smart cop. This film has a huge star cast and couple of actresses gave a guest roles in that. According to me i like the way of this film's screenplay because all necessary items have been included perfectly. Shahid makes a small role in this film so do kareena and other titular character however Paresh and Akshay did a great job in this film. the film could be able to deliver the proper recipes to audience since majority of the film has been handle by these talented actors. The reason why i say this is because comedy and mystery solving portions have been handled very well by paresh and akshay respectively. Plus points of this film  Amazing Screenplay Performances Songs thrilling segments.Minus Points  Some scenes are quite subtle which could have been little more obvious to the audience.Please go for it. Don't miss it. Have fun ride from top to bottom.".

The director duo has taken enough leeway on the part of the public to torture them with their newest offering. Also the films suspense does not thrust like a rapier which was common to their earlier movies like Baazigar Khiladi etc.The film just trundles along lacking the limpet like feeling a property which most of their earlier films possessed. They seem to have lost their sleight in making suspense films which they were considered masters once. The movie stands in complete shambles due to the fact of this duo not adding the right ingredients to the cauldron of film making. So a feeling of great felicity empowers you when this ordeal comes to an end.Considering the star cast Shahid and Kareena seem to be too much engrossed in themselves to act well. Also they shriek and shout to earsplitting decibels at the drop of a hat.Johny Lever and Paresh Rawal fail in their usual antiques of evoking laughter. Debutant Upen Patel seems just like any other model from the fashion world flaunting his six pack abs every now and then. The only saving grace of the film is the performance by Akshaye Khanna enacting the role of a detective with lan. Then we have Priyanka Chopra at the moribund end of the movie just to encourage some whistles form the front rows.The whole story drags along failing to arouse your alacrity at any instance and the scene where the dead body is found by Shahid and Kareena is total balderdash and the internecine quarrels of putting the blame on each other are totally childish.All and all the film is a tawdry show and is insipid in nature. The helmsmen have certainly taken the boat the wrong way. This one certainly serves as a punitive for people who have watched this movie and wont draw rewards form the film cognoscenti and certainly wont add good words to the directors repertoire.".

And the cover looks so ugly it is so dark and boring. I thought that this movie is probably just like the cover. It is actually better than some other movies which Shahid kapoor were in. I am rating this movie a 8 because it is better than some other silly Indian comedy movies. Some scenes actually made me laugh. At first I thought that the storyline is really good it reminded me of the movie death on the nile river it has the Agatha Christie kind of mystery. Then I got on here and read that this movie is actually just a copy of some other movies. So I should lower one point for it but since it is rated so low i am going to keep the 8 rating.Shahid Kapoor is really good his eyes alone can act. I wonder if he will become a big star if he gets an USA accent and comes to work in Hollywood. Anyway my favorite scene was when he and pyriya opened the suitcase in the police station their reactions were purely comical very funny. The other couple's reaction were also very funny.Indian movies tend to be long at least two hours long. If they cut the some unnecessary scenes and formed its own original story. This movie could be a hot hit. It combined hot dancing with a mystery which is quite unique. Hollywood hardly ever makes movies like that. The ending was a surprise to me I totally didn't expect the killer. I also like those cheesy pick up lines that Rocky uses".

The film hardly thrills and is more of a brainless comedy than a potboiler. The climax sucks to the core and there is no intelligent unraveling of mysteries. Bollywood is still in the infant stage in the arena of suspensethrillers and a few good ones that have been made so far  like Samay Sushmita Sen2003 never got an encouraging response.ACTING The only good thing that can be said about 36China Town is the above average acting. Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor though still young in Hindi cinema act with maturity and share impressive onscreen chemistry the couple are known lovebirds offscreen too!. Debutant Upen Patel is pure eyecandy but still needs to brush up his acting. Yet another downpoint of the film is that Upen's voice has been dubbed and the lipsync is imperfect. Paresh Rawal and Johny Lever do gross injustice to their comic talent though as an afterthought there are certain hilarious scenes in the film. Akshaye Khanna once again delivers a great performance. Its sad that after some damn good performances like Dil Chahta Hai Border Humraaz and this one the actor is still not sure of his place in Hindi cinema. Payal Rohatgi and Tanaaz Lal complete the acting cast. Payal would be better off displaying her wares at some cheap dance bar because the absence of ANY acting talent in her is conspicuous in the film. Tanaaz Lal looks refreshing and looks a part of the film.MUSIC Himesh Reshammiya comes out on top again with the track Aashiqui mein teri.....".

	schema:headline " Excellent Thriller Wonderfully Retro";
	schema:reviewBody "36 Hours is a beautifully made thriller about an American major captured by the Germans in World War II not long before DDay and who is drugged and made to age artificially so that when he wakes up he thinks five years have passed that the war is over and that the Americans won. A fake military hospital was made to convince him that this is so complete with fake newspapers reporting on the activities of President Wallace with references to the retired FDR vacationing happily in Warm Springs. The idea behind it all is to get the major to spill the beans about where the Allied troops were going to land in France indeed the major does know this and the Germans know he knows. In this respect the movie is based pretty much on fact. The Germans knew that there was going to be an Allied invasion of the Continent most likely in Francebut where? Most of the German high command expected the Allies to land in Calais but they weren't sure. Everything hinged on outfoxing the Allies so that the Germans would be prepared for what they knew was going to be a massive invasion. But back to the movie a friendlyseeming doctor excellently played by Rod Taylor explains to his patient quite convincingly how he came to lose five years of his life. The race is on to find out the truth only at first the major doesn't know it. He believes what the doctor tells him but the doctor has his problems too which is how to tactfully get the information he needs from his patient actually his captive without the major knowing it.James Garner is fine as the major so good in fact as to make me wonder why his movie career wasn't more successful. Eva Marie Saint is her usual dignified self as the love interest though I found her character once the truth is revealed about her background hard to believe. Taylor's doctor is much more interesting but alas gets less screen time. His character is ambiguous a GermanAmerican who has returned to his homeland where he has managed to get funds to do research and who is slowly but surely becoming disenchanted with his Nazi superiors. The movie works like a charm for its first roughly two thirds and then falls off somewhat near the end for reasons I won't give away. Overall though this is a very satisfying and somewhat neglected film. Though it doesn't appear to be made on a big budget it's very good in recreating the wartime mood and in this respect wonderfully retro. It probably seemed a bit oldfashioned when it came out when James Bond was all the rage but time has been kind to it and it plays better today than many of the more hip sexy movies of the Austin Powers sixties.".

	schema:headline " Wellmade absorbing wartime thriller with an intelligent plot.";
	schema:reviewBody "George Seaton had already written and directed the very impressive The Counterfeit Traitor when he turned his attention to this absorbing and cleverlyplotted thriller. Once again the film is set during WWII and once again Seaton weaves an exciting story against the backcloth of that intriguing and terrifying period of history.Major Jefferson Pike James Garner is an American intelligence officer who is kidnapped and drugged en route to Lisbon during the days approaching the DDay Landings. Pike's original mission before his capture was to pass on misleading information to the Germans intended to trick them into expecting the Allies to storm ashore at Calais rather than the actual intended target area of the Normandy beaches. When Pike awakens he is unknowingly in a secret compound in Bavaria and the DDay attack is still 36 hours away from actually taking place. He is told by disguised Nazi spy Major Walter Gerber Rod Taylor that the war is over and that he has been suffering from amnesiac lapses for the past six years. Gerber's plan is to convince Pike that the war ended years previously with Allied victory and that it is safe to reveal details about the DDay Landings.... details which would in fact be very useful to the German forces in the hours approaching the topsecret Allied attack.It is a very interesting plot and is wellhandled. Rod Taylor's performance as the slippery Nazi trickster is exceptionally good while Garner handles his slightly dull role as the hero with sensitive information which he is unsure about revealing with efficiency. The crisp black and white photography  unusual for a film made in the Technicolourobsessed '60s  adds to the film's verisimilitude and sense of period giving it a documentarylike feel. While the proceedings are stretched out to a rather lengthy 115 minutes the film doesn't become significantly tedious and manages to keep the viewer excited even though we know because of the reallife success of the DDay invasion that the audacious Nazi plot is doomed to fail. 36 Hours is a solid suspenseful yarn which should satisfy anyone who enjoys stories about wartime intrigue and audacious masquerades.".

	schema:reviewBody "This BW movie 36 Hours is now being repeated on digital TV quite regularly and I never tire of watching it. The WW II storyline written by Roald Dahl  Carl Hittleman is an odd one. It has to be one of the most implausible yet somehow believable tales ever to be thought up.A US hospital run by Nazi Intelligence has been set up in Germany to enable secrets to be winkled out from it's patients i.e. prisoners. The gimmick is that the inmates are led to believe that the war has been over for a number of years in favour of the Allies.The new arrival a certain Maj. Jefferson Pike James Garner is an Overlorder i.e. someone who is au fait with the plans of the forthcoming Normandy landings. After being kidnapped in Lisbon he is brought unconscious to the hospital and given necessary ageing treatment. On regaining consciousness he is told that he is suffering from amnesia and has been a hospital patient for years but he must now start remembering.A disguised Wehrmacht psychiatrist Maj. Walter Gerber an American born German but a good guy at heart Rod Taylor is given the task of unlocking the valuable knowledge. If he fails he and his hospital are for the chop.

	onyx:emotionText "This BW movie 36 Hours is now being repeated on digital TV quite regularly and I never tire of watching it. The WW II storyline written by Roald Dahl  Carl Hittleman is an odd one. It has to be one of the most implausible yet somehow believable tales ever to be thought up.A US hospital run by Nazi Intelligence has been set up in Germany to enable secrets to be winkled out from it's patients i.e. prisoners. The gimmick is that the inmates are led to believe that the war has been over for a number of years in favour of the Allies.The new arrival a certain Maj. Jefferson Pike James Garner is an Overlorder i.e. someone who is au fait with the plans of the forthcoming Normandy landings. After being kidnapped in Lisbon he is brought unconscious to the hospital and given necessary ageing treatment. On regaining consciousness he is told that he is suffering from amnesia and has been a hospital patient for years but he must now start remembering.A disguised Wehrmacht psychiatrist Maj. Walter Gerber an American born German but a good guy at heart Rod Taylor is given the task of unlocking the valuable knowledge. If he fails he and his hospital are for the chop. And the Allies will succeed in their invasion etc. etc. Anna Hedler his nurse and supposedly Pike's wife is an exconcentration camp internee Eve Marie Saint who will do anything not to be sent back.

The best kept secret of World War II was the exact date and location of the cross channel invasion into western Europe. As things get closer to DDay the Allies want to make sure the Nazis stay fooled right up to the end.Which is why Garner goes to Lisbon to check out a source at the German Embassy in neutral Portugal. But the Nazis have been watching him too. While in Lisbon he meets up with a Mr. Michael Finn at a hotel bar rendezvous which renders him unconscious and Garner is secretly flown to Germany.The nice things about 36 Hours is that some of the facts about the landings at Normandy are woven very nicely into an intricate espionage story. Incidentally some of the same facts that were used in another Garner classic film The Americanization of Emily but in a far more comic vein.What the Nazis have decided to do is trick Garner into revealing the plans for the imminent invasion. They've set up an elaborate facade of a US. Army Hospital in an occupied Germany in 1950 and when Garner wakes up they're going to convince him that the war is over and the allies have been victorious. They've even cooked up a love interest in Eva Marie Saint who is formerly a concentration camp inmate and like all of them will do anything to avoid going back.All this is the brainchild of German doctor Rod Taylor who is convinced that without the usual Nazi like methods Garner can be tricked into revealing vital information. Skeptical about the plan but willing to go along with it if it succeeds is SS major Werner Peters who played a lovely variety of Nazis in the Sixties. Of course when Garner does realize this is all a charade it becomes quite a three cornered cat and mouse game between him and Taylor and Peters. The SS has a tried and true motto they're skeptical in general about information not obtained under torture.36 Hours is a finely executed espionage and escape drama. The cast is at they're combined very best. But as good as the ones I've mentioned there is one stunningly droll performance by John Banner soon to become Sergeant Schultz on Hogan's Heroes. He plays a German version of Dad's Army and he's one of the older generation that hasn't bought into the Nazi way. He's the best in this fine film.".

But in some ways it's equal to it. The acting especially by the four main leads is first rate. It's convincing in a plot that takes some work to be convincing.

But then he gets kidnapped and the twists that follow are what make the movie. Garner gets better and better in his role playing the game several ways as it unfolds. At his side is Eva Marie Saint who is excellent even down to a fair middleEuropean accent. A charming and disarming German doctor played by Rod Taylor is key to this whole charade as he too plays two sides to a coin. The more severely obvious SS officer Werner Peters is brilliant and not a caricature and he represents the whole German evil machine circa 1944. Or is it 1950? Keep a grip on reality as you watch. There are some small subtle cues as you go. For one thing it's expected that most of the audience in 1965 still knew that DDay was Jun 6 1944. They will play with the date of that as if you know. And there was famously a delay due to rainy weather that shows up too.You might even watch a DDay classic like The Longest Day just to set the stage and get some broad facts if you feel gungho.

	schema:reviewBody "The story of a US major kidnapped in May 1944 by the Germans who try to trick him into believing that he has amnesia the war is over the Allies won and  by the way where and when will the DDay landings take place? The Germans have set up a fake hospital staffed by phony Americans and they rush the unconscious Major Pike James Garner there. He is attended by Rod Taylor a real doctor but wearing an American uniform and Eva Marie Saint his fake nurse and wife who has been chosen for the deception from among the inmates of Ravensbruck.The Germans have been very thorough. Alles in Ordnung. And they convince Garner for a day or two that the concocted story is true. Garner is sufficiently convinced that he spills the beans about the invasion. But he becomes suspicious and for some time exists in two zones Schrdinger's major. When he finally twigs to the con game he lies and tells them that he made up the Normandy story. Thereafter it gets kind of complicated.It's structured like a threeact play. Act I. We see Garner in his habitat in England going over the invasion plans with other officers. He is told he must meet his contact in Lisbon. He incurs an important paper cut while handling a map. Act II. The ersatz hospital where Rod Taylor explains everything for the thousandth time to the phony staff. Here we see Garner wake up and react to his amnesia. We then see the penny drop. Act III. An anticlimax in which Garner and Saint escape to Switzerland.It would have made a good Twilight Zone episode. As it is Act III should have been dropped and more time spent with Garner in the hospital getting to know the other patients becoming friendly with Taylor developing some affection for Saint. I don't know what they might have filled the story out with but it's too sketchy. Here is Garner in this typical VAtype hospital and we only see him talking to Taylor Saint and an intrusive and extravagantly stupid SS officer posing as a civilian. Garner has lost six years of his life as far as he knows and he simply doesn't snoop around enough for missing information. How can he wander around and not stop a pinchbeck patient at random and ask how the Sox are doing? Or whether Mammy Yokum got out of the cabbage patch? And I wish the SS officer hadn't been so obviously a pig. The guy looks like Elmer Fudd. He's manipulative craven obsequious practical as he puts it. The SS officer is a real stereotype too. He's fat arrogant and has a hangworthy neck the width of one of the Parthenon pillars. He ends every sentence with a rhetorical Huh? The German soldiers when they are in American uniforms look like anybody you might stop on the street. But when the jig is up soldiers in German uniforms take over and they are pudgy jowly and ugly. How retro can you get? The movie is overdirected too. Example There's a scene in which Saint and Garner are sitting across from each other. She's knitting. Garner has become suspicious and is silently probing a bookcase looking for something  anything  that describes postwar events. Saint's job is to keep an eye on him without revealing that she's doing so. Garner is supposed to be hiding his doubts. You and I  total amateurs at the business  could do a better job of enacting the roles. Garner is supposed to act naturally be casual but he's frowning as he flips through the books and his suspicions grow. Saint should be concentrating on her knitting with only an occasional flick of her glance at Garner but she virtually stops knitting and stares goggleeyed at Garner. It's like watching a Cecil B. DeMille movie where every nuance is shoved down your throat. Just open a little wider please.Interesting byplay towards the end between Garner and Taylor when the Reveal has been made and Garner is about to be toted off for interrogation by the SS.

Deprive a man of sleep and you make him fuzzy confuse his allegiances. It makes the SS sound like St. Francis of Assisi compared to the enhanced interrogation of today.Rod Taylor's character is supposed to have been born in America and spent his first sixteen years there before coming to Germany but he wouldn't fool me for a minute because he uses the expression different to a British locution rather than the American different from or different than. Eva Marie Saint wouldn't fool me either. I know a person from Newark New Jersey when I see one.I've kind of made fun of some of the movie but it's not actually badly done.

	onyx:emotionText "The story of a US major kidnapped in May 1944 by the Germans who try to trick him into believing that he has amnesia the war is over the Allies won and  by the way where and when will the DDay landings take place? The Germans have set up a fake hospital staffed by phony Americans and they rush the unconscious Major Pike James Garner there. He is attended by Rod Taylor a real doctor but wearing an American uniform and Eva Marie Saint his fake nurse and wife who has been chosen for the deception from among the inmates of Ravensbruck.The Germans have been very thorough. Alles in Ordnung. And they convince Garner for a day or two that the concocted story is true. Garner is sufficiently convinced that he spills the beans about the invasion. But he becomes suspicious and for some time exists in two zones Schrdinger's major. When he finally twigs to the con game he lies and tells them that he made up the Normandy story. Thereafter it gets kind of complicated.It's structured like a threeact play. Act I. We see Garner in his habitat in England going over the invasion plans with other officers. He is told he must meet his contact in Lisbon. He incurs an important paper cut while handling a map. Act II. The ersatz hospital where Rod Taylor explains everything for the thousandth time to the phony staff. Here we see Garner wake up and react to his amnesia. We then see the penny drop. Act III. An anticlimax in which Garner and Saint escape to Switzerland.It would have made a good Twilight Zone episode. As it is Act III should have been dropped and more time spent with Garner in the hospital getting to know the other patients becoming friendly with Taylor developing some affection for Saint. I don't know what they might have filled the story out with but it's too sketchy. Here is Garner in this typical VAtype hospital and we only see him talking to Taylor Saint and an intrusive and extravagantly stupid SS officer posing as a civilian. Garner has lost six years of his life as far as he knows and he simply doesn't snoop around enough for missing information. How can he wander around and not stop a pinchbeck patient at random and ask how the Sox are doing? Or whether Mammy Yokum got out of the cabbage patch? And I wish the SS officer hadn't been so obviously a pig. The guy looks like Elmer Fudd. He's manipulative craven obsequious practical as he puts it. The SS officer is a real stereotype too. He's fat arrogant and has a hangworthy neck the width of one of the Parthenon pillars. He ends every sentence with a rhetorical Huh? The German soldiers when they are in American uniforms look like anybody you might stop on the street. But when the jig is up soldiers in German uniforms take over and they are pudgy jowly and ugly. How retro can you get? The movie is overdirected too. Example There's a scene in which Saint and Garner are sitting across from each other. She's knitting. Garner has become suspicious and is silently probing a bookcase looking for something  anything  that describes postwar events. Saint's job is to keep an eye on him without revealing that she's doing so. Garner is supposed to be hiding his doubts. You and I  total amateurs at the business  could do a better job of enacting the roles. Garner is supposed to act naturally be casual but he's frowning as he flips through the books and his suspicions grow. Saint should be concentrating on her knitting with only an occasional flick of her glance at Garner but she virtually stops knitting and stares goggleeyed at Garner. It's like watching a Cecil B. DeMille movie where every nuance is shoved down your throat. Just open a little wider please.Interesting byplay towards the end between Garner and Taylor when the Reveal has been made and Garner is about to be toted off for interrogation by the SS. What do you suppose they'll do to me? asks Garner. Oh they'll probably start off with something simple first. Maybe sleep deprivation. A trick they picked up from the Russians. Deprive a man of sleep and you make him fuzzy confuse his allegiances. It makes the SS sound like St. Francis of Assisi compared to the enhanced interrogation of today.Rod Taylor's character is supposed to have been born in America and spent his first sixteen years there before coming to Germany but he wouldn't fool me for a minute because he uses the expression different to a British locution rather than the American different from or different than.

	schema:reviewBody "What is most remarkable about 36 Hours is the year it was made 1965. With the third and best Bond movie having been released in 1964 Hollywood and England were in the midst of 1001 iterations of the secret agent theme. To the modern viewer this appears a knock off of The Prisoner but actually that was first broadcast in 1967. One poster says McGoohan outlined the concept in 1965 which still raises the possibility that 36 Hours was a direct inspiration. However there were hints of what was to come in his Danger ManSecret Agent series. And some say The Prisoner was based on a real spy village. Some might say 36 Hours is an homage to Hitchcock. The concept certainly is and there is a reason Roadl Dahl also wrote several of the best Alfred Hitchcock Presents television episodes. The early scenes where there a so many gray little people who are actually spies is true to the Hitchcock paranoia as is the sense of atmosphere. However the directorial style is not Hitchcock and one must wonder what the movie would have looked like in his hands. I think the pace would have felt more taut with more buildup of suspense. Another factor is the music. Look at the Portugal scenes  they look like Hitch but the music by Dimitri Tiomkin is far too light for suspense. There was very little music later in the movie to set the mood. Bernard Herrmann would have given it more of a Hitch feel. So I think they were trying not to imitate Hitch  perhaps too hard. Some complain that it is too slow and indeed at points the movie does feel like it is 36 hours. But I strongly feel we have become an ADHD nation of short attention span due to modern editing. The slower pace gives you time to absorb the details and atmosphere which is as much of the story as the explanatory dialogue. And you don't feel like a limp rag when it is over. There are elements that echo Hitch's North By Northwest which co starred Eva Marie Saint a very pretty face with nothing to prove. Here she gets to act a very different persona and she creates a convincing younger version of Marlene Dietrich with just a touch of German accent. They don't come more handsome than James Garner but he too gets a chance to prove his acting chops. Rod Taylor also was in a Hitch classic The Birds and gives a convincing performance here one of his best. So there is some great acting to be seen.36 Hours is about a Great Con much like The Sting 1973 and the earlier Went the Day Well? 1942 which also entailed Germans speaking perfect English. Actually there was much about DDay that was a Great Con much of which has only come out more recently. Lots of clues accidentally fell into German hands including a corpse of a courier the partbrainchild of Ian Fleming who also hatched a scheme that sounds a bit like U571. There were lots of real cons going on on the Allied side so in that light it is not so improbable that the Germans would try one of their own if they had had the imagination. It takes a while for the plot to thicken say about half the movie. The details eventually come together nicely the hallmark of Roald Dahl. The clicking heels was a nice touch as a giveaway. The Germans now face the problem of whom and which version to believe and the fall back to believing the Pas de Calais option is executed believably. Here we see hints of the tricks that were played historically. The movie seems to stay true to the era.With all the attention to detail there was one oddity the coffee which was served in a French press without any plunger. You cannot make coffee then remove the plunger or you will pour grounds into your cup. So this coffee was made then put in the carafe. Was this a goof or was it a clue something was wrong with the coffee?Spoiler alertThere was.".

	schema:reviewBody "The television series Mission Impossible started out being a variation on two different caper films Topkapi and Rififi involving heists against seemingly impossible targets. But it quickly evolved into a con of the week show thanks to the two writers William Read Woodfield and Allan Balter who wrote the majority of the scripts during its first three seasons.What does this have to do with 36 Hours? Well a year before Mission even premiered 36 Hours presented a story remarkably similar to what the producers of Mission did week after week if someone was placed in an isolated situation and given only enough information to make the setting appear real  here to convince American Major Jefferson Pike played by James Garner that the war has been over for years  then that person might genuinely believe the false front and might also come to believe that revealing military secrets such as the date and location of the DDay invasion is harmless. Indeed this movie closely resembles  or is resembled by  an early episode of Mission known as Operation Rogosh the first to use this same confidence trick known as the time shift to make the subject think like Maj. Pike here that with the false passage of time once precious secrets are no longer important.Of course unlike the folks on the television series the people who are operating the big store that was created for Maj. Pike are the bad guys and therefore the audience desperately wants him to see through the deception. It all sounds implausible yet by coloring his hair as if had gone slightly gray fuzzing his vision enough so that he seems to need reading glasses and completing the background with just enough personal articles stolen from his London flat the illusion is strong enough to make him believe the story at least at the outset.A surprise is Australian Rod Taylor as an Americanborn German psychiatrist who is the primary confidante for Garner's character as well as Eva Marie Saint as a nurse who is a different kind of confidante  with a strong incentive to make the deception work. And for a time it does . . . so convincingly in fact that it seems perfectly natural for Garner's character to give them exactly what they want. Of course with the thenmajor star that Taylor was in the role it's foregone that he won't be as unsympathetic as some of the other Nazi characters.The movie is also spiced with a thoroughlybelievable Celia Lovsky as a sympathetic local villager  and John Banner best known for playing Sgt. Schultz on Hogan's Heroes as a real hero here! Unfortunately this movie is not as wellknown as those that came along later such as Mission and The Sting but perhaps now that it's out on DVD that will change. A winning film from beginning to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Seaton was a Hollywood Alevel writer and director who could tell a story efficiently and professionally. He also knew movies had to sell tickets to be successful. He kept that in mind while creating often with William Perlberg as producer movies that were satisfyingly A caliber and watchable even when they were serious by Hollywood standards. He didn't mind threading in irony or even a message or two but usually these were plot driven. Seaton in other words knew his way around. And so we have 36 Hours. It's not about the terrible conflicts of wartime exigencies as The Counterfeit Traitor is. It's not a sad uncomfortable story of love and sacrifice that The Country Girl is. And it's certainly not a bit of romantic fluff as Teacher's Pet is. 36 Hours is a fine efficient wartime yarn nothing more nothing less...and that for me is good enough. Major Jefferson Pike James Garner is an Allied intelligence officer who has been flying between London and Lisbon to pick up information from a clerk in the German embassy. It's May 31 1944. Pike is ordered to make one more flight...and the success of the Allied invasion only days away may hang in the balance. Hitler is convinced the invasion will take place in the Pas de Calais region. The Allies are doing everything possible to the keep the real location at Normandy from leaking out. The Germans of course are doing every thing they can to either confirm Pas de Calais or learn the real location. German agents with Pike now in Lisbon slip him a mickey. When he wakes up he's in a U. S. Army hospital in Germany. It's May 15 1950. His American doctor Rod Taylor tells him he's been in a coma for six years. Germany lost and the Allies occupy the country. Wilkie is President. Former president Roosevelt is recuperating again at Warm Springs Georgia. G.I. patients greet Pike by name. U. S. doctors aid his recovery. And now that the war is won there's no secret about where in France the Allies actually invaded six years earlier. So tell us about it they ask Pike. Pike's doctor of course is a German. Major Walter Gerber Rod Taylor is a skilled psychologist. The U. S. military hospital is a phony a carefully prepared installation near the Swiss border where everyone  patients doctors nurses  are Germans carefully selected for their flawless English. And speaking of nurses Pike's nurse Anna Hedler Eva Marie Saint is introduced as his wife. Gerber has organized all this in a lifeordeath gamble. He must convince Pike  within 36 hours  to volunteer the location of the invasion of France. Gerber however has someone watching over his shoulder. Otto Schack a Gestapo interrogator is equally convinced the experiment will fail. He is pressing to use the proved methods of Gestapo interrogation. All this makes for an intriguing and clever if unlikely con. But it works. We sure outfoxed the Germans with Normandy Pike says and gives the details with pride. But then Pike notices a small paper cut on his hand which is barely healed...a paper cut he now remembers getting two days ago in London. He realizes what must be happening. The con game now becomes a deadly cat and mouse game. Somehow he must convince Gerber and Schack that he knew what was going on all along and had conned them into thinking he had deliberately misled them away from the Pas de Calais. The last third of the movie  now with the Germans conned thanks in part to lousy weather on June 5  becomes a race for Pike to save his skin. Can Pike escape and make it across the border to Switzerland? Will Gerber prove he's a good German and help? And will Pike take with him Anna a woman who was forced into her role by threats to return her to Ravensbruck? Garner serves up a puzzled troubled man who finally figures out the score. Taylor gives us a dedicated German who however uneasily realizes his experiment has personal costs he didn't bargain on. Saint does a fine job in a role that doesn't give much latitude. And John Banner as an aging fat German Home Guard sergeant who shows up during the movie's last 15 minutes nearly steals the show. Weak spots? Otto Schack. He's just an oldstyle Hollywood Gestapo man slimy and opportunistic. Seaton also gives both Saint and Taylor turgid opportunities to reflect on their past and in Gerber's case his good motives. And as professional and experienced a screenwriter as Seaton was the movie at nearly two hours could use some trimming. Still 36 hours is just what it is a good war yarn built around a clever double con. We should count our blessings.".

And will Pike take with him Anna a woman who was forced into her role by threats to return her to Ravensbruck? Garner serves up a puzzled troubled man who finally figures out the score. Taylor gives us a dedicated German who however uneasily realizes his experiment has personal costs he didn't bargain on. Saint does a fine job in a role that doesn't give much latitude. And John Banner as an aging fat German Home Guard sergeant who shows up during the movie's last 15 minutes nearly steals the show. Weak spots? Otto Schack. He's just an oldstyle Hollywood Gestapo man slimy and opportunistic. Seaton also gives both Saint and Taylor turgid opportunities to reflect on their past and in Gerber's case his good motives. And as professional and experienced a screenwriter as Seaton was the movie at nearly two hours could use some trimming. Still 36 hours is just what it is a good war yarn built around a clever double con. We should count our blessings.";

A really enjoyable storyline not too corny or overthetop. A rare midday or late night movie treat!

The concept of the movie is great thriller material. A couple of days before DDay an American major is captured by the Germans during World War II. They attempt to brainwash him into believing that years have past and the war is over and that he is safe in an Allied hospital so that he will tell about the Allied invasion plans involving the Normandy invasion as if they have happened in the past time. It's a real psychological thriller that due to its story also has a certain unpleasant and unreal sciencefiction like atmosphere all over it. The movie has some great and solid thriller moments in it that makes this movie an unforgettable one and an extremely underrated one in its genre. It's sort of too bad that in the end the movie gets overwritten by leaving its original concept and turning into a more formulaic WW II thriller genre movie that tries to look more clever and complicated than it in fact really is. The movie could had definitely and perhaps also should had been 20 minutes shorter and should had ended earlier. It downgrades the movie but definitely not enough to prevent this movie from being a great and original one.The movie has a great thriller build up. featuring lots of spy elements in it. It's psychological while the second halve turns into more physical which is also one of the reasons why the second halve of the movie does not works as good as the first. It isn't the fastest going movie like we're accustomed to from '60's movies. Not that it matters though. The movie is good and tense enough to keep your interest for its entire running time without ever looking at the clock.It was a good choice that the movie was filmed entirely in atmospheric black  white. It gives the movie a more authentic feeling as well as a unpleasant and almost alien like feeling. Luckily the movie also features some well placed and refreshing humor to keep things light and also provide the movie with a certain entertainmentlevel.James Garner is good and also believable in his role. He also shares some good screen time with Rod Taylor who also gives a good performance and plays an unpredictable character. Really great in her role was Eva Marie Saint one year before she and James Garner would team up again for Grand Prix. She plays a great and strong female character. Really not that many actresses around in the '60's to play a role like that and do it so believable as she did. It definitely makes Eva Marie Saint one of the best actresses of her generation. Let's hope that Superman Returns won't be her last role. Werner Peters also plays a good stereotypical like SSofficer who in a way is the comical note of the movie though in the end his character turns more and more evil.A movie most definitely worth seeing if you get the chance to.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The situations that develop are tense but the trouble comes halfway through. There's not enough tension to keep events in the second hour strong enough to overcome inadequacies in the script. The extra punch needed to wrap up the story just isn't there. I will say however that there is a nice final moment in the story where Eva Marie Saint's character is able to shed a tear for James Garnerand it is a moment extremely well played by both actors.Garner is his usual self in the role of Major Pike perhaps a bit more subdued but defiant enough when he finds out he is being played for a patsy by Rod Taylor and Saint whose character undergoes a rather unbelievable turn at midpoint in the story. The expository scene in which she reveals her background however is well played by the actress and a bit reminiscent of her Eve Kendall in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.A tighter script would have been more forceful instead of the almost two hours of time needed to tell the story. And more tension should have been drawn from pitting the two leads Garner and Saint against each other in the noir style of say a Bogart and Bacall. Some melodramatic music in the style of a Warner Bros. composer like Franz Waxman would have spiced things up more than the sparingly used music of Dimitri Tiomkin.Still worth watching for its fascinating story idea.".

Suffice it to say that this story of intrigue is worthy of Hitchcock.The title refers to the length of time the SS gives Major Gerber to prove the value of his unorthodox interrogation method. The time limit helps drive the actionfine use of a Hitchcock method but without frequent images of a clock counting down.

I love this movie and most people would too if they gave it half a chance.";

Cliff Spab is a meaningless person trapped in a meaningless society that does not appreciate the horror of his ordeal and ruthlessly tries to cash in on his pain.

It was at a period in my life that I needed something to show me that I was still alive and things could always be worse this movie was it.  The characters the plot the cinematography all of it.  Every minute of this movie kept me wondering what would happen next and a lot of had edge of my seat suspense. Stephan Dorff did such a great job of playing this character.  Having to balance such an emotionally scarred but still nonchalant young man must have been difficult.  I really believed that he had been put through these awful things though because his performance was that good.  Reese Witherspoon also gave a great performance.  I believe her role in this movie was slightly underrated she played your typical romantic interest but she also was the reason that Dorff's character didn't lose his mind. I often find that the cinematography is better in independant films and I believe this was independant.  It had some bad language in it but that doesn't bother me.  The symbolism that is throughout this movie amazed me and I notice something new everytime I watch it.  SFW is based on the book 'Madison Heights Syndrom' and even though I've never read the book I'm sure they did a great job adapting it.   There was not one thing about this movie I didn't like and would recommend it to everybody.".

It is ostensibly a hostagedrama set in a FunStop convenience store but rapidly reveals itself as more a biting attack on the media circus and the hype machine a revealing portrayal of suburban life in America and a comment on the nature of heroes. The leads are played effortlessly by Stephen Dorff who seems to not be acting at alland Reece Witherspoon with excellent support from Bmovie stalwarts Joey Lauren Adams and Jack Noseworthy. All the characters are unlike those you see in most films... they are the sort of people you've met but never expected to see on screen. Characters the hero Spab Dorff meets along the way are delightfully unattractive and random from the hippie Earl and his militant partner to the receptionist in a neck brace at a posh hotel. Richard Portnow's FBI agent has some wonderfully quotable lines and Mr and Mrs Spab soon reveal themselves to be far from the perfect parents. The arrangement of the story flashbacks are employed heavily lets you build up a rounded picture of the events that made Spab a hero not revealing the true account of what happened in the store until near the end. Up to this point the events are clouded by the media and gossip surrounding the FunStop Hostage Crisis and although we are led to believe Spab did something spectacular the later flashbacks reveal why he is unwilling to assume the mantle of hero and why he seems to be in a bad mood most of the time!. A great film that depicts a classic antihero with more than adequate backup from the script and cast. Watch it soon!.".

	schema:reviewBody "5 people are taken hostage in a convenience store for 36 days until a fight allows them to escape.  During these 36 days the terrorists' only demand is that their video feed from inside the store is broadcast live on the networks.  Spab and Wendy emerge as the only survivors to find themselves heroes of the media generation.Don't let the plot summary fool you into thinking this is some type of thriller with a media slant.  The hostage thing is over in the first 3 minutes and any flashbacks are dull and meaningless except one powerful one.  Instead we have a mixed up satire on media and the fade of fame.  The plot never makes sense and really loses the point after only a few minutes. The fact that the whole hostage thing is never explained and barely touched on just shows it is nothing but a poor plot device to get to where the makers wanted to be to make their point.It manages to come across as just an angry youth movie  with it's anger not directed anywhere in particular.  This causes it to be very loud and with far too much swearing causing you to start to switch off.  The only point that the film manages to make clearly is that no matter who is the 15 minute celeb or news story that night TV is all the same.  Wow!  What cutting edge comment!Dorff is OK but just plain annoying in his videos that apparently the world love.  Witherspoon is vapid Busey is just loud and annoying and Adams is totally misused.  The cast put more effort into saying the F word than anything else.  It is very off putting because it is unnecessary  I guess they thought the kids' would dig it.Overall this is just like the media that it tries to criticise.  It is loud meaningless lacking substance and totally forgettable  physician heal thyself............".

	schema:headline " The Real Meaning A GoodBad Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes the acting and directing were a little inconsistent and some of the lines were sophomoric and occasionally downright lame but the value of the movie lays in it's overall existentialist theme. Cliff Spab doesn't care about the consequences of anything he's smokes he drinks he curses doesn't care about bettering himself doesn't really care about the way he looks and isn't afraid of anything not even death. Is it because he was overlooked abused etc.? Not really. Cliff doesn't revel in fame or attention when he gets it but rather treats it as a joke because it simply doesn't matter even if he half enjoys it hence the phrase So Fu.... What. The importance of this phrase points to the notion that nothing really matters in life. Someone can get the best grades go to the best schools watch their weight be good to others always do right gain fame and notoriety...or they can be shot in the head in the middle of a store robbery. In the grand scheme of things it really doesn't matter. Quoting Chuck Palahniuk On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero. Our existence in our solar system in our galaxy in the universe is a spec of dust on a spec of dust on a spec of dust hence SFW nothing really matters.The black comedy and satire of this movie comes from the doting media and fans of Cliff Spab. It's not that they really love him they are just looking for an answer a motto to guide their lives. But as in real life something seemingly meaningful to you one moment becomes a useless fad in the next moment. In the conclusion of the movie Barbara Wyler tries to shoot Cliff or something it's really been years and states her tagline Everything matters! It's the complete opposite theory of Cliff's. Her essential meaning is that everything we do has an affect on the future future generations the overall makeup of things on our planet etc. Her message could be looked at as kind of good but the irony lies in the fact that she seems all too excited to step directly into Cliff's shoes and be another meaningless shortlived role model. In essence Cliff was right when he believed nothing matters and Barbara's time in the spotlight will also fade away. One day neither will be remembered and will have no affect on anything or anyone. Even those that followed them for a brief time will be gone and forgotten. It's a sad story of the media misguiding people to waste their short lives with whatever's popular and meaningless in the moment. But it also questions if nothing really matters anyway SFW.".

Reese Witherspoon is completely wasted and the obviousness of Levy's cult wannabe heavy handedness is evident throughout. SFW is basically a terrible film. If John Waters had made it  and he would have made a better job of it and without the ridiculous incessant swearing it would have been successful because Waters understands irony. Annoyingly he did make a film with Dorff CECIL B DEMENTED in 1999 which was great until the last reel when it all fell over. He should have made SFW instead As for Stephen Dorff's career well I guess he can re emerge Rockylike and make a film called THE POWER OF TWO a sequel to the only intelligent film he has yet made.

There is a LOT of profanity in this movie re the title So Fin What. I wasn't crazy about Doirff in Blade but he does a riveting job in this film pulling off a crass cynical character who is a natural class clown but wants to be deeper and is.Again I find it interesting that a movie that has a bunch of uncomfortable commentary about America and its ruthless media and weaponssaturated culture gets panned on these media boards. This is not an effects movie and you may not find it 'exciting' enough if your thing is CGI but its a totally competent and ambitious indiestarter film I don't know where in the directors career this movie came out.This is the kind of movie a historian would go for it was made by someone with ideas in the context of their time and not some overwrought overpositioned Hollywood puff piece. The movie gets a lot clearer at the end revealing details of events you wonder about from the beginning. This film also has a lot to say about the horror of gun violence and being witness to it.

There is a little fight and the camera is shot at by one of the hostages. We are then taken to the present day where hero Dorff is in his hospital bed with a bullet wound. Both Dorff and Witherspoon handle the script well. Jake Busey also appears. Sadly like most of the characters in this film he soon disappears. Busey is one of my favourite actors as is his father Gary. I was hoping to see him with a big part in this film but after a ton of swearing he vanishes from the screen. That is the main problem in this filmit introduces these new characters and before they're allowed to develop they're taken from the screen. I would also say the amount of swearing is outrageous. If that was cut down the dialogue would be much better. Witherspoon as always is extremely beautiful and seems like the only character in the film that has any depth. Dorff I'll admit has his moments. His last two scenes are quite touching. This film has its moments. The hostage 'Split Image' film is very good. The final fight scene where Joe and Clive overcome their captors is handled well by the director. Rating35".

This would have made an excellent comedy and the talent was there in the two leads. Instead it takes an interesting original premise and turns it into a preachy borefest. With a lead character like Dorff's one would assume there would be a little old fashioned punk rock humor to the proceedings. If I wanted to hear a sermon I'd start going to church or reading Noam Chomsky the obvious inspiration for some of this film books again. Truly a pity because this could have been a great film.".

It is the story of a hostage who has been aired for 36 straight days and has become a celebrity.  His most famous quote is S.F.W. or So Fing What.  The worst thing that I could see about the movie was its language and if the bleeps were not there on the parts that were supposed to be on television I would swear that this had the most Fwords and any other swearing than even Goodfellas.  But it did not bother me.This movie stresses me and it should.  It is about what the media was when the movie came out.  Instead of the mindcontrolling media that it is currently see Mad City it used to be fickle and still is a little and change with the public.  One day the media could hate the pres and the next it could love him for the same action.  This is instead of trying to force everybody to hate the pres.The movie is a little confusing because of the editing.  It starts with day 36 of the crisis and then moves forward.  We only see the crisis in flashbacks.  You never learn what the terrorists are about and it does not really matter.  What does matter is that they held Spab and Wendy hostage for 36 days and aired every minute on TV.This is pure GenX stuff.  But it is good for everybody else if you can get past the language.  It actually has something to say about society and how everybody is sheep.  They all follow everybody else without knowing why. They change at the drop of a hat.  And they all want a piece of the leader.This is not really a comedy and not really an action or drama.  It is nonconformist which is good.  Watch this movie and you will automatically mull it over.  Then watch it again.  You won't see everything the first time around.  This is a highrate film but a it has low points. 810".

Klein seizes the opportunity to up the ante and arranges for the arrest of Vrinks but when he goes further and viciously involves Vrinks' wife Camille revenge is inevitable.";

	schema:reviewBody "What a good surprise this movie has been ! I just had to let you know about it as soon as possible As it might not rings any bell in foreigners' head know that the Quai Des Orfvres is the familiar name for the Criminal Investigations Division of the Paris Police located at no. 36. In popular parlance Quai des Orfvres means to the French what Scotland Yard means to the British.Indeed we are here in a thriller a dark one. The director Olivier Marchal is a former cop and the story of 36 Quai Des Orfvres is from real facts from the life of Dominique Loiseau who cowrote the script former member of the BRI Brigade de Recherche et d'Intervention  Search and Action Squad the antigangs squad in the mid eighties. In this movie we follow the struggle between two cops.On one hand we have Vrinks BRI's head. Daniel Auteuil who is one of the most famous actors in France offers the audience an amazing performance playing this cop who is found of justice whatever it costs and whatever the methods are to take down the criminals. To reach his ideal of justice he uses to flirt dangerously with the dark side taking risks for his family his life and his career. Anyway it seems his priorities are still in this order. Like the Vincent Hanna of Heat he just has two lifes he tries to separate the one at work and the one at home where he doesn't say anything about his work to his wife played by the beautiful Valeria Golino just because he's afraid that might make her run away... On the other hand we have Klein the head of the BRB Brigade de Rpression du Banditisme  Crime Repression Squad taking care of big robberies and so on played by a very well known actor in France but also around the world after a few appearance in Hollywood movies Grard Depardieu who seems to have reminded the amazing actor he can be. Depardieu is indeed at his top playing this ambitious and soured character who reaches power and power only. Tensions exist between these two men who used to be friends. They really don't share the same goals regarding their professional life but it appears quickly that the problem is mostly located on the private front. We don't know exactly what has happened but it seems that a woman who is now Mrs Vrink has been between the two of them breaking for good their friendship long years ago and creating a scare which is still very sensitive today.Their boss Robert Mancini played by Andr Dussolier the narrator's voice in Amlie here playing perfectly again a role quite similar to the one he had in Agents Secrets makes these tensions get worse when explaining them that he is about to be promoted. As they are both equally qualified they are in competition for his replacement. The one who will take down a gang of very violent robbers currently holding up to ridicule the police forces will be the new head of the number 36 Quai des Orfvres.And here you know just the starting plot of this movie which benefits of a really really good script. In addition to this perfect script you have a great casting for the main roles but also for the background characters who are for most of them unknown actors who will surely be known in a few movies if they continue to play so well and have the luck again to play in such a great film. The rhythm of the movie is also really good and very unexpected for this kind of production in France risks have been taken and ... it pays. This movie really takes you in its story and it's a great journey.Olivier Marchal is a former cop yes but more than that he is also a great thriller movie fans. I've used a reference to Heat earlier and according to some interviews I've read after having seen the movie it seems that Olivier Marchal totally agrees with me on the fact Heat is one of the best thriller ever shooted if not the best. He said he wanted to something in the same spirit all things considered and I had indeed been surprised during 36 Quai Des Orfvres to think a few times about Michael Man's work. We are far from a Collateral or a Heat but 36 Quai Des Orfvres doesn't have to get redden in front of these masterpieces IMHO. Fan honest and humble Olivier Marchal has delivered us a very efficient and striking thriller who deserves to be classified among the best of the genre. 36 Quai Des Orfvres is letting me hope that maybe France will be back on the thrillers front which had been quite deserted after a golden age in the 70's with great directors like JeanPierre Melville. I really hope that this movie will be released in foreign countries and that most of you will have the opportunity to see it. An opportunity that I seriously invite you to not miss".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the privilege of seeing this film at the Lincoln Center NY City Rendezvous with French Cinema in March 2005 with the director Olivier Marchal in attendance.The film stars Daniel Auteuil Gerard Depardieu and Valeria Golino. The two male leads play rivals for the position of Chief of Police in the same district of Paris. Depardieu's character is the heavy and the actor does a magnificent job. But so does Auteuil as the good guy and Golino as his wife. Marchal both wrote and directed this film drawing on his former life as in fact a Paris cop and based the events in the film on some real occurrences from the 80s in Paris. There are drug dealers and corrupt cops to be sure but what gives this film tremendous power is the combination of the superb acting and a tough smart script.The current chief is in line to a promotion to commissioner and knows the personalities of the two rivals wellso well in fact that he engages in some devious manipulative actions to set them against each other. The resulting tension and conflict between these two is what gives the film its tremendous momentum. The plotting is perfect this film does everything it's supposed to do and a lot more to grab the viewer by the throat and not let go until the end.Upon conclusion of the film the director was bombarded with questions. One of them was whether or not the film has American distribution. One would think that with two French megastars like Auteuil and Depardieu no problem right? Wrong. Marchal indicated that the film was picked up for distribution throughout the world EXCEPT in the US. It is my fervent hope that some American studiodistributor smartens up and then snaps up this film which is without question the absolute best policier in more than 20 years. The last great film in this genre from France was La Balance directed interestingly enough by an American expat Bob Swaim. That was in 1982. Even Tavernier's L.627 1992 is not a strong contender.But 36 Quai des Orfevres is the real deal. The title refers to the street address of the district precinct station whose sign in a nifty opening sequence is ripped off by...well you'll just have to see for yourself.Very highly recommended. A great thrillerformidable! French for terrific.".

The two male leads play rivals for the position of Chief of Police in the same district of Paris. Depardieu's character is the heavy and the actor does a magnificent job. But so does Auteuil as the good guy and Golino as his wife.

Auteuil is our Dirty Harry kind of cop often worse than the villains he's after but he DOES usually get them in the end Depardieu is a tad choosier but not TOO good to live. To say more wouldn't really add much I found myself a little intrigued by the long black leather coats worn by both Brigades resembling nothing so much as the outfit of choice of the Stasi in East Germany and I HOPE this is an oblique comment on the fact that England at least is slowly becoming a Police state.

Why they couldn't have just focused on the hatred of the cops amongst each other is beyond me. There are so many plot points and characters it gets confusing. These typa films try to make things flashy by throwing in some ultra violence and quick camera movements to distract you from the reality of what it is one of a 100 films I've seen many times before.Since this is only a film I won't get too philosophical but can you imagine if anyone believed that things in ParisFrance were this bad with the criminal element or even the Police department? I mean by this film you'd think that this was the most corrupt Police department on the planet.The casting was OK but that can't make up for what's actually here. If you wanna see a decent french film with this typa action but has actual depth try Le Deuxieme Souffle1966 or La Femme Nikita. These are far superior than this one. For a general film about cops with this kinda action try Heat or Ronin. You can't miss with those.".

	schema:reviewBody "First the good news the first hour of this film is an enjoyable if derivative cops and robbers show while Depardieu and Auteuil do as much as they can to keep things afloat throughout. The second hour sadly is just a melodramatic soup which you will enjoy in direct relation to how readily you swallow the soap operastyle plot contrivances which are rammed in without regard for logic or the intelligence of the audience in order to get Auteuil's character jailed and his wife slain. For example can a senior policeman  The good cop highly regarded by his superiors and the hero of the moment for having just jailed a violent gang that had been terrorising Paris for two years really be convicted solely on the uncorroborated eyewitness evidence of junkie hooker?

The second hour sadly is just a melodramatic soup which you will enjoy in direct relation to how readily you swallow the soap operastyle plot contrivances which are rammed in without regard for logic or the intelligence of the audience in order to get Auteuil's character jailed and his wife slain.

Of course the politicians are angry and want immediate results in the capture of these criminals. The stakes are raised when a vacant seat in higher office is opened to the officer who manages to do so.Leo Vrinks is a decorated cop with questionable methods. Toeing the line that separates cops from thugs his team of officers and himself are tasked to bring these criminals to justice. His rival Denis Klein also a celebrated cop wants the case for himself but unceremoniously gets his team and himself relegated to a support role in the sting operation.Naturally unexpected things happen during the operation because of Denis' callous behaviour and lives on both sides are lost. But no the show doesn't end there when the thugs are captured as the rivalry between the men spill over and provides more than sufficient fuel for the second half of the movie.I guess it's the same at most offices where promotion's at stake the struggles and intense rivalry may get into the way of the greater good in getting the objective achieved. Methods are questioned where morality and ethics are put into the spotlight  does the end really justify any means necessary? Like memorable HK police thriller Infernal Affairs it is the powerful relationship between the main characters that this drama explores and excels in with excellent acting from Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu as the bitter men with ambiguous methods and morales.It's a relatively tight storyline and you'll have to pay close attention to the subplots in order to be able to piece together how and why the ending was as presented.

It's clear that Depardieu and Auteuil's characters were once friends but are now no more and it is obliquely hinted at that Auteuil's wife is the reason but that is all.

When Depardieu inadvertently causes the death of a colleague he is not reprimanded because the evidence of Auteuil is compromised by his own internal affairs hearing. And yet Depardieu's fauxpas is fuelled by a halfbottle of scotch he sinks in his car immediately before acting. Considering the degree of enmity felt for him by half the cops there I can't help thinking this would surely have been picked up on by his superiors.

My congratulations to all the stuff for this super job with lot of plots intrigues and twists. The main characters were well developed and played by the great actors Daniel Auteil and as usual Grard Depardieu. I am surprised what the french film scene presented recently to the audience with good thrillers as for example CRIMSON RIVERS I and II L'EMPIRE DES LOUPS and the funny ones L'ENQUETE CORSE and TAISTOI. Standing ovations and I have my great respect for all. These movies are much more better than the last thrillers I saw from Hollywood. The running time was not long in respect of the similar USthriller HEAT that was too long and not so hot as 36 Quai Des Orfvres. For all theses reasons I give with my wife a solid 710 that matches nearly the actual vote of 7.2 on IMDb. Don't miss it you won't regret.".

Great emphasis is then placed on Depardieu's efforts to ensure Auteuil's character stays there. Yet the cause of this hatred is never explained so we don't understand  therefore don't feel involved.

	schema:headline " Not as good as it could have been";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an intriguing film about police work that misses out on quite a few opportunities for greatness. Unfortunately it's not as similar to Heat as it purports to be. It lacks the action the tension the human interaction. We begin by meeting the retiring cop Eddy and his buddy Vrinks who are working to catch a band of armored car robbers. Their nemesis is Klein a sleazy and ambitious cop. When Vrinks gets a tip from an informant he's put unknowingly in a tough situation a situation that will haunt him later on. Once Vrink's group sets up to catch the robbers the envious and drunk Klein screws up and gets Eddy killed. This earns him the repudiation of almost the entire police force. But he's got a card up his sleeve. By coincidence he gets to find out about the situation Vrinks got himself in thanks to the informant. That turns the tables in favor of Klein. Vrinks ends up in jail and Klein not only exonerated but promoted. To make things worse Klein involves in the death of Vrinks' wife who was contacted by the informant to offer help. While this may sound quite exciting there is a surprising lack of action in this thriller. There are a few short scenes to establish Vrinks as the good guy willing to do anything to catch the bad guys and as someone who stands by his friends. Klein is the opposite. The bad guys don't get much screen time. This is more about the lives of the cops. But strangely it feels very distant and cold. Perhaps this is appropriate since the topic is police work and not teenage drama queens and kings. Still the human factor is missing in this French movie. What is intriguing but not exploited adequately is the political aspect. We meet the police brass and associated bureaucrats that support Vrinks at least in spirit but end up acting in favor of Klein. To some extent this story line is quite realistic. Good guys do finish last and the slimy sleaze balls do win. Klein however seems too much of a nasty traitor to be favored even by gutless politicians. There is a point in this movie where it all seems too dark. The good guy has lost everything and there seems no way out whatsoever. It's as if the filmmakers overdid it. For instance the whole storyline about Vrinks wife is really unnecessary. Vrinks had plenty of reason for revenge even without her death. I too have problems with the score. At times it is very similar to Heat's and used to create tension and excitement. The problem is that while Heat delivers action and excitement 36 doesn't and the music just seems like a manipulative device. Similarly the editing used cuts most scenes into very short bits disconnecting us entirely from the characters and from any chance at conversation. Overall this movie succeeds in what it sets out to do to get us to like the good guy hate the bad guy and cheer for revenge. There is some effective realism the despicable judicial system the revolting behindthescenes politics that tie the hands of law enforcement and promote incompetence the underground network of bad guys etc. But you are left wanting more more heists by the robbers more police operations more about Klein more sinister stringpulling by politicians more buddy work by the good cops. In a way this movie is a combination of Heat and Miami Vice. It takes the coldness and distance from Miami Vice and puts it in the context of Heat. I think the reverse would have made for a cooler movie the excitement of intimacy of Heat in the drug underworld of Miami. Still this is a very enjoyable thriller just be aware that it will not turn out too be as great as one hopes.".

We meet the police brass and associated bureaucrats that support Vrinks at least in spirit but end up acting in favor of Klein. To some extent this story line is quite realistic. Good guys do finish last and the slimy sleaze balls do win. Klein however seems too much of a nasty traitor to be favored even by gutless politicians. There is a point in this movie where it all seems too dark. The good guy has lost everything and there seems no way out whatsoever. It's as if the filmmakers overdid it. For instance the whole storyline about Vrinks wife is really unnecessary. Vrinks had plenty of reason for revenge even without her death. I too have problems with the score. At times it is very similar to Heat's and used to create tension and excitement. The problem is that while Heat delivers action and excitement 36 doesn't and the music just seems like a manipulative device. Similarly the editing used cuts most scenes into very short bits disconnecting us entirely from the characters and from any chance at conversation. Overall this movie succeeds in what it sets out to do to get us to like the good guy hate the bad guy and cheer for revenge. There is some effective realism the despicable judicial system the revolting behindthescenes politics that tie the hands of law enforcement and promote incompetence the underground network of bad guys etc. But you are left wanting more more heists by the robbers more police operations more about Klein more sinister stringpulling by politicians more buddy work by the good cops. In a way this movie is a combination of Heat and Miami Vice. It takes the coldness and distance from Miami Vice and puts it in the context of Heat. I think the reverse would have made for a cooler movie the excitement of intimacy of Heat in the drug underworld of Miami. Still this is a very enjoyable thriller just be aware that it will not turn out too be as great as one hopes.";

	schema:headline " Where honor meets decadence and gentleness brutality...";
	schema:reviewBody "The film by Olivier Marchal has recently been released in Polish cinemas under quite a misleading title 36 which does not indicate much to an average movie goer. And the same was as to me. I went to see it not because it is based on true facts no handout said it nor because it is a thriller I am not a particular fan of such films but because of two main actors Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil both remarkably popular in Europe. The movie surprised me not only due to the performances of the above mentioned persons but because of the content and the way it is presented.MESSAGE AND REALISM It would be silly to present now the content of the film. Many before me have already done it. All I would like to say or in other words all I would like to draw viewer's attention to are two factors what the film generally wants to convey and why it is so natural. Marchal's film IS I do not deny filled with violence. It shows the methods of the worst criminals. A particularly disgusting moment was beating of a woman in a bar close friend of the cops. However the main idea and focus is not directed towards the criminals that much as rather towards two cops who can also be influenced by decadence and brutality. Leo Vrinks Daniel Auteuil is definitely a good man attached to his family and striking for justice indefatigably fighting against the pack of bandits. His former friend however Denis Klein Gerard Depardieu moves his goals in a different direction... Therefore the end shows that they get what each one deserves... Therefore the movie is a wonderful message of how people stir their goals in life. At the same time it is a very natural presentation of the world of the cops how risky their lives are how they really have to deal with most serious crimes. But here it is important to state that by showing violence the film IN NO WAY tries to promote it but aims at a realistic image of the main characters' reality.CAST The performances are great. Most people play very naturally which makes the film a true adventure. There are such moments in which you feel that you are there with Vrinks. The director wonderfully manages to lead a viewer to the action to be controlled by it to sink in it. And that proves the fact that the film is a very talented piece of work.EMOTIONS I was very very surprised how many gentle moments the producers entailed in a thriller. On the one hand we see the corruption and decadence of the criminal world on the other hand there is love and gentleness. I will never forget the moment when Vrinks is in a jail and does all he can in despair to see his wife Camille Vrinks Valeria Golino. Their delicate kiss and gentle words I love you later occur to be the key aspects of their last meeting in this world. And the sequence of Vrinks and his 17 year old daughter Lola played by Auteuil's real daughter Aurore Auteuil. He is showed as a man who has never been spoiled by the world he dealt with. The emotions that the movie shows are really worth attention  no kitsch no tearjerker but real life! To sum up I have to say that I liked the movie. Not many French films are released in Poland not many of them are famous in the world pity but after seeing Marchal's film I consider it one of the best of its genre. Really honor meets decadence and gentleness meets brutality. Isn't that realistic?".

In this very sad bleak but also very touching Bavarian comedy Saegebrecht plays a lonely overweight woman in the big city of Munich in her late thirties who works as an udertaker. Her life consist of her sad work watching TV and eating loads of sweets and cakes. One day she's falling in love with the voice of a subway driver played by popular comedian Eisi Gulp announcing the train stations. She stalking him until he falls in love with her but their intense romance is only shortlived.Together with Doris Doerrie's Maenner Men released the same year Zuckerbaby was a blueprint for the very popular German movie genre of the Beziehungskomoedien relationship comedies in the eighties and nineties. It is shot in a typical colorful 1980's neon style reflecting the bright lights and loneliness of modern life in the big cities. There are not much dialogues and the real conversations only start with the beginning of the romance in the middle of the film. There is also a creepy sad atmosphere of death loneliness and the longing for love but the movie works perfect as a human drama as well as a campy love comedy.The actors are doing a great job and the minimal harmonica tunes in the background are adding a great atmosphere to the picture. By the way Zuckerbaby was a famous German Rock'n'Roll song from the fifties by Peter Kraus which is constantly played during the movie. If you want to watch one of the best German films of the eighties Zuckerbaby is a good example to recommend.".

The colours and moods suggest that there is something mysterious and frightening going on behind the scenes but there isn't. The dialogue and the characters especially Marianne Sgebrecht's are to take more seriously as the direction which seems to me somewhat playful not in any way relevant for the development of the plot.At least this connection of story and direction brings some fascination.

	schema:reviewBody "Zuckerbaby or Sugarbaby is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1985 so it had its 30th anniversary last year. the writer and director is Percy Adlon turned 80 last year and this was the beginning of a trilogy of films he made with actress Marianne Sgebrecht. The other two are in English language though and include an Academy Award nominee. Sgebrecht herself was nominated for a German Film Award here and same goes for her colead Eisi Gulp who for whatever wrong reason was nominated in the supporting category. Neither of the duo won the award. These two basically are the film especially Sgebrecht. She probably was a good casting decision for this one and I believe this film would have been worse without her. This is not supposed to say the film was particularly interesting though. It is a twoman show and the two actors make a solid job but the script never really made me care for either of them or allowed me to make an emotional connection here. Sgebrecht always plays characters who somewhat define themselves through their weight but are not negative people rather likable. I do believe she is a very physical actress. She frequently plays the nice friendly obese woman from next door who struggles with life and human relationships a bit but it does not take away from how likable she is. Anyway all in all I am glad this film only ran for slightly over 80 minutes. It dragged for me on several occasions and sometimes I also felt it was style over substance may have worked better and been more essential as a short film of around 40 minutes. I don't recommend the watch or only if you really loved Outt of Rosenheim. Maybe I also did not like it that much because Bavarian culture and humor are absolutely not my thing. Thumbs down.".

The humorfor the first half of the film is hilariously funnyis very grownup humor and the actual love story which it becomes with its tensions and tendernesses is also very very matureI think it quite likely that the movie will only appeal to people who are at least 35 but that they will find considerable truth in the way lust infatuation and eventually tenderness and caring loveand lossare portrayed.The protagonist is a fat middleaged oldmaid spinster who works as a mortician in Munich and one day unexpectedly mesmerized by the gentle voice of a youthful handsome athletic driver of the Munich UBahn subway metro rushes to see the owner of the lovely voice and becomes obsessed and infatuated with him. The first half of the film tells us the hilarious adventures and desperate measures she goes through to identify him stalk him and ultimately snare him and seduce him.SPOILERS FOLLOW It is here that the film turns from a trivial farce into a film of depth and true interest a relation that started as an infatuation driven on her side by lust and a desire for life and youth in her colorless and depressing life and on his side by a nagging and unpleasant wife who drives him into the arms of a loveaffairthis relation CHANGES into one of true affection caring and tenderness and the two who were lusting for one another's surface qualities slowly discover the real human beings underneath the fleshand discover that there is more than simply lust and fun in their relationship.The film moves toward a deliberately ambiguous ending that raises questionsmany of themand leaves us haunted by the lives of the two main characters and their experience.There are two moments of sexually explicit activity in the film for people who are touchy about such things but none of it seems gratuitous sex for the sake of sex scene and such scenes are conducted within the bounds of taste good not smutty humor and leave us with a sense of INTIMACY rather than PORNOGRAPHY.The real adult nature of the film is in the departure from any sort of expected scenario like Hitchcock's Psycho it is a film which starts off going decidedly in ONE direction and then takes a sudden and wonderful turn into a totally unexpected and different directionwe stop laughing and we start identifying strongly and at times painfully with the main characters and their brief taste of an escape from their respective lonelinesses.Can't recommend it highly enoughit's a big favorite of mine.".

It was made in Germany but I am not certain which Germany  in any case there is a cameo of the infamous Luxemburg station the second most reputed m'etro station in Europe. You will enjoy it.";

But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O'Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O'Toole's eyes within the vast arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a silly movie Wow I had Michael Apted's quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me I don't know what he meant. I love this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film on its release aged 13 and it forms an important part of my transition towards adulthood. I am pleased to see that it consistently rates 20something in the IMDb listings even from others whom I envy for I can't see it with fresh eyes who are seeing it for the first time. Pleasing too is that some of those are also teenagers for whom a fortythree year old film must itself seem part of the past. As for the minority who are bored by intentionally slow pacing and for whom punctuation paragraphing and grammar are a lost art I suggest they learn a little about the history of filmmaking from which it may become apparent that much of today's fast editing techniques were invented in the 1920s try Eisenstein's October for example.From the universally admired cinematography of Freddie Young the long shot of Omar Sharif's floating mirage entry the preCGI battles and panup scene changes to O'Toole's florid but careerdefining performance and the then novel timeshift narrative this film set standards not matched even by Lean himself and as many reviewers have commented financially and practically unlikely to be attempted today. I too have rarely seen such clarity of image outside of Imax and in my view the script by Robert Bolt and I now have learnt an uncredited Michael Wilson is the finest in cinema. Maurice Jarre's music and some of the acting style now seem a little excessive but repeated viewing around 35 times in my case does not diminish the impact and quality and the restoration and now DVD release still after all these years approaches the effect of that first 1962 viewing.It is rare that repeated watching of a film as opposed to a live performance does this and the reasons go beyond the photography performances and editing. In my opinion it is because the characterisation and storytelling encourage an appreciation of the ambiguity and inconsistency behind our motives and behaviour and in a wartime scenario in the contrast between political expedience and personal morality. For a 13year old this opened a window into the adult world and it explains why the story has resonance far beyond its setting. The film doesn't require an understanding of middleeast politics though it does have some very current relevance but it does require an ability to look listen and understand. The fact that so many people rate it so highly says everything about its wider impact. When The Matrix and even Lord of the Rings have slipped out of the ratings and the adolescents who inhabit these pages have grown up I believe this film will still be in the 20s or 30s perhaps enabling young people to once again see the world through adult eyes.Like Ali I fear Lawrence. I fear the power of art to change us to challenge our preconceptions. Every time I see this film I learn a little more discover something new. When I was 13 I didn't understand much but this film helped me to see that I wanted more knew more than my peers. I can't rate it more highly than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sweeping epic and literate version of British adventurer and soldier T E Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during the First World War. Lawrence miraculously well played by Peter O'Toole went native when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence's efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient.Lawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn amongst others served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself with his own demons and with the cruel desert environment the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert the nomadic allies under Lawrence's direction attack and disrupt the Turks' efforts to maintain control of the territory whilst the elephant  the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins  pushes ever deeper into the area not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middleeast between them and that the battlelines for the 21st century are already being drawn.Scripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue cinematography soundtrack and especially direction are superlative likewise the supporting actors. But it is O'Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie but is well worth the ride and will by the bye provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics. One of the best films ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein. There are films that define a time. There are films that define a genre. There are films that define cinema. 'Lawrence of Arabia' defines all of the above. Within its frames 'Lawrence of Arabia' captures the essence of a man a time and place with unparalleled cinematic magic. Though a winner of 7 Oscars and one of the Top 100 ticket sellers of all time most people were not able to see 'Lawrence of Arabia' the way it was intended until 1989 and I still imagine most people have only seen it during one of its annual Christmas TV viewings. Steven Spielberg Martin Scorsese and Robert Harris deserve massive applause for their efforts to restore this film to its 2.201 widescreen 220 minute glory. I myself thankfully have never seen any other version of this film. So when I first saw the film it was in its untainted glory and it's an experience I shall never forget. Never before had I seen a film that blurred the lines between storytelling and art so much. Never before had I seen a film so assured in visual storytelling. Never before had I been so transplanted into a film's world. The awesome acting the stupendous story the remarkable visuals the sublime script the fascinating dialogue and majestic music all combine to make a film like none other.'Lawrence of Arabia' is played out in five acts each one of them represents a different part of Lawrence's psyche. The first act is Lawrence's introduction into Arabia where he is very much an Englishman  albeit an outcast. The second act concerns his assimilation into Arabia the taking of Aqaba and his rise to deity. The third portrays Lawrence at the peak of his military career and his growing egotism. The fourth act is his capture torture mental breakdown and dissertation of his troops. The fifth concerns his comeback revenge and both his greatest and most flawed accomplishment the slaughter of Turks and the liberation of Damascus. Every scene in these acts is essential to the development of his persona. Lean and Bolt raise the question of who Lawrence was but they never answer the question. This is one factor that brings me back to the film time and time again  each time I watch the film I am left with a different perception of Lawrence's character.The film contains an all star cast including Peter O'Toole Omar Sharif Alec Guinness Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains. Only 'JFK' rivals it in my view. Of course there was been many all star casts that haven't performed to their usual standards but it is not the case here. Everyone is on top of there game especially Peter O'Toole who gives the greatest cinematic performance I have ever seen. From extremes of joyous extremes and heated contempt he dominates the screen with undeniable screen presence and charisma. Many an actor would be lost on screen amidst all the sand but O'Toole never is. Watch Lawrence's scene in the mess hall near the beginning then watch his immense 'No prisoners' scene  the change is remarkable. Omar Sharif is also superb and it is easy to see why he became a big international star following his charismatic performance.I have never been a fan of desert films and find the majority of them boring but Freddie Young's 70mm widescreen photography brings the desert alive in such an exciting and absorbing way. The film is simply full of memorable and beautiful scenes such as Sharif's introduction the long pan over the assault on Aqaba or the glorious reveal from a purple flag of Lawrence and Sheriff Ali leading their final army. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a unique visual experience and one you will not forget in a hurry.Although it comes in at over three and a half hours 'Lawrence of Arabia' never lulls and if not for the forced DVD intermission I doubt I would move at all while watching it. The innovative editing including some of the most famous examples of directcutting keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. There are no gratuitous scenes. Every scene is a required piece of the puzzle. Maurice Jarre's phenomenal music also helps keep the film going. I'm sure some of the scenes of people crossing the desert would have been tedious without his music but with his majestic music transplanted over the images they are simply compulsive viewing. The epic action scenes are breathtaking in their scope and execution. But what gives them their impact is that Lean perhaps limited by censorship laws is not concerned with the visceral thrill of battle but rather the effect they have on the battlers. What drives men to war and what do they get from it. And thankfully the action scenes are succinct and progressive with no blasted shakycam or CGI troops. Everything you see on screen is real and was performed which just adds to the gobsmacking sense of the shots. It is this sense of realism that deepens the experience.If one's respect for 'Lawrence of Arabia' is not enamored after viewing the film perhaps it will be when thinking that we will NEVER see a film like this again. No studio would take the risk of a project this big that excludes many of their 'key demographics' and 'film rules'. There are no talking parts for women. There is no love interest. There is no happy ending. 'Lawrence of Arabia' a product of Hollywood showing its balls which for many a year it seems to have lost. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is an aweinspiring Goliath of cinematic perfection. The best film I can lay claim to having seen.".

What drives men to war and what do they get from it. And thankfully the action scenes are succinct and progressive with no blasted shakycam or CGI troops. Everything you see on screen is real and was performed which just adds to the gobsmacking sense of the shots. It is this sense of realism that deepens the experience.If one's respect for 'Lawrence of Arabia' is not enamored after viewing the film perhaps it will be when thinking that we will NEVER see a film like this again. No studio would take the risk of a project this big that excludes many of their 'key demographics' and 'film rules'. There are no talking parts for women. There is no love interest. There is no happy ending. 'Lawrence of Arabia' a product of Hollywood showing its balls which for many a year it seems to have lost. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is an aweinspiring Goliath of cinematic perfection. The best film I can lay claim to having seen.";

But time does things to movies and when I watched it again last year I found my eyes to be weeping at the end. It instantly became one of my favorite movies.Since then I learned a lot about the history of cinema and I also learned a great deal about the movies of Sir David Lean. I found my self watching films like Brief Encounter The Bridge on the River Kwai Doctor Zhivago Ryan's Daughter and the underrated A passage to India. Lean became one of my favorite directors and just a few months ago I decided to watch Lawrence with some friends. Although I had seen it a couple of times before this time it was a different experience altogether from the starting credits to the blowing of the match the crossing of the Nefud dessert finding Gassim and bringing him back to the camp the invasion of Aqaba his torture and rape ? Lawrence's laugh after the slap by the outrageaous guy his being left alone to the final gaze to the motorcycle. I sensed something when I watched that film which leaves my with the undoubted feeling that Lawrence of Arabia is the greatest film ever made. For me this is it. Ever since '62 it's been a downfall. No other film has managed to reach Lawrence in its poetic greatness. Few do come very close Vertigo for instance.If we are to classify the two complete different cinematic styles it would be those of Hitchcock and Ford. Hitch was a very confined director. He captured his movies from the point of view of one character. His movies took place most of the time in closed spaces. In a sense Hitchcock's films were a journey in people's emotions and a study in people's characters. On the other hand Ford was an open director. He wasn't confined to one character or one location his films where actual journeys. His basis was mostly on theme and his main ability was to amaze with his imagery. Thus these are the two different shooting styles....Well Lean combines both.Which is basically why his best film Lawrence is the best film of all times. But not only in terms of style. Also in terms of content. The intelligent script written by Robert Bolt the powerhouse performances by O'Toole and Shariff a shame they didn't get the statuette but also the ultimately heroic yet tragic figure of T.E. Lawrence contribute in making this the most visually and emotionally sweeping film of the last 111 years.Such a shame that Lean retired for 14 years after Ryan's Daughter there's no way to know where he would have gotten.".

	schema:headline " Makes a Strong Case for Best Film Ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "The definitive epic of the cinema's history. Lawrence of Arabia is handsdown the finest production of the 1960s and makes a strong case as the best movie ever made. The titled character Oscarnominee Peter O'Toole in his careerdefining role dies in a freak motorcycle accident in the early1930s in his homeland of England. In spite of being honored by the nation many knew nothing of him. Some loved him others despised him but no one seemed to know the man at all. Flashbacks immediately start as we meet the character during World War I. He is a lieutenant assigned to mundane duties but suddenly he is thrust into a greater role in North Africa. He is to assist a Saudi Arabian prince Alec Guinness. The goal is to fight off the dreaded Turkish regime that poses a threat to the Arabs. If the Turks take over this land in Africa what will it mean for the English? This concern leads to those in charge most notably Claude Rains wanting the titled character to help the Arabs to win their freedom back from the Turks. With the help of allies Omar Sharif Oscarnominated and Anthony Quinn among a whole host of others O'Toole starts to assist the Arabs in their allornothing task. An ambitious American journalist Arthur Kennedy wants to tell O'Toole's story in the hopes of getting the U.S. interested in the war basically trying to get his nation involved in World War I by presenting them with a largerthanlife hero. During the venture O'Toole becomes a bit warcrazed and looks at himself as a sort of Christlike figure who thinks of himself as immortal. O'Toole proves to be someone who is very at home in combat and when the combat is over will he be able to function properly? Franklin J. Schaffner's Patton benefited greatly from David Lean's Oscarwinning for directing masterpiece. This Best Picture Oscar winner from 1962 just grows in importance as the years pass by. Lawrence of Arabia is a thinking person's film that is much much deeper than it appears on the surface and it appears deep on the surface to start with. The film deals with a slice of history that really did not seem that important back during World War I but the situations in the Middle East now are greatly due to T.E. Lawrence's acts nearly a century ago. Did leading the Arabs to freedom make the world a safer place? This is the main question that Lean's film raises. Guinness' character is someone who changes almost immediately near the end of the production and it is a somewhat frightening foreshadower of things to come. A monumental milestone in filmmaking that stands so tall against all the other great productions of all eras. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence Peter O'Toole holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out. Before the action is even completed however Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon. It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history second maybe only to the bonespaceship cut in 2001 A Space Odyssey. And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in Lawrence of Arabia. The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them. Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knockyoursocksoff action sequences. Lawrence of Arabia has these elements too but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes you can have movie magic.Lawrence feels unlike other historical epics of its time. In most big filmsI'm thinking of movies like BenHur Spartacus Cleopatra all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as Lawrenceone gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses. One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction. Everything feels static and wooden. But in Lawrence Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme closeups of actor faces. In one especially brutal scene after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people the action cuts to a closeup of O'Toole looking panicked and crazed gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like thatnot just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scenethat set Lawrence apart from other standard epics.And of course I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole. He is perhaps my favorite actor not one of the most prolific but certainly one of the most unpredictable. He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform. He carries Lawrence of Arabia almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders. That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great but O'Toole towers above them all. O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshiped or feared or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to Lawrence of Arabia again. His later films are certainly more than watchable and A Passage to India is even quite remarkable in its own way but we would never get another Lawrence. Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade A".

In one especially brutal scene after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people the action cuts to a closeup of O'Toole looking panicked and crazed gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like thatnot just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scenethat set Lawrence apart from other standard epics.And of course I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole. He is perhaps my favorite actor not one of the most prolific but certainly one of the most unpredictable. He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform. He carries Lawrence of Arabia almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders. That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great but O'Toole towers above them all. O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshiped or feared or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to Lawrence of Arabia again. His later films are certainly more than watchable and A Passage to India is even quite remarkable in its own way but we would never get another Lawrence. Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade A";

I can only hope that one day he joins the 21st century hero's aren't all musclebound apes leaders aren't all fluffy paragons of virtue and so what if he did turn out to be homosexual?If you and you dad like watching a man being whipped before being violated there is I believe a wealth of material available to cater for your taste at your local pornography shop.In my opinion its one of the best films ever made and certainly the best film I've seen based on real events.Forget the length feel the quality.".

He becomes a traveler a great man and a leader to the people that he has associated with.  Only director David Lean could have given us a movie experience like this.An assortment of phenomenal actors are collected for this movie and what a cast!  Peter O'Toole Omar Sharif Anthony Quinn Alec Guiness and so much more portray their characters with intensity and believability.  Never have I been so impressed. As Lawrence Peter O'Toole plays the role of which his name is most associated with and is surprising for me that he made the role his own because before I got a chance to see this movie I imagined a man opposite from someone like Peter O'Toole.  Omar Sharif as Ali is one of the most charismatic characters in film history.  I will not say anymore about the cast because I'm allowed only 1000 words to use in my comment.Will all do respect to classics such as Gone With The Wind and even Bridge on the River Kwaithis is without a doubt the most exciting epic of all time.

Watch it on the biggest and best screen available to you turning up the sound to movie theater volume. Additionally the scene won't be appreciated unless you watch LAWRENCE OF ARABIA from the very beginning including The Overture.The scene begins at night just before sunrise. Lawrence and his army have succeeded in crossing the sun's anvil portion of the Nefud desert. Lawrence then notices there is a camel with no rider. It is Gassim's camel perhaps Gassim fell asleep and fell off the camel and could not catch the camel in time to remount? Lawrence decides to turn back and rescue Gassim if that is the case.This is where the scene begins. It ends when Lawrence completely exhausted looks at the ground and falls onto a mat into a deep sleep. Everything that happens in between is the most enjoyable piece of cinematic art I've ever seen and is now there for you to discover and enjoy. This is all I will reveal.".

You can't get more spectacular than the scenery in this film. Hands down a huge 1010 for what they did with the cast and scenery. The story is simple enough and based on a true story of World War II British soldier who finds himself conflicted on who he is truly fighting for when he becomes entangled with the Bedouin armies of Arabia. I also realize that this is an epic and that being said and being filmed in the sixties historical epics were known to be lavish productions. I watched this film on a 2 disk DVD and at the end of the first DVD I was so pleased I almost wanted to watch it again and again and slap a perfect score on it. I would have been just as happy to have it end right there. But as it turned out there was another disk with an hour and a half on it adding the total running time to an outstanding 3 12 hours and I have nothing against that unless it's not necessary. I found the last part of this film very unnecessary it dragged it bogged down the story and I found it quite confusing. Yes I understand that it brought about T.E. Lawrence's conflicted opinions about the war but it just almost felt like an anticlimax and sadly brought the film down for me.Veteran actor in his screen debut Peter O'Toole plays Lawrence. I think O'Toole perfectly captures everything Lawrence was meant to stand for. O'Toole as Lawrence is conceited young naive bull headed and has great delusions of grandeur which he uses to win over the Arabians. On top of these less than desirable traits Lawrence has incredible charisma and leadership qualities and O'Toole is the same way. At first he seems almost smug and monotone but the more you watch him the more he electrifies the screen and you become enamored with him. I don't know if that's talent of a gift but either way he makes the film what it is. The incredible Sir Alec Guinness plays Prince Feisal the leader of one faction of the Arabian army who leaves his men to the trust of Lawrence after becoming enamored with him. It's not a big role but when Guinness is on screen he makes it larger than life. Anthony Quinn is the opposite leader Auda abu Tayi whom Lawrence brings together with Feisal's men to take Damascus away from the Turkish army. Quinn is much like Guinness who doesn't need a lot of screen time to make an impression. They are both worthy of royalty. And Omar Sharif is brilliant and intelligent as Sheriff Ali who becomes Lawrence's wing man and friend.The cast are all brilliant together the story is of epic proportions and the direction which was Academy Award winning by David Lean is nothing short of brilliance. It might possibly be one of the best directed films I have ever seen. It's simply breath taking. But so much extra is added that I'm just not sure it was necessary. Lawrence becomes so conflicted and ends up leaving them and it just seems to contradict everything he had done. Perhaps I am just being petty about it and I didn't like the ending but nonetheless the last hour and a half was too much for me. Still I don't regret for a minute seeing it and I encourage everyone to see this because even now it's spectacular to watch imagine how it felt more than 40 years ago. 8.510".

	schema:headline " Why this film is brilliant and it's not because of 70mm";
	schema:reviewBody "Note I talk about scenes in the film so there are MILD spoilers.Yes Lawrence of Arabia is remembered for desert vistas and sweeping battle scenes. The cinematography is unforgettable the scale vast. In many ways it defines epic but at the center of Lawrence of Arabia there is a real historical person who was also a hero worthy of classical Greek tragedies a man whose virtues are his downfall. A lot of people seem to miss this and often I think fans of the movie even miss quite why there is nothing else out there like it. Every aspect of the film from the narrative structure to the staging of shots revolves around exploring not just what T.E. Lawrence did but why he did it and what it cost him.The desert is a recurring image but it's not simply a stunning landscape. Shots linger on vast emptiness and suggest a blank canvas on which Lawrence can paint whatever he wishes. Profoundly alienated from his family and home culture Lawrence pulls on the robes and persona of the man he might have been if he'd been born an Arab. The deeper his insecurities reach the farther his ambitions must go. He conquers the desert and the desert conquers him demanding payment for every personal triumph.The desert and the visuals of Lawrence of Arabia work in relation to the narrative characters and themes in a way that would be impossible without 70mm film without the long lingering shots that make the desert itself a character. The desert shifts and changes shimmers and conceals as mysterious and indefinable as Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's performance is miragelike with emotions flickering and disappearing. Just as some shots linger on a vast and empty desert others linger on his face frozen in a moment of internal conflict.Director David Lean cuts together closeups and wideangle shots to reflect the dual nature of his film as vast epic and intimate portrait as when Lawrence journeys through the furnace heat of the desert to rescue a lost man. Consider the sequence. A speck in the distance Lawrence's eyes lit up in relief and vindication the man who has expected to die almost literally rising from the dead they move toward each other two specks becoming one and finally the impersonal specks become human beings again.Robert Bolt's screenplay is elegantly structured to show that the desert exacts a personal price for every public triumph and that Lawrence's inner and outer identity are constantly in conflict. Lawrence captures a Turkish seaport by crossing the Nefud desert but this success has required him to execute the very man whose life he just saved from the desert. Returning to Cairo to announce his military triumph he helplessly watches a young friend drown in quicksand. Grieving and stunned Lawrence approaches the Suez Canal and is seen by a British motorcyclist. To this man Lawrence is a speck on the horizon and when he calls Who are you? we know this is the very question Lawrence is asking himself. The more Lawrence accomplishes the more of a stranger he becomes to himself  an unknown speck in the desert within.Eventually Lawrence must come in from the desert and rejoin his own raceandclass divided culture. This time Bolt hides the theme of identity in a way that can only be noticed when the film is seen more than once. At the end of the war and the movie a British officer shouts racist insults and slaps Lawrence down to the ground because he is dressed in Arab garb. A few days later when Lawrence is wearing a British uniform this same officer is proud to shake Lawrence's hand.Still later  but seen at the opening of the film at Lawrence's funeral  this very British officer professes his great respect for Lawrence and berates a reporter who really did spend time with Lawrence for daring to be cynical about him. And the theme of identity comes full circle. Much as Lawrence fought for ideals his own people did not understand and against personal conflicts few would see Lawrence of Arabia remains a film of many secrets offering something new to discover on each viewing. It is the dual nature of Lawrence of Arabia as an epic and as a personal exploration of the mind that lifts it to a level of poetry made from images and dreams.Ironic that the film is like its hero often celebrated but rarely understood.".

Unfortunately the Cineplex Odean in Centuty City has been demolished to make way for a modern office complex. The demolition of this movie house coincides with the demolition of movie making in this town.The scene of Ali coming into view on the desert is the best piece of cinematography I have ever seen. This movie prompted my wife and I to travel through Syria Jordan and Israel where this movie takes place. I brought with me on this trip Lawrence's autobiography Seven Pillars of Wisdom. I used this book to instruct my car and guide to take me to all of the places that Lawrence visited in Syria and Jordan. I even hired a 4 wheel drive vehicle to take me into Wadi Rum the canyon that Lawrence sung Tum Te tum Te tum. The place really echoed. My Bedu driver took me to a cave at the end of the Wadi where I was introduced to a very old Bedouin who fought with Lawrence during the Arab Revolt. There was even graffiti on the wall of the cave written by Lawrence's followers.Before Lawrence involved himself in the Arab Revolt he lived among the Arabs in the land once called The Ottoman Empire which was administered out of Constantinople. His book discussed his visit to the most preserved Crusader Castle still in existence today in Syria north of Damascus Craque DE Chevalier where the Crusaders held off Saladin during a great siege.That movie and my visit will never be erased from my memory. Thank you Bob for that wonderful restoration.".

Then Emma finds out that she is already married to a man she's never met before a result of a misguided prank that leaves her bewildered and very confused. Worse than that her plans for the future are now threatened. With her wedding just around the corner Emma must find the mystery man and obtain an annulment. Emma tracks down her accidental husband  Patrick a charming and handsome neighborhood fireman with a big secret...that he was behind the accidental marriage.

Said girl loves a radio show hosted by a woman who's pretty disdainful towards the idea of romantic sweepyouoffyourfeetfairytale love. Even as a little girl she couldn't believe the happy ending. She even thought the lady and tramp were doomed to fail as a couple. So the fiance calls into the radio show and for some reason overtly pragmatic Dr. Emma tells her to call the wedding off. Of course this we don't actually realize until like minutes before the credits roll. Then fianc Patrick is all riled up and swears his revenge on Dr. Emma. Yet he's actually pretty passive about it... until a hacker friend decides to marry Patrick and Emma. This is an issue for Emma because she's about to marry her publisher Richard Colin Firth pretty much the only likable character in the film. He's madly in love with her. She's just settling for the secure yet notthemanofmydreamsbutofmyreality. You can guess where it goes from there. They forcibly meet about two times and he's suddenly ready to confess to his friend that he's falling for her. For whatever reason she thinks she's in love with him too and even calls off her wedding until she realizes what he did. She goes back to her old fianc and he welcomes her with open arms. They're both happy until Patrick calls Emma's radio show and says he's in love with her on the day prior to her wedding. So the next day it turns out Richard didn't file the annulment papers and they're not getting married.And that is the amount of depth with which the story is told. I was honestly hoping for Emma to marry Richard and send immature idiotic Patrick to the curb. He was just not a likable character. But then again neither was she. So maybe it was a good pairing after all. But not a good movie. Not a comedy as I didn't laugh once. And certainly not a romance. Not by a long shot.Sam.".

I enjoy a feelgood romantic comedy as much as the next person Probably more than many blokes but the biggest problem with The Accidental Husband is that it misfires on every front. Uma Thurman can be a good actress however she can also overplay things very easily and this is a perfect example. However how well she played the part is essentially irrelevant as the best actress would not have been able to save this mess.For starters The Accidental Husband is replete with some of the worst 'RomCom' clichs but they alone do not a bad movie make. The biggest problem is that the two romantic leads illicit no sympathy and have littletono chemistry with a completely shallow and trivial story that makes them unlikable. The character of Patrick Sullivan Jeffrey Dean Morgan is supposedly deeply in love with Sofia Justina Machado. She breaks up with him on the basis of advice from radio loveguru Dr. Emma Lloyd Uma Thurman. The next thing we know he is falling for EmmaAfter the ohsoamusing 'accidental husband' revenge scenario which he was petty enough to carry out after being dumped with nary a glance back at Sofia. Take in contrast Richard Bratton Colin Firth who loves Emma but realises she doesn't feel the same about him gives her time to make her mind up and is even eventually decent enough to let her go and be happy with Patrick on their wouldbe wedding day. So we are supposed to cheer on the man who is fickle enough to decide he's deeply in love with one woman only to forget about her and fall for another shortly after over a man who is patient and understanding? Not to mention Emma being our romantic lead who happily sleeps with Patrick before she breaks up with Richard And even changes her mind and stays with Richard till the point just before the wedding. There's not a lot else to say except that for a romantic comedy this falls flat in almost every way. The few humorous moments are limited to the character of Deep Ajay Naidu. Instead of being left with a smile at its conclusion I was left with a slightly sour taste. A better title would perhaps have been The Lucky Escapes for the characters of Sofia Who seems to have made the right decision and Richard for escaping a life with a fickle and untrustworthy wife. It would have made for a much more interesting romance to see those two characters as the leads who end up together!".

I was impressed with an exchange between Jeffrey and Colin's characters which was unusually realistic for this sort of movie.Some commentators have expressed displeasure at the fate of Colin's character because they like the actor but it is only a character.The involvement of the Indian family was slightly curious but enjoyable and Ajay Naidu put in a solid performance as Deep.If you are after a RomCom and you can cope with a bit of logical nonsense you should find this an enjoyable diversion.".

I was impressed with an exchange between Jeffrey and Colin's characters which was unusually realistic for this sort of movie.Some commentators have expressed displeasure at the fate of Colin's character because they like the actor but it is only a character.The involvement of the Indian family was slightly curious but enjoyable and Ajay Naidu put in a solid performance as Deep.If you are after a RomCom and you can cope with a bit of logical nonsense you should find this an enjoyable diversion.";

Initially the movie focuses on Sophia a confused woman looking for love and not finding it with her fianc. Although on screen for barely five minutes she easily establishes herself as a very likable character. While watching the movie I secretly kept wishing it had been about her life and not Emma and Patrick's. But I digress.Although terribly clichd what the movie does do is pull from the Hollywood stereotype that when a person Emma ditches one man Richard for someone else Patrick everyone is okay with the result. This movie shows the true story of two unlikable and confused people making selfish decisions and leaving a very nice man devastated. Although the conclusion is a tad more depressing than your average Hollywood film it is honest. This separates it somewhat from the Hollywood clich.If you like Uma Thurman you will like this movie. If you're looking for a fresh romantic film with a true happy ending skip it. 510".

	schema:headline " Real Jewish humour!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is often compared to LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and with good reason. They are both comedies that take on the treacherously delicate subject of the Holocaust. Also Benigni turned down the opportunity to make this film and then borrowed the idea of a Holocaust comedy to make his film.  Which is fine with me because in his hands the film would have sunk into offensive silliness.  Benigni is Italian which means he is great at Italian humour.  But he hasn't an idea as to what real Jewish humour is like.  This film is a quintessentially Jewish film.  It is about the old world Jewish experience that can only be understood and articulated by a Jew with old world roots.   Unfortunately much of the old world Jewish lifestyle and humour has been lost to recent generations.  To some viewers the characters in this film may seem like characters out of FIDDLER ON THE ROOF.  But despite the broad characterizations for the benefit of Jewish humour the characters here are all quite human and honest. Jewish humour by the way depends on flagrant exaggeration and waggish expression.  The film even uses a great analogy of this when it explains that Yiddish is basically German with a sense of humour.  Take away the exaggerated humour and you've got basic German. The story is about the inhabitants of a French shtetl Jewish village who decide to deport themselves to Palestine before the Nazis come and deport them to concentration camps.  They buy a train tailor a few dozen Nazi uniforms and flee across the continent sidestepping real Nazis and French resistance fighters who think that the train of Jews is a Nazi train.  There is a subplot involving an outbreak of communism among some of the Jews on the train that gets a little tired.  But then that does live up to the film's title.  This train of life is a microcosm of society with all of its pettiness and shortsightedness.This is a beautiful film that is much funnier and bittersweet than LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL without the unnecessary manipulations to pull on our heartstrings. For those who want to taste the real Jewish experience I recommend this highly!ADDENDUM  There are many who feel that it is sacrilege to make any type of comedy about the Jewish experience during WWll.  To make light of suffering or to drastically bend or cover up the truth for the sake of entertainment is sacrilege.  But this film does not do any of those things.  It retains the humour and the dignity of a culture that was almost made extinct.  It provides us with a great tribute to the spirit and perseverance of those people.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's amazing how many people seem to be complaining about the unrealism of this film.  Given that anyone with two brain cells to rub together can see that the film is not trying to be realistic from scene 1 onwards the question is not whether the film tried to be realistic and failed but whether a film about the Holocaust must try to be realistic to be any good.The trouble is that unless as part of the performance the entire audience is deported in cattletrucks slowly starved and then gassed it is rather difficult to see how any film can be realistic about the Holocaust. So if there are to be movies about the Holocaust at all or if they are to do much beyond telling us that the Holocaust was ghastly we knew that didn't we?they have to give up on trying to be realistic and try to look at the Holocaust in an indirect way.  This is where I think Train de Vie succeeds for example by the deliberate parallels between the society inside the train and the society that helped caused the Holocaust.  I could list them at length but if you've seen the movie and didn't notice them you won't be convinced by anything I say and if you haven't seen the movie I'd rather leave you the pleasure of discovering them for yourself.I never actually thought of the film's relation to Life is Beautiful until reading the IMDB comments after I'd seen both films.  Well it's very hard to compare the two films but I don't think Train de Vie needs to be ashamed of the comparison.  True Roberto Benigni does not star in it and that is a heavy handicap for any film.  On the other hand I think I like the exuberant unreality of Train de Vie better.  After all the portrayal of the Holocaust in Life is Beautiful is just as unrealistic as that of Train de Vie the only difference is that Train de Vie revels from the first sceneto the last in its unreality.  If we must be unreal let us at least enjoy it.".

The village fool Shlomo comes up with the idea to purchase a locomotive train some of the villagers to talkactdress like Nazis and head for Palestine in hopes they can fool the real Nazis. Okay the premise is far fetched. That's a given. But for this film it works. The closeknit village buys into the plan and sets to work creating the ruse. Shlomo rises about his village idiot persona and finds new worth. The fake Nazi commander Mordechai begins to take his role a little too literally. There's a subplot about some of the young men converting to Communism. And a small band of resistance workers who try to blow up the train. But the star of this film is not one person it is the village. They've banded together to survive which isn't lost amid the humor. There's true fear and hope. Some may feel the villagers are made fun of and lampooned but there's a healthy respect for the Jewish customs and family closeness in this film. Watch the scene where the villagers prepare for the Sabbath during their journey and you'll see what I mean. Too many films to count have focused on the reality of the Holocaust. There's no deny that it was a horrific event that should never be forgotten. This film does not desecrate or abandon that truth. It simply adds a new dimension worth exploring.".

How this peculiar escape plan with all odds against success develops is just an excuse for portraying how war religion prejudice ideologies etc end up affecting the life of simple people. Only that instead of watching an emotionallyfilled movie which is Ok to me but its not the only way to tell a sensitive story we are presented with this in a more subtle way as a townspeople tale where each of these realworld factors is reflected  in a mocked twisted funny way inside the train environment. Communist dogma nazi's 'ethnic order' social privileges military commands everything from which this community was isolated is suddenly 'infecting' people on the train of course with absurd consequences that go against the very goal of the community life  just the same effect the outsidetrain world is suffering.I'm not trying to say this is the one and only intention of the movie yet it is what I value the most. As for the rest of it being a tale of townspeople its characters are stereotyped yet intimate and natural in their motivations from the music to the dialogs and comic situations nothing is forced here. And you can end up laughing at the oddity of all this world while thinking of just how tragically resembling of our own real world it is  something the ending just reinforces.Whether you choose to see all this as a marvelous tale or as an offense to common sense is up to you but certainly there is a lot more to be watched throughout this story than its ending or its historical correctness.

Both movies talk about Holocaust in a humorous way. But unlike Benigni Radu Mihaileanu a Jew himself acknowledged in his movie that the way the Jews felt the war was very different than how other felt it the Italians for instance even if some of them shared similar experiences Benigni's fathers spent two years in a concentration camp. Mihaileanu's Jews in their attempt to escape sure death used Jewish wisdom collaborated in a Jewish fashion and laughed at Jewish jokes. Yes they laughed a lot at Nazis of course and equally at themselves. We the spectators laughed we them. What happens when a Jew tells the story of Gypsies' Holocaust experience? Mihaileanu tried it.

The various emotions that the movie evokes often depending on the viewer's own mood at the time allow the movie to be watched repeatedly and for new levels of meaning to reveal themselves. Roberto Benigni may have stolen the concept of Life is Beautiful from Mihaileanu's Train de Vie but the films cannot be compared. Whereas Benigni glibly believes that love and laughter can conquer all even the Holocaust Mihaileanu understands that they can only help one survive separately from the more practical and real danger of physical death. In other words love and laughter are directly part of the point of Life is Beautifulends in themselvesa somewhat offensive concept. In Train de Vie on the other hand they are on the side and only serve as foils as means to ends.

Humor is one of the secrets of Jewish survival and even in the darkest times as WWII Jews tried to cope with the situation with a mix of faith resolution and a unique humor that survived and helped them survive the times. Radu Mihaileanu's film is a fantastic story of hope and dreams in horrific times. The idea is good and original with an ending fifteen minutes that pay back some of the viewers hard time in the mid of the film. There are a lot of good things to be seen here but also a lot of slow pace and conventional cinema sometimes even bad cinema. The film is moving and emotional but more at the abstract level. Too many of the characters on the screen belong to the Jewish positive stereotypes descended directly from 'Fiddler on the Roof'. Acting is good but even the best actors could hardly overcome the schematic approach of the script. The secondary plot of the sudden exposure of the close shtetl society to the nonJewish world is treated in a way too much similar to some of the BashevisSinger books and deserves much more than the simplicist approach given to it in this filmIt is always worth making and seeing films that show the Holocaust from different perspectives. 'Train de vie' is neither the best nor the worst of them. 710 on my personal scale.".

Obviously the plot was only a basis for director and cowriter Peter Lichtefeld that gave him the opportunity to convey a certain feeling of melancholy. And this he managed excellently.Personally I share his fascination for everything that has to do with trains. So I was quite an appreciative audience for his movie. But I think Lichtefeld also generally transmits that wonderful roadmovie atmosphere of long and arduous journeys especially in trains and by including myths of the Inari lake the place where the main character heads to on the one hand and a  completely unmotivated  crime mystery on the other hand he even manages to create suspense and fidgety excitement. You get a notion that something great is behind all this although to be honest there isn't. Zugvgel is a film for romantic dreamers and for train fans like me. It is not a thoughtful reflexion of the arduous ways of our lives or so.The actors are well chosen Joachim Krl is Germany's melancholy man number one. Outi Menp is exotic enough to tear him out of his apathy although we never know what exactly it is that attracts them to each other. Peter Lohmeyer plays the thoughtful detective that uses the psychological approach to find the wrong criminal. And  SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER!  Nina Petri is a secretary so erotically rakish from the start that of course she turns out to be the real killer in the end  END OF SPOILER .I had hoped to see a little more of the picturesque Finnish landscape.

	schema:reviewBody "Zugvgel  ... einmal nach Inari or Trains'n'Roses or Train Birds is a German movie from 1998 so it will have its 20th anniversary next year. The writer and director is Peter Lichtefeld and it is probably by far the man's most known work. I do believe that the film has certainly its strengths in terms of the screenplay but the best moments are not as memorable as the weakest moments unfortunately. Until the point where the boss gets killed right after the protagonist was in his office it is still somewhat believable but honestly this is enough for the entire film. Then we have a cop who stops doing his job basically only to make friends and get closer to our hero and the ending with the truck route feels really false sadly. I know there is an emotional note to it but it was Weber's big big dream to win this competition and then he sacrifices it for the sake of it. And he knew it all even if it's just 3 minutes or so eventually looking at the smile on his lips. Quite a pity these moments sunk an otherwise solid film with decent performances. Krl was one of Germany's biggest stars at that point and while he did not get the nomination this time with the German Film Awards Lohmeyer in his 30s playing the cop did and he took home the prize too one of the biggest awards of his career. It is a relatively short film at 80 minutes only but that's not a problem at all. I think for the first half it was a pretty decent watch but the turns they took in the second half just disappointed me to an extent where I could not recommend this movie and I don't think you should check it out. Thumbs down. There are many films that combine German characters in a bit of a culture clash with other countries Asia pretty frequently for Doris Drrie for example and here we have the defining FinnishGerman film perhaps. Quite a pity. Finland deserves better than this overall.".

It is not Citizen Kane but it is a heartwarming tearjerker. The part where Eddie teaches her how to sing and the ending almost brought me to tears. Thomas Haden Church's character was hilarious the competition and the scenes with his son had everyone in the theater howling. This is an awesome movie cant wait to buy it on Blu Ray.

The business meetings Murphy went to and various discussions about same were certainly not down to children's levels and a lot of kids in the cinema clearly got quite restless including some of ours at least one of whom complained about the movie being boring. But when Murphy went on his comedy antics it was a bit too juvenile for adults. I thought Eddie was great as was Yara Shahidi as the young girl in an absolutely lovely natural performance while Thomas Haden Church was amusing as the fake Indian. But what was with the imaginary friends?? Were they real? If not how did the girl get all the right information about the businesses? If they were... well... the film didn't seem to relay that.

Performances on a whole are sincere subdued for Murphy and convincing unlike similarly plotted stories like Disney's The Game Plan Imagine That never gets to the point of annoying which is becoming a more and more difficult feat for formulaic yet effective children's features.Focused driven and always in control Evan Danielson Eddie Murphy is a financial wizard organizing and leading his many clients in the direction of monetary prosperity. This doesn't leave much time for his sevenyearold daughter Olivia Yara Shahidi who is socially detached and dependent on her security blanket named GooGaa that transports her to an imaginary world with princesses and dragons. It's all in her mind but when Evan plays along Olivia's invisible friends miraculously produce accurate advice on stocks investments and insider tips. Suddenly he's immersed in his daughter's invented fantasy forcing himself to redefine his relationship with Olivia and the meaning of true success.I imagine it was a lot of fun to watch Evan remarks after undergoing his inevitable earlymovie mental breakdown. That might be a slightly generous statement in regards to the entire film which maintains a worthwhile level of lighthearted humor and fatherdaughter relationshipmending drama. It isn't overly preachy even though at times it's sickly sweet Murphy's likable Evan is a man who wanted kids but probably shouldn't have had one especially considering his relatable lack of time and subsequent failure to connect with his daughter. Learning to be a better parent through success and defeat with initial manipulation followed by quality bonding the process is understandably generic  the blueprints for this family flick aren't original but definitely more watchable than similar exploits that can't seem to include any mature bits for older crowds such as the parental audience assumed to be present with children.Supporting character actor Ronny Cox plays a role comparable to his famous villain turns in Robocop and Total Recall and Thomas Haden Church steals many scenes as Johnny Whitefeather a competitive financial executive who exaggeratingly mocks Native American culture with creatively hilarious quotes and unorthodox meditative methods for gaining stock market knowledge It's not the paint that makes the warrior he advises Evan along with constant references to the dream sparrow insulting little elk nicknames and other funny Indian riffs. He's quite convincingly phony. There's nothing artificial about the film as a whole however which makes Imagine That quality family amusement even if it doesn't exude total originality.Mike Massie".

This movie makes me want to go find an imaginary person and become friends with them.Awesome.";

	schema:reviewBody "Eddie Murphy's newest comedy Imagine That does not have the painfully low amount of laughs as Meet Dave or the extreme offensiveness of Norbit. In fact it does have one or two laughs and it's kind of sweet and certainly not offensive. That said even this Eddie Murphy vehicle can't stop my belief that by now Eddie Murphy should be flipping burgers somewhere. When I say one or two laughs I mean I got a quiet haha every 55 minutes of the movie and it's 110 minutes. The sweetness comes from the fact that Eddie Murphy is a jerk to his daughter and then is all of a sudden nice to her. Don't worry that's not even actually sweet he just does it so he can get a promotion. The only real entertainment and not funny or sweet entertainment comes from Thomas Haden Church as Johnny Whitefeather Evan Danielson Eddie Murphy's business rival with a weird way of business. Unfortunately he's only in a couple of scenes. The two laughs come from Bobbe J. Thompson the kid who played the foulmouthed Ronnie in Role Models as a kid offered easy money and who denies it. The second laugh is Johnny getting his son hopped up on red bull so he can use the same skill Evan uses for his business predictions. This is not a good movie by any means but if you want to see a bad Eddie Murphy film then this is the best bad Eddie Murphy film you can get. Unlike his previous films instead of being horrible it's just mediocre.".

While watching this movie it started to remind me of a kids movie that Eddie Murphy was in a few years ago called 'Daddy Day Care.' I liked 'Daddy Day Care' a lot more than 'Imagine That' i don't know if it's because i was younger then but I still wouldn't say that 'Imagine That' is a horrible movie.

This movie isn't all bad just not up to Murphy's standards. Imagine That has a likable enough premise. It's innocuous enough for kids to probably like and tolerable for adults. Its predictability is extremely high but it manages to be just cute enough to pass the time in a decent manner. One of the biggest compliments I can give this movie is the chemistry between Eddie Murphy  Yara Shahidi was a treat to watch with one another. Thomas Haden Church is funny as per usual whist Martin Sheen has a brief but classy role. Final Thoughts I don't remember much about this movie to be honest with you. I just remember it passing the time better than I thought but ultimately felt slightly flat when it was all said and done. 510".

This movie isn't all bad just not up to Murphy's standards. Imagine That has a likable enough premise. It's innocuous enough for kids to probably like and tolerable for adults. Its predictability is extremely high but it manages to be just cute enough to pass the time in a decent manner. One of the biggest compliments I can give this movie is the chemistry between Eddie Murphy  Yara Shahidi was a treat to watch with one another. Thomas Haden Church is funny as per usual whist Martin Sheen has a brief but classy role. Final Thoughts I don't remember much about this movie to be honest with you. I just remember it passing the time better than I thought but ultimately felt slightly flat when it was all said and done. 510";

	schema:reviewBody "Some people love to believe fiction and be affected by it. As long as it's for instance a movie's story it's good. But when it concerns something out of the movie precisely about it then this is really bad. Because when it comes to Imagine That everybody hated it without seeing it believing the false reputation of it as ugly. So imagine that ! It's one of Eddie Murphy's family comedies. Namely something without swearing toilet humor and sex jokes which is the type he mostly practices as a profession since the 2000s start. While this is optimistic and lovely how it is done is the question. And here it is fairly done.The character which Murphy plays is simply a man who doesn't listen to his child daughter. He goes to a journey that makes him just listen. It has also a fantasy spirit comic moments different antagonist hot pace and relaxing feel. I did enjoy it.Murphy is perfect being astonishing while doing nothing. He has really funny scenes like  having unique dinner made by his kid his bargaining  failed one!  with a kid and his sneaking into the home of his kid's friend. The conflict was on between him and the character played by Thomas Haden Church who  by the way  played one of his most memorable roles. The sequence of the Beatles's All we need is love was shot so beautifully it's euphoric and sentimental. The whole movie seems like a cute effort with a message for parents as if made by their kids. However it wasn't all top notch.The 7 year old Yara Shahidi who played the imaginative kid was straightly bad. Aside from her weak presence she played her part dully so how about being in front of the forever energetic Murphy. Most of the time she gives a less than expected performance like she's reading the dialog uninterestingly. Sure all the kids who played roles in front of Murphy before were more charismatic and talented. That annoyed much since this movie has no one but Shahidi and Murphy for most of its time. Yes the comedy wasn't about farts private parts and the like. But it wasn't a lot either. This script played the movie as a fun day between a father and his kid. The laughs were few and the rest was about flimsy chuckles. It clearly needed more funny situations and dialog.The third act suffered some obviousness and predictability. For instance the father of the kid's friend overreacted couple of times in terms of dealing with the hurried Murphy. The way the antagonist lost the conflict was forced and unconvincing he was too wise to do what he did at the last weighty meeting. Master of businessmen Marin Sheen's reaction towards Murphy's actions at the end was easy to predict for having a happy ending anyhow. And although the song scene was good but the matter of a climax where the dad leaves his work and goes to his kids preferring soul  family love on material  money is too conventional and wornout having been done in numerous movies lately. Anyway Imagine That is a little movie watchable meaningful and nice. Its important message is delivered wickedly without listening to your kid you won't succeed and it's true. Believing fiction can be so well to do unless when it comes to this movie's reputation. It undeservingly got harsh treatment from everybody. And the lesson here is  don't blindly believe the reviewers they can be blind themselves !".

Evan and her mother are divorced and we can quickly see that Evan's career ambitions usually command his full attention and his relationship with his daughter comes in a very distant second.That in fact if the thrust of the story the fatherdaughter relationship and how Evan might repair it.

It's a very funny criticism of advertising and the way it's made. I feared it would not do justice to Beigbeder's excellent book but in fact it's quite good.Most of all Jean Dujardin is very good in his role. He could be one of those mens you see working at Publicis on the champs Elysees ! Some people may not like the movie because there is a lot of sex and drug taking inside the movie.

That does not mean much because it is obviously a subjective remark but there is a plot you can enjoy and enough creativity in the montage and the way the film is made to obtain an original product. Visually it is new and good. It is all very artistic and graphic without hindering the scenario. You get to see the beauty of superficiality and the cold hard reality of depression and drug abuse behind excessive behaviors. It is a succession of canvases with an elaborate plot. The acting is just great Jean Dujardin Vahina Giocante... and you follow the characters into their life introspection without doubting a second of how much real they all are. Paradoxically you will laugh. The few appearances of the author F. Beigbeder are you could think to remain you of the fact that this film was inspired from a book since you tend to forget that fact and enjoy a new story. There are so much novelty in the narration that you enjoy the film with a new eye as a new story. If you read the book you'll find some nice reminder and an inch of novelty to adapt the film to 2007. If you have never heard of the book you will have a nice display of the secrets of how to sell anything through commercials thanks to the advertising business. You will also get to grasp the meaningless of it all. The film is slightly political but it does not force your judgment with subliminal messages and readymade ideas. That way it's always entertaining. It's sometimes a loud movie but it's definitely worth the ticket seat. This film is truly original and provides a real cinema experience.".

This astonishingly lame ending undermines any value the movie might have had.I suppose the altruistic blurb at the end of the movie is the kind of palliative the filmmakers needed to include in order to convince themselves that their movie has a higher moral purpose. The question is why do they even bother? In reality it is just a story about a narcissistic selfloathing fashion victim who sees the error of his ways. The great irony of course is that had they spent all their time and money on charitable projects instead of making this movie they could have contributed much more to ending world hunger.Himself an excreative adviser for an ad agency Beigbeder wrote 99 Francs under the encouragement of another famous French author Michel Houellebecq. Octavo the main character hoovers cocaine in rails forming the numbers 666 pops whatever pills he can get his hands on screws hookers drives under the influence and  in his spare time works for France's most powerful ad agency as a creative adviser.

The movie offers two endings  one happy one sad  and they both have him renouncing his consumerist lifestyle one treats him as a Christlike martyr the other has him living out a Rousseauian backtonature fantasy on an island. Grade school stuff I know but not so awful as it sounds.In the adept hands of Jan Kounen the movie is visuallyengaging rhythmic and yes entertaining. The problem is the story. Just like the book the overall feeling is one of disingenuousness. Remember the scene in Fight Club where Tyler Durden goes on about the superficiality of our consumer lifestyle? You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fing khakis. Somehow a hothit guy dressed in fashionable clothes isn't the most convincing of anticonsumerism preachers. That's kind of what happens in 99 Francs.Even with the main character's redemption 99 Francs gives the impression that it is more intent on looking cool than trying to open people's eyes to the evils of consumerism.

	schema:headline " Pydjhaman rules the world !";
	schema:reviewBody "The first question that comes to mind when you ear about this project is  what the hell is Jan Kounen doing as a director of such a movie ? Jan Kounen was a french talented and trendy director of the 90's just as his friend Matthieu Kassovitz. He released Doberman when Kasso brought La Haine on french screens. But after this violentcartoon movie Jan Kounen had discovered Shamanism while directing his experimental trip out of the blues Blueberry and then made a documentary about inner journey and other substantial trips. 99 Francs on the other hand is an autofiction by the french intellectual bobo Beigbeider that narrates his experience as a publicist in a satirical and fashionable style. So my question was  what's the link between this director and this book and what the hell is Jan Kounen doing as a director of such a movie ?First from a factual point of view Kounen and the main and incredibly credible actor of the movie Jean Dujardin have themself been publicists and decided to take the book as a starting point and to go on completely different directions. Beigbeder who appears several times in the movie agreed to this betrayal. But this critic of the advertising world isn't the best part of the movie and only seems to be a support for more experimental journey that only drugs can give.The character of the movie inhales himself several time a gargantuesque quantity of cocaine unknown pills and other drugs that makes him have gigantic visions that the movie emphases. A large parts of the movie is just a description of absurd visions that links the cartoon and trash violence of Doberman with the experimental form of Bluebberry in the funny and cool package of a critic of advertising and a large public comedy. The best part of 99 Francs is to me an improbable escape to the tropical forest of Bluebberry with Jan 'Pydjhaman' Kounen like guide. If Yan Kounen defines is movie as the Yogourt Fight Club the film is also near from Gilliam's more experimental and crazy works.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first question that comes to mind when you ear about this project is  what the hell is Jan Kounen doing as a director of such a movie ? Jan Kounen was a french talented and trendy director of the 90's just as his friend Matthieu Kassovitz. He released Doberman when Kasso brought La Haine on french screens. But after this violentcartoon movie Jan Kounen had discovered Shamanism while directing his experimental trip out of the blues Blueberry and then made a documentary about inner journey and other substantial trips. 99 Francs on the other hand is an autofiction by the french intellectual bobo Beigbeider that narrates his experience as a publicist in a satirical and fashionable style. So my question was  what's the link between this director and this book and what the hell is Jan Kounen doing as a director of such a movie ?First from a factual point of view Kounen and the main and incredibly credible actor of the movie Jean Dujardin have themself been publicists and decided to take the book as a starting point and to go on completely different directions. Beigbeder who appears several times in the movie agreed to this betrayal. But this critic of the advertising world isn't the best part of the movie and only seems to be a support for more experimental journey that only drugs can give.The character of the movie inhales himself several time a gargantuesque quantity of cocaine unknown pills and other drugs that makes him have gigantic visions that the movie emphases. A large parts of the movie is just a description of absurd visions that links the cartoon and trash violence of Doberman with the experimental form of Bluebberry in the funny and cool package of a critic of advertising and a large public comedy. The best part of 99 Francs is to me an improbable escape to the tropical forest of Bluebberry with Jan 'Pydjhaman' Kounen like guide. If Yan Kounen defines is movie as the Yogourt Fight Club the film is also near from Gilliam's more experimental and crazy works.";

	schema:headline " An honest movie that gets tangled up in what it tries to point out";
	schema:reviewBody "I never read the book of Beigbeder and so I was eager to see the movie after hearing many positive views on the book and knowing that the visuals of a Kounen Movie will be great. I didn't expect this movie to be so much of a comedy because the subject is rather tough. Anyway I think 99 francs works really good on the level of a satire and it captures the deeply rooted cynicism that is implanted in the world of marketing and PR in my opinion you can't work in this industry without becoming a total cynic very well. I just loved the honesty in how the meetings and decisions were described as masturbation and how the main actors spend most of their time being high on drugs and their ego. Since the subject is so damn messed up I think approaching and ridiculing it with comedic elements made the movie more enjoyable. You will get many good laughs as well as following the comedy some direct punches to the stomach. All served in perfect visuals with loads of great ideas melting the flashbacks and development of main character Jean Dujarding together. The movie starts of practically with its end and then fastrewinding to the beginning of how Jean ended up in Marketing but Jeans back story is shown in a very superficial way. You don't really know too much of him and rather see him on his job with his overthetop cynic boss Marc and his slacker colleague Charlie. Like in every movie it takes a woman in the form of trainee Tamara to get the humanity out of Jeans character. They start an affair but when Tamara gets pregnant things get too serious and Jeans cynical world starts to implode leading to more and more harsh pictures breaking up the colorful advertising world.Until the first ending I think the movie already made its point by presenting a fake world of cynics with their ridiculous everyday life and how they feel like gods. Unfortunately someone had the messed up idea of presenting the movie with an alternate ending so you get a very long second version... I get the idea of making fun of how things usually turn out in Hollywood movies and in a perfect adworld but I think 99francs really messes up its whole intention. Guess what you get an alternative ending in which Jean finds his humanity and moves to a tropical island finding his peace and love. Yes we know that advertising and Hollywood clichs are superficial but that point was made before and by playing with the rules even when making fun of them the movie gets entangled in what it wants do criticize and to my understanding falls flat on his face not even stopping from letting you leave the movie with a preachy message printed on the screen.Its kind of like making the whole movie again and then telling the viewer what to think and in that its more of what it criticizes than it was supposed to be. That is really a shame because the movie is filled with eye openers and visual gimmicks that make it fun to watch although the last part kind of dragged for me. So still 99francs is recommended viewing especially for everyone who doesn't work in or near the marketing industry. But I wished the movie left the viewer with a hard and direct punch to the face and thoughts spinning in his head to come to his own conclusion and not some hahahafun ending with a preachy moral presented like in a World Aid spot.".

I felt like I was treated like a 10 year old who has never seen a film or read a book or really knows nothing about the realities of the world. Actually it felt like the makers were 15 year old teens who felt like they wanted to set the record straight of what the advertising world reaaalllyyy is like. But the problem is that there was absolutely nothing new here. We've seen this stuff million times before.Like other reviewers have pointed out here this was apparently a successful book transformed to film. That explains a lot because usually it's really hard to achieve the atmosphere successfully. And this film tried really just too much. In a way I appreciate the franticness of the film and of course I do appreciate the obviously high production values but to me it was all just a waste. The knowledge of those can't erase the disappointing feeling the film gave me and that's why I only give it 3 stars.".

Zulu is a perfectly staged perfectly acted account of the British defence of Rorke's Drift where 139 British soldiers held off 4000 Zulu Warriors at the height of the AngloZulu War. Its strength is not in romanticism or over sentimentality in the name of glossy hard sell the crux lies with just being a tale of pure courage a tale of pure stoic heroism it sticks vigorously to the actual events and thus the film plays out with genuine honesty that few other War pictures can ever lay claim to.

The Natal location is stunning beautiful lush rolling hills dwarf this tiny outpost the sky a never ending eye witness to the courage unfolding Stephen Dade's photography perfectly capturing this colourful extravaganza.

John Barry's score is blood pumping to the maximum swirling strings collide with thumping base drums to give one the feeling of invincibility. Ernest Archer's art decoration Arthur Newman's costumes and of course the John Prebble screenplay that is Zulu's heart. I could go on and name everyone involved in this picture such is the admiration I have for the work involved. But really the story sells itself not a glossy British victory in sight this is not just another British fable of imperialistic fervour it's just a tale of bayonets with guts behind them and ultimately a story of when men really were men all in the line of duty.

On that day an epic battle was fought between 4000 Zulu warriors and approx. 100 British soldiers.Now I have noticed many of our American cousins have made remarks in their reviews of Zulu to the effect that the soldiers were nastypasty British Empire builders and that they all deserved to choke on their own vomit however the film does not try to justify the Zulu War or it's origins so I will not either suffice it to say that you shouldn't be expressing assumptions and opinions on nineteenth century political attitudes with such an obvious twentyfirst century viewpoint. They are two very different worlds which cannot be compared.This film is beautifully shot and scripted and the the John Barry musical score keeps the battle scenes moving well. It seems to makes the sometimes long periods of heavy fighting pass by quicker. Barry took authentic Zulu songs and chants and added the dramatic score around them to make an original and haunting theme which still ranks as one of his greatest film score offerings.Stanley Baker is fantastic as Lt. Chard the Royal Engineer who is able to use his skill in successfully fortifying the little hospital outpost against the onslaught of the foe.Micheal Caine plays Lt. Bromhead the professional line soldier and upper class officer who after a little whining and grumbling accepts his position of second in command and fights valiantly in the battle. It was this film that propelled Caine to international stardom so powerful was his performance. Other noted cast members include James Booth as an excellent but inaccurate Hook and Nigel Green as ColourSergeant Frank Bourne the typical Victorian Sergeantmajor complete with side whiskers and moustache.The Great Jack Hawkins who did not like the character he played or his work on the film portrayed Otto Witt the pacifist missionary with a drink problem and again it is another performance worthy of an award. It was upsetting however to hear in his voice his wonderfully clipped speaking voice the early effects of the throat cancer which had by this time plagued him for three years and which was eventually to lead to his death.Also special mention to Richard Burton who narrated the whole show. He truly had one of the best dramatic voices in the world and speaks his lines beautifully. It was also good to see the Zulu's portrayed with dignity and honour rather than just mere savages with bones through their noses. They were a brave and strong opponent that day and they are deserving of tribute as much as the British.The basis of this film is taken from historical fact although certain characters and events have either been altered erased or just plain fabricated for dramatic purposes. I hope that should any producers in the future be foolish enough to attempt a remake of this classic epic they will put historical accuracy first and Hollywood sensationalism second if at all.Enough has been said by others regarding the blatant slander of Private Henry Hook so I will not elaborate on it save that it was a gross slur on the bravest of men. I hope should the film ever be remade his honour will be restored and his gallant deeds on that day be portrayed accurately.To quash further popular myths none of the film is shot on the exact spot at which the battle took place the real Rorke's Drift was in fact about 60 miles from the location shoot.The regiment in question did not become the South Wales Borderers until two years after the battle and was at the time a Warwickshire Regiment. They were however based in Brecon which is where the Welsh connection was born and would explain why there was a higher amount of Welsh nationals attached to it.Despite this the regiment consisted mainly of Englishmen and only about 12 percent were in fact from Wales. With these demographics being how they are I can assure you Men of Harlech would not have been sung at Rorke's Drift at least not without the culprit being bayoneted by an Englishman with earache.Lt. Chard himself was an Englishman having been born in Plymouth into an established and respected Somerset family. This being the case I find it funny that although Stanley Baker never refers to Chard as a Welshman he none the less seems to revel in promoting Welsh pride at ever opportunity. Of the eleven V.C's won in the battle only three of them were awarded to Welshman so why the big Welsh message Boyo?Also the final salute made by the Zulu's did not occur. When they reappeared on the hill they returned with the sole intention of finishing off the gallant soldiers at the outpost but decided against it when they noticed a sizable relief column approaching Rorke's Drift from the south.Finally a few people have made references to ColourSergeant Frank Bourne wondering whether or not he really existed and if so why he was never awarded the V.C. for his conduct on the day. Yes he really existed and yes he did fight at Rorke's Drift. He was in fact recommended for a Victoria Cross but told the powers that be that he would rather have a promotion instead. This he was given along with a D.C.M and an O.B.E. He was the last surviving veteran of Rorke's Drift when he died on V.E. Day 8th May 1945 aged 91 and with a rank of Lt. Col.

	schema:reviewBody "A magnificent recreation of one of the most incredible battles in history Zulu depicts how less than 100 British soldiers held off an army of 4000 Zulu warriors. The battle follows a previous one less than a day before in which about 1200 British soldiers lost. This film really gives new meaning to the saying 'keep a stiff upper lip'  or 'never say die.' The British soldiers here led by Lieutenants played by Baker  Caine know full well the force coming against them they know what has already occurred. By rights they should beat a hasty retreat before the approaching army arrives. The film never delves into the reasons psychological or other of why the commanding officer is determined to remain beyond just the statement that he holds the queen's commission. It's a question that baffles the missionary Hawkins usually the stiff English officer in other films who begs them all to leave. The film seems to say when the moment comes no man really knows what he will do until it is upon him. Here the soldiers find out very quickly what they're made of. Cy Endfield the director manages to build some heady suspense before even the awesome battle scenes. The soldiers hear a strange sound in the distance like a train notes Caine. Now we no longer need wonder what 8000 feet on soil sound like. And it's not just the suspense the drama here is very effective. There are numerous sequences where Endfield manages to drive home a point that sticks in your mind for days  maybe years. Who can forget that simple act of turning over a wagon? The photography is superb capturing the vastness of the area and should be seen in widescreen glory. I've seen this film many times as a kid and of course these were standard TV showings I didn't know better it was one of my favorite films of all time regardless but it's twice as glorious in proper aspect ratio. I even had the privilege of seeing this on a theater screen once about 20 years ago and I was suitably blown away even knowing the story beforehand nowadays a DVD on a big screen TV is your best bet. The musical score is perfect as well. I can't imagine the film with anything different.When the fighting begins it's really breathless by that I mean there is one central action set piece when many of the Zulu warriors break through the ranks and threaten the inner compound including the officer in command. I always have to hold my breath during this sequence even though I've seen it 20 times it's that good. Every time a Brit soldier falls I think my God that's a good portion of the entire defending force! They can never make it! Yet they do several times. It's a relentless depiction of war battles never equaled as in The Alamo1960 another historical depiction of a small group against a much larger force  it's good but not even close. Somehow Endfield and whomever helped choreograph the action scenes managed to weld together the perfect combination of huge crowd battles and singular confrontations where it becomes a little personal.All the actors are first rate. Caine is terrific in his first major role. Baker is very solid  has to be  as the one in command. Booth  I know his character may not be historically accurate  but he's the most colorful and when he explodes into fullfledged heroism it's something to see. And Nigel Green as the sergeant  THAT's why the British ruled the world for a time! In fact all the supporting and minor roles are filled out excellently this was when script writing had to be extra professional. The much later prequel had no hope of comparing to this masterpiece but even that film was well done. Yes I'll say it one more time  this is a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "I cannot find words to fully express how perfectly formed this film is though I will of course make a good stab at it!I've seen Zulu so many times since it was first released that I have lost count. In the days when you could sit in the cinema and watch a film come round for a second or even a third time I always did this with Zulu. I bought the soundtrack when it came out on vinyl of course.From Stanley Baker  Michael Caine on through the cast list the acting is quite simply superb. This is an ensemble piece and the ensemble gives its all! Photographically it is beautifully conceived and executed. There is a tendency in 'war' movies to find a couple of favourite types of shot and then endlessly repeat them rather like a budgerigar that has learnt how to make his bell ring no danger of that here a whole lexicon of camera movements  angles is deployed with consummate skill so that you cannot watch this film without being fully engaged with it.But to cut to the chase what is so striking is that here is a movie that could so easily have been yet another 'duffing up the natives' actioner and instead becomes a vehicle for all sorts of interesting questions. Questions such as 'what is it to be a man?' and 'what is courage?' are posed and turned into interesting questions with complex and surprising answers.The way that Zulu culturesocial psychology is compared with that of the British soldiers is also deft and insightful. The cry of the drunken pastor you're all going to die echoes through the rest of the film as we see how the protagonists face death.Any review of this would be incomplete without mention of the music which is so wellsuited to the action. It forms a restless swirling and sometimes majestic backdrop to what is happening onscreen.The voiceovers which 'bookend' the film also underline that which is in any case clear from the narrative this film is no apologia for imperialism. Neither does it represent battle as other than bloody and painful murder. What is perhaps the most remarkable feature of the film is the way in which it damns war while neither grossing out nor alienating its audience. It is on the contrary an enthralling and passionate entertainment.One memorable visual moment occurs toward the end when the Zulus appear simultaneously on the skyline all round Rorke's Drift. Compare this with the appearance of the tanks on the skyline in 'The Battle of the Bulge'...P.S. beware as you always should TV showings or videos that are 'scanned' rather than in the original letterbox format cinematography this good does not deserve to be butchered!".

	schema:reviewBody "Its shameful noone makes films like ZULU anymore. In these PC dominated times there are those who may view this film as being racist  dealing with a heroic battle between white foreign troops against native black Africans during Victorian times. Nothing could be further from the truth. The zulus are rightly presented as being fearless and disciplined warriors ready to willingly die  than show cowardice. The only other criticism a modern day audience can level at the film is the fact that the battle scenes are slightly ungory compared to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and PLATOON. But so what ? How many other films compete with the excitement and tension of scenes like  the soldiers fighting off the hordes of zulus in the hospital building ? Would graphic disembowelment and decapitation improve these scenes ?  of course not.I could go on all day as to whats brilliant about ZULU  but I wont. But I will say that for me the greatest aspect of the film is John Barrys score. The fact that he never won an oscar for it just goes to show theres no justice in the world.Without doubt the greatest British film of the 1960s  probably the greatest British picture ever  and possibly the greatest film ever. Lets hope Hollywood never decides to remake it".

	onyx:emotionText "Its shameful noone makes films like ZULU anymore. In these PC dominated times there are those who may view this film as being racist  dealing with a heroic battle between white foreign troops against native black Africans during Victorian times. Nothing could be further from the truth. The zulus are rightly presented as being fearless and disciplined warriors ready to willingly die  than show cowardice. The only other criticism a modern day audience can level at the film is the fact that the battle scenes are slightly ungory compared to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and PLATOON. But so what ? How many other films compete with the excitement and tension of scenes like  the soldiers fighting off the hordes of zulus in the hospital building ? Would graphic disembowelment and decapitation improve these scenes ?  of course not.I could go on all day as to whats brilliant about ZULU  but I wont. But I will say that for me the greatest aspect of the film is John Barrys score. The fact that he never won an oscar for it just goes to show theres no justice in the world.Without doubt the greatest British film of the 1960s  probably the greatest British picture ever  and possibly the greatest film ever. Lets hope Hollywood never decides to remake it";

	schema:reviewBody "If you watch only the first two minutes of 'Zulu' it will be worth your while. The superbly dramatic theme music followed immediately by Richard Burton's striking Welsh narration are utterly entrancing. The rest of the film is not bad either!In January 1879 during the Boer War at Isandhlwana in South Africa over one thousand British troops are annihilated by King Cetshwayo's Zulu army. Standing between the four thousand Zulus and victory is the mission station at Rorke's Drift and about one hundred and forty British soldiers some of whom are wounded. Commanding the military operation is the young Lieutenant John Chard Stanley Baker also coproducer of the film with Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead Michael Caine in his first major film role. Against the unimaginable odds the British troops  the B Company of the 24th Regiment of Foot South Wales Borderers  manage with exceptional courage and stoicism to hold off the Zulu attacks until morning. The valour of the men defending Rourke's Drift resulted in the awarding of eleven Victoria Crosses. The roll of honour is recited by Richard Burton at the film's end.Baker and Caine are very convincing in the two lead roles as Chard and Bromhead the rival lieutenants from different social classes who come to respect and even like each other. Their first meeting emphasises the psychological as well as the physical distance between them. Chard the Engineer Officer in his shirtsleeves is up to his waist in water Bromhead the upperclass blueblood in his helmet and fine cloak is on horseback having just returned from hunting. However as the battle progresses this rivalry is forgotten as their prime concern is the job in hand. Their exchange when Chard is injured and Bromhead goes to his aid is telling. By the end of the film as they stand together in the burntout ruins of the hospital they are equals.The incredibly virile Stanley Baker one wants to say Fwhoar! every time he appears on screen coproduced the film because like most Welshmen he was extremely patriotic and wanted to publicise the bravery of the Welsh soldiers at Rorke's Drift. Michael Caine auditioned originally for the part of Hook but was offered instead the part of Bromhead as his looks were considered more suited to those of an upperclass officer than a Cockney private.Good support is given by the other actors in the supporting roles. James Booth as Private Henry Hook is probably the most memorable character portrayed historically inaccurately as the company ne'erdowell yet who wakes up to his duty at the moment of crisis and fights almost to the death. Jack Hawkins and Ulla Jacobssen are effective as the wellmeaning but naive fatheranddaughter missionaries the Witts. The outstanding bravery and selflessness of the other mainly Welsh soldiers is brought out by all the actors in the subordinate roles. What I think is very admirable about 'Zulu' is its lack of jingoism. Far from it crowing about British supremacy over the natives it portrays the bravery of the Zulus as equal to or even greater than that of the British. At the end of the battle there is no great rejoicing it was just a job which had to be done because they were there. In the ruins of the hospital when Chard asks Bromhead how he feels Bromhead replies Sick. Their dialogue continues Bromhead There's something else. I feel ashamed. Was that how it was for you? The first time?Chard First time? Do you think I could stand this butcher's yard more than once?Bromhead I didn't know. Chard I told you. I came up here to build a bridge.No more needs to be said.Although the character names and events are factual the film does sometimes sacrifice historical accuracy for dramatic effect. How much real rivalry there was between Chard and Bromhead is unclear  although it is true that Bromhead ceded command to Chard. Private Hook was not the thief and ne'erdowell as played by James Booth. Colour Sergeant Bourne was a short man and quite unlike Nigel Green in appearance. Most of the Victoria Cross winners were English not Welsh. And the film itself was shot not at Rorke's Drift but at a location some miles away.Interestingly neither Chard nor Bromhead lived to a great age. Both died in their forties Chard of mouth cancer in 1897 and Bromhead of fever on active service a few years before. Neither ever married. Nevertheless their names are immortalised in 'Zulu'  as are the deeds of the tremendously brave men Welsh English and Zulu at Rorke's Drift on 22nd23rd January 1879.".

	schema:headline " Possibly the greatest single battle film ever";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an incredible film. While there a few inaccuracies and some dramatic licenses on the whole the movie follows accounts of the battle accurately. It doesn't vilify the Zulu in fact it treats them with great respect for their bravery and devotion to their homeland. The bare facts are well known that Rorke's Drift was the jumping off point for the British invasion of Zululand and was a hospital and supply depot. It was defended by roughly one hundred men against some 4000 Zulu. Stanley Baker is outstanding as Lt Chard the senior officer at the fort who takes command despite being an engineer officer. Michael Caine is of course fantastic in his first big role as Lt. Bromhead. Nigel Green is superb as Colour Sergeant Bourne who received a promotion instead of a Victoria Cross and outlived all the other defenders. The cast of mostly Welsh actors really convey the desperation and bravery of the garrison. The biggest fault with the film is the total misrepresentation of Pvt Henery Hook as a malingerer in fact he was a good soldier and bravely risked his life to empty the hospital. The scenes of the post before the attack show soldiers at their worst in some ways especially the treatment of Margaretta Witt. The atmosphere and attitude change when the imminent threat of Zulu attack becomes a fact. Unlike the overconfident officers at Isandlhwana the inexperienced lieutenants build their defenses and set up ammunition supply to counter the assault. They respect their opponents and understand that they may be the last line of defense against a counterinvasion into Natal. The fighting is spectacularly filmed highlighting the bravery and resolve of the Zulu and the determination of the redcoats to survive and hold the fort. I was embarrassed to read the comments of certain Americans who have had their brains filled with revisionist political correctness and rooted for the British soldiers to choke on their own vomit and die because they were imperialist tools. Just to see this as a record of great bravery on both sides and an exciting entertainment apparently isn't enough they have to spout P C drivel.".

The mealie bag wall they build in the film was vital in order to slow up the thousands of zulus.The victory was not a sure thing because they had guns. The zulus had hundreds of guns capture that morning from the other 1700 British troops that had been killed by the zulus armed with spears.As to where the Hawkins character went to ? In reality he legged it away from his mission before the battle  later submitting a bill for damages to the British government.No explanation into the reasons for the battle. No bad thing as the true story of men against men is a worthy tail on its own and any explanation would be open to interpretation  read the history yourself!One last point everyone enjoys the Men of Harlech scene. Whilst this is poetic license  a very similar incident happened in the Afghan war at the same time.

I'm assuming it had a UK 'U' certificate despite the violence because my grandfather took me to see it at least 3 times the first week it was on general release in our local flea pit cinema in Wales. I've watched it so many times since my family groan whenever they hear it on the Christmas schedule as it usually is. I must buy the DVD. So fascinated was I by the story that in 1979 on a visit to South Africa I made a huge detour to go to Rorkes Drift. As others have stated the film was not made at the battlesite the site itself is on a low plateau in a plain and not so obviously surrounded by those fantastic hills as in the film. When I was there RD was a hamlet 10 miles up a dirt track but with a post office from which I sent my grandfather a postcard. No doubt Zulu was hijacked somewhat by the Welsh and given an overly strong nationalistic core. However it remains a superbly atmospheric exciting and yet moralistic and respectful story PC before its time and true in so many core facts. I cannot think of any other 'battle' based film which has remained so basically true to its historical base and nonjingoistic. Even as a child my admiration and respect for the opposing Zulus was entrenched  how many war films where a child is so blatantly rooting for one side could have done that?".

	schema:reviewBody "Zulu tells the tale of a battle that takes place at Rorke's Drift during the AngloZulu war of 1879. A small British garrison is informed that the larger part of their regiment of 1500 hundred men have been killed by a Zulu army of 40000 warriors. Word quickly spreads that a large force of Zulus is heading toward the small hospitaltrading postgarrison. The two officers at the outpost Lt. Col Bromhead Caine a fancy lad from a family of officers and Lt. Col Chard Baker an engineer squabble over the best course of action for the garrison. With a brief amount of seniority in his favor Chard is in command and decides the best course of action is to defend the outpost. Retreat is viewed as impossible due to the wounded at the hospital and wide open area that would be the escape route. The personality clash and eventual mutual admiration between the two officers is some of Caine and Baker's best work.Preparations are quickly made to prepare for the inevitable assault. Bags of grain boxes of biscuits and boxes of tinned meat are stacked up as barricades. Every available man including many of the wounded from the hospital are placed at the defenses. When the attack begins it is clear the small force is vastly outnumbered. 160 British soldiers and local militia defend the outpost against 4000 Zulu warriors.The 11 hour assault comes in wave after wave at the heavily outnumbered troops. The film has some great scenes of courage and bravery on both sides of the action. The scenes of battle are epic in scale despite the fact that the battle does not begin till about half way into the film and take place in a small area. The viewer will really feel the sense of being hopelessly out numbered and fear of being overrun and killed in a foreign landThe defense of hospital and the sub plot of the drunkard Pvt. Hook Booth soldiering when it matters most provide some of the best action scenes in the film. If you enjoy action packed war films this is a can't miss. At the conclusion of the film narrator Richard Burton describes how 11 Victoria's Crosses out of 1344 all time were earned during this battleSome critics bash this film a bit due to its lack of historical context and how the film takes some liberties with historical accuracy. Similarly some will view this film through racist glasses. While the film does change some of the characters a bit especially the character of Pvt. Hook who was actually a bit of teetotaler and not a drunk as portrayed in the film overall it is a fairly accurate portrayal. It's important to remember that this is a film and not a documentary about the battle. While the Zulu's are the eventual losers in this battle the film portrays them fighting valiantly and they are presented as a fearsome and brave force to be reckoned with. Moreover the film does question the rationale behind British colonialism and just what these soldiers were dying for.In summation if you like war films this is a classic that should not be missed. Strong acting performances by many of the cast admirably demonstrate the heroism and loyalty of the soldiers to each other in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. This film is currently available for streaming on Netflix.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film many times before it was a particular favourite of mine as a youth. It's a story of immense bravery against seemingly insurmountable odds and I guess that's what attracted me to it. Add to that it's based on real events and you've got me sold! The British army has fought in many battles over the years and many medals have been won. The highest award for bravery is the Victoria Cross and no fewer than eleven were won by the defenders of a small outpost called Rorke's Drift in Natal Africa on January 22 1879.Having already won a great victory slaughtering 1200 British soldiers Zulu warriors are on the march. Four thousand are headed for Rorke's Drift a small missionary hospital in Natal. A detachment of troops from a Welsh regiment are stationed there under the command of Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. An officer of the Royal Engineers Lieutenant John Chard is also in the vicinity when word comes of the defeat. Having seniority Chard takes command and begins to make preparations for the coming attack. A missionary Otto Witt and his daughter Margareta are also there but are proving more of a hindrance than a help. After the first Zulu attack the Witts' are sent away as Otto is distracting the men with his talk of death. Wave after wave of attacks ensue with great losses on both sides but the garrison remains undefeated. Can they hold out? Will help come in time? Of course I can't tell you here or the Spoiler Police will have me clapped in irons and put on Company punishment again.Mostly filmed on location in Natal you really get a feeling for the place. Of course the filmmakers couldn't get 4000 extras to play the Zulu army but they did a pretty good job with what they had Remember no CGI back in 1964. This film is famous for being the first major film role for Michael Caine who did a great job as the young aristocratic Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. Equally good was Stanley Baker as Lieutenant John Chard R.E. Other performances of note came from Jack Hawkins as Otto Witt Ulla Jacobsson as Margareta Witt James Booth as private Henry Hook and Nigel Green as ColourSergeant Bourne.The story is told entirely from the point of view of the garrison and this does make matters seem very one sided. Of course the battle scenes are all very well choreographed but nothing like as brutal as they would be if it was made today. I loved this film when I was growing up and believe it or not I still love it today. It is most probably because of the story it tells rather than it being an outstanding piece of filmmaking. I must admit though that Michael Caine does stand out in this one his star potential is there for all to see. Over all a film I have no problem recommending even though it may not be politically correct to do so these days.My Score 8.410.IMDb Score 7.810 based on 13839 votes at the time of going to press.Rotten Tomatoes Score 92100 based on 13 reviews counted at the time of going to press.".

The film quickly sketches the personalities of the main characters and when the action starts it quickly moves into high gear. It successfully mixes tension and action in a way that few war movies have yet matched.The performances are great particularly coproducer Stanley Baker as the hardasnails Lieutenant Chard who assumes command on the strength of his seniority and Michael Caine in his first major starring role as the aristocratic Lieutenant Bromhead who comes into conflict with Chard.Refreshingly the film is respectful in it's portrayal of the Zulus as honourable and dignified warriors.The script features plenty of memorable dialogue and a decent amount of humour.

	schema:reviewBody "'Zulu' is an underrated superb film on so many levels. I have studied and enjoyed this film closely many times DVD wide screen version and am impressed with the whole work as well as the respect given both 'sides' what an extraordinary well done story about a clash of two great cultures. In a way very much in a true sense an 'unracist' film. Is it perhaps unspoken ....like the film 'The Sand Pebbles' but of a different time and situation saying...are we beginning to get in over our heads?Michael Caine's introductory performance balances so well ActorProducer Stanley Baker's with their contrasting characters as 'officers and gentlemen'. Baker the Royal Engineer working middle class officer commanding by a seniority of only several months and Michael Caine's 'Bromhead' the product of an upper crust distinguished military family. The film tells convincingly about fear discipline and courage....and how they seem to find it within themselves. How discipline and training can replace fear paying off at the critical moment. It is often brutally plain and simple.Without clich this film asks all the good questions. Why us? asks the thoughtful private to his 'Color Sergeant' Because we're here...and no one else. he replies. The Welsh exdairy farmer who if hard fighting would perhaps sensibly 'escape' emotionally to tending to a sick calf. This is played as counter point humorously in Zulu yet it also shows too perhaps it is not well to think too hard about what is happening to survive the battle. Actor Jack Hawkins almost dominates the early scenes...and reminds us what is faith vs. 'religion'...and perhaps whom is better 'spiritually equipped' the preacher or the 'Color Sargeant'?Actor Michael Caine is introduced here to the film public as 'Bromhead'. In one of his best played scenes of this actor's budding illustrious career...... remarks to pacing Stanley Baker Did you know my grandfather was at Waterloo? and follows reflecting his vulnerability...I wish now...right now I was a damned 'ranker' like Hook.... realizing his social trap the terribly high expectations beyond his physical predicament  duty to his military family as well as to his country. Sadly battle and expectation of death can be a great social equalizer too. So very pleased to read here that genuine Zulu and the Zulu Chief are featured in the production. Chief Buthelezi as Zulu King Cetshwayo kaMpande. Actor James Booth's 'Hook' character we soon find is a complex one well acted. One moment malingering humor next a test of will  then the Victoria Cross. In the end Hook quite unchanged  but unquestionably broadened. Actor Gert Van der Berg as Boar Lt. Adendorff is a key character in the first half and the end of the films story. Adendorff as Lt. Chard's Boar military adviser we gain insight into the Zulu's disciplined ways.....and values. He's counting your guns! Referring to the Zulu chief of the far ridge explaining to Baker and the audience the ole boy is counting your guns....testing your firepower with the lives of his warriors! I so regret with astonishment that we have not seen more of Actor Gert Van der Berg appearing in only two very fine films 'Zulu' and 'The Naked Prey'. The sweep of the wide screen cinema photography is breathtaking. The hills sky and clouds incorporated in many scenes with low upward camera angles much like in 'Patton'.The only small criticism of Zulu might be technically were in a few of the early scenes some not so smooth sound editing as they jump to a new scene. The sound mixing quite extraordinary later in the film overall.The final scenes a remarkable salute to both sides. The exhausted Europeans for their hard fought defense the Zulu's whom withdraw after the battle salute  both sides knowing very well the Europeans could have been wiped out if the Zulu King merely wished it.When they charge in those great numbers at those out numbered English Welsh garrison it is the war chant Usuto! Usuto! Kill! Kill! the fierce Zulu are yelling.As for political correctness or not it is only for the high price of college tuition we ever at all believed in those tiresome narrow political professors. My God.....your from the sixtys! but again....that is a line from another good movie. LOL.Caine has another extraordinary line near the films end....does everyone feel like this afterward..... Sick? Feeling something else too...ashamed? Stanley Baker reflects...you have to be alive to be sick. You asked me and I told you Caine softly retorts.Corfman".

Okay we identify with the British troops in the face of insurmountable odds and all that  but you have to admire the ZULU warriors all the more for going up against them unfalteringly and the 'pan' across their fallen bodies isn't so much a moment of joy for the Brits saying Ha look how many we've killed of you lot as opposed to clearly showing what an awful waste of life it all actually was.The film clearly marks out why the British Army was as good as it was. Organisation.  Okay we got butchered a couple of times but when placed in a position with time to ready ourselves the British forces where pretty unbeatable.  One of the huge advantages being the fact that often we were going up against quite primitive 'warriors' with even more primitive weapons.  The whole staying smart obeying orders and keeping in line firing in order helped to saved all those mens lives and is a neatly condensed show of arms to everybody out there.  Each setpiece of British organisation reinforces just how good they were just how well they were drilled and just how murderous they could be with their efforts.The film clearly marks out why the ZULU forces wasn't quite so good.  It wasn't a lack of courage or absence of valour it was simply down to the fact that they were outclassed weapon and organisation wise.  Okay they made pretty well organised charges and all that but against rifles that's just cannon fodder.  But as is pointed out by the Dutch guy they're merely counting your guns.  The ZULU's in the film aren't daft guys in furry underpants they're the bravest warriors ever seen or ever likely to be seen.  Well organised forces wilted in the face of British troops during that period they didn't.  The fact they salute the British and walk away merely adds to their nobility and patheticises the British efforts  eventually they would have crumbled the British would have lost against such odds if the Zulus had pressed all at once.  They didn't.  They walked away saluting the British effort.  That moment alone with Caine blazing about how they're being taunted and the Dutch guy chuckling to himself struggling to believe what is actually taking place is the icing on the cake of the gradually increasing tension.For a moment of absolute spine tingling tension you can't beat the ZULU singing being countered by the Welsh Choir of voices.  It's an equaliser as such a moment of contrast and compare between the rigid red suited Brits and the tribal shield clapping chanting.John Barry's music is a constant presence and always perfectly suited to the moment I'd be interested to know the content of the ZULU chants though whether they are authentic which I figure they are or simply picked out by the director for looking the most intimidating.Top film no insult to anybody.".

Especially when he finds out that one of the villains he has hunted has become a monk because he regretted his deeds. Will Shane be able to forgive?At first this seems like an average revenge western among a thousand others but it stands out from the crowd by a slightly more thoughtful attitude of director Fizzarotti whose only western this is. Revenge isn't just a natural way of life or rather death it is questionable sometimes. Also the movie has an interesting cast.

As for the character he isn't given a personality or any depth except for a sledgehammered back story about a dead fiance which is dropped in towards the end of the film. Paula Sarah Jessica Parker repeatedly mentions how sweet Tripp is but this sweetness must be going on off screen as on screen he is constantly a jerk. There is also no chemistry between McConaughey and Parker which makes the socalled romance hard to notice. If it is there at all.Paula is given even less personality than Tripp. All we know about her is that she gets men to move out of their parents' home professionally. She only refers to Tripp in terms of the job so when after about half an hour we have to be told Paula has feelings for Tripp it is a surprise. It certainly isn't in the performance or the dialogue. It would help if we saw she doing her job before being hired in to help Tripp. As it is it is very confusing how she is so successful since she utterly fails in every aspect of her job with Tripp. And realising she is failing in her job she sleeps with Tripp  for money. She becomes a prostitute and doesn't bat an eyelid. How is this not an important plot development? The film generally doesn't make sense and the scenes in which Tripp is attacked by a chipmunkdolphinlizard seem to have wandered in from a different genre and fail to amuse. However the scene in which Kit Paula's housemate tries to buy a gun is very funny the only funny moment of the film mainly due to the performance by the salesman Rob Corddry.As for the supporting cast Kathy Bates as Tripp's mum hams it up and Zooey Deschanel as Paula's housemate phones in her usual tediously bored performance  this is obviously her selling point but strangely enough a bored actor is boring to watch.Basically Failure To Launch is an entirely disengaging film and forgets to actually put any romance in between the setup and the finale.".

Luckily for me there was nothing good to see for date night out with the wife. So we decided to see Failure to Launch. It was possibly the funniest movie so far this year. Great characters great story and loads of bust out laughing situations. Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates are crazyfunny and actually parents I would love to have. The rest of the cast especially the character of Kit are perfect for the parts played and extremely funny. This is just what it is supposed to be a fun romp. Enjoy this movie and don't take it seriously like the guy from Canada.".

They all have names like Ace Demo Kit Tripp and Captain!! We all knew EXACTLY what was going to happen the minute Sara Jessica Parker says I never have sex with a client. Gee  wonder if she will with Matthew  er sorry  Tripp...I also cant believe that the movie invested sooooo much time in a subplot where someone wants to murder a mockingbird. Wow! That's funny! And obviously the studio found it hilarious whenever an animal attacks a human! Woohoo that's some funny comedy  Billy Wilder could learn a thing or two from these fine filmmakers about what is truly funny. A chipmunk attacks a dolphin attacks a mockingbird bites the guy's nose like in a Goofy cartoon oh  and a lizard attacks  and after he does  they show him snickering  thus making the snickering lizard more threedimensional than any of the supporting characters. Plus it really was truly creepy what SJP's character tries to do  to date screwedup mainly lonely guys and make them think she likes them to try and get them to move out. The one other scene where they show her working  the guy is the typical fat nerdy slob who quotes Star Wars and you watch her pretend to like him. Man! That is one creepy job there almost as creepy as being a boat broker. I kid! I kid the boat brokers and all the members of The Boat Brokering Association. This movie is just a mindfreeze  watch point A move to Point B and then to Point C  now go home. The fact that this thing made TONS of money says it all.".

The audience I sat with loved it and laughed often so I think this will do well in the theater especially those that enjoy Mr. McConaughey's abs and southern charm. There's actually some great nature shots with Dolphins and other funloving creatures but I won't go into detail since it would spoil some of the crude humor in this flick. I think this would make a great date film since most of the film is told from the male perspective so it's not your typical female male basher. Zooey Deschannel has some great moments as well with her deadpan looks and offbeat charm. There's no Oscar worthy performances here just a fun silly offbeat romantic comedy with a little umnudity from Mr. Bradshaw no frontal of course.".

Then she'll collect her fee and boogie. But no we know from the getgo as with any screwball comedy that the two leads are destined to be together. But when one learns the other's secret what true love there was goes on the rocks. This is exactly what the other two films above did and I'm sure it's a burgeoning new genre.What drags it down a bit are the side plots and side characters. Many of these are good or even terrific one way or another but it's all patched together and a little lightweight and thin. The best of these is Parker's roommate played with Oscarworthy dreariness by Zooey Deschanel who also appeared in 500 Days of Summer. But the sideshows of the mockingbird the biting dolphin and even the baroque arrangement with the t.v. monitors in the final scenes are all a little clunky. Good on paper maybe but in the end you have to make yourself enjoy the best of it all which will make you laugh and have fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "The star of Au hasard Balthazar is a donkey a trained animal that has been led goaded into what passes in an animal sense for a performance. Of course there is nothing new about this  animals have been stars since Rescued By Rover  yet there is something unique about the performance of the donkey in Au hasard Balthazar something that strikes one sort of funny if one gets to thinking about it. It has to do with the approach of Robert Bresson a director whose way of working with actors was shall we say unusual. An auteurist in the purest sense Bresson believed zealously it seems that the director should be the sole creative force behind a film the one person responsible for the movie's tone its meaning. The problem with most movies if you look at things in a Bressonian way is that stubborn habit of actors to sometimes change the meaning the texture of a scene by how they play it  that irksome tendency of actors to take the creative reins themselves and slip things into scenes that aren't meant to be there. Bresson's solution to this problem? Rehearse your actors to death make them do takeaftertake until the words no longer mean anything to them until they have lost the ability to be spontaneous anymore to do anything but what their director tells them to  in short break them like animals. The people in Bresson's films perform their actions with the same hollow mechanical absenceofwill one perceives in a circus elephant rolling a ball and this is exactly as Bresson wants it for it allows him to carry out his cinematic plans without fear of their being subverted by an actor who has some contradictory notion in their head of what a scene is supposed to be about who their character is. The human actors in Au hasard Balthazar stripped of their emotional tools their tricks occupy exactly the same plane as the donkey Balthazar who is as they are a trained animal an element in a composition.The first scenes are an idyll the foal Balthazar newstripped from his mother's teat becomes the favorite pet of a group of kids spending the summer together on a farm. This is a time for frolicking for amorously carving names into benches  but alas the childish harmony is doomed soon to end. Bresson conveys the fleetingness of youth cutting quickly through a series of tableaux depicting carelessness and joy slightly darkened by the presence of a sickly young girl then without warning we're presented with the realities of grownup existence embodied most cruelly by the image of poor Balthazar now grown harnessed to a saltwagon salt having ironically been his favorite treat during his carefree younger days. It's here that Bresson gives us an indication as to the donkey's morethananimal nature Balthazar having been mistreated rebels against his owner tips the wagon and about to be set upon by a mob of men with pitchforks flees. Some instinct  or is it conscious will?  leads Balthazar back to the farm which has been taken over by a former schoolteacher whose daughter Marie once one of Balthazar's playmates still resides her existence a lonely one. This would seem the beginning of a new happiness for Balthazar but the donkey's fate is alas still clouded with gloom. Marie becomes the object of the juvenile delinquent Gerard's amorous attentions for obscure reasons the jaded miscreant is resentful of Balthazar and avails himself of every opportunity to torture the poor beast.Tenderness and cruelty live sidebyside in Au hasard Balthazar and seem equally the product of an almost mindless instinct. Nowhere is this embodied more purely than in the character of Gerard Francois Lafarge the angry sadist who becomes Balthazar's chief tormentor. Gerard is capable of being gentle as demonstrated by his wooing of the poor farmgirl Marie the PreRaphaelite beauty Anne Wiazemsky but he's equally capable of unfeeling viciousness as when he ties a piece of newspaper to Balthazar's tail and sets it alight. Is Gerard a good person or a bad one? Does he hate Balthazar does he love Marie? These questions seem of little concern to Bresson who views human affairs in terms of irresistible internal forces. Bresson in a mysterious vaguely irreverent way blurs the line between human and animal brings human behavior into the animal world while elevating Balthazar to the quasihuman. There's an awareness to Balthazar that's more than you would expect from your average quadruped and it's through this hint of sentience that one begins seeing the saintly qualities in Balthazar the patient endurance of hardship the radiance of spirit.It's an amazingly delicate piece of work by Bresson an audacious idea carried out with the utmost discretion and skill. Perhaps only Bresson among all filmmakers could've made this idea work because only he had mastered the art of rendering existence nearly abstract while at the same time achieving powerful emotional effects. If the film were merely symbolist it would be irrelevant  Balthazar can of course be seen as a symbol for a lot of things but it doesn't seem right to reduce him to some emblem of suffering some Christlike trope. Balthazar is above all a character a protagonist in a drama but of course in Bresson there is never any sense of conventional drama of easy emotion. As a storyteller Bresson was efficient but patient  his scenes never go on longer than they need to yet you wouldn't call the pacing urgent. There's something about Bresson's cutting that keeps the story flowing briskly while never engendering a sense of hurry. He moves from one character to another one situation to another with an unfussy ease that shames most conventional directors with their dependence on transitions devices and segues. The film's very pace helps convey Balthazar's saintly nature his perseverance. It's a work at once touching bold enigmatic and stirringly human.".

	schema:headline " Great";
	schema:reviewBody "The greatness of Robert Bresson's 1966 black and white film Au Hasard Balthazar which translated means something like Randomly Balthazar or By Chance Balthazar comes not from only one aspect of it nor even just a few. Virtually every aspect of the film reeks and resonates greatness although despite this being the near full consensus opinion of film lovers and critics alike it is one of the most poorly understood films I've ever read the criticism of. This is because so many aspects of the film are based upon its most superficial qualities rather than those deeper and more essential even as the film achieves this depth in only 95 minutes. This economy occurs because the film focuses not on the superfluities of living but only those things with resonance and meaning the important and poetic moments that distill all else. And oftentimes those things with meaning are not the expected architectures of the human face but those of other parts of the human body like hands backs and human postures all of which evoke connections and depths that would likely be unthinkable to cogitate on in films by other directors.But before I get into this film's essence let me synopsize the narrative. The film is a picaresque 'animal film' and I am an animal lover so I am emotionally inclined to be favorable to any such film. Yet when I write this fact of the film's nature I do not mean it in the way a film like My Dog Skip a great 'animal' film aimed at children is an 'animal film.' Au Hasard Balthazar goes above and beyond even that high level of art for many reasons yet one of the most manifest is that it is shorn of all sentimentalism even that sort which is meant in a positive sense. The film follows the life and death of a male donkey in the French countryside. Named and christened Balthazar by his first owner a young girl named Marie the donkey grows up changes owners several times and eventually ages and bleeds nearly to death seemingly dying on a hilltop surrounded by a flock of sheep after being accidentally shot at night when he is stolen by the film's villain to transport illegal good across the French border. But before that denouement we get to see many slices of life that of the donkey its owners and the people that are around it in the small village even those things that are beyond the purview of the beast's impassive eye....Au Hasard Balthazar is nothing short of a masterpiece a work of art of the highest order amongst the greatest dozen or two films ever made and on par with the same highly ranked works of art by the greatest writers poets playwrights musicians and painters. It also points out convincingly why art is better than religion or philosophy in dealing with the 'big questions' in life for art has an economy neither of the other two pursuits possess witness Balthazar's death. How many words would be spilt in a religious text or philosophic tract to distill what the mere sight of a dying donkey amidst sheep does? Art is models of the real that encode and decode the real while elevating the very process of that encoding and decoding. Art and especially film and its even more abstract cousin poetry can penetrate far more deeply and with far less distraction than any other human media into the essentials of existence. Art can elucidate these matters with eloquence and profundity and art and only art can do so in the hands of a great artist.I give you Robert Bresson.".

Art can elucidate these matters with eloquence and profundity and art and only art can do so in the hands of a great artist.I give you Robert Bresson.";

Robert Bresson's 1966 masterpiece defies any conventional analysis telling a story of sin and redemption by following Balthazar a donkey as he passes through the hands of a number of masters including a peasant girl a satanic delinquent and a saintly fool. Perhaps the greatest and most revolutionary of Bresson's films Balthazar is a difficult but transcendentally rewarding experience and the director is better able than in his previous work to put his philosophy of cinema into practice that is is to say the filming and meditation of that which is concealed. This is a gorgeous Criterion DVD with and excellent digital transfer and it includes some fine supplemental material such as a French television program which includes commentary from such notables as Godard Malle and Bresson himself speaking about the film.

This is what the real essence of the Catholic church once was when it accurately recreated Christ's giftand what illuminates Robert Bresson's personal spiritual path in the otherwise deeply perverted church of today.The story that of a donkey's life is on the surface absurd. But what Bresson can bring to it through the patient austerity of his camera work the martyr like surrender of his characters including the donkey Balthazar is as transcendent and enlightening as a private epiphany. What is amazing is that he is able to project so much depth into an audience so unsuspecting.Finally and perhaps what makes this film and all of Bresson's work so illuminating is that he had an unrelentingly objective film sensibility quite like that of Luis Bunuel.

I'm aware that Bresson's movie is filled with symbolism and layered with subtext but his approach turns me off. Bresson's mantra is this no acting under any circumstances. Step 1 is to hire nonactors. Step 2 is to direct them not to emote. Step 3 is to keep reshooting the scene until the actors give up emoting. It was common for him to do 30 takes of even the simplest scenes. He doesn't do this to be cruel but because he sincerely believes the truth of the material cannot be revealed until the people saying the lines stop thinking about the fact that they are saying lines. A kind of brute force method of ensuring that no one on his set is attempting to craft a performance. He definitely gets what he's after but whether or not it's worth seeing is questionable.As a movie viewer raised in the spoonfed postSpielberg Hollywood era I find it tough to get through Bresson. I disliked Balthazar but not because I think it's crap. Bresson made his film inaccessible so it would be hard to understand but because it's so pretentious I didn't WANT to understand it.".

In this early life the children particularly Marie and Jacques later playing as teenagers by Anne Wiazemsky  who later married JeanLuc Godard  and Walter Green respectively play with him lovingly jostling in the hay. With monetary issues Balthazar is taken into adult life abused by masters who use his prowess to pull carts whipping him regularly. He escapes and goes back to that place of beauty where the children had so adored him. Of course they are grown and Marie the only one who actually lives at the farm takes him back in however the farm is struggling and this relationship is soon split.As Balthazar is then moved from owner to owner he is used to deliver bread to again pull carts. He is saved at one point by a drunk Arnold JeanClaude Guilbert who is accused of murder  although this infraction is never elaborated on and he is only accused several times by local teenthug and thief Gerard Francois Lafarge. Balthazar also briefly becomes a star in a circus making mathematical calculations using his hoof. Aside from the various moments of violence inflicted upon the poor animal he is witness to the violence that the people he comes in contact with have over each other. Marie ignoring the protestations of her fathers wishes to stay away from Gerard she ignores him and continues a sexual relationship with the petty criminal which inevitably leads to heartache.Beautifully shot in black and white the French rural countryside becomes a majestic and yet horrific backdrop for the sins of humanity and the innocence of an animal that is forced to do the bidding of the people. Bresson often frames Balthzar at the centre of the image his large eyes portraying utter pathos  and we the audience adore him. The final moments of the film are some of the most simple yet moving moments in cinema history. Gerard using the now old and worktired Balthazar steal him to carry contraband over the border. Fleeing the area due to gun fire from the border patrol Balthazar escapes into a field where sheep are grazing. Having been shot he walks slowly and joins the flock sitting his eyes displaying something that resembles happiness  or at least a relief to be with other animals. The end however is also incredibly heartbreaking.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " beautiful in its lyricism Bresson's Au hasard Balthazar is original and poignant";
	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I'm not as completely overwhelmed with the work of the immensely revered director Robert Bresson as others are and I almost wish I was more so. I do know from the other films I have seen of his Pickpocket and A Man Escaped that he is one of the superior craftsmen of his time in France a veritable storyteller with a very precise original craftsmanship and way about telling his stories that shows compromise is nowhere in sight. However I don't think try as I might and I do love other films that do evoke religious connotations and metaphors like with Dreyer and Rossellini's films which perhaps aren't as heavyhanded to soak into all of the allegory of it all. When it comes down to it Au hasard Balthazar is a kind of fable and it is successful even as some of the Christian connections are lost on me. It is strongest at being a dramatic look at two lives where drama doesn't need to be put to highest heights or given a shot of adrenaline. There's almost something very worn down about the characters as well as the donkey Balthazar that is the best part of what Bresson does try to draw parallels to. His direction might be uneasy to get along with but it is rewarding in a cathartic way too.Much has been written about Balthazar being a kind of saintly figure or Jesus who suffers all of his life and then at the end dies a sorrowful death for perhaps everyone else's sins. But if that side of reading into it isn't really suiting and you're looking for just a really welltold story which is really all a fable can do the donkey's and Marie's Anne Wiazemesky story does take on a neorealist side to it too. It's the everyday things that count in this world and act as burdens that don't give people the kind of life and enjoyment they could have. While Bresson maybe doesn't have his great strengths in much of the dialog his direction of the actors which involved multiple takes to the point of as with the donkey beating the life out of it is quite unique. Like with Pickpocket you can tell something is so suppressed with them even with the careless young man who Marie falls in love with and later leaves and the unfortunate drunk who 'takes care of Balthazar for a while that it's no wonder nothing happy ever really comes to any of them. Also the body language is so distinct and powerful that it really makes the uncomplicated nature of the photography and editing work that much more so. Turn the sound off and it might not even make a difference what with lack of music Two of my favorite scenes might likely be two of the best scenes I've ever seen from the few Bresson films I've seen. One is when Balthazar has a brief stint in a circus and it's interesting to see how the simplistic nature of the story reaches for once an almost ironically amusing point in this scene. For a moment you're pulled into that illusion of a Disney movie where an animal is meant to be more like us but then once reality comes back in it wipes that all away. The other scene is during a dance in a bar where everyone's bopping away to a jazz song and the young man mentioned before throws bottles and causes a ruckus but no one seems to stop dancing at all. Are they too who should be having a good time that numbed by their lives to not be shook up by the disturbances around them? It is a film that really does get you thinking once it ends about how smalltown society treats things in very set ways that make some like Marie want to just get out. There's an undercurrent in the story of money being an integral and hurtful part of the world where pride and suffering gets mixed up in it too. But most striking when watching the film are the scenes with the donkey who punctuates the unwavering methods of those around him who very rarely are actually kind and happy around him aside from the kids early on. These scenes display Bresson utilizing his storytelling and skills with poignancy that if you can identify with the innocents of the story is kind of mindblowing.Even if the film is possibly imperfect it nevertheless left me feeling I had seen something special. Few filmmakers can get away today with putting together a tragic story and pulling parallels between a worker animal and a misguided young woman and how others out there try to live every day. It's a brave movie more often than not that might hit and has hit other viewers both young and old alike. Grade A".

	schema:headline " Simply A Wonderful Film";
	schema:reviewBody "A truly unique work in cinema. It is simply amazing that a story that is on the surface mostly about the life of a donkey can cause you to ponder the mysteries and ironies of life and fate. Bresson created here a model of how to say more with less. The final scene of this film is illustrative of this in its extraordinary ability to deeply move the viewer with only a bare minimum of directorial touch.The plot lines of Au Hasard Balthazar at times seem forced sometimes confusing the viewer and often leaving the characters' motivations unexplained. This matters little however because they all follow the same theme that one's actions explainable or not are often just a reaction to the environment within which we are placed. The human characters and the donkey are one. Just as Balthazar must succumb to the whims of his owners so are we humans often just surviving and submitting to the actions of those who control us. The film is in many ways a rumination about the free will actually afforded us in life. A key scene is between Marie and the miserly farmer winemaker? where the latter expounds upon his philosophy. Money and selfconfidence are the keys for him because they allow a certain autonomy that lets him do as he pleases. Money or the lack thereof is depicted in several instances as often replacing true morality or spirituality in the characters' lives.Another scene that mesmerizes there are several is when Balthazar is pulling the circusanimal feeding cart through the cage area. The soundless shots of the donkey making eye contact with the other animals is brilliantly done again with little camera flourish. They seem to be communicating silently with only their gazes which say here we are this is our fate. Extremely affecting and staggering in its simplicity.This is a film to be watched again and then again and then again. In one of the DVD extra features film scholar Donald Ritchie states that he has seen Balthazar many times yet he still cries during the ending. I believe this and understand it. Credos to Criterion for resurrecting this classic and for again doing such a fine production job.".

Congratulations sir or madam  you are the very image of the snobby elitist pseudointellectual cinephile! Yes of COURSE the only reasons some primitive commoner might dislike Au Hasard Belthazar is because they would rather be watching The Matrix or because it gives them booboo feelings in their hearts. Of COURSE. You even made sure to point a finger at society that vague eternal enemy of the masturbatory wouldbe intelligentsia. Good on you mate!!Well having seen the film knowing of its adoration among critics and intellectuals and been subsequently underwhelmed by it allow me to share my own assessment in hopes that Flavia may find my criticisms more justified than the plebeians who came before me.I could hardly call Au Hasard Belthazar a bad film. It more or less succeeds at being what it wants to be  a bleak muted melodramatic little parable of fatalism and misanthropy. I admit I don't entirely get the accusations that the film is incoherent or obtuse at least in its meaning its plot is another story as I will address below  as art films go this one is ridiculously straightforward. Its core message simplified and paraphrased by way of popular idiom Life's a bitch and then you die. Not rocket science and certainly not Kant.I possibly probably lack the formal background in film technique at present to properly explain what is so remarkable about its cinematography editing etc.  none of it particularly stood out to me one way or the other  but with so many grayhaired film critics in agreement over its aesthetic genius I guess I'll just take their word for it until further notice.But just because the film is good from a strictly artistic standpoint doesn't mean I have to like it. And I sure as heck didn't. I didn't HATE it or even really think that poorly of it overall in the pantheon of pretentious art films there are countless far more obnoxious specimens more deserving of my distaste but there are an awful lot of things about it I didn't like. I didn't like its deliberately obtuse choppy and incomplete plot structure. I got it but I didn't like it. I can't believe there was no way of communicating the theme of Belthazar's ignorance innocence of the greater world around him without all but taunting the viewer. I didn't like the dour mechanical manner in which it goes about its business with only a single scene the circus suggesting anything resembling a sense of humor or liveliness and that being gone as quickly and abruptly as it arrives. I didn't like the stilted disaffectedly gloomy acting and dialogue presenting human beings as mere twodimensional figures in a cosmic diorama rather than independent entities with believable thoughts feelings and behaviors operating within a web of existence larger than themselves the essence of great tragedy in my opinion. I didn't like the way it grasped at images of suffering and abuse for easy pathos  the final scene was powerful yes but even as I felt saddened by it I also felt manipulated. And I didn't like the way it contrived the worst possible outcome for every situation just as a heavyhanded means of proving its point about how life is suffering and human nature is deeply corrupt did you know Bresson was a hardcore Catholic?.Anyone in touch with the real world outside of the hermetic sphere occupied by artists and intellectuals shouldn't have much difficulty guessing why the average viewer probably won't care much for Au Hasard Belthasar. It's dour it's muted it's impossible to follow on any level beneath that of pure allegory it doesn't have much insight to impart to any worldwise person that they don't already know and yeah it's not very entertaining. Some may appreciate the message or the craftsmanship and I can respect that. But to claim that disliking Au Hasard Belthazar could only be a result of some deepseated deficiency on the part of the viewer is pure selfservicing nonsense.".

But to claim that disliking Au Hasard Belthazar could only be a result of some deepseated deficiency on the part of the viewer is pure selfservicing nonsense.";

	schema:reviewBody "Faith has been made complicated in the 21st Century. It is economic. It is sociological. It is classist. Above all it is politicized. Christ's message has been manipulated and warped so that people can justify hate with His words. Mention of the Republican party or the Right will undoubtedly conjure images of frenzied worshipers people shouting in tongues and probably Rick Santorum. How many votes in this election will be made with a spiritual basis? Belief has been exorcised from political discourse. It's like your personal life something you leave behind when going to work. For many Christianity has been made a joke  a punchline that everyone knows will never land.It's mental segregation. A religious conviction has been made into shorthand for particular socioeconomic ideas. And wrongly so. Educated liberals offer factual objections to the most basic assumptions in the Holy Bible. In fact the simple virtue of education has been politicized as well. Believing in a God is now associated with being stupid or uneducated.All of this is equally upsetting. It makes AU HASARD BALTHAZAR so vital.The Christ imagery is not hard to see. BALTHAZAR is about the eponymous donkey and his struggles. It is a touching arrangement of image after image sound and story. Bresson was a French Catholic and like those of us with a strong faith couldn't leave his convictions at home. In art this fact somehow becomes a virtue again.Bresson's tale is full of impeccable photography and a tremendous script. The pictures are so astoundingly crisp and focused that Bresson teaches us where to look with less labor than Hollywood is every able. It's so subtle but we have been trained to lie with depth especially now as we are dancing with three dimensions. He famously said that the only way to photograph was from close and in front. At times this consistency is redundant not beautiful but only when employed in rapidly edited passages. Most of the time however his photography is sublime  perhaps more evocative of the Italian school than other contemporary French work. In addition there is a magnificent script spending a gorgeous majority in silence respecting the potential of the image. It owes equally to the formality of mass and the subdued ecstasy in Dostoyevsky.So many remark on Bresson's radiant visual style but he also makes thoughtful use of sound. Some noises like a cricket or a creaky wheel will gradually migrate from peripheral to dominating. He constructs these tableaux in layers but unimposing ones. They are simple but never insulting. His discipline informs the counterpoint rather than eliminating it.A difficult film but entirely rewarding. Don't ignore the religious imagery and symbolism. Instead appreciate the intimacy between Bresson and his material.93.3".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is about a donkey who is sold to several people who are all cruel or ignorant but it is different from all the animal films or in other words from all the films which the main character is an animal. Balthazar was the first Robert Bresson film I watched and to me it was enough to call Bresson a great director a master. The story telling or direction is pretty low key or lusterless but still perfect heartbreaking and dramatic. Also it is one of the most important films so far because it tells some facts about women women and men relationships. In the movie there is a girl. Two boys love her one of them is a gentleman the other is very macho and troubled and in fact not really loves her herself to make love with her. She cannot decide but finds the other boy dull. I won't forget the conversation between two forever. It was something like I work and take care of you. Then we have children the boy says. The girl How boring it sounds. In movies or real life both aren't many women are like that? Such kind of men do not care about the women who are interested in them or the women who they are interested in. Sometimes they insult them. However it causes women love them more. However Balthazar is not a love story or romance despite there is a love adventure of a girl and two boys. By the way even if it sounds this is not a clich love triangle at all in fact this is not a love triangle. Returning to Balthazar some people write that the film has several religious references messages. I could not any reference or message in the film may be because I am not a Christian. I always wonder the donkey in the film how they managed it how it did these? It has a performance I think and its performance is great. For example its reaction when it sees his ex owner at the circus and the final moments. It makes us feel what it feels. We feel its consciousness about the world and people around him. It seems that it is aware of many things. I would have wanted to keep it at least for a while. The power of the film comes from not only Bresson's direction but also it tells many things through animals. For example Balthazar tries to get closer to a flock but they leave the area hurriedly. There would be a lot of interpretations. The film may look like a typical don'thurtanimals or animalsaremorehumanthanhumanbeing film but it is not it is an unusual film. Lastly the music at the end of the film was great too.".

Marlene Jobert is great so is little Thomas Waintrop and if you don't mind that the plot has some unbelievable elements in it you will enjoy the experience. The music by the way is entirely taken from Verdis opera La Forza del Destino adapted here by French film music maestro Philippe Sarde and that title should give you a hint for the on goings. Not least to be watched for it's reference to Alice in Wonderland!".

I didn't think it was groundbreaking so originally I was going to give it 910 but also I though it was very straightforward and plot twists are usually important parts of dramas and romantic comedies.The thing is though I've never expected romantic comedies to have very much story or be very heavy on plot. So all I was looking for was something to occupy me... and I got it.There's not much else to say except that I really don't think the movie was so bad that it deserves a 110. When you consider the genre it was fairly average.

It is predictable in the story yes it runs out of ideas at the enddidn't like the freeze frame for example and the script and characters in a sense are clichd. However the film does look good with striking locations and fashions and the photography is above adequate. The soundtrack is bright and breezy the pace is snappy and there are some amusing situations. Plus the entire cast are likable and do give it their all while she has been betterie. Mean Girls and Freaky Friday Lindsay Lohan is very charming. All in all not that bad in my opinion. 610 Bethany Cox".

Freaky Friday Mean Girls Herby etc. I didn't enjoy them at all which was surprising because normally some of those flicks are my cup of tea. 2 Frist time I saw a preview for Just My Luck I wasn't very interested in seeing it. 3 The only real reason I wanted to see this movie is because I loved Chris Pine in Princess Diaries 2 and thought he was gipped on some much deserved screen time in that one so I wanted to see what else he had to offer  because honestly that deleted scene from PD2 with him and Mia Anne Hathaway in the kitchen was faboo and never EVER should have been left on the cutting room floor. What's worse is that GM never said WHY they cut that scene.That said I ended up loving Just My Luck. Call me crazy and say I have no taste. I don't care. I came for the hottie I stayed for the movie.Was this an award winning movie? No and I doubt it was ever hoped to be by anyone who went in to make it.Did it have flaws? Yes. A few but a minor one that bugs me enough to mention but has no real factor on liking or disliking this movie is the freezeframe at the end. Should have cut to black instead but that's just me. Freezeframes are tricky things that should be used rarely and wisely.Does it deserve to be bashed and tagged as the worst movie of 2006? Definitely not. As about two other people have said this was a cute fun escaperealityfor90minutestoanhour kind of a movie with no pretenses to be anything other that what it was.Okay so I agree that there were moments when Lohan's acting could have been improved the two that stick out in mind are when that blonde guy first joins her in the elevator and when she's looking at the broken mirror at the very end. But you can find bad acting in even the so called best movies of the year. Sometimes no matter what they do some dialogue or scene comes off clunky. It happens. We move on.Overall  considering my opinion on LL in general  I was pleasantly surprised by her in this movie. She's another Julia Roberts to me. I'm not a real fan but she's got a movie or two that I enjoy.I thought Chris Pine was just adorable in that geeky down on his luck optimist who in his characters own words gave up years ago. That's my secret to happiness. He was tender and hopeful and just head over heals for a girl who before the ball would never given him a second glance.I was surprised but glad that they didn't delve two much deeper into the workings of this change of luck thing. You knew the kiss was the key and as far as the actual workings of it all that's all that mattered. The more important part is what happens to the two fortunateunfortunate souls sucked in by this crazy bit of magic.When the movie wound down to a close I thought of about a dozen different ways it could have ended. The one they chose is the one I love the best. Two people who would love to have good luck all the time  having experienced the worse first hand  but would rather the other be happy instead.I loved the scene at the end when they both refused to keep the luck trading it back and forth until no one knew who had the luck and who didn't. Ashley really grew to the point that she was willing to sacrifice that for someone else which in the end made her deserving of the great guy that Jake is.And what better way to bring it all to a close then to give the luck to a little girl who is still young enough to be either corrupted into cynical thinking or learn the lesson that Jake and eventually Ashely did Luck comes and goes. What you do with that luck helps define who you are.Maybe I got a little to philosophical on a movie that I said was just a bit of fun. I don't care. I thought this movie was all kinds of wonderful. It's one that when the credits began to roll my first thought was I'll totally buy it when it comes out on DVD. That's how I know I really liked a movie.I see this movie as an underdog of sorts. And when it comes to movies I tend to prefer the underdog. When someone talks up a movie too much it tends to turn me off It was only at the very last minute that I changed my mind and decided to watch both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings two series that I had sworn off due to people raving too much for my tastes.If that makes me a person with bad taste in movies then so be it. I'll live happy in my ignorance.I would definitely see this movie again. And again and again. As I said I'll buy my copy of the DVD the day it's released.I give this movie a ten because even though it wasn't perfect I feel the need to offset some of the really unnecessarily bad reviews and scores it got from others.AL".

I love Lindsay Lohan's work and saw Chris Pine in the princess diaries so i guess i was always gonna love the story anyway. I loved the way Lindsay as Ashley had everything then lost it. I think that one critic said this movie was bad and they all agreed with him! They aren't the target audience and they should remember that! The story basically is that Ashley Lindsay has everything then looses it in one kiss to bad luck magnet Jake Chris which turns out Ashley being unlucky and Jake getting all the luck. If i had to say something bad about the movie it wud only b that McFly don't hav to be in it to make the story work it cud have been any band. But keep up the gd work Lindsay and ignore the things they say about you!".

But when fate comes knocking she accidentally loses her winning streak to Jake Hardin Chris Pine. What is Ashley to do when she falls in love with the guy who stole her luck? This is a cute teenage movie without a lot of substance. I think Lindsay's fans will like it but I think this has very limited appeal. It is a combination of 'Freaky Friday' and 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' but not nearly as funny.It had a good message in the end but who cares.

Lohan is a happy lucky young lady who is envied by her friends as she gets luck after luck. From being promoted in her job to dating an eligible bachelor she has everything a girl could want from an extravagantly beautiful apartment to expanding wardrobes. She is living everyones dream life. Pine on the other hand is not so lucky in fact he is nowhere near. Trying to get the band he is managing noticed he comes across many funny comical moments such as picking up a 5 dollar bill which has been used to pooper scoop. THis and many other bad things occur until the two meet at a Masquerade party and inevitably kiss on the dance floor switching fates.From the beginning I liked this film Lohan until most recently has been one of my favourite teen actresses since I watched Mean Girls and Confessions of a teenage drama queen. THis is a brilliant chick flick and definitely should be watched by all.".

I even guessed the ending of this movie as soon as I saw the scene where Katy and Ashley talk for the first time. If you are into movies you will too...If you overlook the silly script then there comes the bad acting. What is wrong with Lindsey this time? She is totally overacting her part and the actresses who play as her two friends are not any better. It is as if they are doing roles of fairytale princesses. However in my opinion Cris Pine does his part well.However I am not saying that this movie is 100 garbage. It has two or three enjoyable scenes but that's about it. In my opinion Just My Luck has a great concept if it was not for the childish script and bad acting this could have been a very entertaining comedy.".

You know you shouldn't be compelled to give it more than a passing glance but for some reason you just can't tear your eyes away.As with most romantic comedies this plot is completely formulaic and predictable to the very end. The only real surprises are in the little things that make up the story. The script is achingly bad it has the actors saying things that I'm sure were meant to be cute little oneliners but it just comes out sounding dumb.Missi Pyle always a great addition to any comedy was great in her small role. I felt myself wishing she had more appearances it may have made the film more funny and easier to bear. Lindsay's performance was weak and I blame this mostly on poor direction and not lack of talent. I feel like she is still not quite ready to carry an entire romantic comedy on her own. She would have been fine in one of the supporting roles and I think Bree Turner would have been a much more suitable choice for Lindsay's lead role.Suspension of disbelief is crucial to enjoying this movie in any way shape or form. Unfortunately everybody knows that Lindsay was 18 when she made this film. It's extremely difficult to believe that Lindsay is a college graduate they never say how recent but one can only assume VERY recent with a killer job at a top PR firm in Manhattan and a chic fully furnished apartment in a very posh building with Sarah Jessica Parker as a nearby neighbor.I realize that this is meant to be a popcorn flick and nothing worthy of an Oscar or anything other than a Kid's Choice or MTV Movie award however most other fluff movies have better writing acting and direction than Just My Luck. I'd much rather spend my time watching a ball of fluff like Failure to Launch than this movie. Thankfully I didn't have to pay to see it.".

The subtext of the film embraces unity and peace in troubled times throughout the world. Difficult to believe coming from a standard looking Lohan affair yes? Well you'll have to see it to believe it.Lohan herself puts in a stellar performance and it leads only to aiding you in seeing what's really going on here. The educated among you will spot the references to higher philosophical planes of being only unbelieveably given weight by Lohan's performance. Who would have thought that you would come away from this film refreshed and inspired by the words of it's actors? See this for yourself I urge you I beg you. If you want to experience the full force of it's truth you can't rely on my words. Never has a film had such an impact on me.A stunning film with a stunning message fantastically executed.

If you fall into this category you shouldn't be reviewing or even watching the movie.JUST MY LUCK is a comedy that falls somewhere in between a romanticcomedy teencomedy and Disneycomedy. As a movie it definitely has its flaws like it's attempt to be a promotional launch for the band McFly but I have never seen a movie that tries to appeal to as many people as possible that doesn't have flaws.Lohan is entertaining both as the luckygirl and unluckygirl and she's easy to watch on screen. It's no MEAN GIRLS but it's not as juvenile as FREAKY Friday or HERBIE so I think it's another fine addition to Lohan's resume.Bottom line is that if you enjoy mainstream nobrainer entertainment you will likely enjoy this movie. JUST MY LUCK doesn't attempt to be anything other than a comedy with mass appeal to easy going individuals. No deep and artistic meaningful content? Who cares! Since when are we expecting that from a movie like this? JUST MY LUCK serves it's purpose and I don't think it's a movie you should completely ignore because of negative reviews from critics and Lohanhaters.

	schema:reviewBody "Films have a poor reputation when they involve stars from the music industry or should I say 'pop stars' as I categorically refuse to put Britney Spears and McFly in the same batch as the deity Bach and Wagner. Thus I wasn't expecting much when I got up at a ridiculously early time so I could see the only showing Brighton Marina cinema had of Just My Luck with an audience consisting of 3 people including me.The storyline is predictably simple Ashley played by Lindsay Lohan has good luck and Jake played by Chris Pine has bad luck. Ashley holds down a successful job although the audience is unaware of what job she is successful at. By contrast Jake is head of a smalltime band known as McFly. Ashley gets lucky although what you mean by 'lucky' is key here see below by improvising for her company and landing a 'bigballdate'. At this 'big ball' Ashley kisses Jake who has hijacked the ball as a professional dancer to try and get the prestigious Damon Phillips played by Faizon Love to look at his band. Via this kiss Jake gains all of Ashley's luck and suddenly everything goes wrong for Ashley and everything goes right for Jake. McFly became famous and eventually are asked to play at a 'Hard Rock caf'. After learning from a clairvoyant what has happened Ashley tries looking for her luck doing random silly stuff including kissing all the professional dancers which is probably why she took the role eating someone's leftovers from an unhygienic cafe before pivotally falling for Jake. She eventually discovers Jake has 'stolen' her words not mine her luck and she attempts to get it back from him. I shall stop at this point as I think to go any far would ruin the ending but if the truth were told it isn't anything to write home about.I believe commentators have gone a little too far in categorising it as one of the worst films ever made and may want to ask themselves for what reason they believe it to be so poor. It may not be a particularly a good film but this it is difficult to see how it could have been any better. May be one criticism of this film is its target audience. The target audience is rather narrow there is nothing that will stimulate you and the jokes are rather immature and 'teenypoppy'. If you like that sort of thing you might be happy seeing this film it was rather predictable from the outset what it was going to be like Lindsay Lohan has too small a range to play to play any other charactertypes! So we must accept that most people are going to be outside of its 'target audience'.I was disappointed with the characters though Ashley was paradoxically not entirely an alpha female. I'm not sure who or what Ashley was supposed to be and I don't think the actor knew either. This was demonstrated in her mediocre acting. It doesn't seem realistic that Jake fell in love naturally with Ashley for any reason other than pity. Am I wrong in thinking that most girls don't want to be pitied? I think what annoyed me most the lack of basic coherent structure. As already alluded to in earlier statements I don't think this film defines what luck actually is and as a result there is no clear distinction between what is 'luck' and what is 'intelligence'. For example if someone works very hard to achieve a degree and gains a first one wonders whether it was gained through pure luck or intellect? In contrast Lindsay gets her position because she sits in on other people's discussions according to the film and based on what she has learnt decides the best way of organising a ball. Her offer is accepted and she does very well within her company is this plain luck or is that because she deserved it? Later in the film even when she knows that she has overdone the washing powder she still switches it on even though she does not know where the 'off' switch I'm not sure what that has to do with luck. Similarly when she tries to replace a lightbulb. What has this got to do with luck? The main point is that there is no 'depth' to this film. Here is a film looking for a theme and a structure. If it purports to be a comedy I fail to see the joke. While it isn't the worst film you'd ever see you will probably come out feeling as dissatisfied as I did.".

This is easily the worst movie of 2006. It is an abortion of anything worth living for. The acting is horrid. As my friend said it's just lynsey lohan going AHHHH!!!!! MY LUCK IS SO BAD!!!! for an hour and a half. To be perfectly honest i stopped caring how bad her luck was. The movie also has the song to the 8th and ocean soundtrack in it towards the beginning. After that point the only thing i could think of was how I'd rather be at home watching 8th and ocean reruns with a grilled cheese. Do not see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only Lindsay Lohan movie I had ever watched was Mean Girls 2004  on board a flight to Europe and I thought it was a pretty entertaining  chick flick. Herbie Fully Loaded somehow didn't appeal to me so Just  My Luck was next on the screens here. There's another little story too  on how we picked this DVD in Petaling Jaya KL Malaysia together with  Scary Movie 4 and then donated it but heck that's another story for  another day and it really was just our luck that night of the  purchase.  Just My Luck tells the story of the crossing of fated paths between an  incredibly lucky girl and a totally unlucky guy. In typical  boymeetsgirl fashion these 2 individuals will meet and remeet each  other again in makebelievably coincidental situations and find in  each other the sparks of love. The introduction was quite neat as we  get acquainted with Ashley Albright Lindsay Lohan the walking good  luck charm and Jake Hardin Chris Pine a walking disaster with a  knapsack full of emergency supplies to help him tide through the day.  One's a sassy PR consultant the other a baokarliao takes care of  everything lowly worker  at a bowler's aspiring to make it  big via his discovery of a Brit band the McFlys. The couple meet  anonymously at a masquerade ball and a seemingly innocent kiss  transfers all the luck on Ashley to Chris. And so it follows that  Ashley will try everything she can to get her luck back. Until her  conscience starts to question just who might need the luck more.  The reversal of roles story isn't really new only the medium and  method are different. Like recent movies The Shaggy Dog and even  Lohan's own Freaky Friday are movies that belong to the same story  genre. So the question is does this one work? Given the good looking  cast it should appeal to the youngsters who are fans of Lohan or are  attracted to the good looks of Chris Pine. Their chemistry worked well  off each other and you can feel their respective surprise and  frustration as their lifestyles differ drastically.  There are plenty of situational comedy infused with a story like this  but most of them felt contrived. Towards the end given that luck could  swing the situation either way some scenes seemed to be stuck in limbo  way too long waiting for that punchline to give it direction. Granted  being incredibly lucky already is stretching the plot a bit too thinly  so you'll be better off treating this movie like a childish fantasy. A  typical datesafe movie enjoyable at certain points though with the  usual expected feelgood ending.".

Eddie reprises his role as Lemmy Caution the hero of Peter Cheyney's novels this time in search of a scientist supposedly kidnapped for his formula for a new lightweight solid fuel.Constantine was the star of many adventures in France in the early sixties and the whiskeyobsessed Caution was one of his most popular roles.  This particular film boasts a good cast which is where the most fun is derived but the whole thing is rather silly.  I expect that by this time it was just a matter of giving the audience what they wanted without making things too complicated or heavy.Director Bernard Boderie had previous experience working with Constantine in Women Are Like That and Ladies Man.  Here he keeps the show moving but lets things slide uncomfortably into farce towards the end with a silly slapstick fight scene used to finish off the gang.  While the film is not an outright spoof the comedy comes often enough that no one would dare take it seriously especially with Eddie winking or chatting into the camera several times.The Paul Misraki score is fun and jazzy as one would expect although it's not as prevalent as one would hope.  If you're in the mood for light fare this film will probably do but don't blame me if you're still hungry for a juicy spy flick afterwards.".

However I found a screenplay with the most inconsistent and incoherent situations awful characters and terrible acting mostly of them by actors and actress with the last name Hopkins Bobb Chet Tommy Erica  these amateurish guys should have sold or distributed this DVD for their families and friends instead. Last but not the least the lighting is also very poor and there is no ghost. Ernest Borgnine in the end of career has a minor and also very bad acting and reading of the introduction.

Nora who lives with Jenny and her and Gunny's daughter doesn't want to hear anything from Ted after she spotted a picture of Ted and Lucy in the morning paper.

	schema:reviewBody "BORN TO DANCE MetroGoldwynMayer 1936 directed by Roy Del Ruth is according to its title one starring Eleanor Powell as the one born to dance. Being the third in the series of Navy musicals produced within the year following SHIPMATES FOREVER Warners 1935 with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler and FOLLOW THE FLEET RKO 1936 with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers the title Born to Dance translates itself as a musical whether a song and dance or backstage story being a combination of both it gives no indication as one with a U.S. Navy background. Regardless BORN TO DANCE ranks the best of the trio thanks to a fine score by Cole Porter witty dialogue particularly from the secondary characters Sid Silvers and Una Merkel as well as the very young James Stewart surprisingly effective singing through his softspoken Fred Astaireish style of vocalizing.The second of its annual Eleanor Powell musicals BORN TO DANCE brings back her co stars from her initial MGM musical Broadway MELODY OF 1936 including Sid Silvers Una Merkel Frances Langford and Buddy Ebsen with Virginia Bruce substituting for June Knight as the temperamental actress. As an added plus Frances Langford who in Broadway MELODY of 1936 only participated in the song numbers this time gets to belt out her songs and take part of the plot.Following the opening titles with a background of musical notes yes this is a musical and still silhouette dancing images of Eleanor Powell the story opens with singing sailors submerging from a submarine and going on shore leave in New York City. Ted Parker James Stewart meets Nora Paige Eleanor Powell at a Lonely Hearts Club managed by Jenny Saks Una Merkel who is married to a Ted's fellow Navy partner Gunny Sid Silvers whom she hasn't seen in four years and through him is the mother of a threeyearold daughter Juanita Quigley. While Jenny finds Gunny to be a big disappointment to her and unwilling to tell him that he is a father Ted finds himself becoming very much interested in Nora whose ambition is to become a dancer hense the title. Their romance is soon broken up when Lucy James Virginia Bruce a famous musicalcomedy star along with her press agent James McKay Alan Dinehart visits Ted's ship for publicity pictures and after her Pekinese dog falls over board with Ted jumping in to save it McKay then makes a romance story out of it. Ted finds his time being occupied being with Lucy and away from Nora. However Ted arranges for Nora to get into Lucy's upcoming show as her understudy without either girl being aware as to whom was responsible for this arrangement. As Ted is going through his complications such as believing Nora to be a mother to Jenny's little girl there is Mush Tracy Buddy Ebsen who finds time in becoming the romantic interest of another Lonely Hearts Club employee Peppy Turner Frances Langford.Song numbers include Rolling Home sung by the Foursome Quartet Sid Silvers Buddy Ebsen and James Stewart RapTap on Wood sung and danced by Eleanor Powell Hey Babe Hey Babe sung by James Stewart Eleanor Powell Sid Silvers Una Merkel Buddy Ebsen and Frances Langford Here Comes Lucy James sung by sailors The Captain Had a Very Bad Night Last Night recited by Raymond Walburn Love Me Love My Pekinese sung by Virginia Bruce chorus Easy to Love sung by James Stewart  Eleanor Powell I've Got You Under My Skin danced by George  Jalna sung by Virginia Bruce Easy to Love sung by Frances Langford danced by Buddy Ebsen Love Me Love My Pekinese audition dance by Eleanor Powell Swinging the Jinx Away sung by Frances Langford with Buddy Ebsen danced by Eleanor Powell and Easy to Love sung by cast. The other members of the cast consists of Raymond Walburn Barnett Parker Jonathan Hale and Reginald Gardiner making his movie debut in an awkward but amusing cameo as a policeman in Central Park who fantasizes himself as conducting to the score to Easy to Love with an unseen orchestra only in New York!.As with Powell's other Broadway Melody series BORN TO DANCE includes moments of singing and dancing on cue with a full orchestra playing in the background whether it be at the Lonely Hearts Club on the Navy vessel or in the middle of Central Park. Comedy also takes its toll in BORN TO DANCE including Walburn as the confusing captain who can't distinguish the difference between the very tall Mush Ebsen and the ultra short Gunny Silvers asking them if they are twins and in giving an assignment for Mush deliver an important message to a Rear Admiral Stubbins at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Mush however keeps forgetting and when he does remember can't find Brooklyn and ends up in Yonkers as well as Helen Troy's classic bit as sharptongue Brooklynese switchboard operator. Troy must have been an inspiration for Lily Tomlin's comedic character in later years when appearing as a telephone operator in the late 1960s variety comedy show of LAUGHIN.BORN TO DANCE is light on plot memorable on songs and well constructed with dance numbers as choreographed by Dave Gould highlighted by the lavish but classic 13 minute finale of Swingin' the Jinx Away portions would be reused again for the finale in Eleanor Powell's latter 1943 musical titled I DOOD IT newly rescored to appeal more to the big band era for the time of its release.Other than having its presentations on commercial television some decades ago the original soundtrack recording to BORN TO DANCE was displayed in record stores in the late 1970s. If there is any Eleanor Powell worth seeing it's BORN TO DANCE by all means that's what she was and does it well. Available viewing on Turner Classic Movies. 12".

But the real curiosity is to watch Buddy Ebsen. I bet that many people that watched him in TV series such as Beverly Hillbillies and Barnaby Jones didnt had a clue that in his youth he was a very acomplished dancer. The songs by Cole Porter are top notch and I've got you under my Skin' and Easy to Love' became standarts. If you like 30's musical is well worth to take a look in Born To Dance.".

Although the plot is down right silly that hardly makes Born to Dance unique back in its day. What you take from it is the wonderful singing and dancing and the glossy production values of an MGM musical.And of course Cole Porter's score. It contains two of his most beloved standards Easy to Love and I've Got You Under My Skin. The rest of the score is serviceable for the plot. I particularly like Hey Babe Hey in which all the principals of the plot participate. How they got James Stewart to dance must have been a challenge.Of course Born to Dance is famous for Easy to Love being introduced by James Stewart. Stewart had always maintained that the proof of Easy to Love being a great song is that it survived his singing of it to become a great popular standard. His singing is adequate but for the life of me I'll never understand why Allan Jones who was up for the part wasn't picked. Especially since I've heard Allan Jones's contemporary recording of Easy to Love. Stewart is all right but the part isn't exactly a stretch for his thespian talents and for cryin' out loud Jones was one of the best movie singers ever.The other standard is introduced by Virginia Bruce spoiled mantrap of a Broadway musical star who takes a shine to Stewart after he saves her Pekingese from drowning while Bruce is visiting his ship at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Bruce sings I've Got You Under My Skin directly to Stewart with a come hither glance to lure him from Eleanor Powell who is her show's understudy.Borrowing from Hit the Deck with a plot of three sailors and three civilian women Born to Dance pairs off Stewart with Powell Buddy Ebsen with Frances Langford and Sid Silvers with Una Merkel. Raymond Walburn is at his avuncular best as the ship's captain who keeps entrusting Silvers and Ebsen to deliver a message to the Admiral and they keep getting sidetracked by their women.With Powell as the understudy to Bruce and them both vying for Stewart you can readily guess how this story will resolve itself. Eleanor dances divinely especially in the finale number Swinging the Jinx Away which Frances Langford sings and Buddy Ebsen also dances.With all the talent involved and a plot which is a walking clich but easy to take it's easy to love Born to Dance as I do.".

	schema:reviewBody "If ever a person was truly born to dance it was Eleanor Powellthe first of MGM's great dancing stars and a performer still considered by many to be the single finest tap dancer to emerge from Hollywood. And with the 1936 film BORN TO DANCE MGM offered Powell the single finest film of her entire career. Although extremely lightweight the story of three sailors and their romantic complications has a very playful tone and witty scriptwhich forms the perfect frame for a memorable score by the celebrated Cole Porter. The musical numbers are staged with a more subtle flash than one normally finds in 1930s musicals and there are several complex ensemble numbers and the memorable Easy to Love and I've Got You Under My Skin.Not only was Powell a greatly gifted dancer she was a clever comedian with a pleasing singing voice and her playful performing style is particularly charming in such numbers as RapTap on Wood and Swinging the Jinx Away. Her leading man somewhat surprisingly is none other than James Stewartand although he wasn't really a singer or a dancer he does extremely well with both and he and Powell make a very entertaining couple. The entire cast is their equal with Phil Silvers and Una Merkle amusing as bickering lovers Buddy Ebsen demonstrating his remarkable talents as both eccentric dancer and clever comic and Virginia Bruce the perfect femme fatale. Everything about the film sparkles and shines right down from the sets to the polished performances. If you enjoy classic musicals of the 1930s BORN TO DANCE is a must have! Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Newcomer to the big city Nora Paige Powell meets sailor Ted Stewart. They fall in love meanwhile she gets into a show understudying the lead the great Lucy James Bruce. Ted saves Lucy's Pekinese when it jumps into the water and the producers use that for publicity cooking up a romance between Ted and Lucy. Nora is heartbroken believing that Ted is cheating on her. They fight. Lucy ends up walking out of the show Powell then becomes the star  you can guess the rest.Certainly this is a wonderful score one of the best with the wonderful Easy to Love I've Got You Under My Skin Rolling Home RapTap on Wood and others. The surprise of the cast is James Stewart singing in a Fred Astaire sort of way  he's delightful very musical with a sweet voice that goes well with his boyish demeanor.Eleanor Powell is one of the great film tap dancers and she gets to do a lot of numbers. She's a very pretty woman with a wide smile. I find her nontap work a little odd as her choreography always seems to include a front kick which looks awkward. It's the kind of move that nondancers like Raquel Welch do in nightclub acts and it doesn't really suit Powell. She is a very likable presence and it's really fireworks when she gets atappin'! Una Merkel Sid Silvers et al. provide excellent support and good comedy which is abundant in the script that makes the most of dialogue even if the story is thin. Virginia Bruce is great as the glamorous Broadway star. She performs I've Got You Under My Skin beautifully.Stewart sings Easy to Love and I can still remember the look on Carol Burnett's face when he sang it to her many years ago I believe on her TV show. She spoke of going to the movies with her grandmother and watching him on the screen. To have him sing that song to her was an overwhelming moment. It's one of the nicest scenes in the film too to see this tremendous star when he was so young and fresh.This is simply a wonderful walk  or should I say tap  down memory lane. Don't miss it.".

Jimmy Stewart who plays a clean cut sailor in this film shows his talent not just as an actor but as a singer and dancer as well.

Another actress I discovered for the first time when I saw this movie was Virginia Bruce and she is captivating in the musical number aboard the submarine with her Pekingese companion Cheeky. I had recognized the name but another actress who I had little knowledge of was Frances Langford and she is natural to dance with the young boot scooting Buddy Ebson.

	schema:reviewBody "Featuring songs by the great Cole Porter Born to Dance is a pleasant MGM musical in the boy meets girl boy gets girl boy loses girl mold. Basically it's about three sailors who are allowed some shore leave and three showgirls who are nuts about them. . . . well at least two of the girls are! The two main characters in this piece are an aspiring dancer named Nora Paige played by the attractive hoofer Eleanor Powell and a petty officer named Ted Barker played by a rising young star named James Stewart. Powell was the perfect choice to play the kind sweetnatured Nora with all her dancing prowess and Stewart was equally the perfect choice for the role of the decent softspoken shy Mr. Barker. Virginia Bruce was also an excellent choice for the role of the selfish bitchy prima donna Lucy James not to mention the delightful performances of Sid Silvers Buddy Ebsen Una Merkel Frances Langford Raymond Walburn and Alan Dinehart.My favorite highlights from Born to Dance include the following DON'T read any further if you haven't yet seen this musical. James Stewart's golden opportunity in this picture came with his beautiful vocalization of Easy to Love thank heaven that the top brass at MGM had decided not to stick to its original plan to dub over Stewart's voice with that of a professional singer. During the opening number Rolling Home Stewart's singing voice is a bit shaky but his Ted Barker character shows a boyish expression of delight as he declares through the periscope that the submarine crew has reached their home in New York. Nora makes a fine first appearance at the Lonely Hearts Club as she sings and dances to the tune Rap Tap on Wood in which she is joined by a quartet of sailors who sing  play ocarinas. There is a catchy musical introduction of Lucy James as the submarine crew sights her  her publicity staff just before she prepares to climb aboard the sub. James Stewart's other lesser known number titled Hey Babe which he sings quite well is enhanced by the singing and dancing of the entire party of six Ted Nora Peppy Turner Langford Mush Tracy Ebsen Gunny Saks Silvers and Jenny Saks Merkel.A decade after Born to Dance was released when James Stewart's acting career was in a slump he watched his performance in this film and wanted to vomit. I hate to admit this about my favorite actor but yes he does overact in Born to Dance on the other hand as one particular Stewart biographer pointed out Stewart looks like he's having a lot of fun in this movie and boy that is nice to see. One final point of all the various Cole Porter numbers we hear in this film only two of them maintained widespread popularity  the aforementioned Easy to Love and I've Got You Under My Skin which Lucy sings to a fairly embarrassed Ted.".

As a tapper she's a topper. Add to that those high Charlotte Greenwood kicks. The numbers in this movie particularly the grand Navy finale were outstanding.There is more dancing to be praised. At this time in his career Buddy Ebsen was what was called an eccentric dancer. He had as much dance screen time as Powell. Not to complain because he provided a great deal of fun.Reginald Gardiner as a Central Park cop wildly conducting an orchestra was a hoot. Someone noted it was similar to a Danny Kaye outing. I thought it was an exaggerated Charlie Chaplin.Some of my favorite moments though featured Una Merkel and her husband Sid Silvers also active behind the scenes. She is a lovable ditzy blonde. Some of my favorite favorite scenes were between her and their 312year old daughter played by an adorable and hip Juanita Quigley. Their giveandtake were warm and hilarious. The kid asks question after question and mom's standard answer is go and play. The kids expressions are unbeatable.And of course there is the Cole Porter music and the charm of Jimmy Stewart  singin' Stewart. His dancing was  er  and his singing was  er  charming. He pulled it off.One thing that hit home was the Central Park location of West 67th St because it was about a mile from my high school on West 86th.Anyway bunches of kudos to everyone who had anything to do with this great movie.".

Since then I have viewed this movie at least a dozen times and enjoyed it immensely each time. Eleanor Powell dances like no one else but what I found most appealing is that the movie is structured something like an operetta. Much of the narrative is sung including the opening scene of the sailors on the submarines and then the characters at the Lonely Hearts Club. I also appreciated the ensemble work which features throughout the movie. While Parker is clearly the star the other characters are well drawn and have songs and scenes of their own. The scene where Eleanor Powell and James Stewart visit the model home greeted by the extraordinarily effete Bennett Parker is hilarious. The specialty numbers with Georges  Jalna and with Reginald Gardiner are highly entertaining. Virginia Bruce was pleasantly bitchy in her role as a divalike Broadway star. The Cole Porter songs are sublime. It makes a person sad to think that Hollywood once routinely produced such delectable entertainments.".

There is something about his movies that I find appealingly graceful and exhilarating especially movies like On the Avenue My Lucky Star Folies Bergere de Paris and Lady Killer.

	schema:headline " Just a few spoilers  excellent Broadway Melody 1936 and 12";
	schema:reviewBody "This musical there's a lot that is said about it in other comments above is probably one of the best musicals before the 40's ever made. Why? Well yes there is campy humor and there isn't the dual star power of Elenor Powell and Fred. Or Fred Astaire and Ginger. But what makes this film so great is well you have to look at Broadway Melody movies 1929 1936 1938 1940 and Ziegfield Girl 1942 to compare them. What you'll find is a typical Broadway Melody theme. The Broadway Melody theme is the lead actress is trying to get a dancing part on Broadway. Pure and simple and every campy joke and fun action revolves around to some extent that theme. Elenor Powell takes on this same role in this movie as most of the others she's a girl from a small town trying to hit it big by getting a dancing job in Broadway.Some of the humor is dated in all these movies but that's to be expected. There's a couple of pauses or long scenes that could have been left out and almost fill in as filler being comic relief and these are in all the Ruth Del Ray's pictures.What makes this musical so great is it doesn't rely on the main two or four characters in the movie. Each subplot is plausible humorous and although not slapstick is something that is unexpected. Each scene when viewed for the first time comes from out of nowhere seemingly yet if fits perfectly into the plot or subplot. Each character furthermore and I'm talking about the supporting cast are PERFECTLY cast. It's more than humor it's high humor that could be used as a form of tongue in the cheek commentary on the craziness of the world. For example the Captain of the ship is incompetent in a lovable way so much like all the authority figures we often see in government or even the service but this character  Captain Dingby is more lovable almost like a cartoon character. He's played perfectly by the actor. Then there's the sailor getting married and leaving home and all the repercussions of that yet played out in a humorous way. Actually the beginning and end of the movie plays into one big joke that's about Gunny Saks. Perfectly bookending the movie. There's actually so much to say but I've watched this movie more times than I'd care to admit. The child listening in on mom's conversation and humor involved in that even pig Latin. Priceless it's almost a commentary and a time capsule of American life really I'd have to say it's working on so many levels.Okay what are the weaknesses. Well the policeman leading the pretend symphony probably a long parody of a conductor at the time but it plays to long especially for modern audiences. Then there's the looking at the honeymoon cottage tour it's a little on the long side but it gives some backstory to the things a young couple of that time might do spending time. Those are the down parts. The rest is really well done. Some of the tunes and accompaniment seem a little childish and dated like the pipe sounds when Elenor is dancing her first time. But the timing and buildup of the music and even the timing and crosscutting between the scenes is PERFECT. And I mean perfect it's not like it's suspended and if you thought to try to figure out how long the other couple in the scene would take to get to their position it would take exactly the amount of time to the next cut to the next couple. Almost perfect editing. There's one almost jump cut like cut in the Lonely hearts club from a close up of Elenor and Jimmy to a medium shot a little off the same angle. Not bad.Almost every scene even if it adds a little humor helps define a character and drives the action forward. Perfect construction as perfect as a Hitchcock movie but his is humor. Also the scenes are unexpected enough to be somewhat shocking in humor in that you don't know or cannot guess what will happen next yet it all holds together. The only other movie that I've seen that does this BUT to an EXTREME as well is Something about Mary. But Something about Mary of course is all shock humor and the humor in Something about Mary is funny because of the shock and over the top nature. When you watch Something About Mary a second time it's not funny or nearly as funny as the first time because half the fun of it was the shock and not knowing what would happen. This is not true with Born to Dance.Born to Dance is as funny the second time you watch it as it was the first time. This I think is because the humor is true comedy and a higher form of comedy. Yes it's still fluff but it's also a commentary about how people really are. The comedy although light is as true today as it would be in 1936.So with near perfect construction a multitude of plots pretty good songs as others have pointed out. And even scoring buildup that structures the songs in almost three parts in a classical sense this is just a GREAT MUSICAL.I think a lot of later musicals took a lot from the Broadway Melody movies but you'd have to watch them to see this.Highly recommended. And fortunately I have the LaserDisk version. Will buy the DVD if it ever comes out.Greg".

I guess it was one of those plot lines that just doesn't translate in these days of DNA testing  Shades of Maury!! TMC was having an entire day of Eleanor Powell movies on the Monday before Thanksgiving. I remember my Mom just loving anything Eleanor Powell did... now THAT's Entertainment ";

Stewart and Powell don't have much chemistry but they do have a natural rapport they were both frank sporty outdoorsy types.But today there is really only one reason to hunt down this movie the big finale by the 24yearold Eleanor Powell. Though both the battleship set and the naval costumes are a monument to bad taste Powell's dancing is an amazing display of strength speed rhythm endurance precision and control and has to be seen four or five times in order to take it all in. It is shot mainly in long takes and combines tap ballet and athletics in the way only Powell could quite manage. The Cole Porter song Swingin' the Jinx Away used as backing is also very clever although Easy to Love is better and is the song that is usually remembered from this movie.".

	schema:headline " Very nice film with amusing parts as well";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film too along with the other Broadway Melody films and many other 1930s and 1940s films of this ilk. Navy sailors Ted James Stewart Mush Buddy Ebson and Gunny Saks Sid Silvers stop in Port in New York for a break Ted is the only one granted a few day leave of the three. Mush and Gunny are given an order by Captain Raymond Walburnto deliver a letter across town to the Brooklyn Navy yard but get sidetracked by going into the Lonely hearts club where Gunny's estranged wife Jenny Una Merkel is staying. Gunny's actually the strange one according to Jenny. Ted meets also Lonely hearts newcomer Nora Eleanor Powell while there and romance takes off beautifully as they merge into one of my favorite songs of the film I'm nuts about you with Mush and the beauty he meets Frances Langford who are also falling for each other while they're all singing and dancing I loved it. Other favorite songs of the film were Ted and Nora's version of Easy to love in the park very good I also loved Easy to love sung in two Esther Williams films in the 1940s and Broadway actress Lucy James' Virginia Bruce's version of I got you under my skin her version came before Frank Sinatra's version but his version became more well known. When Lucy and Ted were getting together under the order of Virginia's show director Alan Dinehart Ted broke Nora's heart in the process since she didn't know that Ted was being ordered by Alan to go out with Lucy Nora just though Ted had chose to ditch her for Lucy. I found sort of funny when Lucy brought her little Pekenese on board the ship sang a quirky little tune about him then the dog jumping into the water and the entire Navy jumping in to get it. Ted beat everyone else to it. That's why Ted was ordered by Alan to accompany Lucy.I enjoyed the quirkyness in this film the Captain had a comical attitude. For instance he would yell to Gunny and Mush after failing to deliver that letter do you know what this means!!? Gunny no. Captain  Do you!!?. Mush no. Then Captain suddenly more calmly well there you are then then yelling again Put Saks in the brig!!Jenny certainly didn't treat Gunny well but I guess a lot of wives would be bitter after just so newly being married the two of them first engaging in a marathon dance and then him running off into the Navy for four years. Gunny was gone so long that he never even met his 4 year old daughter. The subplot with Lucy and Ted with Eleanor being her understudy was OK but Lucy's attitude got a little bit too nasty to keep her likable. I loved Virginia Bruce in The great Ziegfeld and her musical numbers in that film were great especially the wonderful You're really looking beautiful tonight. But even there she had a temperamental side such as when she yelled and smashed Ziegfeld's William Powell's elephant statue. Speaking of Powell Eleanor Powell in this film was very nice. That first song of hers Rapa tap on wood I liked and even found sort of amusing in one part where it was the first time I ever heard someone say Mickey mice. Eleanor did show her amazing dancing skills again just like in the Broadway melody films and Rosalie which I also lived. And that layback then kick move of Eleanor's was amazing and I read that it was so hard to do that very few dancers have mastered it besides her.Also a good number of the cast in this film was also in either Broadway melody 36  Broadway melody 38 or both".

	schema:reviewBody "Much of the creative team that had produced the Oscarwinning Broadway Melody of 1936 collaborated again the following year on Born to Dance. Though the former film somehow managed to cop an Oscar nomination for Best Picture the latter film is better in every conceivable way.The plot is shoestring thin but then weren't all of the plots of these 1930s musicals. What this film has going for it is the cast lead by Eleanor Powell and a young James Stewart who outshines every other cast member Powell included with the screen presence and charm that would make him one of the most enduring actors in Hollywood history. It also has great songs by Cole Porter which sound much more like the Broadway musicals of a decade later than other musicals from the 30s. And the songs for the most part are integrated into the plot rather than existing as standalone showwithinashow numbers that were in vogue at the time. Una Merkel and Sid Silvers deliver in supporting roles while Buddy Ebsen who also appeared in Broadway Melody of 1936 appears in this one as well and is just as weird as in the previous film performing dance routines in his inexplicably gangly floppy style. The Swingin' the Jinx number that serves as the movie's finale was nominated for the shortlived Oscar category of Best Dance Direction but it's a number early in the film performed by all four principal cast members that proves to be most memorable. Cole Porter's song I've Got You Under My Skin was also nominated for an Oscar though personally it's my least favorite song in the score.A bit front loaded Born to Dance slows down as it goes and nothing in its last half is as good as in the first but it's still a really fun movie.Grade B".

BUDDY EBSEN is a great dancer but his singing voice is minimal for vocalizing. VIRGINIA BRUCE gets through a couple of songs with her modest talent but again neither performer is capable of putting over Cole Porter standards.The story is that of a girl aspiring to be a Broadway singerdancer and it's tailormade for the bubbly energetic Powell who rescues the plot from being completely banal by her mere presence. SID SILVERS is amusing enough in a minor role as is REGINALD GARDINER but clearly the film belongs to Powell whenever she goes into her dance.Directed by the reliable Roy Del Ruth it's pleasant enough but clearly a product of its time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Born to Dance for a number of reasons. One was that it was a musical for as long as I can remember I have loved musicals and some of my favourite films are musicals. There is also Eleanor Powell who is an incredible performer. And there is James Stewart who is one of my alltime favourite actors.Born to Dance was interesting to say the least. But it was disappointing as well in a way. What didn't work for me was some of the dialogue some of it is genuinely humorous and witty but there are other times where it is painful and just bizarre. Buddy Ebsen is a good enough dancer but his singing is very minimal and does little justice to the wonderful musical numbers.I hate to say this but Stewart was a rare disappointment in this one. Stewart was a great actor and had been in many wonderful movies but in all honesty his role as Ted is one of my least favourites of his. His acting is good enough he is still the charismatic and endearing James Stewart I know and love but his singing and dancing are a different story. His singing is flat and quite limited in range mostly Easy to Love is listenable but there are other times where he sounds as though he knows the songs are too big for him while his dancing is heavy and flatfooted.Problems aside Born to Dance does have a number of good things. The story is a simple one with some predictable scenes but it is also very charming with enough heart to satisfy. The dancing is wonderful to watch especially Eleanor Powell's tap dancing and the ingeneral brisk pacing ensures that Born to Dance has few dull spots.The production values are top drawer the sets and locations are striking the costumes are beautifully tailored and the cinematography is quite exemplary and doesn't look dated. While there are two disappointments in the cast there are several good ones. Virginia Bruce seems to be having a whale of a time and Frances Langford demonstrates a stunning vocal technique. Reginald Gardiner's cameo is very awkward but also quite amusing at the same time.In my mind Eleanor Powell gives the best performance her acting is great her charisma is infectious her singing is wellabove average and energetic and her dancing fares best of all as it is incredible. Other than Powell's performance Cole Porter's music is the other high point. The background scoring is beautiful and very memorable while the songs especially RapTap on Wood Love Love my Peckinese and the big production number at the end are outstanding with catchy melodies and witty lyrics as one would expect from Porter.In conclusion interesting film musical but I would be lying if the pang of disappointment wasn't in the air. 710 Bethany Cox".

Ebsen can't sing either and his dancing which makes him look like he's having an epileptic fit is unintentionally hysterical. This gets a 5 for the songs dancing and Powell.

The gem for me was not the long finale but her dance in Central Park to Easy to Love. Beautiful! But that gets interrupted by Reginald Gardner's turn as a conductor doing a Charlie Chaplin imitation. I yearned to watch Eleanor dancing instead of the stupidity being inflicted upon us. And it is too bad that Francis Langford did not get I've Got You Under My Skin. Virginia Bruce does nothing with it. Powell seems to have so much fun while she is dancing  it's infectious. And of course bw is best for musicals. You get a field of depth that color cannot accommodate. And they knew how to exploit that depth in the 30s!".

In fact  she had difficulty remembering her lines and the crew believed it was because of alcohol abuse  but only later did they realize they were seeing the early stages of her Alzheimer's condition . Besides  there appears habitual secondaries who usually work in American productions shot in Mexico  such as  Gregory Sierra  Enrique Lucero and Chano Urueta .

Hayworth appears briefly as Langella's tormented mother.  The action is fast and well staged and the film's humor is so effective that it has often been seen mistakenly I believe as a spoof of its genre rather than as the fine example it is of the genre at its best.  This whole line of reasoning bothers me because it implies that an adventure movie can't be funny that it has to take itself deadly serious.  Much like Duck You Sucker! this film's irreverent humor is one of its main ingredients but it does not detract from its standing as a decent action flick.  It's in fact closer to the way action pictures are made today  I would question whether the critics and fans who see this as a parody also think that Schwartzenegger's Commando and The Running Man are also parodies?As Mitchum's character becomes more involved with Langella's peasant village giving them the sacrament because they haven't seen a priest in years he begins to BECOME the priest of his congame but his actions keep his friends and Langella guessing as to the extent of his conversion. This brings up the theme of the appearance becoming the reality an unusual theme for a western action flick.  Good performances and an unusually good film results.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wrath Of God is a kind of parody on the films Robert Mitchum was so routinely cast in back in the Forties and Fifties and even later on which he was doing know for a good paycheck. It's funny in spots but ultimately doesn't quite come off.Humphrey Bogart's The Left Hand Of God is the closest comparison one can make to this film. Bogart is also an adventurer in priestly disguise who aids a Chinese village during Kuomintang China days.The Wrath Of God has Mitchum as a priest who is also a conman and handy with a variety of weapons particularly the Thompson submachine gun. He Victor Buono and Kenneth Hutcherson form an alliance of convenience which wasn't easy with Buono and Hutcherson refighting all the recent troubles in Ireland.They get impressed into service by a strutting Colonel played by John Colicos whose behavior and that of his troops doesn't inspire a whole lot of confidence that Colicos's bunch are the good guys. Colicos has to get inside the stronghold of a wealthy Don played by a young Frank Langella in one of his earliest films. Colicos is no prize but Langella is positively psychotic especially on the subject of religion. In his domain he's forbade the Catholic Church and any of its priests from any practice of the religion. He's got his reasons but they're kind of out in left field to say the least. Mitchum's convincing guise a priest might just draw him out.The Wrath Of God marked the final screen appearance of Rita Hayworth who got the film as an act of charity by Mitchum according to the Lee Server biography of Mitchum. Hayworth was having financial problems and was drinking heavily. Little did anyone realize that the reason for her bad behavior which occasionally got reported in the press back then was the onset of Alzheimer's Disease. The woman was drinking literally because she was losing her mind. She caused a lot of production delays. A truly sad end to the woman who in my humble opinion was the greatest screen sex goddess of all.What delays Rita Hayworth didn't cause Ken Hutcherson did with an accident which injured his arm and the insurance had to pay big bucks. The film was delayed by several weeks while Hutcherson healed and as Server put in his book the insurance company wound up owning the film.They didn't wind up owning Gone With The Wind.".

One could only dream of what director Sergio Leone might have accomplished even given the awkwardly structured expositionladen storyline. Fortunately Nelson had a wonderful cast Mitchum Buono Hayworth and most notably Ken Hutchinson and John Colicos with which to work. Only Frank Langella seems to indulge in overacting and he arrives more than 45 minutes after the beginning of the film my 45 minute rule if a two hour movie is still introducing major characters after 45 minutes the movie is usually a dog. Fortunately Nelson handles the humor better than the drama and there is an abundance of it albeit irreverent.The theme of The Wrath of God is redemption through sacrifice. Mitchum did this better in Heaven Knows Mr. Allison. Sam Peckinpah did it better with The Wild Bunch. Richard Brooks did it better with The Professionals. Heck even Anthony Quin did it better in Guns for San Sebastian the movie this one most nearly resembles thematically. Still there is much to enjoy in The Wrath of God to dismiss it entirely even with the flat disappointing ending. I give The Wrath of God a 5.".

However the other character who stands out as having one of his best parts is Victor Buono as an English arms dealer who is strictly in it for the money. The device of focusing on him as he is thinking really makes his character stand out. At one point they are trying to talk him into using his car for a battering ram and all he is ready to get out of town before the shooting starts. The scene focuses on on as he is thinking They're trying to make a hero out of me. Not to spoil it but his death scene is really a good one. This is another movie viewers should try so see.

The director here is the successful Werner Jacobs and the writer is the equally successful if not more Franz Seitz. The cast includes a handful names who are still really popular today in Germany. Every German film buff knows Hans Kraus Peter Alexander Heintje Hannelore Elsner Theo Lingen and Willy Millowitsch at least their names. So you can certainly say this 90minute film has a starstudded cast. The story and film itself is probably not on par with these big names but it is still a satisfying watch. And this is mostly because the film does not take itself seriously at all even in the more dramatic moments. Yes the inclusion of Heintje early on was extremely random and just as a crowd pleaser as he added nothing to the story but the music was nice also by Peter Alexander and that made me deal with it easily. And one actor I have not mentioned yet is Rudolf Schndler as Knrz who is just so much fun to watch in all his scenes. I would have liked to have Lingen more screen time just like he did in the first but it's fine and the film works as a Peter Alexander showcase too because of the great range he has. And luckily for audiences Hans Kraus not a great actor honestly did not get so much screen time this time and still or maybe because of that he was improved compared to the original film. I think this was a decent watch and recommend it. Many more films should follow. Lets see how these are.".

It's also interesting to see the reactions of his friends especially Candy to his squanderings because another condition to the will is that he can't tell anyone what's going on.It's really quite a lot of fun and Pryor and Candy together make it worth watching.710".

That's unfortunate really because as comedic performances go Pryor strikes pure gold in this unheralded film. His manic energy his sheer frustration with the impossibility of his dilemma spend 30 million dollars until you are dead broke and not have a single penny or asset left at the end in order to inherit three HUNDRED million and the fact that he channels so much believability into what would otherwise be absurd are highly laudable. With an excellent supporting cast that included the likes of John Candy and Jerry Orbach it's hard to imagine anyone too jaded to enjoy this film. It's ridiculous and over the top to be sure but it's also supremely funny in a way much more pretentious comedies can't touch. Pryor breathes life into the film and the film glows as a result.

This all adds up to a series of very comical events which is most enjoyable to watch. Look out for the upcoming remake of this movie.";

His wealthy uncle dies and leaves him a 300 million inheritance....but there's a catch. In order to get it he must spend 30 million in 30 days. It might sound simple enough but a position in the New York stock market as well as a phony election campaign for mayor sometimes keep bringing spent money back to him. Hilarious complications ensue as Pryor attempts to spend all of the money and keep it spent without getting any of it back.

Pryor is very funny with all the excitement of spending a lot of money recklessly and trying not to receive any back but he has to have receipts for all spent.  The casting of some great comedians like John Candy Jerry Orbach and Hume Cronyn are a great asset to this film.  There is a lot of excitement and the baseball game between Hackensack Bulls and the New York Yankees is especially fun!

And a funny adaptation it is! Pryor plays a baseball player who prefers partying with his buddy John Candy. Once it's time for him to start spending he goes all out. I will say that this isn't the best work for either of them but Walter Hill's movie definitely elicits its share of laughs. The best part is Brewster's mayoral campaign he's the most truthful candidate of all time or at least the most realistic.The executives who formally give Brewster the money reminded me very much of the Dukes in Trading Places. As it is one of them is played by a man who seems to have spent much of his career playing bombastic executives David White aka Larry Tate on Bewitched. He went from playing an executive in The Apartment to playing the boss of a man married to a witch to playing an executive who gives 30 million to a ruletrashing cool dude. What a country indeed! Anyway the movie is at once a parable about profligacy and also just a plain old fun comedy. Brewster is a guy who quite simply knows how to party.

For instance when Brewsters rich uncle said that it was against the rules to buy a picasso and then turn it into firewood how come he was able to buy a valuable stamp and then have it canceled by mailing in effect devaluing it? I guess it wouldn't matter since he could give some money away but then why not just give it all to one person and save the time?".

I have read several of the other reviews which are dismal to say the least but I am now a fan of Richard Pryor after this film.  For truly awesome Pryor watch  Stir Crazy  instead.  This is a revamp of an older film of the same name that came out even before  talkies  in fact Thomas Jefferson may have seen the original!  The 1919 version could only be an archaic dusty relic that should be examined by archaeologists.  That is exactly why this film needed a fresh new take forget people that feel it is not close enough to the original it was 1985 during the  me  era and people were spending their dough like it was going out of style.  Ronald Reagan was president and Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton on  Family Ties  the Capitalist was the flavor of the week. Richard Pryor is Brewster a washed up baseball player who has been in the minors for 15 years it seems as if his dreams are being washed up along with his game.  His friend Spike played by John Candy not a super performance from him I might add is his good friend and catcher on the minor league ball team.  Brewster discovers that his great uncle  a  honky  in his own words is giving his last surviving heir a chance to get  300000000 or play it safe and get 1000000.  The only stipulation to get a the big pay out he needs to play a little game his great uncle was a crotchety tormented man too much cigar smoke watch the flick. Brewster has to spend 30 mill. in 30 days with absolutely no assets. That is a tough situation if ever there was one. The movie is really fun its fantastic to watch Pryor trying to spend every last penny.  I guess the movie's intention is to show how extravagance can be a real pain in the ass!!  I loved Pryor as Brewster I wanted him to be successful he is so damn funny and a truly likable guy.  Candy is the buddy role and his character is unfortunately two dimensional.  I love John Candy Bless Him but he cannot make much out of an under developed role.  Watch a hilarious performance of Seventh Heaven TV Minister as the conniving lawyer who seems like he has a rake up his ass and you really want to see him get his just desserts. The movie is a little slow at times but you will be cheering for Brewster along the way and see the hordes of regular people those without 30 mill to blow enjoying his riches.  The conclusion is a little bit weak as well but the many comic moments make up for it. Watch this flick it might be a winner for you.6.510".

This is not cerebral stuff but good humor and laughs while ignoring reality. It is am homage to a couple of fine film comedians who are no longer with us.Richard Pryor  John Candy did not work together enough and this movie makes up for that loss. This film allows Pryor to do his manic over the top behavior just perfectly. It allows Candy to do his humor well too. The support cast seems to be well fitted with the stars and the show goes smoothly and funny without going too long.Monte Brewster is a minor league pitcher for the Hackensack Bulls when the movie starts who wins a game  promptly gets into trouble at a bar fight celebration after the game. He and Candy compliment each other well especially at the court hearing. Then they are amazed to be bailed out by a stranger who has been taking photos of Monty.From Jersey the stranger takes them to a law office in New York City where Monte finds out he is rich from his Uncle Rupert Horne. The catch is does he want to be 1 million dollars richer or 300 million richer? In order to get the 300 he has to waste 30 million dollars and not have anything tangible to show for it in 30 days. From this premise the insanity of Pryor takes over and fits perfectly. He arranges for the Bulls to play the Yankees hires a huge staff including his buddy Candy  when his staff presents him with an unexpected 10 million dollar profit which puts him back where he started he gets a desperate idea to spend the extra millions. With 2 shady characters running for mayor Monty runs using Vote None of The Above as his campaign slogan. One reason I like this movie so much is my favorite political throw away line in any movieI'm asking people not to send any money to my campaign. I'm telling you to keep your money your going to need your money after this election.I keep hoping those words needing your money aren't true after our election of Obama but he seems to be spending money fast than Monty. Maybe when he is done in office he could star in a remake of this one?".

Then they are amazed to be bailed out by a stranger who has been taking photos of Monty.From Jersey the stranger takes them to a law office in New York City where Monte finds out he is rich from his Uncle Rupert Horne. The catch is does he want to be 1 million dollars richer or 300 million richer? In order to get the 300 he has to waste 30 million dollars and not have anything tangible to show for it in 30 days. From this premise the insanity of Pryor takes over and fits perfectly. He arranges for the Bulls to play the Yankees hires a huge staff including his buddy Candy  when his staff presents him with an unexpected 10 million dollar profit which puts him back where he started he gets a desperate idea to spend the extra millions. With 2 shady characters running for mayor Monty runs using Vote None of The Above as his campaign slogan. One reason I like this movie so much is my favorite political throw away line in any movieI'm asking people not to send any money to my campaign. I'm telling you to keep your money your going to need your money after this election.I keep hoping those words needing your money aren't true after our election of Obama but he seems to be spending money fast than Monty. Maybe when he is done in office he could star in a remake of this one?";

Monty Brewster has a chance to inherit over 300 million dollars from his late great uncle. However Brewster has only 30 days to spend 30 million dollars without accumulating assets. He must also avoid telling those around him the underlying reasons for his behavior. The film hints at this difficulty shown through Spike Nolan doing what he can as a caring and true friend to help Brewster increase his financial fortune. Naturally Nolan is shown being justifiably confused when he notices Brewster's discomfort when his income rises. The part where Brewster decides to go into politics is humorously entertaining.John Candy is actually youthful and exuberant in this too. Rick Moranis has a cameo too. Great to watch. Brewster's Millions is a lot better than so many other comedies today and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets dusted from the vaults again by Hollywood... I actually think director Walter Hill 48 Hours did a good job. This really holds up well through the years.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of those early movies that kinda popped outta nowhere for me. I think the earliest Pryor movies I remember seeing were double acts with Gene Wilder such as 'Stir Crazy'. As for Candy I believe I first saw him in 'National Lampoon's Vacation'. I remember this being a regular flick on TV back in the day always on in the afternoon or early evening easy going fun for all but also very easily lost under the radar. Believe it or not but this story is actually based on a novel from 1902 and there have been many film adaptations as well as theatre productions. The funny thing is these older films don't have quite the same impact for example...the 1945 version sees Brewster having to spend a mere 1 million Dollars in 60 days or less to inherit 7 million slight alteration from the original novel which has a full year to spend the 1 million. Now that feat would probably be relatively doable these days.The plot has always been one of much debate though it must be said. A rich old relation leaves Monty Brewster Pryor a tough decision in his will he can either take 1 million Dollars no questions asked right away or he can take the challenge. The challenge being he has 30 days to spend 30 million Dollars and not have any assets that he doesn't already own at the end of it. Further to that he must receive value for services of anyone he hires he cannot buy something expensive and just destroy it and he can't just give stuff away as gifts. He can only donate 5 to charity and gamble 5 away plus he cannot tell anyone of the challenge. If he manages to do this by the 30 day limit he will inherit 300 million Dollars if he fails he gets nothing not even the 1 million.Now this has to be a real nail biter of a decision and one that is sure to draw discussion after you've seen it. Its like that age old question...what would you do if you won a vast amount on the lottery? Personally I'd be more inclined to take the 1 million and run because surely in this day and age or even back then it would be impossible to spend 1 million per day for 30 days. The fact you cannot own anything by the deadline is not only painful but just impractical. The main reason being if you had that kind of money the first things most folk would buy would probably be property cars and gifts...all of which you can't do with this challenge. If you really really think about it it would be incredibly hard to do. But of course the lure is the 300 million money to literately burn but failure results in zilch.A great concept for sure with added imagination and teamed up with some stellar 80's casting. This movie really can't go wrong what better way to produce good comedic scenarios than having an everyday bum needing to spend spend spend on whatever he likes. The film practically writes itself you know what to expect when you read about it and having the crazy unpredictable force of Richard Pryor in the lead is a surefire winner. Sure enough its enormous fun watching Pryor go from zero to hero with his fortune. He walks around New York like he owns the city he's hiring people left and right on exorbitant salaries for menial tasks he's allowing people to pitch wacky preposterous inventions and ideas to him for funding making bad bets throwing big bashes running a protest campaign in the local elections for Mayor which would cost tonnes of money etc...The sequence where he buys a rare stamp the Inverted Jenny and then posts it is actually very clever indeed I would have never thought to do that. Although I'm not sure if a stamp that's just over 70 years of age in 1985 would be usable for actual postage I could be wrong. Another clever idea although part of the plot was hosting an exhibition game between the local baseball team Brewster plays for and the Yankees again I wouldn't of thought of that.Whilst watching questions do pop up in my little brain though. Even if he didn't manage to complete the challenge wouldn't he be able to stash amounts he earned through whatever venture in a bank account somewhere for later. If its not part of the 30 million I'm sure you could hide earnings especially bet winnings or stocks and shares earnings. The other thing that hit me was his electoral campaign for Mayor which he was winning hands down if he lost the challenge he could easily of kept that job. I don't think the company that was in charge of the challenge could take that away from him. Really I'm sure there could be ways of staying rich even if you did lose the challenge.I wouldn't really say I'm nitpicking but simply putting more thought into what I would have done if it was me just like the lottery question. This is just one of those happygolucky 80's productions that was extremely lighthearted and warm. As I said anyone can enjoy this with the ever dependable Candy in full flow with his funny fat faced expressions and mannerisms. Pryor shows he could do lovable easy comedy roles just as well as more edgy adult orientated ones and of course look out for an early Rick Moranis role. Not forgetting the great range of character actors and familiar faces supporting the main leads. A near perfect old classic underrated comedy with a fun story fun performances and a happy ending.910".

He and his friend Spike Nolan John Candy have dreams of joining the big league but the problem is that nobody is interested in them. Everything hits rock bottom when they are locked up in gaol for brawling and are not bailed out by their coach. But a strange guy pops up bails them out and takes them to New York City where Monty is brought into an office alone where three lawyers sit. Here he learns that he has inherited a lot of money but there is a catch. His great uncle doesn't want him to be taken for a ride but rather he wants him to use the money wisely so he says that he has thirty days to spend thirty million dollars. If he makes it then he gets three hundred million but if he fails he gets nothing. At the end of the thirty days he is allowed no assets he can only give 5 away to charity and can only loose 5 gambling. When hiring people he can only get his money's worth. Nor can he tell anybody about it. As such he has to get rid of all of the money while everybody else is trying to get him to save it.This movie is based on earlier movies and the critics did not like this one that much. I have not seen the earlier movies though would like to but I enjoyed this movie. Richard Pryor and John Candy are both good clean actors and comedians and the jokes are seriously funny in this one. It is quite amusing watching his friends wonder why Monty gets upset when he earns money and is joyous when he looses money.The whole purpose of this is to force Monty to get so sick of spending money that he won't blow away the money that his great uncle has earned. The lawyers want the money because if Monty fails then they get the 300 million. They don't think Monty can do it though but when it seems like he is succeeding they get scared and try to defraud him out of 20000 so that they still get the money. Thus it becomes a competition with very high stakes. Monty looses nothing if he fails but if the lawyers fail then they can be up for fraud.The interesting thing about it also is how people all come to bludge off Monty for the money. People swarm around him wanting jobs and simply money and others try to swindle him but Monty doesn't care. The fortunate thing is that when he wins everybody is going to think that he is broke and they are not going to bother him anymore while Brewster sits on millions of dollars. His friend Spike and the security guard show their friendship by collecting money for him after so we can see beyond the movie that Brewster will remember them for their generosity.The cleverest thing Brewster did was run for mayor and then withdrawal at the last minute. This was a very fortunate occurrence that there was a mayoral election on at that time because it would have been very difficult to get rid of it otherwise. The clever thing though was buying a very expensive stamp and then mailing it. It was this action that worried the lawyers and made them act against him.The critics did not like this movie but I do. This is a clever movie and Pryor and Candy are decent actors. Candy plays a good friend who is always there for Brewster and we know that this friendship will last even though Brewster has become a millionaire.Favourite Quote Spike to Monty when they are in gaol I don't think this is a race thing because I'm in here too its funny to me since having seen Hanging with the Homeboys a few days earlier.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Brewster's Millions is not a perfect movie by all means but it is a bright and breezy film that does have its heart in the right place. Also as far as comedies go it is not one of the most defining films of the genre but to be a good movie Brewster's Millions didn't need to be that.As I have said already Brewster's Millions is not a perfect film. The plot is on the predictable and simple side and I can understand why one might find it bizarre too with its concept and all though I did find it refreshing in a sense on the other side of the argument. The ending feels rather abrupt and could have been rounded off better and also while others may be divided on whether to perceive this as a flaw Brewster's Millions does have a theme that is firmly rooted in the 80s which may date it slightly.However it is nicely filmed with striking locations and nice cinematography and editing while the soundtrack is nicely 80s without dating the film. The film does work in its humour the script is funny without the need to be too sophisticated and smart while the odd situation also made me chuckle. The direction is good enough the film is paced well and it is a good length. And although the story is quite simple there is enough material to engage throughout and a lot of it is to do with the fun chemistry between Richard Pryor and John Candy. Pryor I can find loud and unfunny at times and other times where he is a lot of fun his performance here is the latter and it does help that his character and most of the characters here are likable while Candy really does shine. There is also a hilarious cameo from Rick Moranis and Jerry Orbach is always good value.All in all Brewster's Millions is a fun film with heart even if there are partsaspects that could have done with more work. 710 Bethany Cox".

	onyx:emotionText "While Brewster's Millions is not a perfect movie by all means but it is a bright and breezy film that does have its heart in the right place. Also as far as comedies go it is not one of the most defining films of the genre but to be a good movie Brewster's Millions didn't need to be that.As I have said already Brewster's Millions is not a perfect film. The plot is on the predictable and simple side and I can understand why one might find it bizarre too with its concept and all though I did find it refreshing in a sense on the other side of the argument. The ending feels rather abrupt and could have been rounded off better and also while others may be divided on whether to perceive this as a flaw Brewster's Millions does have a theme that is firmly rooted in the 80s which may date it slightly.However it is nicely filmed with striking locations and nice cinematography and editing while the soundtrack is nicely 80s without dating the film. The film does work in its humour the script is funny without the need to be too sophisticated and smart while the odd situation also made me chuckle. The direction is good enough the film is paced well and it is a good length.

Made in the context of Gordon Gecko's 'Greed is good' philosophy of the 1980's its lessons are just as relevant today as we face the economic disaster caused by the selfishness and greed of many of our financial institutions. Brewster finds that friendship loyalty honesty and generosity of the heart are far more valuable than the promise of material riches. John Candy's flawed yet redeeming character reminds us that we are all vulnerable to temptation but we don't have to succumb to it. I see Richard Pryor's Brewster join Orson Wells' Charles Foster Kane in his search for Rosebud. Unlike Kane Brewster's search is more successful. Like all good comedy this film not only entertains us with laughter but also offers us insight into the human condition.".

Tom Green is in it because his girlfriend felt sorry for him and wanted him to be in a film that got shown in a cinema outside of the US however his character is stupid and pointless.

I was among a cheering laughing crowd.You might think I was prejudiced. Wrong. Knowing for sure that this movie wasn't my cup of tea I prepared myself for getting everything I could from it. I wish it contains action I wish I can laugh I was thinking. Well the only thing I got was an awful need of walking out.This movie is so downright bad I don't know where to start First this is not Charlie's Angels. Aside from the fact that three girls are the main characters and they happen to follow the orders from a man called Charlie there's nothing more in common. All similarities end at that. This movie should be called Three girls and their dumb everyday life or something like that. But even retitled this movie would stink. And this affirmation takes me to the next megaflaws.Second the three girls are stupid. The Cameron Diaz character borders on retarded. But not in a funny way. She's plain stupid and acts like a nerd. I know that is supposed to be funny. Maybe for a 5 year old it is.Third there is no actual plot just a badly made up excuse for linking pitiful sketches together. This movie could have lasted 30 minutes or 6 hours. It feels disjointed. It's nothing more than a sucession of sketches.Fourth the soundtrack. Argh!. I can't even think of it without getting angry. Who in the world made that compilation a 17 year old boy? It's the most lazy soundtrack in movie history. Every time there's an actionfight scene some random hiphopmetal is thrown even though the song belongs to another emotional planet. It really sounds like someone would have put together a list of last years' most topical hits and played it randomly. The inclusion of Korn's Blind in an action scene can be called blasphemy.Fifth the action scenes. Over the top boring we've seen them all before.Sixth the pace. This movie simply hasn't. It's a steady sucession of boring action and poor jokes. Don't expect a climax. This is LINEAR. Urgh.As I know there is a word limit I won't go on. But I could speak easily about 20 awful things in this movie without thinking too hard.Wait there's something good. It's Bill Murray and I feel very sorry for him because he alone can't raise my rating to a 1.Avoid like plague.RATING 0.4".

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another old television show has been updated for the big screen. The new Charlie's Angels movie is cheesy and comical and it means to be. What we have here is a mindless but fun outing that will have women cheering and guys laughing. Diaz Liu and Barrymore portray the extraordinarily skilled team of crimefighters who seem able to do everything except lead a normal life. Bill Murray plays Bosley their supervisor and John Forsythe reprises his role as the voice of the team's boss Charlie. Their latest seemingly routine call involves rescuing and protecting a computer genius whose technology is about to fall into the wrong hands. Of course things wind up to be more complicated than expected and the Angels must use their talents to save the day. They quickly cross paths with a creepy individual played by Crispin Glover who some of you my remember as the nerdy George McFly from Back To The Future. He's changed his look a bit since then and ends up being one of the coolest big screen villains since Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode One which he was surely patterned after. This film is fun albeit silly fun and will entertain you on many levels. First time director McG pronounced MickG borrows shots and styles from many recent films. The most obvious similarities come from The Matrix allowing our heroes and villains to defy the laws of physics on numerous occasions. All of the fight scenes are spectacular and nicely choreographed with the exception of one involving Drew Barrymore towards the end. You would think with all of the fancy wirework and effects capability that they could at least give the illusion of Drew's kicks connecting with the bad guys. Bill Murray adds some nice extra comedy to an already funny film. Don't expect any Academy Award nominations but definitely expect a sequel. Mindnumbing entertainment can be great if you're in the right mood.".

It was great actionfilled excitement from beginning to end with very likable performances and was an excellent way to spend my spare time. I loved the fighting sequences because they were so tastefully and interestingly done and the acting was really good too for what it's worth like I said. I did think the script was poor and it had a lot of plot holes and I got a bit uninterested and felt the movie became way topo stereotypical at some parts even though it was enjoyably stereotypical to begin with but nonetheless this was a really great movie that I enjoyed watching for what it was and that is sheer joy and entertainment.

This is mainly down to the zany atmosphere created by first time filmmaker but expert poppromo director McG In fact the real tribute has to go to him for crafting a film this good out of a very difficult production which faced an incomplete script and personality clashes between some of the cast. The film is clearly tongue in cheek and references a lot of the stereotypical visual elements of action movies. From matrix bullet time to music video like super slow motion shots the films works slapstick comedy into a serviceable plot. The three leading ladies are good value ably supported by the rest of the cast albeit Bill Murray's role seems to almost like a one man stand up show has been worked into the film and seems a little out of place. Russell Carpenter's photography is vibrant and colourful and musical choices work well for the story.Overall a lot of enjoyable fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching Charlie's Angels there is a brief period of time where a smile is plastered onto your face and will not come off. The movie has everything anybody would want from a film like this. The best part is watching Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu literally kick the crap out of bad guys. Everything else in this film will not matter because after scenes like that nothing in the film even matters. Throughout you will forget it was based on the popular television showand just watch it like it was a newly conceived idea by Hollywood producers.If you want a hardcore plot wrong movie. If you want meaning wrong movie. If you want reality wrong movie. Charlie's Angels has none of these qualities throughout the film and that is what make it so amazing. In the film people jump out of Boeing 747 jets at twentythousand feet and nobody dies. People jump of one hundred foot castles and live to tell the story. Buildings explode sending our heroes into a car windshield and they walk off without a scratch. These parts even though they are very unreal gave me the sense of what I call in your face action. The Angels do have a small purpose though in carrying out these beautiful scenes.The Angels Natalie Diaz Alex Liu and Dylan Barrymore must rescue Eric KnoxSam Rockwell after being kidnapped. All signs point to Roger Corwin Tim Curry the villain in the film who the Angel's are highly suspicious of in stealing the new voice ID software developed by Knox himself. Along for the ride is a surprisingly not annoying Bill Murray as Bosley who does prove his worth as both the character and actor. Also joining is Crispin Glover as the creepy thin man who loves pulling women's hair out and smelling it. The Angels's have there hands full and they go through with the actions scenes in the film with so much enthusiasm.The action scenes as I mentioned before are very unreal. Even though they are unreal the film makes the action scenes so great by having the same style as The Matrix. The slowmotion back flips and the half speed car chases give the action scenes that edge that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. We all know that Lucy Liu can't do a 540 degree turn in midair or that Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz can hang off a helicopter and defuse a missile but who cares. These scenes will make the movie worthwhile believe me people.The action scenes are great and the comedy is just as good. I forgot to mention that this is an actioncomedy movie and both genres are proved to be great in this film. When there is no action the movie will be making jokes and making the theater laugh. Like when Alex's boyfriend Jason Matt LeBlanc who has a very small cameo is rehearsing his scene in an action film and drops the girl after she is shot. Or when Natalie is having one of her dream dance fantasies. The film is a hoot.Does Charlie's Angels stay true to the original who cares. I really don't care about the original because this film is spectacularly done. It is complete with everything real and unreal about Hollywood. Do not worry about plot dialog or direction because all of it is great. Just watch it to see Cameron Diaz Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore kick major butt. Watch it and then watch the smile on your face at the end.".

	schema:headline " My teenage obsession packed full of action eye candy and laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "I vividly remember this film being publicised and Destiny's Child's 'Independent Women Part 1' being in the charts as well as clips from this film being featured in the video when I was 13. I wanted to see this film when it was out in the cinemas but I couldn't see it then because I was too young due to its 15 certificate in the UK strangely enough it's a 12 in Ireland and a PG13 in America but when I was 14 my mum hired the DVD and I watched it under her supervision due to its violent content meaning I was okay. Finally when I turned 15 I received the DVD for my birthday that complemented my PS2 perfectly and I'd watch it every day after school to write down the script much to my sister's annoyance and frustration. I still have that DVD and I also found the film on LoveFilm Instant. After having watched it for the first time in a while I thoroughly enjoyed watching it just as much as I did as a teenager.I'd already heard of Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore when this film came out but this was the first time I'd ever heard of Lucy Liu all of whom played the Angels perfectly with their highoctane stunts numerous disguises and active leading roles especially Diaz as Natalie my favourite Angel who I found the funniest with her laughoutloud lines and superb dance moves whether in her dream or against a Soul Train replica stage. The story was gripping and dramatic especially when the Angels discover that Eric Knox's kidnapping was a setup and have to get their Bosley back. The lines are mostly fun if a bit silly yet memorable while the soundtrack is very good and I also have that on CD. Not only did the film's soundtrack feature songs that were on CD but also songs that were not on it e.g. Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean' and Blur's 'Song 2' and snippets of incidental music consisting of various arrangements of the 'Charlie's Angels' theme tune plus some eerie powerful and tense pieces. A lot of hard work and effort were put in the stunts and action scenes the film is somewhat fastpaced and some of the special effects are incredible especially the camera zooming into the cloudy sky of the Columbia logo before cutting to a plane flying against a real sky and the slowmotion bullet Knox fires when the moment he shoots Dylan out of the window is replayed. Afterwards Dylan rushes towards a house where two boys are playing a computer game and she asks them for help that house being the one featured in 'E.T. The Extra Terrestrial' in which Barrymore starred when she was a little girl. I was so impressed with the leading ladies' roles in this film that it prompted me to watch other works of theirs such as Diaz in 'There's Something About Mary' Liu in 'Ally McBeal' and Barrymore in '50 First Dates.' This film also inspired me to write a spinoff television episode that was based on the Simpsons episode 'Trilogy of Error' as well as a crossover story in which the Angels meet Shrek the titular character of yet another brilliant Diaz movie. While this film has several mistakes as listed on the likes of Slipups.com and Movie Mistakes.com they were still fun to spot and were saved by the humour and the action sequences. The outtakes at the end were a laugh as well.Overall this is an amazing girlie action flick that features memorable dialogue stunning stunts fantastic special effects and a superb soundtrack. I also recommend the sequel 'Charlie's Angels Full Throttle' which is even better. 1010.".

	onyx:emotionText "I vividly remember this film being publicised and Destiny's Child's 'Independent Women Part 1' being in the charts as well as clips from this film being featured in the video when I was 13. I wanted to see this film when it was out in the cinemas but I couldn't see it then because I was too young due to its 15 certificate in the UK strangely enough it's a 12 in Ireland and a PG13 in America but when I was 14 my mum hired the DVD and I watched it under her supervision due to its violent content meaning I was okay. Finally when I turned 15 I received the DVD for my birthday that complemented my PS2 perfectly and I'd watch it every day after school to write down the script much to my sister's annoyance and frustration. I still have that DVD and I also found the film on LoveFilm Instant. After having watched it for the first time in a while I thoroughly enjoyed watching it just as much as I did as a teenager.I'd already heard of Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore when this film came out but this was the first time I'd ever heard of Lucy Liu all of whom played the Angels perfectly with their highoctane stunts numerous disguises and active leading roles especially Diaz as Natalie my favourite Angel who I found the funniest with her laughoutloud lines and superb dance moves whether in her dream or against a Soul Train replica stage. The story was gripping and dramatic especially when the Angels discover that Eric Knox's kidnapping was a setup and have to get their Bosley back. The lines are mostly fun if a bit silly yet memorable while the soundtrack is very good and I also have that on CD. Not only did the film's soundtrack feature songs that were on CD but also songs that were not on it e.g. Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean' and Blur's 'Song 2' and snippets of incidental music consisting of various arrangements of the 'Charlie's Angels' theme tune plus some eerie powerful and tense pieces.

About the only way this material stands even a chance of succeeding is if the filmmakers treat it like some overthetop live action cartoon or is it video game?  which is pretty much what they've done.  Unfortunately it turns out to be a cartoon almost totally devoid of wit creativity and charm.  The plot mainly consists of finding ways to get the girls into campy costumes and situations.  Thus we have the angels as nuns the angels as welders the angels as exotic dancers.  The problem is that this cutesiness wears awfully thin after awhile especially since that is pretty much all the screenplay manages to come up with in the way of entertainment.The stunt sequences  which consist mainly of tedious slowmotion shots of the girls flipping through the air karatechopping the bad guys and dodging bullets  are so excessive in nature that we begin to understand what a detrimental effect The Matrix' however inadvertently has had on filmmaking in the past few years.   When any physical action  no matter how contrary to the laws of physics and gravity  is possible how are we supposed to care what happens to the people involved?  If no one seems to be in any real danger all possible suspense is eliminated and we are left admiring the work of the special effects team and very little else.  The Charlie's Angels' films are not alone in this regard but they do serve as handy warning signs of the potentially debilitating effect of this trend on the future of action movies.About halfway through the film Jaclyn Smith one of the angels from the original TV series shows up to dispense some veteran advice to one of our intrepid little cherubs.  Though long past her prime Smith is so goddessy beautiful in her brief moments on screen that not only does she outclass all three of the leading players but she makes us heaven forbid even feel a twinge of nostalgia  however faint  for the original series.  Frankly I didn't think that was possible.  Credit the makers of this fiasco for achieving at least that much with their film.".

Later they find out that the ring is one of a coded pair that once combined unlocks the data for the location of the entire witness protection programme.  The other ring has also been taken from it's holder and the holder murdered.  The Angels are charged to bring back the rings but along the way they encounter secrets from the past including a violent old flame from Dylan's youth seeking revenge and an exAngel striking out on her own.It was with a heavy but open heart that I went to see this film.  I had enjoyed the first film for all it's flaws but I didn't really want to see a film that just went over the same ground.  Happily CA2 didn't just make the same mistakes as the first film did  it actually went beyond them!  One problem with the first film was that the plot had too many scenes that just seemed to happen without reason or consequence the race cars scene for one.  However here the majority of the scenes seem to exist outside the plot.  It's like they knew that they wanted to repeat the essence of some scenes from the first film and if they couldn't fit them into the plot then they just dropped them in anyway.  Scenes that were enjoyable in the first film were just not quite as funny the second time round.The plot is so disjointed that it really does feel very episodic and I struggled sometimes to see the narrative flow  mainly because for large sections of the film there wasn't one.  Characters are dropped in for little reason scenes occur that are wedged into the plot simply because someone had the idea in isolation and got it added to the film etc.  However I won't waste time debating this here as I think many agree that this film was never meant to provide substance.  Which leaves us with style.  McG is aptly named as he is responsible for a mass produced product that seems to lack invention or spark of it's own.  It was possible to look at the first film as a tongue in cheek satire of blockbusters  but to do the same thing all over again made me realise that he wasn't satirising the cult of excess  he is actually part of it and worse he hasn't got ideas of his own.Hence we have scenes that are more like music videos.  The soundtrack pretty much covers the whole film lest we should have a quiet moment to think! Also the action scenes are subpar Matrix rips  once he may have gotten away with it but the joke has worn thin.  The action is just silly and makes it very hard to get excited or involved.  The opening sequence is just laughable and sets the tone  it's a shame as some of the fights are well choreographed and could have been good if they hadn't been pushed to being OTT.  The constant use of slow motion and linger shots of the girls' asses or blowing hair also gets quite tiresome in the end.  The film has quite a few good references to other movies eg Cape Fear  Sound Of Music however these only work if they exist as scenes themselves and not just as references.  To show you what I mean The Simpsons' spoofed Cape Fear but the episode stood in it's own right.  In CA2 some references seem only to exist as references and not part of the film.  The constant use of injokes and styles from other films stopped feeling like clever fleeting references and started to feel like McG just plundering for things to fill his film  I mean doesn't even the concept of a quest for a ring sound familiar to anyone never mind the Matrix effects?!The cast is amazing and it is to McG's further shame that he makes poor use of the majority of them.  The lead trio are good but as the outakes show seemed to have had more fun making it than I had watching it.  Liu comes out the best for my money as she is the most convincing fighter and is the sexiest!  Moore is alright in the support but she is poorly used  she really does have a very small role most of which is to show off her new body.  Mac is a major let down  from the trailer he had looked funny but the truth is that he gives a poor minstrel performance at best.  He has a few funny lines but he is not as funny as I've seen him  his failure makes the loss of Bill Murray feel 100 times greater.  Theroux is physically impressive but has a terrible accent that wonders from Northern Irish to Southern Irish to some sort of flat Scots at times.  The support cast is deep and mostly wasted  Bruce Willis has about 3 words and 1 minute of screen time Fisher Patrick Eve LeBlanc Wilson The Olsen's Smith Forster and Pink to name a handful all have very little to actually do and it just turns their scenes into a game of oh look it's '.  The biggest waste is Cleese who is given nothing to do but do bug eyes over cheap innuendo and whisper ferret'.Overall I'm aware that to make these points is a waste of my time as many fans of this film will acknowledge them and say so what?'.  Hell  I half enjoyed the film as a piece of fluff for a Sunday afternoon with mindless action and sexy ladies  but it's hard for that to totally suffice and try as I might I couldn't help but feel like I wanted something more from it.".

The storyline is disjointed and the action sequences are so far overdone it's laughable. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but when the Angels are flying around like Matrix Agents even dodging bullets it just gets silly. There are numerous references to other films but I get the impression that they're included as padding rather than genuine homages.Demi Moore looks great but is wasted in this compost heap of a film. If ever there was an argument for not buying a DVD before you've watched it this is it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film at the recommendation of my 13 yearold daughter. I like the original film version of a few years ago but Full Throttle lacks the wit and charm of its predecessor. It therefore had to rely on action and special effects which I found boring and I like action films. The dialogue was weak and in particular the special effects were disappointing for this day and age. There was too much obvious work in front of the blue screen and the situations were so preposterous that I eventually gave up on the film after enduring too much of a particularly ridiculous chase. I've only ever walked out on two other films in over 40 years. There is much better entertainment available.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked Charlie's Angels. It never took itself too seriously and Bill Murray provided some comic relief making the film more than just an hour and a half bikini advert. Something funny or unfunny happens in Charlie's Angels Full Throttle It's terrible. I mean this movie isn't bad it's just awful. The acting is even worse than the first there's no Bill Murray and what were all the stars making cameos in this film thinking? Bruce Willis Owen Wilson and others make brief appearences but what about Demi Moore Crispin Glover Back to the Future Robert Patrick better remembered as the T1000 in T2 John Cleese or was that a cameo? Luke Wilson Bernie Mac who now has his own very popular TV showhe didn't need this to hinder his career Matt LeBlanc Friends and so on and so forth who all took main roles? Okay I understand LeBlanc taking part in the film his career is going nowhere other than Friends but seriously Luke Wilson?! Between this and Legally Blonde 2 the man may never make a lead role again like in Old School a much funnier and more fun film than this. And John Cleese! What's with him and small roles lately? Harry Potter James Bond all of his roles are supporting Whatever happened to his acting career? And that's not to mention what in the  Cameron Diaz is doing in this movie. Drew Barrymore...maybe. Lucy Liu...definately. Cameron Diaz...NO WAY! I really like Cameron Diaz and she can act see There's Something About Mary but what in the name of H.G. Wells is she doing in this? And why does she act so bad in it? I understand playing homage to the show with bad acting and all like the first film but this pushes the limit. The direction style is worse thanks to McG and Drew Barrymore manages to steal the show as the alltime worst actress in recent years. I know it's not all herit's the script. Anyone who has to say the stuff these girls say in this film should know they're in trouble and should mutter the lines with utter chaos but it's unbearable how corny the things they say are. And just check out their acting in a dirt bike scene when Liu and Barrymore are worried and scared that Diaz's character might be in trouble. Youch! Bad acting to a new extreme. This film has the mediocrity of a horrible Bmovie from the seventies with a huge budget splattered on top.Originally titled Charlie's Angels Halo the name changed due to copyright on the video game Halo Full Throttle's plot is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. It's horribly contrived. Where should I begin? In the beginning of the film the three Angels Natalie Diaz Alex Liu and Dylan Barrymore rescue a hostage Patrick from a bunch of Hungarians. Stupidity ensues when the Angels fall off a bridge dodging a missile and manage to grab onto a helicopter or something before the truck they were in blows up. When watching this scene the first things that enters your brain is this How in the world did this pass Columbia TriStar's eyes? I mean that scene is the kind of stuff I used to think would be neat when I was about ten only back then they didn't make feature films out of idiotic ideas. Anyway on with the plot.After rescuing Patrick they find out he was carrying with him a ring on his finger that the Hungarians stole. This ring when joined with another reveals the entire database of those on the witness protection program and their real names. Good Lord I didn't know that the Government kept the names of their protected witnesses on a superduper ring gadget so easily stealable. I mean didn't this pass the actors and actresses' mindsmaybe the film might be a bit sore on the plot?I suppose that's not why people go to see this movie. They go to see the girls in bikinis. That's not a bad idea the first one was like that but if you're going to have a plot at least make it nonlaughable. Even the first film's plot was better than THIS!One thing leads to another pretty soon they find out Dylan who entered the witness protection program years ago is being targeted for assassination by the Creepy Thin Man Crispin Glover. One thing I found funny is that Crispin Glover refused to return for Back to the Future Part II demanding what writer Bob Gale said was unreasonable perks yet he returned for Charlie's Angels 2 in a flash. Interesting Crispin I see you've learned from your mistakessadly you've used your wisdom to return for a terrible film.Charlie's Angels Full Throttle isn't just miserable it isn't just awful it is just so mediocre it hurts. It's like on gargantuan mess filled to the rim with bad acting horrible Matrix ripoff fight scenes and a Godawful script all of which makes Charlie's Angels Full Throttle one of the biggest cinematic disasters in recent years. I could spend hours wondering why the beautiful and talented Cameron Diaz chose to appear in this film but in all honesty it hurts my brain just thinking about it. What hurts my brain even more is the fact that this film has grossed close to 100 mil already meaning more sequels. I weep for those that paid to see this movie expecting a treat. I'll say once more to the fans of the films that I enjoyed the original as a guilty pleasure but this is too much for me. Please no more sequels.1.55 stars John Ulmer".

An overthetop parody that keeps you gasping and laughing the entire time.If you want realistic action this movie is NOT it.  This is a liveaction cartoon beautifully shot in a kinetic MTV style.  Cameos are numerous Is that Bruce Willis?  Hey Pink! and watch for plenty of little homages to various campy TV series of the same genre.Most of all sit back and enjoy!  The three angels are as goofy as ever with their satiresincerity and fierce poses.  They each have a distinct personality trait which helps all the little subplots keep moving along.The supporting cast was fine too.  Bernie Mac's Bosley was an improvement over the first.  Lots of laughs!  Demi's Madison character was okay but I kept getting the impression she was trying too hard.  This is a parody and Madison should have been a hammedup villainess but Moore remained too seriously focused. This caused the character to seem out of step with the rest of the movie.  John Cleese was fine too.  His part was small and generally consisted of the tired joke of miscommunication about his daughter's Liu occupation.If you enjoyed the first Charlies Angels see this!  If you like goofy allout action fun see this!  If you want drama skip this.7 out of 10.".

It's not like they were trying to make Gone with the Wind.  But CA2 really is pathetic.  All the cartoon violence the idiotic costumes the nonexistent plot the obviously fake nudity it is a complete waste of time.  It's also not at all entertaining even though you know it's supposed to be stupid.  You just get that Oh my God is this movie moronic feeling over and over again.  The guy who flips upside down to shoot the Angels from his dirt bike!  HAHAHAHAH!  Man that was terrific!  And I am pretty sure it was supposed to be cool as opposed to completely stupid but I could be wrong.I doubt it's the worst movie of the year.  There is a lot of eye candy in this film it has to be better than Gigli which I haven't seen.  If you can get over the utter stupidity you might be able to sit through half of it before you have to either get out of the theatre or eject the DVD.  At least if you buy the DVD you can take your time getting through the whole thing.  It's so bad it's likely going to take 4 or 5 tries. But you could invite the guys over just to make fun of it!  At least with the first CA it was completely hokey the way the Angels beat up entire armies of baddies but it attempted to maintain some modicum of believability.  CA2 is just an out and out cartoon fantasy.  Totally uneven terribly fake action sequences really just an extended music video with bad jokes bad acting and bad action sequences.  I loved the part where Drew gets kicked in the teeth 3 times in a row by the big bad baddie and shakes it off. HAHAHAHAHA! Man she's tough!  NOTWaste of time.  I'll give it a 3 out of 10 one for each Angel just because they are willing to debase themselves with this utter drivel.  Now that takes courage!".

Charlie's Angels the tv series was full of camp and overthetop antics and did exploit the use of sexy women. The movies are based on this very notion meaning that if you go to see the movie you're going to see some campyspoof with some heavy moments of a campy 70's show.If you're into a fast and fun movie filled with lots of action noise and overthetop scenes then Charlie's Angels is for you! It's got a lot of great action and even though it seems pointless it's fun! Isn't that the whole point for seeing a movie in the first place  to have fun? I love drama and other sorts of movies but you really can't expect it from Charlie's Angels!The one thing that is at the center of the movies of course is the chemistry between Natalie Alex and Dylan. Diaz Liu and Barrymore have a wonderful chemistry together and they make things fun yet sincere.This movie with the addition of Demi Moore ROCKED! It was a solid kick ass movie. It's just about fun enjoyable and uplifting girl power at it's best! So sit back and enjoy it for what it is and stop worrying and stressing over the plot  cause it's not about plot it's about campyfun! ".

At that moment it is blindingly obvious that someone should have been working smarter not harder.  You can bet that when the CAFT audience laughed they weren't laughing with the auteur but at him. For action junkies only. C";

In the first movie the stunts were pretty fake but this one is terrible. I just want one of them to die because there are somethings that no way could they all survive after surviving the horrible explosion they were just in right after they kicked a hundred trained assassins' butts I know I exaggerate. Also in one part they jump out naked only to have to change into clothes. Why don't they just wear clothes in the first place. So stupid. I must admit that I liked the relationship thing between Natalie  Pete in this one just like in the first one. I just think that this movie was a waste of time and it did not pass the sequel test. It was one of the worst I've seen actually.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why are there so many negative reviews about Charlie's Angel's Full Throttle? McG proves that you don't need logic when it comes to having a good time and a good laugh. Neither do the screenwriters John August Cormac and Marianne Wibberley. Sure this trifecta of angels may not have wings on their backs but they sure can defy the laws of gravity. Taken a few pages off of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Natalie Cook Cameron Diaz Dylan Sanders Drew Barrymore and Alex Munday do what they do best dodge bullets survive explosions and kick baddies in the booties but more importantly stay as a cohesive unit even through wedding bells that almost split them apart. Sure it may boarder under glorifying ladies as athletic clever voluptuous and dangerous and while we guys are looked down as dimwitted aggressive and foolish but Charlie's Angels Full Throttle takes us on an energetic ride with enough highflying action that will surely make Issac Newton's theory null and void. No matter if the plot is thinner than Olive Oyl the quest that the angels embark on is after two rings beat that Tolkien that is needed by the villains so they can gain access to computer information that leads to the people enjoy the government's bountiful ways in the witness protection program. The leading villain is Madison Lee Demi Moore a former angel now a dark angel who obsessively needs the rings because if you put the two juxtaposed to each other it will open up the esoteric information needed so she can sell it the leading mafioso from Japan Italy and Latin America. While our heroes as expected find the rings completing their initiative is where the fun commences. The costumers makeup artists Kimberly Greene and Charyl Beasley Blackwell the angels go incognito throughout their whole mission even to point of looking stunning like they're painting the town red. The most fun is that former musicdirector McG ads more thrills than the previous installment in which the angels are on the hunt working for a man who never reveals his identity. Sure it repeats itself from the first part but hey who can ever be bored of the James Bond style opening scene as the threesome save a man from intimidating rouges sport six foot rapiers in the Mongolian mountains? And who could forget the dirtbike scenes with a nohold barred stipulation as they zoom across faster than you can say Ben Hur. The goo into a cartoon world where they push and even go far as to outrageously shoot their guns while upside down. When it comes to chemistry Liu Barrymore and Diaz truly have it and the alliance that these three have are some of the best ever displayed in cinematic history. The best part is no one tries to usurp the other one even though Diaz can really dance seductively. Of course the buzz will be focused on Demi Moore who's been off the screen for a while exhibiting her her sharp skills and a Renaissance figurine body proves she can be a formidable adversary to the angels. With all the energy needed this big budgeted film is filled with big stars supporting them like Crispin Glover as The Thin Man Bernie Mac as Det. Bosley and the John Cleese as Alex's dad who think due to Matt LeBlanc's subliminal wording has suspicion that Alex is biting off more than an angel could chew.".

Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films this is a very very long filmwith a runtime of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay this can seem like forever but since 3 Idiots is a very very good film I loved its length. And like most films of the genre it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know however is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy but it also has many poignant moments keep the Kleenex nearby some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to crysomething you rarely see in western films.As for the plot it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment so my advice is just sit back and watchand if you give it a chance I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your timewith a delightful script wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film.".

It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been The Legend of Rancho.Odd to me is that they speak in part English part Hindi through the movie kinda like some speak Spanglish here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable.

It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been The Legend of Rancho.Odd to me is that they speak in part English part Hindi through the movie kinda like some speak Spanglish here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable.

	schema:reviewBody "All is well the three idiot heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution or even a catalyst but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishlygiven birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.But all is well as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema is a comedydrama unlike any one I've ever seen long but never drawn out frantic but never desperate and emotional but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi R. Madhavan jittery fearful Raju Rastogi Sharman Joshi and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas Rancho Shamaldas Chhanchad Aamir Khan three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering ICE one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty with his father's expensive health bills his mother's fragile core and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work success will find you  yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film however. It uses this method much to its advantage and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely but it takes the viewer on a rollercoaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.One of their problems in college is the professordean of the campus Viru Sahastrabuddhe Boman Irani who the three derogatorily call Virus when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke rendering him unable to focus on academics for months falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.If anything we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure duty and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose but not every method is perfect and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide mental health problems and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers then you may want to reevaluate your methods.3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy uninspiring completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of living through a person that I can imagine.The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable human and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.Through every quickwitted song and dance number through every comedic scene through every instance of dramatic despair emotionally alive moment solemnly poignant sequence suspenseful setup to a lovely heartfelt conclusion 3 Idiots is a wonderful invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen.".

On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia Kareena... Many of the situationscharacters have resemblance or inspiration to Five Point Someone blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality ribtickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feelgood comic caper is leading to its culmination there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances all of them comes out with convincing portrayals but it is Aamir Khan the real showman of Bollywood steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that chase excellence and success will follow.. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...Verdict  THE BEST of 2009 !

I don't want to make spoilers in my review so that you will enjoy every minute of the movie. This movie is 244 hours length full of laughter joy tears drama and passion. And of course the most interesting part of the movie is GENIALITY. I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. I'm also waiting for Ferrari Ki sawari movie to watch. It is starred by one of the 3 idiots. Thank you India for giving us this brilliant movie.".

I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into moviemaking based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. When a friend of mine recommended this movie I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny so out of curiosity I got hold of a copy. My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing All iz well.. I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thoughtprovoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it.".

In short 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly the story offers so many twistsnturns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong filmmaking can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache the drama is attentiongrabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moisteyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.".

Simply brilliant.Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman Madhavan Boman Kareena  Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.Sharman  Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth panache humour and love that we don't want the journey to end.Sharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman you rock!Madhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the controlcrazy hyperactive hypercompetitive almost dictatorish college principal is beyond words. He plays it so so well that you love to hate him. He's that Good.Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms the walk the smile the attitude the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system his positive attitude towards every thing in life it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the superhuge wellbuilt temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani  Vidhu Vinod Chopra.Clich word but I have to use it  FANTASTIC !! 1010 P.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'".

And the first movie was 3 Idiots. I don't know who picked the movie. To be honest I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title which translated back into English is 3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood. I expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. It's a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points shed tears at other points and think all the time.It's about friendship dream love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study which causes a lot of students' losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times including those times I watched it in my class with my students.I give it a ten.".

Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie intertwined with some teary scenes all is well if you follow your passion chase excellence and success will follow be brave and follow your dream think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success  that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dreampassion.Excellent acting colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship love family and playfulstressful campus life.Every student teacher and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes  Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogmawhich is living with the results of other people's thinking. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. Both Steve and the Rancho character Aamir Khan are smart and creative nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie intertwined with some teary scenes all is well if you follow your passion chase excellence and success will follow be brave and follow your dream think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success  that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dreampassion.Excellent acting colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship love family and playfulstressful campus life.Every student teacher and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes  Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogmawhich is living with the results of other people's thinking. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

I went in thinking this would be India's version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk flunking classes and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely wellmade film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch!".

	schema:reviewBody "As you can see I'm a huge movie buff. However my scope is strictly limited to Englishspeaking movies. In other words I have scruples watching foreign movies in subtitles. Nevertheless I'm completely in the state of idleness for the whole summer. What's even worse I've run out of American movies to watch since I've basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a JimCarreyparodylike comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious. On account of my preference for serious movies I tend to ignore those silly comedies. However my friend's nonstop imploring drove me nuts. To humor him I decided to give the movie a try.The beginning was kinda within my expectation. Two goofy idiots started to turn the world around them upside down by extremely overthe top actionsstopping a flight hitchhiking a limousine they reached an observatory of The Imperial College of Engineering aka ICE their alma mater to meet a friend they've lost contact for six years. Only to find another classmate Chatur who started to boast himself for his success over some guy named Rancho. Until then I was feeling this movie was no different than any other comedies. However the following sequences kicked in and I was completely blown away. It all started with a magnificent melody that unveiled the main storyline.The main character Rancho was a guy who was enrolled in ICE. However he was totally different than any other students. Instead of studying by rote like any other students he focused more on the practical aspect of the knowledge. As a result he was able to shock a bully in the groin with electricity. There was another student like him who was working on his own helicopter project. However their director Virusa nickname of course wouldn't allow him to graduate. The heartbreaking rejection ultimately led to the student's suicide. Rancho realized the education system in India was extremely flawed. It suppressed the personalities of all the students focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho decided to step up against it. He kept challenging his teachers and even the director. He made 2 good friends Farhan and Rajuthe two goofy idiots in the beginning and really inspired them. Later he met a girl named Pia who turned out to be the director's daughter. A lot of clashes occurred in Rancho's intent to change the education system and even his friendship was put to test. The ending of the movie was so touching that anybody would shed tears from their eyes with a small twist that would made everything pleasant once again.Overall it's really a sweet movie. It can be a comedy at times with a lot of overthetop action from Rancho and his friends. However it's a lot more than that. It's more of an insight into the education system of India which is similar to those in the likes of other Asian countries like China Japan and Korea. It can at times be so heart warming that your tears can't help but surge out like waterfalls. It can be a musical too with a lot of exotic dances and songs which are common among Indian movies. Great film. Totally change my impression for Indian movies. Easily 1010.".

I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharman's family. A typical 1950's family it's hilarious as well as genius. The film has Superb Performances Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mindblowing as the vicious head.

Because of the hard works and lack of fun you're totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that you're lazy. And what's even funnier is that 80 of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.That's why we love the film it showed our mind it's not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry.

	schema:reviewBody "3 NEEDLES as written and directed by Thom Fitzgerald The Hanging Garden The Wild Dogs Blood Moon Beefcake is a powerful statement about the insidious spread of AIDS throughout the world taking us to places we the viewers would rarely visit from the news media emphasis on the disease. The film is three stories in three countries told in tandem not unlike the technique so successfully used in BABEL CRASH and TRAFFIC. Employing cinematography of enormous talent and a cast of terrific actors Fitzgerald manages to share his stories with such sensitivity that every viewer will feel involved in the tragedy that is rotting away our globe.The film opens with a ceremony in Africa supposedly South Africa where young boys undergo ritualistic circumcision learn the fighting tricks of manhood and move into society as Men. This single portion of the film is intensely beautiful in its nonvoyeuristic observation of an ages old ritual so beautiful to watch that it calls for PauseReplay! From Africa we go to rural China where Jin Ping Lucy Liu speaking Mandarin only is the very pregnant force who runs an underground blood bank which while serving the donors with some cash also contaminates the population with HIV virus we discover that Jin Ling is HIV positive carrying a baby at risk and supporting her HIV husband. The trials she encounters in her shady business are nothing to the moment of personal anguish when she delivers her baby without assistance in a cornfield.Moving to Canada we meet Denys Shawn Ashmore a porn star who is HIV positive but steals blood from his ill father for his frequent 'tests' required by the porn director to hide his positive status in order to continue making porn movies to support his family. His mother Olive Stockard Channing discovers his status hears about AIDS patients' ability to cash in on life insurance early and infects herself so that she can take advantage of the early insurance cash to provide a life of comfort in the small time they both now have for herself and her now fatherless son.And we return to South Africa where three nuns  Sister Clara Chlo Sevigny Sister Hilde Francis Olympia Dukakis and Sister Mary John Sandra Oh  set up a clinic to treat the villagers finding only that acts of tremendous selfsacrifice can stave off the spread of the gore of AIDS. The Men we have watched in the beginning of the film walk into the life that faces a world crippled by HIV and the contrast is powerful.3 NEEDLES' cinematographer Tom Harting deserves awards for the sheer magnificence of his images he captures on film not only the majestic vistas of Africa and China but also the intimate moments such as Jin Ping's birthing. The musical score by Christophe Beck and Trevor Morris manages to find the atmosphere of each of the three stations of the cross Fitzgerald examines. The acting cast both the gifted wellknown actors as well as the smaller roles by unknowns in each location is magnificent. If the film has a flaw it is in the unfortunate arena of avoiding preaching watching and hearing the events is so very powerful that words of summation feel superficial and even insulting. But that is a small flaw in a film of wonder. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I was fortunate to see the director's cut of this film at the DC Filmfest. The audience was privileged to have the director Thom Fitzgerald make an unannounced visit and stay for questions afterwards.3 Needles is three separate stories how AIDS spread in China Africa and the United States.I found it a bit confusing to begin with some African scenes and then jump to the China story. I think this was to allow the narrator to introduce and to end the movie. The narrator was Olympia Dukakis and she had a part in the African story.Lucy Liu led an outstanding cast in the story of its spread to China. Until this film I did not realize that China had an AIDS epidemic. The movie shows how AIDS was spread through blood collection stations throughout rural China. China's vast rural population was perfect for exploitation. They were isolated they needed the money it took a long time to associate entire villages dying with the helpful blood collector.The US story is somewhat familiar to us. A male porn star spreads it knowingly due to his greed. What makes this story unique is how Stockard Channing handles the discovery that her son is not only a porn star but is dying. She educates herself on the disease and discovers a breed of vultures buying up the insurance policies of AIDS victims viaticum companies hedging their bets that purchasing a 2M policy for 1M will double their investment. She sets out to give herself AIDS and sell her insurance policy. What she does with the proceeds is the controversial part.The African story reveals the director's Roman Catholic roots. One wishes that Sandra Oh had a larger part in this story. Chloe Sevigny is wonderful as a dedicated nun who chooses to submit to the local plantation owner sorry don't remember the African name for plantation in order to get revenge  punishment on an adult male who has raped a young young virginal child in order to rid himself of the AIDS virus. As with the others this story shows the many facets of this disease and the difficulty in assigning blame for its spread or for how people handle it.Each of the stories has an odd element of humor to it. At times I found it inappropriate for the subject but perhaps that is also the message we can laugh despite the hardships. I saw the director's cut I wonder if this will be removed  downplayed in the cut that's released.The cinematography is beautiful and sweeping in both Asia and Africa. The US scenes manage to show a true grit feeling.Kudos to the director for assembling a really outstanding set of actors. Outstanding performances from Lucy Liu the fatherdaughter team from the China story and Ian Roberts the plantation owner.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this last night and just can't stop thinking about it. This film is offthecharts audacious in its blend of tragedy and dark humor with cinematography that ranges from powerfully beautiful the South African sequences reminded me of John Ford movies like The Searchers to a seedy quality that subtly conveys the weirdness of its humor and unethical qualities of its characters. The film also never flinches from showing us such taboos as male nudity and the indignities of a terminally ill man. Like the movie Babel this movie contains three stories two of which are set in faroff lands all dealing with complex issues and tragic ignorance.The first story is about how practically an entire village in China acquires AIDS due to povertydriven greed. The film's edge is in how it turns the tables on us psychologically the people are not what they seem and greed is not always clearcut when it is a basic means of survival. The second story is a strange tale of a mother who handles the death of her husband and 'acceptance' of the fact that her son has AIDS in a way that leaves the viewer extremely perplexed and uncomfortable which is actually a good thing. This film doesn't flinch from showing us AIDS stories we don't want to believe such as those people who purposefully acquire it. It mixes dark humor with beautiful metaphors such as the mother driving her sports car into an enormous pile of red leaves until she's practically buried in it. The final seconds of that story leave a chilling print embedded on one's brain what is this woman thinking?? The third story juggles a whole range of issues regarding ignorance religion greed selfishness and selflessness and balances them all on a head of a pin. One false move and the story would have come off as preachy or exploitational. Again there is an iconic scene that stays indelibly in my mind the beautiful and horrific sight of a woman's dead body lying under a thin blanket of mud.The entire film does has some rough edges which may at first put some viewers off. I found Olympia Dukakis' narration a bit difficult to accept at the beginning of the movie during a strange and fascinating African ritual of male circumcision but it all comes together by the very end  in fact quite powerfully. The film also jumps back and forth in past and present which may at times seem confusing but the ultimate effect makes us reread our initial assumptions. And the first film in particular is quite slow although again I think there was a point to its languorous pace. We all know that the disease in question in this film is AIDS but the location used in China is so rural that one feels that the time period could be any time in the past fifty years. In fact the circumcision scene at the beginning of the film makes one unaware of even what century we are witnessing! That I think is the director Thom Fitzgerald's genius. I read a review that criticized this movie for not mentioning the word AIDS which actually I was unaware of. But the fact is this movie could be about any disease as even the Chinese initial reaction to SARS was one of denial. This film does certainly illustrate the stigma associated with AIDS but the fallout is much deeper than sexual practices in developing countries. The reason it has spread as this film so eloquently shows is not because of people's sex lives it's spread because of ignorance poverty superstition fear and greed. If we can just focus on fighting those battles then maybe  maybe we can win.".

In the first one poverty associated to the ignorance and greed sentences the dwellers of a village in the second selfishness and need of money infects at least eight actors and actresses of the porn industry in the last one ignorance and lack of resources doom the poor people to the disease. The screenplay is a little confused and flawed and some of the questions in the Message Board prove it. The first story is tragic and with an ironic conclusion when the dweller questions that he sold his blood for US 5.00 and he paid US 10.00 for the test. The second one is of a tremendous dark humor and I do not know whether the intention of the director  writer Thom Fitzgerald is to criticize the earlier cash of life insurance. The last one has an unnecessary tragedy in the end. Nevertheless 3 Needles is a good honest and powerful movie about an unpleasant theme with topnotch acting of the cast. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Unidos Pelo Sangue Tied by the Blood".

	schema:headline " A Powerful Film about the Destructiveness of AIDS";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is another film of which I knew nothing that  thanks to the recommendation of my video service  has brought two intensely entertaining and thoughtprovoking hours to my life. It comprises three tales of the worldwide AIDS epidemic each unique and impressive.The first takes place in rural China where Lucy Liu plays Jin Ping  a woman who is a blackmarketeer of blood products. She and her partners prey upon residents of small villages who are basically ignorant of the complexities and dangers involved in donating blood. The villagers are poor and the promise of muchneeded funds is the bait used by Jin Ping. A farmer who is unable to give blood uses his daughter as the donor in order to make a better life for his family. The farmer and his daughter are played by two extraordinary Chinese actors who bring humor and  in the end  great pathos to their parts. In this first of the three parts the film shows ruin and death brought to an entire village through greed and apathy.The second tale narrower in scope but is the most fascinating of the three. It takes place in FrenchCanada and revolves around a porn star and his family. Stockard Channing plays the mother in what is one of the strangest and most fascinating roles I have ever seen. To tell more would spoil the film for anyone who might view it but I can assure you that Channing has accomplished something special in her portrayal of a mother's reaction to the illness of her son.The third story in the film stars Olympia Dukakis Chlo Sevigny and Sandra Oh as nuns who travel to Africa to assist at a clinic. They become involved in various ways with the workers and the large agricultural company for which most of the local villagers work. In this third tale the scenery is so beautiful and impressive that it is almost beyond comprehension. The viewer is struck that within all of this natural beauty lurks a deadly disease destroying the population.In most films in which the driving theme is the destructiveness of AIDS you would expect to see at least some characters who are gay men. There is not one gay person in this film. That very fact enhances the film's powerful message that this epidemic is not one confined to a small segment of society but to the world's civilization as a whole. If you wish to observe disease religion avarice politics love hate and still be thoroughly entertained I recommend 3 Needles.".

AIDS is well known as a global epidemic but it is not getting the media attention that it once did in the 80s and 90s. It is left to filmmakers to put a human face to the daily toll caused by this epidemic.3 Needles puts a very human face on the fears and insecurities that cause people to risk their humanity morality and their lives to get past the lies that they have to deal with. This film shows very different cases and reactions by people from the first world and third world facing an unjust world and trying to do their best to get by.I'm somewhat in awe of how gentle the film is given the death despair and horrible acts that are occurring all around the central characters. I love the balance of life affirmationthere are 2 births paralleling 2 deaths. There are charitable acts and kindness from unexpected places. There is clear love for family and friends.Stockard Channing is brilliant in this role Cloe Sevigny and Shawn Ashmore are very good Lucy Liu's character is so real that you feel like you're really in remote parts of China with her and that most people in her place would do the same things.Please go see this film. You'll be glad you did and perhaps you'll come away with an understanding of the complexities of the AIDS epidemic and why existing support methods are failing to stem the tide of this situation.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review 3 Needles";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in Singapore to coincide with World Aids Day 1 Dec it actually took me this long to cast my eyes on the movie no thanks to weird and limited screenings at one or two theatres. Perhaps it's because of the subject matter about that disease which as far as I can recall doesn't get named at all in the movie which probably won't sit down well with audiences who are up for the latest feel good movies in town this holiday season.Written and directed by Thom Fitzgerald 3 Needles comprises of 3 distinct stories set in 3 distinct continents  Asia North America and Africa but looks into a common killer disease that is plaguing our world today. It takes a look at common fears of those who have the disease and those from high risk groups who fear of getting the disease as well as the bad practices and schemes as perpetrated by the greed of men eager to sacrifice all to make a quick buck.The story arcs in my opinion were not weaved together to form one long narrative. Rather it looked as if 3 short stories were glued together at the seams to make up the runtime sufficient to call itself a feature film. The first had an illegal blood trafficker Jin Ping Lucy Liu milking all that its worth in a small Chinese village and for US5 per packet of blood managed to entice villagers to undergo unlicensed blood donation drives for a few dollars. Next we have a porn star Denys Shawn Ashmore Iceman in XMen2 and 3 who while aware he has the disease covers up this knowledge through tampering with the provision of blood samples fearing otherwise he would lose his job in the adult entertainment industry. And lastly a group of nuns Chloe Sevigny Olympia Dukakis Sandra Oh journey to a South African village to assist in the care of the villages only to have Sister Clara Sevigny deciding whether it's worth compromising her beliefs in order to help those she cares for.When watching these stories you'll feel a sense of injustice as the characters do what is obviously morally incorrect. You feel angry at the way blood is trafficked without regard to safety and basic hygiene you feel disgusted at how selfishness clouds the mind into deceit and the better to go with others rather than oneself and you feel sorry for the way sacrifices have to be made while wishing eternal damnation to those who choose to exploit situations for their own gratification. As a movie if its objectives is to make you feel for the issues presented then it's done its part.However as I mentioned earlier I find it rather strange that HIV or AIDS is never mentioned explicitly. Could it be there this disease which shall not be named is following its self fulfilling prophecy amongst men that it is shameful to be infected and the misconception that victims were actually asking for it when they engage in risky activities to follow the common attitude to hush it all up and choose to disbelieve the bringing forward of the expiry date on their lives?As a movie the presentation is rather plain and I thought that the narrative probably would be better if the stories were somehow spliced together neatly so that it flows nicely from one arc to the next rather than opting for the lazy obvious way to segregate them. While nothing controversial is discussed there are a few scenes that will raise a few eyebrows and the best amongst those involves a very pregnant Lucy LIu in a field. I don't think I've seen any such scenes in graphic detail and definitely not in the manner presented. Beats the one which is most talked about involving Chloe Sevigny.It doesn't offer you new insights into the disease but exhibits on common fears from both sides and offers the dramatization of unscrupulous acts which help to propagate the problem on a much larger scale. If you're intrigued to watch it you have to do so soon as I suspect it wouldn't last another week at the screens. Look out too for the local actor Ng Chin Han from the local television comedy series dud Masters of the Sea in quite a meaty role as a Chinese soldier.".

Lucy Liu giving birth alone on the side of a hill in a field... or the Chinese soldiers ripping apart bags of blood with their boots and rifles ... the body of an important character left in the mud... but the squirming is part of the movie's overall experience. gotta love a movie that provides you with an experience! it packs a whallop didactically speaking and the story keeps you interested to the very end. i can't think of another movie that handles the theme of AIDS so well so artistically. the actors should all get kudos for their work. keep an eye on this director my friends... he's someone to watch...".

	schema:headline " Powerful group of 3 stories...";
	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 432014  7 out of 10DirThom Fitzgerald reviewed version is Director's cut of app. 128 minutes Powerful group of 3 stories centering around a spreading virus in three distinct cultures that isn't mentioned as being AIDS but it's definitely implied. What makes this Canadian movie work is seeing the love displayed by the other folk who are watching the torment from the outside and doing whatever it takes to help ease the pain of the suffering ones. The first story doesn't actually begin until a prologue to what will eventually be the final story  but I think it is the strongest with Lucy Liu playing a woman who sets up blood intake centers in an impoverished Asian nation only to find out that they are being infiltrated by sick donors who infect whole areas. A father played by Tanabadee Chokpikultong is the first one sick in his family but ends up being the last survivor and performs amazing feats of sacrifice despite overwhelming feelings of sadness and sickness. The second story is about a male porn star who continues to work to support his mother and uncle despite the fact that he knows he is sick from something. The mother played by Stockard Channing decides to do her part after her uncle dies and she subsequently finds out what her son is doing and what he has. This part is set in Canada and involves an unselfish action that is confusing that involves the mother but I believe the intent was to make her son's life more enjoyable while he is still alive. The final story attached with the prologue is narrated by a nun played by Olympia Dukakis giving it a slight documentary feel but is definitely slow going at first. It focuses on a group of nuns who are there to save souls primarily but a younger nun played by Chloe Sevigny takes extreme measures on her own to keep a family together and safe from a local land owner. What these ordinary people do is not popular when you look at them from a legalized  moralized perspective but there is a greater good in mind by those who perform them. The movie ends by the asking the viewer if you could be one of those ordinary peopledefinitely not in a preachy way but in a compelling way. This film by Thom Fitzgerald is unique despite some slow parts primarily in the 3rd story and a slightly confusing 2nd story but overall is a very good viewing and worthwhile to the cause and to the moviegoer.  Also viewed 125 minute Canadian version on 4192014 still powerful but a couple of scenes cut out and edited differently where stories go back and forth more often 2nd story is missing some important footage in this version but it is closer to the original 123 minute Toronto International film festival version ".

The acting is just about perfect the photography is splendid  fine script  the major things that go into crafting a successful film. Where I fault with the film is the direction. It is what I call the tone.of the film. It is cold remote and distant. This is a problem I have with so many independent and foreign  the director so afraid of showing emotion in a scene that he just lets it play out cinema verite'style. This was not a documentary although it plays like one. It is always interesting and of course tragic to see how the HIV Pandemic is affecting other cultures. It would have been much more interesting to me if the director showed just a little more humanity a little more emotion honing his craft.".

	schema:reviewBody "Did you know they had AIDS in China? It must be a closely guarded secret. However in the first of three stories on the disease we see Lucy Liu as a blood smuggler who buys blood for 5.00 a pint. In the process a whole village becomes infected. It is a sad tale punctuated by her delivery of her baby alone in a field.It then moves to Canada where a porn actor Shawn Ashmore steals blood from his father to hide his infection. After one of the required tests the technician comes on the set to tell him his blood test shows that he has been dead for some time. He rushes home to find that his father was dead when he drew the blood. His mother Stockard Channing comes up with a solution to their problems that is quite original and probably only possible in Canada.The final segment involves some nuns in Africa. Olympia Dukakis Sandra Oh and Chlo Sevigny are sent to save souls before AIDS takes them to purgatory. The opening segment of the movie really didn't make any sense until now. It fits into this segment. I wonder why they didn't put it here. Maybe they didn't want to distract from Sevigny's naughty nun bit.Sevigny is a novice that sees her mission as more than saving souls she also tries to save lives. She involves the other nuns and they swipe money from the collection plate but she goes way further. The plantation owner Ian Roberts wants tit for tat to help her. We did get to see her tit and he got the tat more than once. Is that what God wanted her to do? Is saving lives just as important as saving souls and is some sin allowed for the greater good? The cinematography in the film was incredible and the music was also excellent.".

Blood and blood products feature prominently in each of the three segments and nonsexual relationships between the sexes mother and son nuns and doctors.Since they are completely unrelated except for that the decision to untangle them was a wise one and the version I saw with a prologue flashing forward to the middle of the third segment makes the three complicated plot lines about as clear as they could be. In each greed and poverty feature strongly. The life of the shantydwellers in the third segment is particularly grim. I agree that the message as old as Oedipus  those who try to avert disaster can bring it on is spelled out but when it's Olympia Dukakis' gentle voice doing it I don't mind.Much of the scenery is beautiful but the initiation ritual at the opening is not no matter how age old  it's legcrossingly painful. With circumcision being increasingly touted as a way to prevent HIV transmission it's useful to be reminded that it can also facilitate it.The film has some smiles no laughs and plenty of irony like The Green Shop where hypodermic needles are recycled.3 Needles will have you thinking about the issues it raises  and does not resolve  long after it is over.".

The second is in Canada where a porn star infection comes to a peaceful conclusion ... almost. And the third shows us that there is hope even though those who provide it  especially one nun  has to turn her back on God to save his children.Some say the film is too long and its and international film shot in as I said China Canada and with the nun segment Africa. Maybe it does get too long. Maybe too preachy. But maybe you need to hear these stories so you don't become a victim ... of AIDS or of being a judge without knowing the facts.
