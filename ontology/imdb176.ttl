The women simply want to eat their brains. Back home no one will believe the little girl's story of alien abduction not even Officer Concha pronounced Cornjob. Finally Gamera rescues the children while fighting Guiron a monster with a giant knife for a nose. Gamera kills Guiron while doing gymnastics on a parallel bar and takes the kids home where the kids hope for peace understanding and the end of traffic accidents.";

The little kid in me loved every minute of it. Sure the child stars are a bit annoying at times but more so I suspect to adult ears than to a child's and the effects aren't always up to par but man do the monster battles ever deliver the goods in this one. They are knockdown dragout affairs especially those featuring Gamera and Guiron and surprisingly graphic in terms of their brutality yet the film never loses sight of making clear just who is evil and who is good. Like the best pro wrestling of yesteryear it manages to make the hero Gamera incredibly sympathetic while the villain Guiron comes across as little more than a nastytempered brute and a bully who needs to be taught a lesson in manners.".

Anyway this movie follows Gamera VS Viras. It has the same concept. Two kids one American one Japanese are the stars. And there is plenty of stock footage flashbacks too. Then things get bizarre. Gurion the knife with the attitude slices up a silver painted Gyoas. Shoots ninja stars at Gamera. Gamera sprays out blue blood. Swings around on parallel bars. And does a la cucaracha dance to remove some ninja stars stuck in his arms! He then finishes off Gurion by slamming his knife head into the ground so Gurion is upside down with his legs kicking! Bizarre stuff. Throw in two Japanese women in funky space suits that drug the kids with tainted powdered donuts so they can eat thier brains and you can see what my one line summary means....".

Not only does it show off Gamera's great range of talents but it is also the silliest giant monster movie I've ever seen and oddly violent for a giant monster that is obviously intended for kids.

He and Tom Christopher Murphy get whisked away by an empty UFO to the planet Terra a planet that is exactly like Earth and conveniently shares Earth's orbit and is always on the opposite side of the sun to Earth. On Terra they watch as a Gyaos turns up only to get dismembered by Guiron Terran for 'GiantKnifeHeadMonster'.Only two Terrans still live on the planet Two spacebabes with names so nice and pretty that these spacebabes are obviously evil apparently the rest of the population left to find a new planet but we all know they died in a mass traffic accident. When the Terran women reveal that they must eat the kids brains in order to adapt to life on Earth the kids are saved by Gamera friend to children everywhere.Gamera should have had a toy range based on this movie. He is the most multiskilled monster in the universe! I can see it all now Regular Gamera Jet Propulsion Gamera Ninja Gamera Baseball Gamera Airborne Gamera Judo Gamera Dancing Gamera Gymnast Gamera Aqua Gamera and Gamera the Repair Monster. 'Attack of the Monsters' is a very silly movie  silly in the most funny ways. The poor special effects the very basic dialog the far out story and Gamera's range of talents all make for some quality monster movie entertainment. Some of the monster mayhem seems rather brutal even by regular monster movie standards really how many Godzilla films feature bloody dismemberment? but my only complaint is the lack of Gamera's theme song in the 'Attack of the Monsters' version of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Two boys who are apparently prone to various kinds of mischief find a spaceship in the woods and climb aboard only to find that the ship has autopilot and is programmed to return to the hostile planet of its origin. The film starts off with an astronomy lesson and the hostile planet turns out to be a hidden planet on the other side of the sun. Awaiting them there are two caped and antennaed young female cannibals and an enormous slow moving knifeheaded creature named Guiron. Old favorite Gaos  or something that looks like him  makes a cameo but is defeated so quickly by Guiron that you will hardly notice him. Gamera to the rescue! Back home the younger sister of one of the boys tries to convince her somewhat dour mother of what has happened but she is told to stop making up stories and go study.Indeed this story is the sort of wandering somewhat silly and entirely fantastic thing that kids do make up. But that's exactly why it works. It's a kid film. It doesn't require expensive and fancy special effects just a fun story kids doing amazing things and giant monsters.I enjoyed this as a kid and enjoyed it again as an adult. The acting is passable for what it is  the younger sister is actually very convincing and sympathetic and the two boys do OK. The adults are presented entirely from a kid perspective as was done in The Peanuts  and are stereotypic and often overdramatic. The cinematography is pretty good  again for its purpose this is not an art film nor even an adult action film. And the dubbing in the version I saw Sandy Frank's name did not appear anywhere was actually very good.Fun little film  recommended!".

From it one might expect a film that features whole slew of monsters charging en masse either on a defenseless Japanese city or else each other but this typical cheapo offering from the Gamera folks presents only three monsters Gamera and two outerspace creatures one of who looks like a silver Rodan and the other which has a giant blade for a forehead. The three never have a grand battle either it's just a series of oneonone matchups.All this meant something to me back in the day when Attack of the Monsters was on the local 430 Movie and it was a welcome alternative to bad old Godzilla. Sure Godzilla would save your occasional child but he'd destroy three city blocks doing so. Gamera cared about kids too only he had more respect for property values in the process.Plus this film had special appeal for me because it featured two boys going off on a strange adventure. I could imagine my buddy Stephen and I doing the same thing except he'd have to be the one to get his head shaved.After walking into a UFO and being whisked onto the planet Terra Akio and Tom find themselves in a planet devoid of life except for two comely ladies with antennae heads and the occasional wandering monster. The boys are happy with their new friends but the women being women have ulterior motives. They want the boys' brains for something to munch on during the long flight to Earth. After all why take a chance on airplane food?Back in my middle school days I enjoyed the battle sequences where Gamera fought his alien adversaries while the kids avoided the sexy cannibals and explored an expansive Star Trek set with blinking console lights. Now I see special effects that make the Beastie Boys' Intergalactic video look like a George Lucas production dialogue as halting as a Berlitz beginners' course and a storyline that sags at every turn.But you know something? It's still a joy watching it. Most times the pleasures of youth turn lame in adulthood. Attack Of The Monsters is just as much fun to watch now as it was then especially if you have enough alcohol around.Definitely try to get the Sandy Frank version which has the zaniest dubbing. Better yet find the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 version where little Tom is basted with numerous Richard Burton riffs and Mike Nelson as Michael Feinstein brings it all home with a Cole Porterized version of the Gamera theme.".

For this one you'll have to leave all common sense at the door. It will also help to try and view it with the mind of a nine year old since that seems to have been the intended audience.That good old boy Gamera is the monster hero in this one the retro rocket flying turtle that blasts through space with those flame jets out his leg holes. There's an upright version of Rodan named Gyaos with an oddly shaped flat head and wings seemingly fashioned from aluminum foil. But my favorite has to be that goofy Guiron whose appearance is anything but menacing. Seeing him for the first time reminded me of the candy gram shark on those early Saturday Night Live bits. For sheer lunacy there's nothing better than Gamera's defeat of Guiron as he lands nose down in the dirt.Most of the action takes place on 'Terra' a planet directly opposite the Earth on the other side of the sun. Terra's inhabitants have been reduced to a pair of space babes who for some reason aren't even listed in the film credits. One of their names sounded very similar to Barbarella while the other came across as something like Ploda. At some point when I can compose myself I might try going back to confirm those names but it's not a high priority right now.The human heroes are Japanese boy Akio and his American friend Tom. Unfortunately Akio's sister Tomoko was left behind as the boys commandeered the alien space ship knowing just which buttons to push and how to maneuver their way to Terra. Of course Gamera helped them out owing to his reputation for helping children in distress.Somehow Attack of the Monsters conjures up a much larger mental picture of havoc and destruction than actually presented here with the film's feature creatures going at it one on one instead of en masse. Don't let that worry you though in it's own way it's a fun film that attempts to but never does answer the question What were they thinking?".

It's up to Gamera to save the lads but first the heroic gigantic prehistoric turtle must defeat nefarious knifenosed beast Guiron. Director Noriaka Yuasa and writer Nisan Takahashi relate the delightfully inane and quirky story at a steady pace and thankfully downplay silly humor in favor of a generally serious tone. The monster attack set pieces are not only pretty lively and exciting but also surprisingly brutal and violent the single most shocking moment occurs when big nasty bully Guiron both dismembers and decapitates batlike creature Gyaos then cuts up Gyaos' corpse into itty bitty pieces!. Nobuhiro Kajima as spunky idealist Akio and Christopher Murphy as his American friend Tom are tolerable and pretty likable leads while the wicked cannibal alien women are fetching and freaky in equal measure. Miyuki Akiyama is adorable as Akio's loyal sister Tomoko. The primitive backscreen projection and cruddy Tonka Toy miniatures possess a certain lovably rinkydink charm. Akira Kitazaki's sharp cinematography makes nice expansive use of the widescreen format. Shunsuke Kikuchi's rousing and dynamic score hits the stirring spot. Gamera's cute'n'catchy theme song is an absolute campy hoot. A fun giant creature feature flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gamera vs Guiron is one of the most memorable films that I have seen in my life. It is an entertaining film and easily not one of the worst Gamera Films.Two kids Akio and Tom find a U.F.O and go inside of it. It takes off and takes them to a planet that is far away. On this planet there is a deserted city that soon is attacked by a Space Gyaosbasically Gyaos painted silver. Another monster Guiron appears and literally slices this Space Gyaos to bits. The two boys go inside a building and encounter two female species of beings that inhabit this planet. THey all agree that they must leave the planet before it freezes over however the two females actually plan to eat the two kids brains instead. Gamera soon appears and must save these young kids.Overall this is a really good Gamera Film. It is not really serious toned and has some pretty corny dialogue at parts. Like the part where the mother tells her daughter that she should study or else she will not get into a good school. ???????????? Gamera must save kids again. I guess that really became the main idea of all but two of the original Gamera Series. Gamera does get in a lot of action and does some pretty interesting stuff. Like the part where he does a series of flips over what appears to be a giant pull up bar.Guiron is the adversary for Gamera in this film. He is pretty evil. Physically he resembles a giant knife with legs. He makes a really odd sounding grunting roar that sounds like he has problems. Also he can shoot ninja stars out of his head. Guiron is one of Gameras strongest foes.Gyaos also appears for a little in this film. However it is a Space Gyaos that apparently has taken over the Planet Terra. It is good to see him but the part where he fights Guiron is easily the most disturbing monster fight ever. Easily the most brutal fight ever in a monster film. I mean Guiron cuts off both of Gyaos's wings and then cuts off his head and parts of his neck. This part is disturbing but also memorable but I think they went over board on this part. Gyaos did not deserve such a brutal death. Originally it was going to be a different monster that was going to be chopped up but they decided to use Gyaos to save money.Gamera and Guirons fights are really good. These fights are much better than some that you will see in other Gamera Films. SO I think that the monster fights are well done worth watching over and over.THe human scenes are odd at parts. Police Officer threatens to shave kids heads mother wants her six year old kid to focus on getting into a good school and female aliens want to eat kids brains to gain knowledge. I guess nothing is really original about the plot there have been plenty of space travel films. But the plot works.So this is probably the third best Gamera Film but easily one of the most entertaining. Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this outing our colossal jetpowered guardianturtle has to deal with both a giant knifeheaded advisory and a pair of braineating spacebabes. Briefly two boys sneak onto a flying saucer that takes them to a 'counter Earth' a planet orbiting unseen on the other side of the sun inhabited by Barbella and Florbella the two sexy silverclad aliens their enslaved monster Guiron and a host of 'spaceGyaos' similar to the one that attacked Earth in 1967's Return of the Giant Monsters. The women ostensibly kindly and courteous hosts turn out to be evil and only Gamera can save the two boys and perhaps all of humankind from consumption. The movie is a budget concoction with timefilling clips from previous films as the girls study the boys' memories for weaknesses and all of the kaiju 'action' taking place on a single inexpensive looking 'alien world' set. Like most of the original Gamera films kids are the target audience but the movie has a surprisingly brutal edge. The opening battle between Guiron and one of the Gyaos ends with the flying monster being dismembered while still alive this scene seems to be commonly edited out it is not on my DVD or on the free online versions I checked and I don't remember it from way back when I watched this movie on TV but its purplegruesomeness can be found on Youtube. There is also a scene where one of the boys has his head shaved in preparation for cutting open his skull to get at his brain stopped just in time and numerous shots of a wounded Gamera bleeding. The special effects vary in effectiveness. The scenes on the alien planet and in the spacegirls' base are imaginative examples of budgettokusatsu with 'teleportation' booths and a surreal backdrop but the monster brawls are simplistic and silly relatively speaking with one scene of Gamera doing a number of rotations around a 'high bar' before proudly sticking the landing in front of a bemused Guiron. I watched dubbed version that was an odd of mix of sort of scientifically correct it would take a many years for an Apollo spacecraft to get to another star to ridiculously wrong the boys both amateur astronomers mix up 'star' and 'planet'. In addition to the aliens and the boys we get a little sister continuously pouting because no one will believe her about the UFO a comicrelief cop and the boys' mothers one of whom keeps offering amateur childrearing psychology. The story is pretty typical of the first generation Gamera films and the movie is on par with the rest of the series so if you liked the towering turtle's earlier adventures you'll probably enjoy this one as well but try to find an edgy uncensored version for maximum impact.".

Sure the Sandy Frank versions are hilarious especially on MST3K but they do not properly express the original film or it's more intelligent dialogue. Unfortunately when most people review the Gamera movies it's probably based on these inferior sillier American versions. By no means am I calling this a great film but it is pretty much a nonstop focus on the adventure even if Gamera doesn't get as much face time. As usual though our title character shows up with half an hour left and does endless battle with the evil unstoppable Guiron who loves sawing hisherit's victims into bits and pieces with his dull looking yet razor sharp fin. He also has some awesome ninja like shuriken to launch at his foes. Guiron is a pleasure to watch on the screen as are our two main characters Akio and Tom. Very reminiscent of Invaders From Mars these two lead kids see aliens land no one believes them and eventually they are inside the flying saucer. This all happens quite fast and the rest of the film focuses on the child actors trying to escape from the planet of Terra where they have encountered very shifty aliens who seem kind and gentle at one moment and cannibalistic the next. As far as visuals go the matte work is pretty awful but I really enjoy the look of the spaceships and the alien planet. There's no question you have to be a fan of Godzilla or Ultraman to appreciate this film series but if you take the time to delve into the Gamera universe make sure you do so with the Japanese versions. They will still make you smirk but I assure you in this original version you will find a film like Gamera Vs Guiron smarter and a bit more serious than you expected...".

She ends up in Paris broke and needs to raise 180000 Francs quickly and her only hope is to enter a strip tease contest. She and the two newspaper friends she meets on the train to Paris make quite a good comedy trio.  Even with English subtitles this is a fun and funny film and is a great introduction to the early Bardot without her nudity.some SPOILERS following read further at your considered discretion.Agnes' father a general was so upset she had written a book about their town he forceably was sending her away by train to a convent but instead she hopped onto the train to Paris needing to borrow money from the news men for the billet. That created the connection so that the two guys would need to keep track of her. In the process one of them the confirmed batchelor and womanizer fell in love with her. Agnes went to the address her brother had given her but instead of his house it was a museum instead of being the wealthy painter he claimed he was a poor tour guide. Wanting clothes and other things Agnes took a valuable book and sold it and that is what created her desperate need for 180000 Fr her brother insisted they buy it back and replace it. She decided to enter the strip tease contest which pays 200000 Fr to the winner. I suspect about 200 to 300 equivalent in 1950 money.Shy she calls herself 'Sophie' and decides to wear a mask while stripping and she wins. Her fiancee goes into her dressing room unaware that she is really Agnes and pretends to be in love with Sophia so he can get a story. This confuses Agnes and creates the romantic tension for the last scene. The finals of the contest are in her town of Vichy her brother is there her dad is a judge her fiancee finds out the truth she gets someone else to strip for her presumably everyone turns out happy.At 99 minutes this is an easy film to watch the action and situations are never dull. There is brief torso nudity in context of the contest but no Bardot nudity. If this film were released today it would probably be PG13. I saw it on DVD the restored version in BW. Except for a minute of so in the last half where the image became very dark it is a very fine video transfer. Extras are limited to several Bardot movie trailers. A free loan from my local county library.".

In Paris nobody bothers to read her manuscripts and in fact the whole premise of her being a writer disappears in the first 15 mins as every male tries to seduce grope manipulate and objectify her. The worst part is that she herself soon becomes resigned to being a simple object of desire forsaking any greater ambitions and deeper plot themes than to snare the most eligible suitor. What began with a great setup a talented female writer cracking the male dominated field devolves into a basic boyschasegirl formula. And she goes along with it.On the plus side Toward the end it turns into a fun little Shakespearean comedy of errors  mistaken identities and that is the story's saving grace. I just wish some of the other scenes like all the drooling office workers propositioning anyone wearing a skirt could've been toned down. Like seriously male office workers randomly groping and kissing coworkers may have been funny to audiences 60 years ago but it's a little disturbing today and that kept distracting me from the real strengths of the film.As a historical document detailing the unique career of Brigitte Bardot this film deserves its place. It shows her to be a nave yet morally confident young woman who can handle herself in tough situations without losing sight of her femininity. Unfortunately this role kept her submissive the whole time so it's as if this early work was just a primer for her later roles where she triumphs. I would sooner suggest watching Naughty Girl released the same year 1956 where Bardot shines with her impish portrayal of a young girl who is smart enough to turn all the drooling men into playthings rather than this where she seems to be just below that level of command.".

Fernando Sancho is perfect as always to play the leader of the bandits.

It's a corker!Our hero is Arizona Colt and he's a smug as Johnny Yuma. He's also slightly sinister too or at least I thought so. He cheats at cards with innocent folks and will only find Rosalba Neri's killer if he can get to shag her sister! Did I say Rosalba Neri? I sure did! She's in this one too but she gets murdered fairly early because she's the attractive sexually liberated one plus she has dark hair which makes her evil or something. I'm getting ahead of myself however. This one involves Gordo a bandit whose recruitment method involves massacring loads of prison guards breaking out all the prisoners and giving them the option of joining his gang or being shot! He's planning on robbing a town of all it's gold but he didn't count on Arizona Colt not joining his gang and having no intention of getting shot. Indeed Arizona proves to be a bit of pest as he's always where Gordo doesn't want him to be although he doesn't stop either the town being robbed or Rosalba Neri being killed as he's in the saloon having a pint. On the morally shaky promise of getting it on with Neri's blonde and therefore virginal sister Colt sets out to bring Gordo to justice but instead ends up getting shot full of holes. This sets the film up for the big gunfight and a very cool head to head battle between Arizona and Gordo in an undertakers.Although the film seems to follow the same plot as about 400 other Italian Westerns this one's pretty fast paced and has a lot of shootouts the town seems to have an endless supply of men to take on Gordo's gang. There's also plenty of that Italian quirkiness when Colt spells out 'no' in dead bodies as a message to Gordo and if you like Westerns where the bad guys laugh for minutes at a time for no reason whatsoever then this is the film for you.".

The second mistake is that the movie lasts almost two hours which is far past the breaking point.

This does look very good and I was more than happy with Amazon Prime's print which is of a far better quality than most of the spaghetti westerns they show. This film features Giuliano Gemma as a delightfully amoral gunslinger who rescues a group of prisoners only to fall out with them over their subsequent plans.Gemma is a guy who's only in the game for the money and the women and I liked the edge to his character here. He was one of the genre's most familiar faces and there's little to dislike about him overall in this film. Fernando Sancho does another larger than life villain and is loud and boisterous which fits his character nicely. The story was written by the reliable Ernesto Gastaldi and directed by genre director Michele Lupo who made interesting titles like GOLIATH AND THE SINS OF BABYLON BUDDY GOES WEST and THE WEEKEND MURDERS over his varied career.The main problem with ARIZONA COLT is the running time which at two hours is just too long. There's too much footdragging here and thus some of the scenes start to feel more than a little repetitive and forced. After all there are only so many gun fights and barroom showdowns that you can fit into the running time. Cut half an hour off the running time and this would have been much more fun.".

Well it's not as the Reality mentioned in the title is obviously not the one of the TVgenre but the actual one of nowadays Italy.As Woody Allen wrote once life doesn't imitates art imitates bad television. Following this line the first scene is by far the more fantastic of the whole movie we see an incredibly rich marriage ceremony and we are not on TV or in any other fiction but we are supposed to be in the real world  even if the settings and the outfits looks like a David LaChappelle picture. But later when the guests go back to their homes we see how theirs everyday Reality is made of poor dirty houses impossibly crowded interiors daily struggles and tricks to arrange a living. All places depicted completely lack any sign of awareness or responsible living in the world newspapers don't exist books are never read or shown Internet is never searched  and receipts during commercial transactions are never issued. In this wasteland of culture and decency feelings still grows. We can see that the main character still genuinely loves and cares for his wife and kids and he could be called in his own way a good family man. But disaster suddenly happens when his set of values proves to be not enough to properly relate with the ghosts of fame and success.This Bigbrother thing when it was introduced in Italy had some cultural appeal and for some months represented something worthy to talk about. But it has quickly evolved in a tire and sad repetition of the same situations that seems to aim at a lower target every further year and after more than 10 years of lowering now it doesn't have audiences anymore but victims. This movie will show you how one of those victims undergoes his own sacrifice. So be prepared it can't be anything else than a very sad story  highlighted anyhow by some great actor performances.".

But later when the guests go back to their homes we see how theirs everyday Reality is made of poor dirty houses impossibly crowded interiors daily struggles and tricks to arrange a living. All places depicted completely lack any sign of awareness or responsible living in the world newspapers don't exist books are never read or shown Internet is never searched  and receipts during commercial transactions are never issued. In this wasteland of culture and decency feelings still grows. We can see that the main character still genuinely loves and cares for his wife and kids and he could be called in his own way a good family man. But disaster suddenly happens when his set of values proves to be not enough to properly relate with the ghosts of fame and success.This Bigbrother thing when it was introduced in Italy had some cultural appeal and for some months represented something worthy to talk about. But it has quickly evolved in a tire and sad repetition of the same situations that seems to aim at a lower target every further year and after more than 10 years of lowering now it doesn't have audiences anymore but victims. This movie will show you how one of those victims undergoes his own sacrifice. So be prepared it can't be anything else than a very sad story  highlighted anyhow by some great actor performances.";

If he'd wanted to say something else he added he would have written something else.Matteo Garrone of Gomorrah fame is going for much the same answer about his latest work Reality. I just saw the movie and the director himself at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival where Garrone stepped on stage after the screening to take a few questions.It was an entertaining backandforth between an audience gushing with praise and a visibly pleased but disarmingly unpretentious director. When asked to elaborate on the film's enigmatic ending though Garrone politely declined saying that he'd rather leave it open to interpretation and was more interested in what the audience thought.So here's my take. At the end of the movie the main character Luciano a Neapolitan fishmonger who auditioned for Grande Fratello Italy's Big Brother but never heard back sneaks onto the set of the show in Cinecitta. None of the Big Brother contestants who are splashing around in the pool seem to notice him. Luciano seemingly mesmerized by the giggling bunch takes a seat on a sunbed in a courtyard nearbyand suddenly he can't stop laughing. The final shot zooms out beginning with Luciano giggling all by himself and eventually encompassing all of Rome.What does the uncontrollable giggle mean? Has Luciano lost his mind? That's a very real possibility. On the other hand as Garrone pointed out to me when chatted briefly after the screening he also may be laughing because he's finally wonafter all he is finally in The House. But what kind of victory is that? I think we're supposed to compare the final scene with the first. The film opens with a panoramic shot of Naples in full daylight with Vesuvius and the Bay as a backdrop. Then the camera slowly zooms in on the odd spectacle of a gilded horsedrawn carriage. The carriage arrives at a sort of villa where a staff dressed in what appears to be 18th century costumes opens to door for the passengers a tacky bride and groom.Both the opening and closing scenes revolve around some kind of fantasy but one zooms in while the other zooms out. The colors are important here. The opening shots are strikingly colorful and bright while the final shot is almost black and white being shot at night and starting from the minimalist courtyard with its stylized whitebacklit lounge chairs. The opening is crowded with family and friends and in the end Luciano is alone. The opening represents fantasy within the bounds of reality while reality TV is fantasy beyond these boundaries.By the end of the movie Luciano has lost sight of what is most important his family. It is true that his life as a fishmonger and scam artist is far from idyllic but there is undoubtedly something valuable in the role he plays in his own small community. He is already a star to his relatives and friends as we see from his comic performance at a family wedding at the beginning of the movie.see the rest of this americanfilmtheory.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When I started watching this movie I thought Well the director is Garrone and the movie is set in Naples so it must be a copy of Gomorrah or something like that. Instead I was surprised of how Garrone nicely brought up another aspect of Naples and its inhabitants. The setting is a poor neighborhood in the Italian port city and the main character is Luciano a fishmonger and father of two children. His daily life is ordinary and uneventful and he struggles to earn money through his first job and his second one which consists in cheating people by selling them some cleaning devices. Everything could change when he has the opportunity to participate to the Big Brother rehearsals where he can exploit his qualities as entertainer. His certainty of making it to the show is so strong that he becomes paranoid about people of the Big Brother casting staff spying on him to see if he's really a character as he claims to be in everyday life. He does many crazy things like selling his fishmonger activity and doling out his personal belongings to poor people in order to impress the alleged casting personnel following him. His mental condition soon worsens and develops into craziness which of course affects inevitably his family life. What I liked best about this movie is how Garrone underlines how miserable everyday life can be and how everyone is in search of the big opportunity to get out of misery. This however can lead to ruining personal and family life. I also appreciated how the director shows how some feelings and actions can be so evidently false as that of Luciano of being overly generous with poor people only for personal purposes. One last thing I would like to mark is Garrone's style of shooting which was quite like that of Gomorrah that's very simple and with seemingly amateur close shootings. Compared to Gomorrah however I would say that he wanted to give a more dreamy touch and also something Fellinesque in one scene Luciano comes back home from the Big Brother rehearsal in Rome and in the beautifully lit neighborhood he's welcomed by his neighbors as a hero. In the next scene the neighborhood is showed in daytime during its normal daily activity presenting all its simplicity and misery. Therefore an evident contrast is shown between dream and reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Rotterdam film festival 2013 IFFR about someone pressured by his family to candidate himself for a Big Brother house. It all gets out of hand when he is not accepted initially but yet thinks to be on a sort of waiting list while being observed by the Big Brother team. He assumes being selected for a very special role in that TV show and will be given a part later on when he proves to fit their criteria.During the final QA the director said that the film is about dreaming to escape from reality and to loose one's identity. He describers the main character Luciano to be a victim of the system. Luciano desire to get into the Big Brother house comes from initial pressure by his family though later on he himself gets a bit mad about it. He continues with rigor in spite of protests from the same family that pressured him in the first place. The importance of the family cannot be stressed enough and has a crucial role in the story something typical for Italy as stated by the director.The story forming the basis for this scenario really happened to a brother of the director's wife. By the way He is fully recovered now. He has even reopened his fish shop at the same spot in Naples. And giving away his furniture to make a good impression on imaginary inspectors was also real even to the extent that his wife did not dare leaving the house in fear of finding it empty on return. Even the cricket that Luciano suspected to be full of camera's appeared in reality too. The ending scenes seem a bit far fetched I won't reveal details for spoilers sake but can be deemed all right if it really comes from the true story that was the basis of this film.The director also said that the actors were taken from theater or cabaret except one a family member. Faces were an important criterion in the selection process. The roles they play and their appearances reflect a normal family from the region. That explains the overload of wrinkled people and especially women looking like the stereotypical mama that we see in food commercials. Luckily the main characters Luciano and his wife are not so bad looking in contrast to their entourage.All in all the film is a nice product with many hilarious moments. It is a bit too long in my opinion particularly when you get easily annoyed by heavily gesturing Italians talking with a waterfall of words it looks that way for us understanding no Italian and overly dramatic movements. We won't consider this movie memorable but it serves its purpose as family entertainment very well. Anyway the audience seemed to enjoy themselves nevertheless. The venue over 500 seats was fully booked on a Sunday morning.".

The film is not so much about the football world championship of 1954 itself but about how important this victory became for the Germans themselves. A nation torn apart and devastated by war disoriented and sad found new strength and something in which to believe in.I first feared that I wouldn't like the movie so much as I am a Hungarian myself the nation West Germany beat in the finals of the 1954 world championship in Bern but in fact I was rather enchanted by the story. The excellent script brings the characters above all little Mathias to life. You start to care about them to like them to follow their ups and downs with interest. I especially liked the sensitive approach to the problems a family had to face when the father came back after years as a POW. As many other men in a similar situation Richard Lubanski first wants to show strength and authority by being cold arrogant and  even violent towards his children  but later discovers that he also has to show his weaknesses and talk about his terrible experiences in war in order to get closer to his family again.The parallel storyline of newlywed journalist Ackermann and his pretty and snobbish wife Anette was not very closely related to the main story but I still liked it as the film showed through their lifestyle the beginning prosperity of the Wirtschaftswunder economy miracle years in contrast to the still bleak world of the industrial and mining town the Lubanski family lives in. And they also added some lighthearted comic relief to the film.I would very much like people from other countriescultures to see this film and understand better what Germany went through in these years.I am quite sure that they would not have big problems understanding Das Wunder von Bern as its main themes family war traumatic experiences failure and success are quite universal.".

Regarding the fact that so many special effects professionals from Germany work in Hollywood e.g. for Roland Emmerich the result could have been much much better!But nevertheless this is one of the best German movies in a decade!";

	schema:reviewBody "Historically few movies have been made about football or soccer for those in the United States. I believe this is due for two reasons 1 Hollywood wasn't familiar and care little for the sport for many years and 2 European directors who one would have expected to be more disposed to made such a film have generally been dismissive of football. You see in their mind I think they see it as the opiate of the people the working class in Western Europe would rather go and see a match on Sunday than start a revolution to overthrow capitalism. Only recently there have been a number of movies that deal with the world's most popular sport. This is in my opinion the best of them dealing with the surprise victory of Germany in the 1954 World Cup over the highly favored team of Hungary. This victory was of historical significance for the Germans according to some people since it was the first victory of any kind Germany have 9 years after the end of the war and it meant the start of a new era of increased selfconfidence for the country. OK maybe this is an exaggeration but this movie which mixes real characters the players coach Herberger with invented ones the journalist and his newly married wife the kid from the Ruhr region who has a bad relationship with his former POW father and wants to go to Switzerland to see the final match is thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.".

The film is not just a sports drama but deals more with the atmosphere in post war Germany and with the problems and aspirations the people had during that period and what the winning of the world championship by the German national football team meant for the regular people.Actually this atmosphere is covered excellently. The film shows that the people were still recovering from WW2. There are heaps of debris in the streets from houses destroyed during air raids and many men are still kept as POWs so that the women have to take care for the family. The children play football with a makeshift ball and most people don't seem to have much money. Everything is shown in subdued colors which really contribute to this mood. Although the story is set in Essen a city in the main industrial and mining region of Germany it could have happened everywhere in Germany.The colors only change during the scenes in Switzerland where the world championship took place. In fact those scenes are shot in bright and friendly colors. And also the settings are quite different from those in Essen whereas the location in Essen consists of small apartment buildings narrow streets and those aforementioned subdued colors everything in Switzerland seems to be posh and spacious.Even though the actors are not exactly great names in German cinema they are quite good. As far as I know the actors who play the members of the German national football team were cast not only for their acting skills but also for their ability to play football. Thanks to that aspect the football scenes are quite convincing although the spectators in the football stadium in Bern look really fake.What I really liked though was the fact that the filmmakers used the original radio commentary from reporter Herbert Zimmermann which is legendary. Every German football fan knows the important parts of his commentary by heart.All in all a good and entertaining film although I didn't really like the ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a very moving and unsentimental Drama Snke Wortmann brings us the amazing story of the German National Soccer Team who unexpectedly defeated the Hungarians in the final of the World Cup 1954 in Switzerland. After being a prisoner of war for 9 years Richard Lubanski comes home to his family only to find himself in a world strange and unknown to him. His oldest son Bruno is a communist who plays Jazz music for a living his daughter Ingrid helps her mother at the family's bar and his youngest son Matthias is a soccer fan and a good friend of Helmut Rahn a player of the German national team. Richard in his embitterment and desperation drives his family apart and for a long time fails to realize that he's the one responsible for it. In the second plot line the journalist Paul Ackermann gets the honorable assignment of reporting for the Sddeutsche Zeitung in Switzerland during the World Cup news not to well received by his wife Annette who was already planning their honeymoon. She insists on coming with him and during her stay in Switzerland she learns quite a bit about soccer and in the end knows more about it than her husband. The German National team under Coach Sepp Herberger is confronted with very difficult opponents and after an embarrassing defeat against the Hungarians many Germans already see the team's chances gone of entering the next round. Rahn who got drunk after the loss against Hungary but learned from his mistakes and Fritz Walter the captain of the team though both very ambitious players try to motivate the whole team and eventually they play in the final once again against the Hungarians. Whether you are a soccer fan or not is of little importance when watching this movie as it is more about family friendship and teamwork than about the sport itself. At times moving at others funny Das Wunder von Bern is a wonderful portrait of Germany after World War II a desperate nation in desire of a miracle. The young Louis Klamroth gives an extremely good performance as do Peter Franke Sascha Gpel and especially Peter Lohmeyer as Richard Lubanski. All in all an excellent piece of German history. 9.510".

Only one mistake the boy went with his father from Germany to Bern by car borrowed from a priest but they returned by train. What happened to the car of the infortunate priest? Nevertheless if you are a football fan don't miss it and PURCHASE IT FROM AMAZON.DE!!! The DVD does have Spanish subtitles.".

The background is really good featuring a wartorn Germany which is already in the middle of the Wirtschaftswunder showing the huge contrast between children of Coal Workers who do not own a real football and a newly wed reporter with his wife who are living in a modern house with lots of clothes and would have made a trip to Africa if not for the world cup. In my case the greatest part though was the heavy use of the different German dialects  it's hard to believe how funny simple jokes can sound if told that way  but at the same time I doubt this will work in foreignlanguage versions. Therefore for foreigners I'd give only 610 because of the probably less interesting German history and mainly because of the lack of adequate translations of  languagerelated jokes. For Germans or those few nonGermans out there who study German and watch the original version I'd give 810 close to 9.".

	schema:headline " A touching humorous film which avoids being overly sentimental.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a gem of a film in no way undermined by sub titles. It had a similar effect on me to that which Billy Elliott allegedly had on our Deputy Prime Minister J. Prescott Esq! The plot is centred around the David and Goliath struggle between mighty Hungary and little West Germany in the World Cup final hosted by Berne in the summer of 1954. Even though this was over 50 years ago it is still generally known that the Hungarian team spearheaded by the incomparable Puskas was invincible in those days. Shortly before I was born in April that year my father took my mother to see them play England and they thrashed us 6  3! Drawn in the same group in the early stages of the competition Hungary thrashed W. Germany 8  3 but both teams went on to meet in the final and W. Gernamy came from behind to win 3  2. However that is background only.The film is about much more than a simple triumph in a football competition. The sense of period is superb. The attention to detail to ensure that the audience really does travel 50 years back in time is to my mind almost without parallel. Aided by computer graphics which perhaps fall a little short of the quality achieved in Titanic the film vividly portrays the atmosphere in a depressed working class community on the West side of a divided Germany still very much demoralised by the aftermath of the second world war. Their hero is a young man nicknamed the boss who plays football for the national team. The boss is friendly with and idolised by the real hero of the film Matthias a little boy of about 10 who has never known his own father Richard a prisoner of the Russians since 1943 and like many German POWs not repatriated until the Soviets relax their stance only after Stalin's death 10 years later. We then get a valuable insight into the difficulty that this eminently decent but badly desensitised man has readjusting to life with his family who have moved forward in his absence. There is a problem with each of his children but inevitably the film focuses on his relationship with little Matthias a football mad child of whose existence Richard was actually unaware. Helped by a strong wife a sensible priest but above all by the child himself the father learns to confront his demons. It turns out to be much more than the success of the national team that enables the family to recover its mutual love and self respect. Thereafter father and son make up for lost time! The film is not short on light relief. There are brilliant performances by Katherina Wackernagel and Lucas Gregorowicz playing a young newly wed couple husband a sports reporter whose honeymoon plans are frustrated by the World Cup fever. Bear in mind that this is only 12 years before England's own 1966 victory  remember how Sir Alf Ramsey treated the journalists and interviewers of the day? Perhaps he was taking a leaf out of the book of his 1954 German counterpart! Likewise the match commentary has gone down in German folklore. In the Marriage of Maria Braun we heard part of the original recording while something quite unconnected with football was going on! It is powerful stuff but in this film the commentary is rightly played to some extent for laughs. However the strongest performances come from the family members themselves and inevitably from Peter Lohmeyer and Louis Klamroth who apparently really are father and son! If Mary Poppins and Billy Elliott raised that lump in your throat be ready to go with the flow but have a few Kleenex to hand!".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not know until reading the comments at the IMDb site that winning the FIFA World Cup in 1954 meant so much to a Germany that was building a new humanitarian society.I want to add two remarks to what has been said so well by the others.First of all I think that Miracle at Berlin should be released worldwide with English subtitles because it has such a good story to tell. It only had Thai subtitles not English here in Chiang Mai Thailand but I was lucky to understand enough of the German dialog. The theatre manager later told me the Thai subtitles helped many natives here to enjoy and appreciate this so he ran it an extra week.Secondly it is pleasant to see the Germans in the film express their patriotic pride in such a positive way. For example it was fun to watch the young woman who agreed to delay her honeymoon so that her sportswriter husband could cover the World Cup in Switzerland. She had cared little about the tournament but in the final match came out in front of the German fans to lead cheers for their struggling team.Since then it was also a pleasure to see and read how Germany hosted such a successful World Cup tournament in July 2006 with their theme for visitors from around the world A Time to Make Friends. I'm reminded how Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court Earl Warren said he would first read the sports pages for news of human accomplishments before having to turn to the front pages to learn about the failures. Now that so much of the Middle East is once again in flames we need stories like Miracle at Berlin to remind us that sometimes there are still happy endings.".

Both are stereotyped but acceptable. There are a few aspects of this film that I would like to particularly mention. Some of the scenes of Switzerland are unbelievably beautiful even surpassing those you see at the opening of The Sound of Music when Julie Andrews sings the title number. The dialogue insofar as I can surmise from the subtitle is witty. There is even an exchange between the coach and a cleaning lady at the hotel that comprises entirely of proverbs reminiscing of two songs in two different Gilbert and Sullivan operettas HMS Pinafore and Iolanthe. The usual 'echoing' technique is well places e.g. in the final scene in the train the boy bringing two cold beers to his mentor or echoing to his father what the latter said before 'German boys don't cry'.I think it's appropriate to leave the final words to football. The upbeat game in the finale is well shot and wisely refrains from being overmelodramatic although as far as I understand the actual score of 31 has been modified to 32 for dramatic effects. To the audience in town the games are obviously much more appealing than those in Remember the Titans 2000. Interesting to note also that thing haven't changed in 50 years. Although the TV screen has come a long way the crowd at the pub shown in the movie is essentially no different from the crowd I rubbed shoulder with in the local pubs two years ago for the 2002 World Cup.".

This film is just a wonderful film document of the great victory of the German soccer team against the Hungarian on in 1954. My father was 20 years old at that time and he watched this historical match live on TV in Bale Basel. He told me many times that the German team surprised everybody because nobody was in a doubt at the beginning of the world championship that the Hungarian team will win. So this 32 victory of the German soccer time was really a historical event and cannot be really compared with 1974 or 1990 where they became world champion as well. I deeply recommend my father to go to the cinema as soon as possible to watch this movie. According to the scenery shown in the film Matthias and Richard must have crossed the Alpes when driving from Essen to Bern. But in fact this is not necessary because Bern is located at the north side of this mountain chain. Nevertheless a wonderful film!".

I also liked the music which was supportive without being overly dramatic or emotional.

	schema:headline " This film is everything its Hollywood counterpart wouldn't be";
	schema:reviewBody "It is largely misleading to think of Das Wunder von Bern as a film about football history. Although the film is set in 1954 during the World Cup in Switzerland there is essentially no World Cup football shown until the last half an hour which features the final game of the tournament. The film is really about life in Germany in the early 1950s and the resurrection of the country from the ashes of the Second World War. The world title of the German team totally unexpected for the World Cup firsttimers before the championship serves as a metaphor for this resurrection and the fact is that it did spurt a resurgence of national pride and determination. Yet most of the football in the film is played by kids with rag balls in the muddy back streets of the Ruhr region. A middle class German family living in this area is the encapsulation of German joys trials and tribulations from the period  working day and night to make ends meet welcoming back the surviving prisoners of war struggling to readjust them in society the clashes between former Nazi soldier fathers and their newborn communist sons the EastWest Germany divide the advent of television rock'n'roll dancing balls or was that just a few months ahead of time? and of course football as the game of the working and middle classes. In my view all this is introduced naturally and in good taste without unneeded pathos exaggerated martyrdom or heroism  one thing that sets it apart from the typical Hollywood production. The acting is anything but flashy but so was life there and then. I would say that the cast manages to hit just the right tone and the performances of Louis Klamroth and Peter Lohmeyer as father and son Lubanski are remarkable. Another difference between this film and a major studio blockbuster is that when it does come to football the realism is uncompromising. The casting team spent some time on choosing actors who resemble the actual players as nearly as possible the similarity in appearance and manner between Pter Franke and coach Sepp Herberger is almost uncanny. Moreover these people know how to pass the ball so that the need for special effects and standins is minimal also the exact opposite of Hollywood standards. The recreation of the final game itself is pedantic to the smallest detail with not only the goals but even trivial situations in midfield and radio commentary being reproduced with startling faithfulness. OK the filmmakers forget to mention that Hungary had a goal disallowed for offside in the last minute but apparently this decision was never in doubt. In the final scene of the film the hypedup statements about how this sporting exploit launched a whole nation in the orbit of greatness that we have come to expect from Hollywood are nowhere to be seen they are replaced by a matteroffact reminder of the ephemeral nature of sporting successes. But don't get me wrong this is a good and not just a feelgood film on its own merits not just because it's a Hollywood antidote.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is largely misleading to think of Das Wunder von Bern as a film about football history. Although the film is set in 1954 during the World Cup in Switzerland there is essentially no World Cup football shown until the last half an hour which features the final game of the tournament. The film is really about life in Germany in the early 1950s and the resurrection of the country from the ashes of the Second World War. The world title of the German team totally unexpected for the World Cup firsttimers before the championship serves as a metaphor for this resurrection and the fact is that it did spurt a resurgence of national pride and determination. Yet most of the football in the film is played by kids with rag balls in the muddy back streets of the Ruhr region. A middle class German family living in this area is the encapsulation of German joys trials and tribulations from the period  working day and night to make ends meet welcoming back the surviving prisoners of war struggling to readjust them in society the clashes between former Nazi soldier fathers and their newborn communist sons the EastWest Germany divide the advent of television rock'n'roll dancing balls or was that just a few months ahead of time? and of course football as the game of the working and middle classes. In my view all this is introduced naturally and in good taste without unneeded pathos exaggerated martyrdom or heroism  one thing that sets it apart from the typical Hollywood production. The acting is anything but flashy but so was life there and then. I would say that the cast manages to hit just the right tone and the performances of Louis Klamroth and Peter Lohmeyer as father and son Lubanski are remarkable. Another difference between this film and a major studio blockbuster is that when it does come to football the realism is uncompromising.

I find the narration to be unique an unusual insight into the characters of the film and the thoughts of the little girl Linda Manz who does the narrating. The characters that continually fascinate me are Brooke Adams as the lead female and Robert J. Wilke as the farm foreman. I guess it's their faces that intrigue me. Adams' downturned mouth and sad look and Wilke's wrinklies catch my attention every time.The story is interesting generally lowkey but with a few quick violent scenes that are quite memorable. More than that one gets an incredible feel for the land and for the migrant workers of that time period. Another nice aspect of this film is the very small amount of profanity. Kids probably would be bored with this film but at least I wouldn't be afraid to show it to them.But as many pluses as the story boasts that haunting music and those incredible visuals are what drive me back for more.

	schema:reviewBody "Oh I better come out and say it I love Terrence Malick. I think he's one of the few filmmakers who has completely and utterly captured filmic form. The Thin Red Line was to me an astonishing experience beautiful horrific and the best movie of the 90s. Badlands is the best loversonthelam movie I've ever seen it certainly makes True Romance look like a gimmicky fraud of a movie. Malick somehow manages to make everything seem painfully beautiful his landscape his actors his dialogue. There's something always elegiac about his movies.There's a picture of James Dean I saw from his youth  a baseball team photo  and the caption said something about how it captured his face and in it wisdom and sadness far beyond his years. That's what Malick does in his films and particularly in this film.He must have been a fan of James Dean probably one of the reasons he chose to make Badlands as a sort of homage but not in the sense that coolness comes from a perfectly combed coiffure a red leather jacket which it wasn't  it was a windbreaker and a dark brood. There's a similar story here to that of Giant set on a farm with that remarkable house two men and one girl. Only Giant didn't have a philosophizing and very strange little girl. It was also an overblown soap opera and while this film is I guess a melodrama it certainly isn't melodramatic.If Malick is anyone in the film he's Sam Shapard watching his love through a lens. Malick uses Manz as a sort of channel. If this is indeed some fashion of his own story Malick tells us through her with he visualized by Shepard which is a somewhat brilliant approach. Manz is strangely philosophical at once blunt and abstract. The story is obviously centered around her  I don't see why this wouldn't be obvious  but she's pushed into the background commenting on the characters and informing us like God from above.As always with Malick his film is mesmerizing and hypnotic. I was surprised that the film was only a little over an hourandahalf. The great Ennio Morricone created a wonderful score for this film that seems to forebode impending doom. Unlike his more famous spaghetti western scores it's never overlyflamboyant. And the cinematography listed as belonging to Nestor Almendros but wellknown to be at least substantially contributed to by Haskell Wexler is so much like an oil painting that it's just about liquid film. I'd be willing to pay a lot of money to see this one on the big screen.It might seem obvious to state that this film is a transition between Badlands and The Thin Red Line after all it was the middle film. But this film has moments especially in the finale that are surprisingly close to that of Badlands and this is the film where Malick fully mastered his approach of lush visual poetry told at a languid pace that never seems boring since you're fully within the films grasp.Pauline Kael said in her review that the film is an empty Christmas tree you can hang all your dumb metaphors on it. And Charles Taylor always following Kael's lead even from beyond the grave said of Malick's two 1970s films Next to the work of Altman Scorsese Coppola De Palma and Mazursky from that period they're pallid jokes.What never fails to get me furious is when someone viciously attacks a director like Malick for being selfindulgent. Of course it's selfindulgent he's telling a story that means something to him and trying to share what he feels with us. Malick certainly isn't trying to alienate people and if you are alienated by his films well don't watch them. Malick is a filmmaker like Kubrick but more fluid and much less abrasive. I mean if you're going to aggressively attack a filmmaker aggressively attack someone who is aggressive on his side. Directors like Malick use abstractions to engage their audiences more fully than most. By leaving things  often feelings  open to interpretation the film becomes more intimate.Certainly one of the most enduring films from the 70s this is a masterwork.".

But this film has moments especially in the finale that are surprisingly close to that of Badlands and this is the film where Malick fully mastered his approach of lush visual poetry told at a languid pace that never seems boring since you're fully within the films grasp.Pauline Kael said in her review that the film is an empty Christmas tree you can hang all your dumb metaphors on it. And Charles Taylor always following Kael's lead even from beyond the grave said of Malick's two 1970s films Next to the work of Altman Scorsese Coppola De Palma and Mazursky from that period they're pallid jokes.What never fails to get me furious is when someone viciously attacks a director like Malick for being selfindulgent. Of course it's selfindulgent he's telling a story that means something to him and trying to share what he feels with us. Malick certainly isn't trying to alienate people and if you are alienated by his films well don't watch them. Malick is a filmmaker like Kubrick but more fluid and much less abrasive. I mean if you're going to aggressively attack a filmmaker aggressively attack someone who is aggressive on his side. Directors like Malick use abstractions to engage their audiences more fully than most. By leaving things  often feelings  open to interpretation the film becomes more intimate.Certainly one of the most enduring films from the 70s this is a masterwork.";

	schema:reviewBody "In merely an hour and a half Terrence Malick does more with Days of Heaven than most directors could do in a lifetime. In this wonderful film we see all seven deadly sins play out against one of the most incredible backdrops ever put on camera. Virtually every shot could be framed and hung on your wall as a fine piece of art. Malick even shows us he knows how to film a pheasant hunt!The story though at times swallowed up by the cinematography is also pretty compelling. Richard Gere is the main focus. He plays a downonhisluck laborer from the dirty world of preWW1 industrialized Chicago. After a dispute with a foreman which we see but don't really hear Gere kills the man and is forced to flee the area. Along with him are his girlfriend Brooke Adams and his kid sister Linda Manz. The three of them hop on a train and before you know it they all have a jobs harvesting wheat on a seemingly boundless Texas farm. The work is difficult to be sure but once the owner of the farm Sam Shephard notices Adams things take an unexpected turn. All along Gere has told everyone that Adams is his sister rather than his girlfriend. Shephard likes Adams enough to let the three of them stay on after the harvest is done. Gere overhears the Farmer talking to a doctor in which it is apparently revealed that he has only a year to live. Gere urges Adams to marry the farmer so hopefully the three of them will get his money after he quickly passes. Adams agrees setting the table for nothing but tragedy and betrayal.The story is narrated by Linda Manz who plays Gere's kid sister. In her words and in her voice we hear clear evidence of just what kind of difficult lives the three of them have lived and what a wonderful opportunity their new situation seems at first to provide. Her character is one of the most authentic that this critic has seen in a film in many years. She even has an odd beauty about her if the camera catches her in the proper light. Notice one scene in particular when she is watching a friend jump a train and the sun is setting behind her.Gere Adams and Shephard are also as good as ever. It would be so easy for their performances to get lost within the aesthetic beauty of this film yet they stand out in welldefined characters. I don't recall us ever being told Shephard's name in the film. He's only referred to as the farmer. Is he really dying? We can never be quite sure. Does Adams really love Gere or Shephard? Maybe. Maybe not. There is much left to the imagination about each of these characters. Towards the end all hell breaks loose as you might expect. Secrets are found out fortunes are lost and lives are taken. The last fifteen minutes look like something out of the book of revelations as they were most likely intended to. And for some of the characters new lives are forged but they are another story. And it's a story we can only imagine. Days of Heaven is a triumph on all levels. It is simply unforgettable. Certainly one of the best films this critic has seen in a long long time.10 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "Days of Heaven 1978  Nobody's perfect. There was never a perfect person around. You just have halfangel and halfdevil in you. This line delivered by Linda Manz in Terrence Malick's gorgeous masterpiece 'Days of Heaven' sums up everything you need to know about life on earth. Much of Malick's themes have been devoted to man versus nature and the idea of perfection is not outside that realm  imperfection is the nature of mankind.Richard Gere in his greatest performance plays Bill a hot headed lower class worker who in a moment of mistake accidentally kills his boss in a Chicago factory. We see that the boss is hassling Bill but we never know why we just see faces but no distinguishable voices over the roar of the factory. Bill his sister Manz and his girlfriend Abby played by Brooke Adams take off for the panhandle hitching a ride on a train. Bill and Abby tell everyone that they are all brothers and sisters because as you know people talk. They find work on a farm owned by the rich farmer played by Sam Shepard. Many other films would make the farmer the bad guy giving him trade mark heel characteristics but Shepard's farmer who we learn is dying is soulful and yearning for love. He see's Abby and is interested and eventually will ask her to stay  after Bill hears the doctor tell him he has about a year to live. They decide to stay and after some persuasion from Bill Abby will marry the dying farmer so that they can be heir to his fortune. Suspicions arise and hearts and lives are broken and the Days of Heaven will come to a halting end.The cinematography is some of the most breathtaking ever captured on film. 'Days of Heaven' could even considered a masterpiece for its aesthetic beauty alone if the story were not so terrific. Everything about the film is magnificent. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting and beautiful. You will remember it forever along with Linda Manz' unforgettable narration likely one of the greatest voice overs in film history. Many have criticized Malick's distancing techniques and muted emotions. We are always kept at arms length away. But these people don't realize that the story is a memory a memory from the real main character  Linda. Also in a method that Robert Bresson used by distancing us emotionally it leaves us to add our own emotions and imaginations in the story heightening the power of the film as long as you are willing not to be spoonfed what to think.Terrence Malick is a filmmaker who came out of nowhere with his talents already fulfilled and he has not stopped since. His films are filled with such heartbreaking beauty and symbolism and he is one of the few living filmmakers who truly are creating art rather than just entertainment. He had one of the greatest debuts ever in the mesmerizing and haunting 'Badlands' the deepest and most philosophical 'The Thin Red Line' which is likely the greatest contemporary war film as suggested by the late Gene Siskeland the stunningly beautiful 'The New World.' His films are deep and meaningful and to get into the underlying symbolism and themes of them here would be pointless and better saved for a long essay.Days of Heaven is one of the greatest and most beautiful films ever made. Cinema is at a low point recently but as long as Terrence Malick is still making films we still have some heavenly art to look forward to.PS  Hopefully someone like Criterion will create a new DVD as the current one has some soundtrack problems. Imagine seeing it restored visually and audibly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Days of Heaven is in fact what its highest praisers want you to believe aweinspiring cinema sometimes even mindblowing in what can be filmed and brought forth in a beautiful seamless mold of narrative and poetry photographed with an eye for the prairie and fields like very few others and for the period detail. But it's also wonderful and haunting because it evokes what it is to look back on something and remember things vividly clearly with a subjectivity that is startling in its scarred interior. This is childactor Linda Manz her first role in what is a relatively small career and she voices in grungy but fine vocal from afar at times even as she's one of the principle players.She's the kid sister of Bill Richard Gere a very good if not extraordinary performance compared to others a factory worker who kills a man by accident and runs off with his girlfriend Abby Brooke Adams and the three of them end up working for a farmer Sam Shephard and soon there's a love triangle formed wrapped around an elaborate con of Bill and Abby being brother and sister. These are just the facts but director Terence Malick isn't after just those but after a sad look back from a perspective of wonderment and horror and a kind of fractured innocence. It goes without saying that since it is a Malick picture one will expect the painterly landscapes of the fields those intimate closeups with bugs and waving fields of grass. But Malick is able to put a unique vision into the perspective of that of a little girl who is seeing and experiencing everything as it is not as it may be really imagined or wanting to be.So there's a lot of interest already just in the nature of the farming on this panhandle in early 20th century. But there's just little things little fantastic bits that stick in your mind probably forever the workers in the field toiling away the black man tapdancing by the barn the airplane circus people coming by and showing silent films. Most notably as well are near biblical visions like the plague and extinguishing by lots of fire of locusts. And through all of the many many beautiful shots there's a tender and perfectly tragic love story played out with great work by Adams and a young Shepherd. Manz too I might add is excellent in a role that could have been mucked up by anyone else also trumping a later future firsttime performance in Malick's own The New World with the woman playing Pocahontas.And as if the crisp eye of Malick and his DPs Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler weren't enough there's Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack to boot. Here's a crucial part of Malick's success in translating the theme of remembrance and feeling both the moment and the mood of the whole period and characters in the film sometimes combined just listen to the theme of the movie used later in movie trailers and commercials as it reckons a nostalgic tinge for something that one can't firmly grasp but is felt deeply and without really fully knowing the whole scope. Overall Days of Heaven is almost too good too beautiful it's the kind of picture that defines reputations for better or worse. Like Malick's. A".

Terrence Malick is clearly a wellrespected director and it seems that the IMDb viewers at least think very highly of the film. But unfortunately it seems my tastes haven't changed at all.Where to start? For one thing Linda Manz's narration is horrific. Her voice is so irritating with that horrendous New York accent please don't try and convince me that Chicagoans talk that way  they don't. She herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things which does not make her a talented actress. She's not even acting! I came on IMDb expecting to see her ripped apart since her performance is just so utterly laughable but people actually seemed to like it! She's simply unappealing in every way  I kept hoping Malick would just kill her off.The other actors were fine but certainly nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest in the cast but she also had the only decent part. Except the old guy  he was pretty good.Speaking of acting how could Shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid?? He bought the brother and sister act because...uh why would he buy that? Bill and Abby took every single opportunity to be touchyfeely as though they didn't realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way. It was just completely unbelievable. And finally after a considerable amount of time the Farmer suddenly realizes that Oh my god they're together! Then he goes after Bill with a gun but instead seems to trip into Bill's hand and ends up with a mortal stab wound.Speaking of which the fate of the characters was similarly stupid and dare I say lazy. Of course Bill has to die  could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops? Abby goes on with her happy life getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out. And the irksome narrator randomly finds her deadbeat friend and they wander off into the sunset. But it's okay because Malick never gave me any reason to care about the characters anyway.As for the plot this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development. I can't believe it's only 94 minutes long  I could have sworn I was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours. The sudden locust disaster was like throwing the Bible in my face I'm totally fine with metaphors and allusions but this was completely over the top. Clearly the message was Don't marry for money or bad things will happen to you. Very original.I understand that Days of Heaven like all of Terrence Malick's films is meant to be a piece of art. And I will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply stunning and the magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film. But I need more than nice pictures to enjoy a film and this one just didn't do it for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Days of heaven is exactly what this is. The magic hour when much of the film was shot those moments before dawn and after dusk when everything is indirect dreamlike breathless heartwaking. There's no real story as such. Sure there's a general plot line which should satisfy any casual viewer. This isn't after all a hard film to follow. It is simply that the environment is the main character as opposed to the human elements. Linda Manz's young character narrates the story sporadically like a sleepy traveler beside the campfire telling you of halfforgotten memories and wonderful casual observations that will seem clearer in the morning light but no longer worth mentioning. Her voice is halting and uncertain belying a personality that is confident in all other respects. Other actors good Brooke Adams Sam Shepard and notsogood Richard Gere blend in perfectly. Their performances are so understated that you forget they are actors playing characters. Even Richard Gere who never learned subtlety and would never again employ it is almost invisible here.This is not a long film. For all its leisurely pace ninetysix minutes is all it needs to tell its tale. Terrence Malick is out for sight and sound. There is nothing lost to unneeded expression nothing not shared in the space in front of you. That leaves cinematographer Nstor Almendros with the freedom to photograph to observe without opinion whatever seems to be happening most openly before him.When I first finished watching Days of Heaven it felt like waking from a dream. I couldn't be sure how much time has passed. It seemed so long but the silence was the same and little had changed outside my window. Nothing but the heavy quiet was all around me and I felt the desperate desire to move. Everything beneath my feet felt moving quietly slipping past and all I had to do was put soles to earth and start walking. This is a film of photographs images of the purest sort. Open your eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first exposure that I had to Terrence Malick was Badlands. While apparently every critic and the overwhelming majority of IMDb reviewers would say that this was a good choice to introduce me to one of the greatest filmmakers I found the dialog awkward and strange. The actual film while very effective of capturing the beauty of nature a staple of Malick movies as I later found out was not all that great. Still it had a plot and characters with discernible motives so I was able to somewhat reason away what I personally thought was a bizarre and pretentious style of making films. Probably the biggest reason I can give a pass to Badlands is that it gave Martin Sheen one of my favorite actors a boost into big Hollywood films. I was then told by a friend that I should give Malick another chance and either Days of Heaven or Thin Red Line would be a good idea for my second film. Needless to say after sitting through this I probably will not be getting around to another Malick movie any time soon.I should point out that there are several aspects of this movie that are excellent. As with Badlands the cinematography musical score and setting are absolutely beautiful. If all of the dialog and scenes with actual people in the frame were removed I might actually love this movie. What I'm trying to say is if Terrence Malick made a documentary for National Geographic I would definitely watch it. The dialog much like Badlands is absolutely awful. I don't find entire conversations conveyed through facial expressions staring and minimalistic bombastic sentences to be good storytelling. The narration is no better and managed to annoy me more than anything else. This leads to a fundamental problem of the movie the dialog and narration is so bad that I am not able to really understand or relate to the characters. Why do they do what they do? What are there personalities? I don't know. This causes me to not care about them or what happens to them. Another problem is when a scene develops occasionally the camera cuts to nature or just moves on to another scene with the characters all together. This got so bad that my brother literally called a cutaway before it happened. As a scene was developing that implied sex was about to happen my brother said Huh. I bet its gonna cut to rain or something right before anything physical actually happens. Guess what? Right when something physical was about to happen it cut to rain falling on leaves. The cuts in this movie are predictably bad.This movie being pretentious is just my opinion. I am of the belief that characters and character interactions are more important than setting or scenery and it is obvious that Malick does not share this philosophy and this means that I probably will never like a movie that he makes. Most will call this good film and I simply cannot agree with that. This movie is barely 90 minutes but I would rather watch Gettysburg than watch this again. I wanted to like this movie and that may be why my reaction is so strong. I do not want to try to take away the joy that some moviegoers get from watching this movie and in the end can only hope that we can agree to disagree about Malick films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having never seen a Terrence Malick movie before and having read rave review after rave review about Days of Heaven I had extremely high expectations and I was sorely disappointed. The movie's first scene features Richard Gere working at a steel mill in Chicago. He has some form of argument with another man which is totally incomprehensible due to the earcrushing noise of the machinery an annoying situation which will happen multiple times in the film. After about ten seconds the argument ends when Gere abruptly decides to murder this guy for no apparent reason since we can't hear what they were even saying. Cut to Gere and his family who we've never seen before riding on a train while irritating narration is provided by a character we haven't met and have no context with. This is basically the summary of the movie. There is no denying the absolute beauty of the cinematography but the movie was all icing and no cake. It seems like 95 percent of the film was made up of 30 second dialogue scenes most of which were hard to understand followed by 510 minutes of assorted shots of fields at dusk workers at dusk houses at dusk workers at dawn fields at dawn... and so on. This movie gave me golden hour fatigue. Additionally I just didn't care about any of the characters. They were completely forgettable and the only emotion I ever felt towards any of them was irritation. The plot such as it is moves so quickly that it's impossible to care or understand it. Between all of the mumbled or muted dialogue countless shots of the fields at twilight fade outs and subplots that had little or nothing to do with anything Days of Heaven's 93 minutes drags out to the point where it feels like at least 3 hours. As I said I really wanted to like Days of Heaven but I just couldn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Terrence Malick is less a storyteller than a visual poet. At times the images in 'Days of Heaven 1978' seem too beautiful to be believed  could Mother Nature even construct such moments of magnificence at her own accord? Cinematographers Nstor Almendros and Haskell Wexler credited only as additional photographer consistently shot the film during the magic hour between darkness and sunrisesunset when the sun's radiance is missing from the sky and so their colours have a muted presence as though filtered through the stalks of wheat that saturate the landscape. Crucial alongside the film's photographers are composer Ennio Morricone  utilising a variation on the seventh movement Aquarium in Camille SaintSans's Carnival of the Animals suite  and a succession of sound editors whose work brings a dreamy ethereal edge to the vast fields of the Texas Panhandle. The film's final act away from the wheatfields recalls Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde 1967' but otherwise Malick's style contemplative and elegiac is in a class of its own more comparable perhaps to Kurosawa's 'Dersu Uzala 1975.'Malick refuses to explore his characters' motivations. The viewer is deliberately kept at an arm's length and Malick eschews cinema's traditional notions of narrative development. Instead the story is told as a succession of fleeting moments the sort that a young girl the film's narrator Linda Manz might pick up through her daytoday experiences and muted understanding of adult emotions. Note that the girl is always kept separate from the dramatic crux of the film  the lovetriangle between Billy Abby and the Farmer  and her comprehension of events is tainted by her adolescent grasp on adult relationships and societal norms. I was reminded of Andrew Dominik's recent 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford 2007' another sumptuouslyphotographed picture which also refused to explore its title character Jesse James kept at a distance through the impartial objectivity of the historical narrator. In Malick's film Linda's narration tells us one thing and the viewer sees another. But one can never fully understand the complex emotions driving human behaviour so perhaps the girl's perspective is as good as any other.'Days of Heaven' derives its title from a passage in the Bible Deuteronomy 1121 and Malick's tale of jealousy and desire is suitably Biblical in nature. Essential to this allegory is an apocalyptic plague of locusts which descend upon the wheatfields like an army from the heavens. When the fields erupt into flame quite literally from the broiling emotions of the film's conflicted characters the viewer is confronted by the most intense manifestation of Hellon Earth since the burning village in Bondarchuk's 'War and Peace 1967.' But interestingly Malick here regresses on his own allegory Judgement Day isn't the end but rather it comes and goes. Life is driven by the inexorable march of Fate The Farmer Sam Shepard is doomed to die within a year Bill Richard Gere is doomed to repeat his mistakes twice over. In the film's final moments Linda and her newfound friend embark purposelessly along the railway tracks the tracks being a physical incarnation of Fate itself their paths are laid down already but we mortals can never know precisely where they lead until we get there.".

But one can never fully understand the complex emotions driving human behaviour so perhaps the girl's perspective is as good as any other.'Days of Heaven' derives its title from a passage in the Bible Deuteronomy 1121 and Malick's tale of jealousy and desire is suitably Biblical in nature. Essential to this allegory is an apocalyptic plague of locusts which descend upon the wheatfields like an army from the heavens. When the fields erupt into flame quite literally from the broiling emotions of the film's conflicted characters the viewer is confronted by the most intense manifestation of Hellon Earth since the burning village in Bondarchuk's 'War and Peace 1967.' But interestingly Malick here regresses on his own allegory Judgement Day isn't the end but rather it comes and goes. Life is driven by the inexorable march of Fate The Farmer Sam Shepard is doomed to die within a year Bill Richard Gere is doomed to repeat his mistakes twice over. In the film's final moments Linda and her newfound friend embark purposelessly along the railway tracks the tracks being a physical incarnation of Fate itself their paths are laid down already but we mortals can never know precisely where they lead until we get there.";

All i can say is i hope the photography was superb because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film. Not since the Replacement Killers have i fallen asleep during a film. This film felt so long and it wasn't! the editing was choppy and disjointed the storyline nonexistent the voice over was an incoherent ramble the characters weakly developed and the whole thing was uninvolving. I know that Malick was uncertain of how to do the film. He consequently shot a heck of a lot of footage then spent around two years editing in an attempt to piece it all together. This is very apparent on screen. Everything looks chopped up every time a scene seemed to gain some momentum or some character development it would obtrusively cut to boring scenes of people doing boring things. It was as if someone had tried to cut together a story out of stock footage of people farming. The few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end but those things are no where near enough to maintain interest. I would normally let a bad film pass by without being too vocal but when it is so highly overrated something must be said.Maybe a farmer would like it...?".

	schema:headline " Trying to be a serious drama but turns out as a cheap soup  opera. Or a comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a complete mess. I find it astonishing that it gained so much praise and so many high ratings. I think it should be regarded to a degree as a comedy because there are so many things in the movie that lack coherence integrity and must of all a plain sense of just about anything.For starters the story isn't either original nor great. It's a classic love triangle that could be solidified by a much better script. Because the script is...just lazy  the dialogue between the characters is short empty and doesn't add anything to any kind of depth. The characters are dull even the acting is in my opinion very forced I mean their expressions are always the same throughout the whole film which is indeed a very comic element there's no evident reason why anybody should care about them. Hell most of them don't even have names which adds to the numbness of their storyarc. Because there is hardly a story arc anywhere  beyond the soapy almost pathetic role of the protagonists. So yeah we are left with almost no story at all because the most of it just flows around the classic lovehate relationships but in such a yawny ahundredtimesseen manner that you know what's going to happen in the first half of the movie.Then we have the narrator which is plain horrible. Or maybe the most comic part of the movie. Both actually. It seems like it's it's a she the fish  faced girl who portraits the main protagonist Bill's little sister just rambling about and on and on about that or this nonsense. At moments it seems that she's trying really hard to get some point or other across but then just returns to her noncoherent babbling about some ghost touching her neck or somethin'. Her vocabulary is really um limited her accent isn't even Chicago oriented like the movie states it to be thank you Qatacyo and her talent to tell is just...not a talent. Really. I don't know what Malick was thinking while choosing her as the narrator but he really should be forever imbarrased by his choice.As the whole story progresses we learn nothing new. After Bill gets himself finally killed it looks like we wasted 34 of the film because life really just goes on for his lover and his little sister like nothing ever happened. The ending is pure wtf to me. Like the whole film actually.Of course with Malick you know that there's going to be some really beautiful photography and cinematic awesomeness ahead. About that I can't complain  the shots of the nature surroundings pastoral fields animals and insects are really stunning. But that's the only thing in the film that is really worth praising for. And I can't rate this movie higher than 310 because everything else pretty much sucks and just shows all the impatience and suffering the director had to go through in the two years of editing after the shoot. It really shows that he pretty much knew that it's going to end up in a mess. We see that in the way the scenes blend together with no elemental feeling of the story  there's a scene it's short we get three lines of dialog and then he pushes us in a new scene that just repeats the formula again and again without even the slightest coherence. It's all so painfully random and shallow even the scenes that are supposed to be important or somethin'. So even in this aspect we are left with a couple of nice really beautiful shots that can't really follow the story around because it's so weak and tells us absolutely nothing of a real value.I enjoyed for example The Thin Red Line greatly  although the story again isn't that much original it's pieced together in a skillful way. Professional. The same goes for The Tree of Life. And I dig Tarkovski or Kubrick and many others who both did manage to blend together average stories with great cinematography with stunning results. So I guess it's not about either the story element vs. the cinematography element but it's rather a clever and passionate unison of both that make great exciting and everlasting masterpieces of cinema. Days of Heaven fails the exam on almost every basic field and remains one of my biggest film disappointments. Or maybe just a big laugh....and stuff.".

Yeah it's probably been said before but it is amazing perfect heaven on it's own. It is probably one of the best photographed films I have ever seen and reminds me of Deakins' work in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. All of Malick's films have been visually amazing but this is his most yet. Also the score spellbinding. I thought nothing would beat Badlands' score but this did. It also took me back to the time I first heard it in the teaser for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Now the content the story is simple if not a bit conventional but here it didn't matter. In that it is similar to Badlands and unlike Thin Red Line which I thought the story got overwhelming. Here is what I first experienced in Badlands the sense of longing and the beauty that is found in the world. Ultimately I would say this is a great film if not a bit too superficial at times. Neither of the three leads are on par with either Sheen or Spacek in Badlands and the film never reaches the highs found in the first half of Badlands but it also doesn't hit some of the bumps that the 2nd half of Badlands stumbles on. It is more consistent and in that it ranks about the same for now.".

In Texas they find work at the harvest on a wheat ranch and when the rich but dying farmer expresses his love for the woman the man encourages her to respond to him. When the two are married and the farmer invites them all to live with him inevitable resentment and jealousy surface ...Although they've made a lot of westerns and costumedramas the Americans don't make many films about their own history which feel real and authentic  the style is often deliberately overdone as in Jezebel or Gone With The Wind and there are only a few movies where the filmmakers really try to capture the period say The Grapes Of Wrath or Matewan. Days Of Heaven is the best example I've seen of this latter style and an astonishingly unique and haunting film. The simple story is really just a framework with which Malick paints extraordinary landscapes and evocative themes  in every sense this is a timeless picture. If ever there was a showcase of how to photograph a film well this is it director of photography Nestor Almendros  with additional shooting by Haskell Wexler the Chicago scenes  creates astonishing images of the endless wheatfields and the lonely farmhouse with incredible use of available light and colour and no diffusion filters or staged lighting. Uniquely the filmmakers deliberately did not shoot during the normal day but filmed mainly during the dusk magichour which results in an amazing ghostly ambient feel to the visuals for more on this see the excellent American Film Institute documentary Visions Of Light. The long locust invasion  forest fire sequence is one of the most intense and incredible setpieces ever put on film and my mind boggles as to how they pulled it off nowadays of course it would all be done with computer opticals. This is one of very few movies where you can literally take any still at all and the lighting framing and composition are just breathtaking. I'll admit I'm a photography junkie  to me movies are about images  but if you've never really thought about how a movie is physically shot before please watch this amazing picture. The other outstanding element of the film is the music it is bookended by Camille SaintSaens spinetingling Aquarium theme from his Le Carnaval Des Animaux but the rest is awash in a fabulous stringwoodwind score by the great Ennio Morricone one of his very best. As with many truly great pictures the combination of the visuals and the music result in a sensory experience that lifts you into the stratosphere  it's incredible. I normally talk about actors and writers in my reviews but here they kinda take backstage. The script is intentionally loose and archetypal although they have names the characters are really just Man Woman Farmer and Girl and many plot points are vague you're never sure if Gere and Adams are married or whether Gere kills Shepard. The performances are iconic and whilst I find Adams irresistible in all her films particularly The Dead Zone it's narrator Manz who actually comes off best for me since she's not a star she conveys the bucolic lostintime mood of the piece to terrific effect. Produced by Bert and Harold Schneider and featuring wonderful art direction by Jack Fisk who has designed all Malick's films. After making this fabulous movie writerdirector Malick took a twentyyear break from cinema and moved to France to teach. This was a great shame because he is one of the most original creative and talented directors of all time  don't miss this breathtaking powerful incredibly beautiful picture.".

It's basically a love triangle with a beautiful woman at its centre with themes of poverty power and companionship ably interwoven. It inevitably ends in tragedy. To be honest it was too predictable a plot and too slowmoving to really get me excited.The performances were very good. Richard Gere Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard are superb as the central trio Here in particular. But Linda Manz rather steals the show as the child star narrator who seems to have a more healthy dose of pragmatism and fatalism than the rest of them put together.In summary a simply gorgeous film well put together but with a plot that rather plods along. I'd watch it again but for the visuals not the story.".

Bill Gere and Abby Adams are boyfriend and girlfriend who pose as brother and sister. After Bill punches a man Stuart Margolin and he winds up dead the two of them along with Bill's sister Linda Manz travel from Chicago to the Texas panhandle looking for work.The owner of the farm where they wind up Shepard falls for Abby and when Bill finds out he's terminally ill urges Abby to marry him. After the wedding Bill and Linda stay on at the farm with Bill doing jobs around the place. Meanwhile he's meeting Abby secretly. Jealousy impatience and tragedy follow.Not much dialogue to be had here  apparently Malick threw out the script and let the actors find the story. The three leads  were any of us ever that young? They're beautiful. All the acting is very internalized and it works here beautifully  it's all in the facial expressions the eyes  it could almost be a silent movie. Though it's a languid film there is an underlying tension throughout. The one rough spot for me was Linda Manz and her New York accent. People from Chicago do not talk like that and in fact I had a difficult time understanding her which made her an odd choice for the narrator. Children are naturals they don't have any social barriers or inhibitions so I'm never impressed by child actors though many of them are fabulous. I didn't feel that she had much to offer. Malick felt differently and it's his movie I just didn't think her gifts showed on screen.This is a mustsee film  haunting and atmospheric and incredibly beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always say that my favourite Coen brothers movie is the last one I watched. A slight exaggeration but as they have had very few real misses in their career it's easy to forget just how great most of their movies are. For me 'Raising Arizona' ties with 'The Big Lebowski' as their single most entertaining movie and Arizona is arguably the funnier of the two if you are looking at sheer belly laughs. This movie is the Coen's most cartoonish and shows that they learned a lot from their involvement in Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead' and 'Crimewave'. The movie is full of fun clever touches and infectious energy. It just never lets up. Calling a movie a roller coaster ride is a cliche but it's a perfect description for this. The opening precredit sequence has more packed into it than most movies do in their complete running time! Nicholas Cage has recently got sidetracked making dumb action movies but back in the 80s and early 90s he was one of the most interesting and adventurous leading men in Hollywood making unusual movies like 'Birdy' this 'Vampire's Kiss' and 'Wild At Heart'. 'Adaptation' is a step back in the right direction for him. I hope he continues in this vein instead of say 'Con Air 2'. Cage is just terrific as H.I. and I haven't enjoyed Holly Hunter as much in any other movie. Together they make one of the best on screen couples in many a moon. The supporting cast are all fantastic especially John Goodman and William Forsythe as H.I.'s prison buddies. The psycho biker played by Tex Cobb is a also a brilliant touch. There are so many memorable bits in 'Raising Arizona' I could be here all day pointing them out. Just see for yourself. There were lots of lousy movies made in the 1980s the SpielbergLucasSimpsonBruckheimerJohn Hughes decade that dumbed down mainstream movies forever but there were also thankfully some wonderfully inspired ones like this 'Blue Velvet' 'Brazil' 'RoboCop' 'Repo Man' 'Eating Raoul' 'Beetlejuice' and 'The King Of Comedy'.".

There were lots of lousy movies made in the 1980s the SpielbergLucasSimpsonBruckheimerJohn Hughes decade that dumbed down mainstream movies forever but there were also thankfully some wonderfully inspired ones like this 'Blue Velvet' 'Brazil' 'RoboCop' 'Repo Man' 'Eating Raoul' 'Beetlejuice' and 'The King Of Comedy'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Raising Arizona is one of what I consider to be the five instantly classic films by the team of Ethan and Joel Coen the others being Blood Simple Fargo Oh Brother Where Are Thou and The Big Lebowski. But Raising Arizona is my personal favorite and probably the most quotable films I have ever seen with some of the best dialogue ever written for film. The story in brief H.I. Nicholas Cage and Ed Holly Hunter in one of my favorite roles of hers portray respectively an excon and a cop who meet when he keeps getting arrested for robbing convenience stores. They fall in love get married decide that there is just too much love between them and they need a critter to share it with. Upon finding that Edwina's insides were a rocky place where H.I.'s seed could find no purchase they try to adopt but are turned down because of H.I.'s record. Then they read in the newspaper about local unpainted furniture storeowner Nathan Arizona Trey Wilson owner of Unpainted Arizona and his wife having quintuplets as a result of fertility pills and who joke that They got more than they can handle. The couple hatch a plan to take one of the babies and raise it as their own. What results is an ongoing fastpaced hilarious set of misadventures complicated by the appearance of a ruthless heartless outlaw named Leonard Smalls Randall Tex Cobb Nathan Arizona hires to find the missing baby and two felon friends from H.I.'s past John Goodman and William Forsythe who make a childbirthlike escape from prison. Sam McMurray the smarmy dad in Drop Dead Gorgeous is H.I.'s....smarmy boss Glen. Frances McDormand reallife spouse of Joel Coen and star of other Coen films such as Blood Simple and Fargo is his excitable wife Dot. M. Emmet Walsh Blood Simple has a scenerychewing cameo role as H.I.'s talkative coworker.When Ed finally opens up her 5'2 can of Southernfried whupass throwing her badge to the dirt striding towards Leonard Smalls as she bellows with all her might Gimme back that baby you warthog from HELL!!! I always fling my arms up and shout You go girl! Kick his ass! And the way Hunter cries is hilarious.Holly Hunter was great in this role as one would expect. She's a very talented actress in both serious and comedic roles.Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter made a great on screen couple Cage with his hair standing out in every direction looking like a hapless browbeaten puppy half of the time and Hunter as his diminutive firecracker of a wife who loves him and tries to keep him honest oh yeah except for that little kidnapping excursion. I could go on and on about this film but suffice to say that so far I haven't met anyone who didn't find Raising Arizona hilarious. And as any great Coen brothers film it has a certain mythic quality that's hard to describe but is present all of of the brothers' best efforts. When I was single I often used Coen brothers films as a barometer of sorts for prospective boyfriends. For instance I remember seeing Fargo on a first date and when we came out of the theater the guy whose name I have since forgotten anyway remarked Huh I didn't think much of that while I was thinking how blown away I was by the film! I immediately thought to myself So much for him! This relationship won't last long.For more great Coen comedy check out Oh Brother Where Art Thou 2000 which is loosely based on Homer's epic poem The Odyssey. Another great Coen comedy is The Big Lebowski 1998 which also includes my favorite singersongwriter Aimee Mann in a brief cameo and boasts a cult following that has resulted in an annual Lebowskifest for fans of the film.Blood Simple 1984 is probably my favorite film noir modernday classic tale of lust and betrayal and is my personal secondfavorite Coen brothers film. Fargo 1996 which won the Screen writing Oscar and an Oscar for Frances McDormand is another mustsee Coen classic.".

It can go over the top as much as it wants and still it doesn't become bad. That's a great achievement only the Coen Brothers can do. Jim Carrey can't do it and neither can Mike Myers. At the same time this story is emotional and warming. How often do you see a combination like that. Joel and Ethan Coen often use the same actors and actresses. And they're right cause those who play in their films belong to Hollywoods very best. John Goodman Holly Hunter...and in this film Nicolas Cage !! Nic plays one of his best roles so far. Perhaps even THE best. Holly Hunter is great as always and this role fits her perfectly. I believe it was also written especially for her. No need to say John Goodman and William Forsythe give away flawless performances as well. Try also to pay attention to the rather small part played by Frances McDormand. Raising Arizona is about a criminal falling in love with a police woman. They wanna celebrate their love with a baby but they are unable to have one themselves. Than the news breaks! A rich couple in the area received quintets. 5 healthy young babies. Hi and Ed our couple think it's unfair and they decide to steal one of them so they could raise their own little family. Now the few lines I've wrote appear already in the intro of the movie. I can hear you think  with what else are the going to fill the movie. Well go and see. If you haven't seen this film yet it's a real shame. It's a must see for everyone!!! Some scenes are so hilarious you'll have trouble breathing I assure you. This film doesn't need stupid faces or teenager sex jokes to be funny.".

It is inspirational and detailed from start to finish. The movie is written and directed by the creators of Fargo Ethan and Joel Coen who not surprisingly have placed together a movie masterpiece featuring some really big laughs while still getting the powerful moral of the story across. The film stars Nicolas Cage as a criminal named H.I. who recently married a police officer named Ed Holly Hunter after meeting her in prison. The couple live in a lonely world with hope and dreams of having a kid until they find out that Ed can't have babiesleaving them no chance at ever fulfilling their dreams of having a child of their own some day.One afternoon however H.I. gets an idea he will kidnap one of the babies of the furniture salesman Nathan Arizona whose wife just had quintuplets. After all why would they miss just one child when he has that many?H.I. does this successfully and discretely. He and Ed are as happy as can be. Until some guilt begins to strike him when a 25000 reward is offered for whomever finds and brings back this child named Nathan Arizona  who is named after his loving father. Soon however H.I.'s old jailhouse friends Gale and Evelle break out of prison and cause uproar for him. Then a helmet warring biker from hell shows up causing even more trouble. After that there is an old neighbor enemy of his whom appears knowing his secret. Maybe the idea of raising Arizona wasn't such a good idea after all.The screenplay features some of the funniest moments in film history. The scenes enjoy the insanity of becoming a live action cartoon and a series of melodramatic happenings. One sequence in particular when HI robs a convenient story for Huggie's dippers for Nathan Jr. the filmmakers take advantage of the comedic situations involved with the circumstances here. It includes slapstick humor mixed with high energy and risky stakes as Cage is chased by gun happy policemen store clerks one two and then a dozen vicious dogs his wife and his morals in a exiting and hilarious adventure worth the watch all on its own. There are also several other funny moments in the movie.The performances are also to die for. Nicolas Cage known for a little heftier of roles is full of shimmer here. Such a robust flavor explodes from his juicy character. Holly Hunter is also bursting with comic parody. Her character is perfectly portrayed with the right amount of hostility and human understanding. John Goodman and William Forsythe are hilarious as the two prison escapees. Their exaggerated characters fit the film's comic tone flawlessly. Frances McDormand who was so good in the 1996 satire Fargo here is a little underplayed. Yes her performance fits her character's attitude and witty remarks but in general I think her role was too shallow considering  her ability. The ending of Raising Arizona consists of a daydream sequence from the mind of HI a character so hopeless and free spirited the empathy felt for him matches any character in any chosen movie.  The dream features a vision that takes place in the future where everything turns out to be okay for him and Ed. While I will not spoil what material it contains I will say that it closes the movie with a heartwarming conclusion and yet lets the mind wonder on. Raising Arizona may only be a zany screwball comedy but if you look deeper within its many laughs you'll find something more. A message that will stick with you for some time after the movie is over never give up hope. Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.".

There are also several other funny moments in the movie.The performances are also to die for. Nicolas Cage known for a little heftier of roles is full of shimmer here. Such a robust flavor explodes from his juicy character. Holly Hunter is also bursting with comic parody. Her character is perfectly portrayed with the right amount of hostility and human understanding. John Goodman and William Forsythe are hilarious as the two prison escapees. Their exaggerated characters fit the film's comic tone flawlessly. Frances McDormand who was so good in the 1996 satire Fargo here is a little underplayed. Yes her performance fits her character's attitude and witty remarks but in general I think her role was too shallow considering  her ability. The ending of Raising Arizona consists of a daydream sequence from the mind of HI a character so hopeless and free spirited the empathy felt for him matches any character in any chosen movie.  The dream features a vision that takes place in the future where everything turns out to be okay for him and Ed. While I will not spoil what material it contains I will say that it closes the movie with a heartwarming conclusion and yet lets the mind wonder on. Raising Arizona may only be a zany screwball comedy but if you look deeper within its many laughs you'll find something more. A message that will stick with you for some time after the movie is over never give up hope. Brought to you by 20th Century Fox.";

However when Nathan puts up a 25000 dollar reward to anyone who can successfully return his missing child back to him this gains the interest of several rather different parties...I watched this film this evening based on its rating and on its write up but other than that I knew very little about this film. However when watching this film I kept thinking that the film had a very Coen brothers type vibe to it and it came as little surprise when I saw their names rolling down the screen at the end of the film...Good or bad I'll say one thing for the Coen brothers and that is that they are rather unique filmmakers  the fact I identified this film as being one of theirs without researching it beforehand does prove that their quirky and somewhat unorthodox style does set them apart from the crowd. Despite this though Raising Arizona is still something of a weak offering...The tone is perhaps the biggest problem with this film they take a serious subject matter a couple being unable to conceive and turn it into some kind of goofball chase picture which unfortunately generates few laughs. I often find that the Coen brothers are better when they don't try so hard  THE BIG LEBOWSKI had a daft plot and was pretty stupid but it was hilarious and proved that the brothers could be funny as long as they didn't try too hard. On the other hand THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE was one of their more serious films but it had an engaging story and worked better because it was a straight story that the brothers played moreorless straight.Raising Arizona unfortunately brings out the worst in the Coen brothers in that it is loud crass and rather unfunny  they try to combine serious storytelling with goofball antics which simply doesn't work. Hunter and Cage do their best to make the film fun but as characters they don't evoke much in the way of sympathy and seem rather clichd and onedimensional. Having said that Raising Arizona does at least show that Cage could act a bit and at this point in his career he probably still cared about what films he appeared in. Hunter gives another sprightly performance and is far better than the picture itself. The only other strong performance comes from Trey Wilson and this film like Twins only acts a reminder to the great things that this man could have accomplished had his life not being cut so tragically short. So yes Raising Arizona has the Coen Brothers distinctive style all over it but sadly like a lot of their films I found this one disappointing unfunny and overrated. If you're a big Coen brothers fan then by all means watch it if you must but personally I would rather pull teeth than sit through this abomination again.".

The combination of this bearing the Coen stamp and being the first Cage film I'd seen since Adaptationin which he is dare I say it bearableassuaged my fears and allowed me to sit back with hope intact. The film's opening is rapid in pace though not too much of a fault it's a little distracting and feels a tad rushed but it's no serious problem.

Other than in the first half hour I genuinely don't think as much as a brief chuckle escaped my mouth. The characters are irritating underdeveloped uninteresting and uninvolving the bounty hunter biker caused me no end of sighs and wails of despair. I now remember if you'll permit me something of a tangential thought that I did in fact laugh twice once each for Frances McDormand and John Goodman both of whom are amongst the painfully few good things the film has to offer. Though that said the scene wherein Goodman emerges from mud vexed me with its silly shouting. As if I wasn't disappointed and disgusted enough with the film as a whole to return to things the ending is utterly revolting garbage which attempts in a most upsetting way to sanitise what has gone before with paintbynumbers sentiment. Simply infuriating.Raising Arizona you may have noticed was not quite for me. Almost entirely devoid of humour characters or any shred of likability it is a welcome edition to the Nic Cage canon. I think it possible that I'd have hated this less were it not a Coen Brothers filmnot that is to say that I'm the kind of person who decided that the brothers were the saviours of American cinema after seeing No Country for Old Mensimply that all I'd seen by them prior to this had been at least quite quite good. In summary do try to avoid this.".

I now remember if you'll permit me something of a tangential thought that I did in fact laugh twice once each for Frances McDormand and John Goodman both of whom are amongst the painfully few good things the film has to offer. Though that said the scene wherein Goodman emerges from mud vexed me with its silly shouting. As if I wasn't disappointed and disgusted enough with the film as a whole to return to things the ending is utterly revolting garbage which attempts in a most upsetting way to sanitise what has gone before with paintbynumbers sentiment. Simply infuriating.Raising Arizona you may have noticed was not quite for me. Almost entirely devoid of humour characters or any shred of likability it is a welcome edition to the Nic Cage canon. I think it possible that I'd have hated this less were it not a Coen Brothers filmnot that is to say that I'm the kind of person who decided that the brothers were the saviours of American cinema after seeing No Country for Old Mensimply that all I'd seen by them prior to this had been at least quite quite good. In summary do try to avoid this.";

	schema:headline " One of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard of Raising Arizona I was 8 years old. I was spending a weekend with my dad and it was on a Friday night. Usually when I see a movie for the first time on television I either direct my attention to the screen to see what it is or direct my attention to something that I was doing. I came in right in the middle of the movie and I didn't know what it was about and I certainly didn't understand the concept behind it. But I do remember laughing and having a good time while watching this movie. Now looking back on it it still makes me laugh even harder and longer.The story centers around a convictloser named H.I. McDunnough Nicholas Cage. His friends called him Hi. For the last several years Hi has been robbing convenience stores and ending up in the slammer. After three times Hi decides to go straight. He seeks the attraction of a pretty cop named Edwina Ed McDunnough Holly Hunter. Soon after Hi and Ed get married. But there's just one problem. They want to raise a family. So the couple decides to keep trying. But according to a local gynecologist Ed is infertile meaning that she can't have kids. According to Hi's perspective he can't plant his seed into Ed. Hopeless the couple decides to steal one of the Arizona quints. One night Hi and Ed steal one of the quints from a very wealthy businessman Sam McMurray who owns a furniture store in Arizona.As the movie progresses the humor starts to kick in when the local police and the F.B.I. conduct a manhunt on the missing quint. Meanwhile two prisoners John Goodman and William Forsythe escaped from prison and take shelter in Hi's home. But the two prisoners want Hi to go along with them to pull off a heist. While that is going another character comes walking into the story. An deranged and hellish lone motorcycle driver Randall 'Tex' Cobb enters the story through Hi's dreams and his job is to find the quint and find the people who stole him. You can see that the movie is quite ambitious for its own kind. To tell you the truth it is. This is the first comedy being made by the always entertaining moviemaking duo Joel and Ethan Coen. Their movies never ceased to amaze me. They have really carved out a reputation of movie making with their witty scripts and their zany approach to a story. What surprises me is that this movie is actually their first comedy. Before the Coen brothers made Raising Arizona they wrote and direct a very dark and violent neonoir film Blood Simple which was released three earlier. This is quite surprising because Blood Simple was a very serious and sometimes bloody film that had a lot of twists and turns in it.Here it's a change of pace. How they were to pull this one off is something that strikes me dumb. Watching the movie I found myself laughing more than ever since I now understand the themes involved. One of the funniest scenes that I saw and it is the most significant one is when Cage's character robs a convenience store and disguised himself by putting pantyhose on his head. This plan doesn't since his wife leaves him behind having him deal with the triggerhappy clerk and the police. The chase goes all over the place with Cage being chased by the clerk the police and a pack of dogs. Even in the middle of the chase Cage is even given a lift with an screaming hayseed driver. The way the chase sequence is shot makes it seems that the chase is being played as a cartoon. Maybe that's why the scene made me laugh the first time around. It's that sense of wacko humor that generates a laugh out of the audience. Not only the film's humor made me laugh but toward the end of the movie there's a bittersweet sense that ties the movie together with the characters trying hard to have a family.The writing by the brothers is very funny and even the performances by Cage Hunter Goodman and even Forsthye are excellent. I did believe that Nicholas Cage was really Hi. The fact that he sports a mustache and a dopey appearance when he is getting his mugshot done is very funny and also interesting. I'm not really a big fan of comedies because most of them are done pretty badly and never seem to hit me with their humor. That is true in today's movies. In today's movies you can get away with everything. You can get a kick out of a audience that admired slapstick humor or bathroom humor. I understand that perspective. But I enjoyed watching comedies that have funny dialogue in it. i believe that if you can make an audience laugh out loud with the dialogue then that can be funny alone. The Coen brothers know how to generate a laugh out of the audience with their style of writing.Even in the today world the Coen brothers are still going strong. Last year they written and directed the Oscarnominated picture Inside Llewyn Davis. The brothers seem to really be shifting gears according to the genres. They can frightened you and tantalizes you with Blood Simple. They can make you laugh with Raising Arizona. They can compel you with Miller's Crossing. And they can jolt you with The Big Lebowski. I wonder what they're going to do next.  12 3 12 stars.".

Its not cliche in this instance to say its not whats being said thats so funny but how it is being said.  By fully exploiting the heretofore under utilized treasure that is American English the Coens reintroduced mainstream cinema to the screenplay. The rest is pretty damn good too. Its affably off kilter like every Coen venture Cage and even Hunter are superb the supporting cast even better. Must see.".

	schema:headline " A very entertaining prequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Death Race was many miles away from reaching the same levels of black humor and intelligence from the original Death Race 2000 but it nevertheless kept me entertained mainly thanks to its main actor and the violent automotive sequences. And even though there did not seem to be too much material for a sequel the studio Universal did not vacillate to exploit the home market with Death Race 2 released straighttoDVD. Strictly speaking this is not a sequel but a prequel something which allows a better distribution of the low budget with which it was made. That's the reason why Death Race 2 leaves the stunts for the ending with one exception while it skilfully uses the first hour to establish the origin of the death races as well as the motivations from the villains and the antihero. And I have to say that the final result is a very entertaining experience.The premise from Death Race 2 avoided to become into a simple rehash of Death Race. I particularly liked to see the fact that the hero is not an unfairly accused martyr nor he is trying to prove his innocence. The main character voluntarily participated in a crime with disastrous consequences and his conviction in the jail is justified that is the way in which the cruelty from the real villains is accentuated because their total lack of conscience is not illegal...just lucrative. Talking about the villains the cover from the DVD prominently mentions the presence from the excellent actors Sean Bean and Ving Rhames. Unfortunately my expectations of seeing them interpreting main characters was unfounded because they both interpret supporting characters who are not seen involved in the action. That is a pity because that leaves Luke Goss as the main actor by default and he is a bit insipid and not very charismatic in his role. I would have undoubtedly preferred to have seen Bean or Rhames in that role.Despite Goss' weak performance I enjoyed Death Race 2 pretty much because of the screenplay Roel Rein's dynamic direction and the delirious scenes of action violence and big explosions. Those sequences are very exciting and well filmed.In conclusion Death Race 2 is a very competent action film with which I took a pleasant surprise and I recommend it if you are looking for having an exciting and very entertaining time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Be honest was the 2008 Death Race film itself a remake of the 1975 B movie Death Race 2000 actually avant garde cinema? No it was not! It was a loud visceral simple action movie all style little substance in the grand Paul WS Anderson tradition. This cheap direct to video prequel not a sequel as the Death Race 2 title might seem to imply is just more of the same. Heck even the main characters looks the same only with different names.Now fans of the 2008 crash and burn thrill ride of a movie are in for a treat here. In Death Race 2 we discover the origins of the dangerous game how it went from a simple prison fight caught on camera to full blown TV ratings dependent gladiatorial combat and then to boost ratings the brutal Death Race. Anybody remember the cool sounding masked Driver Frankenstein who appeared at the beginning of 2008's Death Race? Well here is his origin story too. Before he became the famous Frankenstein Carl Lucas Luke Goss was a getaway car driver for a crime boss Markus Kane Sean bean. A heist gone wrong landed Carl a life sentence at Terminal island penitentiary a prison famous for its broadcasts of Death Match. With ratings of Death Match plummeting one of the organizers September Jones witnesses Carl's driving skills and decides to revamp the games into Death Race. Nine cars three rounds five wins to freedom. The no holds barred carnage has just begun. As Carl puts his skills to the test his former boss is planning his death and he has someone on the inside to do it.Sound familiar? To say that the writers were lazy is an understatement. They basically took the exact same character types from the 2008 film and changed their names to be new characters. In other words we got all the uninspired lines one dimensional and slightly racist characterization and minimal character development of the original show but none of the star power the likes of Jason Stratham and Tyrese Gibson. Star power alone was what made the original character bearable and now with that gone they are not as interesting to watch. Fans would recognize Robin shou and Frederick Koehler reprising their roles of 14K and Lists.The main attraction here has always been the cars and the carnage. Despite having less than one third of the budget of Paul WS Anderson's 2008 film Death Race 2 does a wonderful job of replicating all the excitement and adrenaline of the races. Perhaps too good a job as some scenes look 100 copied and pasted from that film complete with similar camera angles same chain of events and even similar lines of dialog. The cars themselves and the sets do not look as well designed as its predecessor but remember this took place before the 2008 film and as such cars get rebuilt and the place gets upgraded as the days go by.With the target audience being those who loved the brainless 2008 Death Race Death Race 2 delivers no more than what they expect. If you thought its predecessor was bad Death Race 2 would not change that impression. It is fun it is violent it is a glorified B movie just like Roger Corman's DeathRace 2000 and Paul WS Anderson's remake and it is surprisingly well shot for a directtovideo film. Definitely worth at least a rental but do familiarize yourself with the 2008 movie before jumping into this.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS BELOWAfter reading the posted reviews I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie except that as opposed to being a Sequel this movie actually is a Prequel to the Jason Statham Death Race of 2008. On the front IMDb page for DR2 is says An origin story for convicted cop killer Frankenstein.So by the time I sat down to watch the movie although confused by the contradicting reviews I assumed the movie was a prequel thus Technically misnamed. Or should I say Misleadingly Named? Perhaps Death Race The Beginning or something like that would have been better?Some reviews I had read stated the producersdirector of the movie tried to hard to make this films lead Carl Luke Lucas played by Luke Goss look like Jason Statham in the '08 Remake. Thinking back to that movie I remember Stathams Character was chosen to become Frankenstein because he was as of similar fit and build or he looked like Frankenstein. So if you're doing a movie explaining where Frankenstein came from started wouldn't it make sense to do this?Another review I read said DR2 never even mentions Frankenstein. While most of the movie doesn't have that character the point of the movie is about how Lucas becomes Frankenstein. In my opinion the back story of Carl Lucas the getaway driver then copkiller then Death Match contestant then Death Race Driver then Frankenstein is whole point to making this movie.The movie explains 1. Why Death Race is a hit Webcast as seen in Death Race.2008 Good old Television now Internet Rating points. Think Violence Sells. 2. How something like this was accepted by the general public as entertainment. 3. Where certain characters like 14K and Lists to name two got involved in the series. 4. Why female prisoners are used in the series. Although not expressly pointed out by the movie they are for the Eye Candy value of the viewer. See number 1 above. Think Sex Sells.5. Why Carl Lucas was sent to prison Killed and reborn as Frankenstein. 6. Even why Frankenstein Drives a Mustang.Obviously this movie didn't have the budget of the remake but with the exception of the the beginning of the movies sound editing it did an outstanding job of telling the story it was made to do. The acting was better than I expected the story as told on screen a little weak but still understandable and got the point across. I questioned some obvious plot holes as they occurred then remembered much like the remake I was watching part movie part prerecorded WebCast. Even though it was supposed to be a Live WebCast it was shown to have parts prerecorded.Over all I felt this movie made Death Race '08 a better movie. As I re watch DR the normal Why are they doing this? Wonder why Hennessey is so evil? and so on is answered. It fills in the questions I have towards the movie. Which is what I feel this movie was Supposed to be.".

On the front IMDb page for DR2 is says An origin story for convicted cop killer Frankenstein.So by the time I sat down to watch the movie although confused by the contradicting reviews I assumed the movie was a prequel thus Technically misnamed. Or should I say Misleadingly Named? Perhaps Death Race The Beginning or something like that would have been better?Some reviews I had read stated the producersdirector of the movie tried to hard to make this films lead Carl Luke Lucas played by Luke Goss look like Jason Statham in the '08 Remake. Thinking back to that movie I remember Stathams Character was chosen to become Frankenstein because he was as of similar fit and build or he looked like Frankenstein. So if you're doing a movie explaining where Frankenstein came from started wouldn't it make sense to do this?Another review I read said DR2 never even mentions Frankenstein. While most of the movie doesn't have that character the point of the movie is about how Lucas becomes Frankenstein. In my opinion the back story of Carl Lucas the getaway driver then copkiller then Death Match contestant then Death Race Driver then Frankenstein is whole point to making this movie.The movie explains 1. Why Death Race is a hit Webcast as seen in Death Race.2008 Good old Television now Internet Rating points. Think Violence Sells. 2. How something like this was accepted by the general public as entertainment. 3. Where certain characters like 14K and Lists to name two got involved in the series. 4. Why female prisoners are used in the series. Although not expressly pointed out by the movie they are for the Eye Candy value of the viewer. See number 1 above. Think Sex Sells.5. Why Carl Lucas was sent to prison Killed and reborn as Frankenstein. 6. Even why Frankenstein Drives a Mustang.Obviously this movie didn't have the budget of the remake but with the exception of the the beginning of the movies sound editing it did an outstanding job of telling the story it was made to do. The acting was better than I expected the story as told on screen a little weak but still understandable and got the point across. I questioned some obvious plot holes as they occurred then remembered much like the remake I was watching part movie part prerecorded WebCast. Even though it was supposed to be a Live WebCast it was shown to have parts prerecorded.Over all I felt this movie made Death Race '08 a better movie. As I re watch DR the normal Why are they doing this? Wonder why Hennessey is so evil? and so on is answered. It fills in the questions I have towards the movie. Which is what I feel this movie was Supposed to be.";

	schema:reviewBody "DEATH RACE 2 is a surprisingly entertaining little straighttovideo sequel to the Jason Statham starrer itself a remake of a Roger Corman cult classic of the 1970s. I'd even go so far as to say this is as much fun as the first film although it has only a fraction of the budget and only one returning cast member as far as I can tell. For DEATH RACE 2 captives the vibrant adrenalinefuelled spirit of the first film and Dutch director Roel Reine himself a veteran of a dozen Bmovies proves to be a better director than Paul W. S. Anderson.To be sure this is far from a great film and it falls down particularly in regard to the actors all of whom are illserviced by their parts. Luke Goss is nothing more than a domeheaded dunderhead an obvious standin for Statham but one that lacks that actor's trademark intensity and scowl. Lauren Cohan fares little better as an overlyobvious arrogant journalist type while Danny Trejo has virtually nothing to do in the stock role of car mechanic. The two big names present in the cast Sean Bean and Ving Rhames are particularly wasted given roles which require them to sit around and do absolutely nothing else. Each has about five minutes screen time tops.Still the screenplay is packed with violent incident which is always good and I like the way the smaller budget is disguised by having combatant vs. combatant fights early on instead of car chases. There's only one real chase here towards the end which is pretty decent although I could have done without the laborious twist in which it turns out thatwell you'll have to watch it for yourself to find out. Even with the many detractions DEATH RACE 2 is a Bmovie done right with all of the highoctane action you could hope for.".

This ActionThriller made for little budget in South Africa features some fine Actors Sean Bean Luke Goss and some well known faces like Danny Trejo and Ving Rhames. Its a veritable cast and they seem to have some genuine enthusiasm for the material. Sean Bean is credible as the slimy Mob Lord and delivers a fine performance reminiscent of his Bad GuyCharacter in Bay's THE ISLAND. A bit strange is the late introduction of the titular Death Race itself but we get to see how the Game evolved from a primitive Cagematch to the brutal Race we got to know in the first part. Thankfully the dutch director Roel Rein knows how to keep the story going and interesting. There is a lot of back story and dirty corporate politics going on which is handled nicely. Some inspiration can be traced from the sleazy Capitalism portrayed in the classic Robocop and its evil Company OCP spliced with modern Reality TV Sensationalism. It works rather well and YES I think the storytelling in DEATH RACE 2 is more solid than in the W.S. AndersonOriginal Yeah I know its a CormanRemake. Definitely worth a watch and I'm looking forward to DR3. If the Producers are smart they keep the Director he has a talent for tight brutal and exciting ExploitationCinema. Thumbs up!".

But it is a shame that we all know how it ended for Luke he dies in the first part of Death Race. Danny Trejo played a decent role as the crew chief but I would have rather seen him smashing someones brains in. The double storyline is well executed Luke tries to race is way out of prison and his former boss wants to kill him. It is great that one of his crewmen tries to kill him if he did not try it the whole storyline was unconvincing. Allinall a pretty good movie about love crime and auto racing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay first of all why did the world need a prequel to the 2008 movie Death Race which was a remake of the classic 1975 movie Death Race aka. Death Race 2000. This 2010 prequel was rubbish.First of all let's break it down into bits. The story  total rip off of the 2008 version. Nothing new to be seen here and in fact there were so many similarities to the 2008 version that it was just painfully embarrassing to look at. Made you wonder if the producer of this sequel was upset about not making he 2008 version so he just copied that one and changed bits here and there.Then of course there were the mistakes in the movie. The woman states there are 9 cars and the prisoners rush and fight each other to get to the cars fair enough. And remember this is supposed to be on live TV. Yet for some magical reason the producers had managed to create these segments with the drivers and the cars they were in sort of presentations of the car and whose driving them. Wow what a ridiculous mistake that was. I laughed so hard when they started to flash these sequences. It was an epic fail.Now don't get me wrong. The movie wasn't all bad. There was a lot of action and explosions in the movie but it hardly made it worth the effort of sitting through it. Death Race 2 is nothing more than a cheap rip off of the 2008 Death Race movie.A sad sad day for movie history. If you liked the 1975 or 2008 versions stay well clear of this 2010 version trust me. I am sure Death Race 2 will appeal to new viewers but for those having seen one or both of the previous movies this is a slap in the face.Even with names like Danny Trejo Sean Bean Ving Rhames Robin Shou and Luke Goss on the cast list this movie fails to impress. And how these people agreed to do this movie is beyond me. Haven't they seen the 2008 version? Didn't they read the script? Didn't they catch on to how much of a knock off of the 2008 version this was going to be?I must say that this movie was a major disappointment and in my opinion the movie shouldn't have seen the light of day.".

Unfortunately this does do anything else then make your head dizzy. It is so obvious that the cars are driving incredibly slow. This manes that the main theme of this film Cars and driving. So 5 minutes in to the film the backbone is already broken. Another thing that ruins the driving is the sound. Most of the cars are roaring v8's but most of the time they sound like a 16L Honda civic with a turbo. The actors does an acceptable job. Sure none of them play particularly well but none of them play badly neither. The voices of the actors are in some scenes obviously captured inside a studio and this really makes the actors seem a lot less believable. My conclusion is that you should stay away from this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard there will be a sequel to Death Race 2008 version I was a bit excited since I enjoyed watching the first one. But than later I found out that this would be a direct to DVD release which got me disappointed. I guess the first movie didn't do so well at box office cause if it did do well I am sure the sequel would have hit theaters and would have had a way bigger budget. Budget for a movie doesn't show how good or hot bad it is in some cases but for a movie like this it needed the extra budget. Everything just looked way too cheap if they just didn't have the budget to make at least a decent sequel they shouldn't have tried in the first place. I liked the original Frankenstein from the first movie although that scene with him was very short he still had charisma and seemed like a cool character with a cool voice and this is from just the first few minutes from the first movie. In this movie Frankenstein lacked the cool voice he had in the first movie and didn't have that big of a charisma. The acting is also bad and the stupidity in this movie gets irritating to watch. The slow motion sequences in this movie was just ultra lame as well. On a bit of a positive note it had few decent scenes that had it's moment which is why I am giving this movie a 4.8. And because it's a straight to DVD movie so being a bit lenient.4.810".

They even tried to make Luke Goss look like Statham it was sad to watch no wonder this rubbish has gone straight to Video  it made me cringe to watch it.I like Danny Trejo he is a mean SOB but he looked like he sold out for the money in this rubbish  he wasn't even acting.Sean Bean was embarrassing to watch his ridiculous Northern English accent and the over the top behaviour  when he tries to break the flat screen TV was hilarious he could barely lift it! What was the point?

Sean Bean is one of my favourite actors since his role in National Treasures but again he didn't do a great job in this movie partly to blame is the script. I watch a ton of B grade movies so I'm used to crappy scripts  acting but it's still good for killing a couple free hours time if you liked the original's unique take on prison based story lines mixed with a bit of high octane.".

The film has some good action sequences that are quite brutal yet funny and entertaining specifically one scene with Danny Trejo. Death Race 2 follows the same formula within the plot as Death Race but they change a few things. Death Race 2 isn't as good as Death Race because of the story the action sequence and stunts and the chemistry between the leads aren't as good as in Death Race. I was expected more.

Everything else from acting to script to storyline was amateur and weak. For starters the chase scene at the beginning of the film was badly choreographed. One could see what they were trying to do with it but it was a complete failure. Throughout the film there some wonderfully large explosions and some OK slow motion camera but they were undermined by their overuse making the audience wonder more at their stupidity then their grandeur.The acting was complete tripe. Even Sean Bean had little to nothing of an impact on screen. Frankenstein played by Luke Goss had a tough act to follow after Death Race 1. He looked pitiful compared to Jason Statham. Moreover I don't think i've ever cringed some much in the space of 90 minutes. The script was extremely corny and clich. I couldn't take anyone seriously. The storyline was similar to that of the prequel except a lot worse and the first wasn't great. Its development was unrealistic and there were countless plot holes. For example the prison allows the inmates to fix old beat up cars highly unlikely but i'll buy for now. Carl Luke Goss is then assigned with a crew to this vehicle repair workshop or whatever its mean to be. What really killed it though was when Carl first arrives in the workshop. He's given the keys to a some banged up car the crew had just fixed and then drives out of a conveniently open door you know taking it out for a quick spin around the prison as people do. While he's driving around the public relations journalist lady of the prison happens to see him She looks at him and thinks ahh what a great idea why don't we let criminals drive around killing each other for the entertainment the people! And thus the idea of death Race is born. Lame.As i stated earlier if you enjoy watching grown men more specifically criminals fight it out to the death actually rather entertaining or find pleasure in watching a movie for its last 5 minutes then this is the film for you cos don't worry the producers don't bother us with the inconvenience of good acting script or storyline its all rather simple these days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I start let me just say that I should have liked this movie I really should. The remake which this is the sequel for was an great little 'leave your brain at the door sit down and buckle up' movie. This however is just bad and not just in a could have been better but in a could hardly have been much worse kind of way. I can see what the producer has tried to do. Take a successful movie copy the format but don't spend very much money on cast or plot. From what I can tell two members of the original cast those playing List and K14 I cant be bothered checking up the actors names reprise their roles but add next to nothing to their respective characters. The other characters are almost carbon copies of those from the original film. You have the white shaved head pretty boy Luke Goss in for Statham the big black man the white supremacist the ice maiden pulling the strings the craggy weather worn mechanic Trejo replacing Mcshane the sexy female prisoner and the Mexican i assuming here as his screen time last about 30 seconds as he's introduced and then killed. The plot is dreadful full of holes but still tries to explain the origin of the original Frankenstein who dies at the start of the remake. As a result the cars don't turn up in the movie until almost an hour in. This hour is filled with some poor set pieces with lots of slow mo. I would just like to take this moment to let the director know that in my opinion slow mo doesn't give the film an element of class or sophistication but just takes up running time. There are exceptions however with filmmakers such as John Woo and Peckenpah who use it to accentuates the violence and not use it as some cheap art trick. None of the set pieces have that 'wow' factor seen in the remake when the big artic turns up. The fights are poor and appear clumsy but this is more a case that the bar has been raised so high with fighters from previous years that this film really struggles. Plot holes are plenty my favourite if that is the right word to use is how they managed to change a 69 fastback Shelby mustang into a 200910 Shelby. Some will argue that they would have got a new one but they clearly explain that everything they will need is already on the island but using a '69 so prominently as a plot tool was a massive error. Okay maybe thats a little anal but it still annoyed me and just don't get me started on the moment a car manages to keep a missle behind like a scene from Top Gun. The acting is pretty grim as well. Luke Goss who was really rather good in Blade 2 just cannot match Captain Cardboard himself Jason Statham and is throughly unconvincing. Sorry Luke but that accent was shocking as well. Trejo is well Trejo take from that what you will Ving Rhames just phones it in as the mogul in charge or Ceasar as he calls himself at one point and what the hell is Sean Bean doing? This man can act he has proved it time and time again? Here he's playing a crimeboss caught between the loyalty of a friend and the loyalty of his wallet. I though his worst film was the Hitcher not anymore its not. The sound design is dreadful worse than Die Hard 4 with many notable moments when the lips don't synch and the sound effects and music appear rehashed from the first film. I could go on and if I were down the pub with you I probably would. If you want 100mins of auto carnage with a stupid story that will leave you content at the end just rewatch the Statham film you'd feel much better about yourself.".

In a way the characters are archetypes representing sexual freedom generosity and social consideration intellectual expansiveness instead of reductionism atheism naturalistic identification communality in spirit stoicism etc but I find identification with the characters easy. But it is not Utopian the consequences for generosity of spirit in a greedy context are dramatized in the story of imprisonment and persecution. As with all good politics the underlying message is not a mere power squabble but a reflection on cosmic order what the right tends to call spiritual concerns. The inflowing of people into the energy of the birth of Jonas and the disintegration of that unity after the event has transpired makes Jonas... a profoundly philosophic and satisfying story.

But the film chewed on heaps of intriguing controversial issues of the time  many lines taken directly from Octavio Paz and Pablo Neruda  which continue to stir emotion in any thinking feeling individual.  The film is also personal full of heart and full of intellectual stimulation.  It's melancholic and nostalgic yet wistfully optimistic.

	schema:headline " Thought provoking Cinma vrit critique of capitalism";
	schema:reviewBody "The end titles somewhat cheekily credit Jean Piaget and Jean Jacques Rousseau among others but Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 has neither the philosophical heft nor the dry tone of the work of such thinkers. Instead the film attempts to give its viewer a new perspective on contemporary society by portraying characters from various social strata and their failure to reconcile their idealistic outlooks with the harsh reality of a capitalist system. The film is structured as a series of disjointed scenes that gradually reveal a number of loosely connected narrative strands. Perhaps the most affecting strand is the one about Marie a grocery store checkout girl who gives away as much food as she sells. Although some of her gifts to customers seem arbitrary she also makes it a point to help elderly people with small pensions. Like several other characters Marie herself is stuck with a menial job even though she seems to be capable of something more challenging and fulfilling. She even has to live in one country and work in another due to a scarcity of employment. Of course her behavior is inevitably noticed and it garners her a harsh punishment. The same happens to an honest teacher who attempts to impart lessons about the failings of the capitalist way of life to high school children and to a lesser degree to the environmentalists who attempt to run an organic farm. The technical aspects of the film are fairly well handled although some of director Alain Tanner's choices were puzzling. He frequently splices in real life footage and he also switches to brief monochrome shots at fairly arbitrary intervals. This seems to have been an attempt to add a Cinma vrit feel to the venture but whatever the reason for its implementation it often falls flat. Still there are some strangely affecting images here particularly in the bicycle sequence that incorporates some of the film's only landscape shots to make the human built structures appear forlorn and dingy against the natural backdrop. Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000 is captivating but uneven thought provoking but not profound.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film of rare spiritual beauty that deals with themes both universal and domestic Swiss. Universal in the focus on the relationship of an individual to democratic society and its supposed freedoms and the fallout from failed revolutions of 1968 in France Mexico and Czechoslovakia crushing of the Prague Spring in the year of the assassination of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and of antiVietnam war protests. Domestic in the issues it raises about the rights of crossborder workers in Switzerland recurrent from Tanner's 1974 film Le milieu du monde the ghost of the Geneva Massacre of socialist protesters in 1932 by the Swiss Army of the contradiction of a prosperous though backwards country where female suffrage was achieved at a federal level only in 1971.The film follows eight individuals whose names all begin with the letter M who are not happy following the Pied Piper of Hamelin and seek different ways to express that whether that is in looking to withdraw from society sabotage it or develop an alternative. They show a society that puts its foot on your neck if you fail to play along and sleepwalk the path laid out for you through school and the workplace. There's thatchhaired Marie played by actress MiouMiou who performs individual acts of covert defiance at her supermarket job her boyfriend MarxistLeninist teacher Marco chockfull of enthusiasm and desire to help people be happy and grow Madeleine who seeks an internal retreat via her interest in Vama Marga tantra her preferred partner for this realisation Max who performs acts of capital sabotage on a larger level a disillusioned 1968er who was in a group but now acts unilaterally buzzardheaded Mathieu who sets up an alternative school for children and performs menial jobs perhaps the closest of them to a true proletarian Marxist his wife Mathilde a happy mother and lover compared to a kindly whale finally their farmhouse hosts animalloving biophilosophiser Marcel and his farmer's wife Marguerite who seems to have a secret life as a prostitute.The individuals are for revolution but Tanner makes it clear that they're not interested in the authoritarian outcome from the USSR so archive footage of missilefetishisation parades are spliced in. The ultimate point is that the chance to change society for the better in 1968 was a once in an era possibility and that the 70s folk have to wait for future generations to have a chance. The note at the end of the film for me however sounded pessimistically we failed to brake what is now a runaway train.The most beautiful moment for me was when Marcel describes the singing of birds at dawn how people don't hear things like that anymore and have built walls of silence around themselves unable to hear the world turning selfobsessed and desolate. I think that although it's taboo in the west to be anything other than bullheadedly proud of the way we live nowadays there are still many people who are forced to live inside their heads and neurosis along with mental illness is widespread. This insideliving is shown in the movie by transitions to black and white images that show wish fulfilment. The inmates in this film are only ever fleetingly fulfilled.My heart was broken before even the first shot in the movie rolled by the piano solo from JeanMarie Snia playing over the opening credits full of present drudgery and faraway hope that is perfectly tailored for the movie.The movie is actually very subtle what's easy to pass by is that there's quite a lot of conflict between the members of the group Marxist Mathieu would like to be able to examine the farm's books so that he understands how much profit it is making and what would be a fair wage for him however his asking that and Marguerite agreeing to it is in one of those black and white fantasy segments  the farm is very much not a commune Mathieu sits at the same table but is fundamentally labour Max is very belittling about his girlfriend Madeleine's tantra there's Marguerite's illicit prostitution which her husband is totally fooled by her secrecy he thinks is something mysterious and beautiful and towards the end Marco suggests that Mathilde's child be named Marie who has been jailed and the others don't even clock who he's referring to. Perhaps if one were to look at the film blackly the characters are stubborn lacking the ability to fit in to go with the flow.".

The sum of events in time we call history.Tanner's whole film is a complex example of how all these 68er people now in a postrevolutionary confusion try to understand the structure of time and their own position in it. Social critique philosophy is always existentialism not on the trivial reason that a society consists of individuals but because Being differs from existence by including the component of time into reflection. Since time cannot be structured by an individual alone conflicts emerge and conflicts are usually solved with fights and battles  as we know from history. However a society in which conflicts can be analyzed into theses and antitheses in order to be neutralized in syntheses would be a society that is conscious that history starts with a metaphysics of time  as taught in the movie by Marcel.

Seventies were a golden age of cinema I believe  not as naive as sixties already not yet too commercialised as eighties. Directors had an opportunity of discussing profound questions and taking their time to do it. The movie is not a bit outdated and it never will. Tanner is a genius of drawing a picture of ordinary people everyday lives through which an eternal light shines. It's true to the core  a real art. A movie that makes you better.".

It's like a flower blooming I enjoyed every moment of it  because it's about life and eternal questions and existence. Seventies were a golden age of cinema I believe  not as naive as sixties already not yet too commercialised as eighties. Directors had an opportunity of discussing profound questions and taking their time to do it. The movie is not a bit outdated and it never will. Tanner is a genius of drawing a picture of ordinary people everyday lives through which an eternal light shines. It's true to the core  a real art. A movie that makes you better.";

It's like watching a European Charlie Chaplin or Woody Allen. Plus the girls are sexy and I don't mean the kind of sexy that makes you turn your head I mean the kind of sexy that blows your eyes out of their sockets!!! I don't know much about directing but the movie seems to have a nice natural rhythm. You know how a lot of films feel choppy or sloppy? Not this one. It's really great. It's also cool because it makes fun of Hollywood which is like Hollywood making fun of itself. Right? So check this one out I guarantee you'll love it!".

He sure didn't sound like one.  At any rate it was funny and I thought that it was really well written.  I especially found the guy who played the director's younger brother really good.

Rather sadly there are some stupid inconsistencies in the script especially in the dialog that could have been easily avoided by a careful revision.But in spite of all this I must say that commercial filmmaking  that is only reinventing itself nowadays  in Hungary has produced a nice watchable comedy that is not annoying at all despite all its clichs and its cartoonish characters.In fact Hungarian commercial filmmaking seems to have found its voice at last. After some highly successful movies in the Nineties that looked back on the years of communism with a mixture of nostalgia and irony Sose halunk meg Csinibaba and recently the modernized remakes of two Thirties blockbusters Hippolyt Meseaut this is a last a film that talks about this young successful Budapest people of today. This is probably the secret of its success it features a simple story that is not very realistic but with which on can well identify some nice ideas these days it seems to be the ultimate laughgetter in comedies everywhere these days that an older conservative petitbourgeois person gets high on cannabis products by accident  this scene is very funnily played by Ila Schtz and especially good directing costume and set design and believable actors that seem to have fun bringing a human side to their often quite clichd characters. I would especially point out Eszter nodi's touching performance.Though the story and the characters themselves are nothing new the scriptwriters and the director have nevertheless managed to give the whole environment a feeling of authenticity there is not a single scene where you would think though most situations are exaggerated and overdrawn that a situation like this could never happen in Hungary in an environment like this. It is probably this feel yes this is what life is like in Budapest today that has made the movie such a huge success.Though definitely a popcorn movie it is nevertheless worth watching because it captures the approach to life of a certain group of young Budapest people of their hopes and dreams. It is also an example that a commercial film industry has started to establish itself in Hungary that is well able to create successful movies on its own aimed to a Hungarian public that has up to now to be satisfied with Hollywood flicks. These Hungarian commercial films are of course not at all of higher artistic quality than their Hollywood counterparts but they are closer to their own public and thus have good chances of capturing their attention and interest. This may also help to recreate a market for Hungarian films that has been lost after the fall of Communism and ameliorate the image of Hungarian filmmaking.".

The scene in which the camouflaged boss dreamed about the modern world is unbelievably superb.

The boss then had a recurring nightmare or a trauma something that might be subtle but within all of us.What's so great about this movie is that it parodies many aspect of our lives with seemingly stupid and childish approaches so successfully that I can't help laughing at ourselves!".

If one day you come back from work feeling your brain cannot take it any more  watch this.

The title seemed ... promising... and the film itself turned out to be even better! I'd have to agree with whomever commented before saying that it resembles the Monty Python type of humor which it does very much so actually... Take the starting scene for instance in which the Voice Over tells the dramatic story of a certain American battalion which fought heroically on the 973rd hill in Vietnam whatever that means!!! while gun fire and bombs are heard in the background... he then announces that this film DOESN'T tell that story!!! I would only recommend RRRrrr to those who enjoy absurd humor and who have good knowledge of French. Otherwize you'd end up not getting half the jokes in the film!!! The most relevant example in this case would be the Nous sommes a l'Age de Pierre joke... In no other language would that make any sense or be funny!!!The fact that Gerard Depardieu is playing in this film is clearly out of marketing reasons. I'm sure that a lot of people went to see RRRrrr because it had an Alain Chabat label but I bet even more went for Gerard Depardieu! This film brings a fresh fun look to Stoneage movies in a quite Mel Brooksish way but without the singing and dancing... dealing with a wide range of absurdities from Why would any human kill another human? to... being in a Carrefour anyone's nightmare!!!.It's remarkable how Alain Chabat masters lighting in this film... one second the mood is pessimistic dark gruesome when talking about the murder and the next second  with no cuts!  it's sunny and bright and everybody quits the investigation and hits the playground for a match of beach volleyball!!! one has to see to believe!Well I wouldn't want to spoil the fun of this movie so my next comment will be WATCH IT...

There are so many gags and jokes in the film that it is generally okay to not pay attention to the plot although the 300 year war over the secret of shampoo is quite clever. My particular favourite is the investigation of the first murder I've got it. She died of old age but young. Apart from that there is also the idea of giving the animals tusks thus ending their names with moth horsemoth bearmoth hippopotamoth etc and the film's beginning.

Even at the end the silence continued. Than my husband broke it saying Man what a good movie was that! The story and the pictures are very intense. They catch the viewer's whole attention which you can hardly escape.The topic of the movie is rape. It's about guilt and atonement.About law morals and justice.In a today's criticism I read the sentence Sometimes it is the start of a movie that gives rise to doubts. In One Way the movie of the Swiss Reto Salimbini a girl is followed by several men and raped brutally as a black figure wearing a uniform Michael Clareke Duncan appears and butchers the wrongdoers with a machine gun. The plot changes from this revengefantasy to the New Yorker world of the publicity expert Eddie Til Schweiger Now I ask myself seriously What is so disconcerting about the imagination that the victim imagines the death of the men that are raping her? Isn't it even understandable somehow? The visualization in the movie makes the fantasy visible for the viewers  and uncomfortable. One Way is consequently shown from the rape victim's point of view which is definitely not a daily mean.In an other criticism it is said that the rape scenes are shown very drastically. So I watched them critically. My judgment I have seen more drastically rape scenes in movies and on television before. But what is really hard to the spectator is  during the whole rape the camera is filming the victim's face. Vivid oppressive and frightening.The pictures do not allow any evading and phrases like somehow she wanted that too or It's not as bad as it seems are absolutely wrong and out of place. The victim is injured with great physical and psychological pain.Is it a woman allowed to take revenge if she has been raped humiliated and emotionally killed? If she can't trust her pretending best friend or in justice? In One Way two raped and humiliated women experience emotional justice in the end and an initial slime ball develops into a better man. This is more than reality can unfortunatly sometimes offer.Fill the movie theaters and watch it! It's worth it! Marte Cormann www.kinoplausch.de".

Til Schweiger has also a great performance in the role of an ambiguous character divided between his career and the loyalty for his friend but he redeems in the end refusing to blame Angeline. The sweet Stefanie von Pfetten fits perfectly to her characters and her confession about a family secret in the end is the great twist of this movie.

	schema:headline " Til Schweiger takes a more interesting career turn";
	schema:reviewBody "hmmmm yesss. From the statistics I read that US females over 30 did not like this film. Whereas the younger audience especially in Europe was thrilled. Why would this be so? The film is about rape and about revenge and how the victim feels and into what kind of situation she gets put by her surroundings. Seeing how things are the US are very ambivalent about sexual themes. Not to say 'hypocritical'. Judging from the themes feministic theory in the US put forward in the 70ies and 80ies sexual oppression and violence are very much more of a problem when they cannot be voiced at all. This may have been different in Europe with a more liberal approach in many countries well not all I believe.... Anyway this might explain why a film like 'One Way' will not be received so openheartedly in the US  it is painful. And it shows parents in their relationship to their children in a very painful way. Maybe this also explains the distaste of 'elderly women' to phrase it this way without actually implying criticism.This much for the background. The film itself is a treat in that it shows a comparatively new side of Til Schweiger as a 'real' actor besides the many comedian roles he has played  actually one of those bought him his ticket to the film world 'Manta Manta'. He played in some more serious films before The Ice Bear Der Eisbaer and Knocking on Heaven's Door but even his last flick in 2006 Where is Fred Wo ist Fred was a comedy  not bad and including some hilarious stunts by Christoph Maria Herbst and beautiful Anna Maria Lara  but not really a revelation. Also the film puts him in context with many other good actors especially Lauren Lee Smith. For a while Schweiger has been directing andor producing his own films  maybe because this was the way of getting a job at all? I hope not  rather do I hope that he will some time tread in the footsteps of Clint Eastwood Robert Redford etc.I will leave the comments to the film itself to the other two I have seen posted. Just this it is a dark film giving rise to hope nevertheless. And it does show many things to make people thoughtful  and I do hope this makes them like the film rather than dislike which would be the far more easy thing to do.".

Anyway this might explain why a film like 'One Way' will not be received so openheartedly in the US  it is painful. And it shows parents in their relationship to their children in a very painful way. Maybe this also explains the distaste of 'elderly women' to phrase it this way without actually implying criticism.This much for the background. The film itself is a treat in that it shows a comparatively new side of Til Schweiger as a 'real' actor besides the many comedian roles he has played  actually one of those bought him his ticket to the film world 'Manta Manta'. He played in some more serious films before The Ice Bear Der Eisbaer and Knocking on Heaven's Door but even his last flick in 2006 Where is Fred Wo ist Fred was a comedy  not bad and including some hilarious stunts by Christoph Maria Herbst and beautiful Anna Maria Lara  but not really a revelation. Also the film puts him in context with many other good actors especially Lauren Lee Smith. For a while Schweiger has been directing andor producing his own films  maybe because this was the way of getting a job at all? I hope not  rather do I hope that he will some time tread in the footsteps of Clint Eastwood Robert Redford etc.I will leave the comments to the film itself to the other two I have seen posted. Just this it is a dark film giving rise to hope nevertheless. And it does show many things to make people thoughtful  and I do hope this makes them like the film rather than dislike which would be the far more easy thing to do.";

	schema:headline " A movie that asks the important question...which is worse Til Schweiger's acting or getting raped with a strapon?";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie starts out with Michael Clarke Duncan playing a black militarized version of Harvey the Invisible Rabbit. It goes on to introduce us to a main character that is a cheating arrogant weakling. A perfectly fine young woman is brutally raped with her clothes on and THEN we see her naked in the shower. Three cops show up who appear to have learned everything they know about police work from the Erik Estrada Correspondence School of Law Enforcement. Eric Roberts pops by as a lobotomized version of Perry Mason. Oh and this film also features one of the rare nonporn appearances of a strapon dildo. If that all sounds like something you'd like to watch put down the meth and go eat an orange.The plot of One Way is rather involved but I'm not going to get into it in too much detail. That's because this story is like running on a treadmill while falling down the side of a mountain. It feels like you're stuck in the same spot and careening wildly out of control at the same time. Anyway here's the basics of it. Eddie Schneider Til Schweiger wants to marry Judy Birk Stefanie von Pfetten his boss's daughter. His professed love for Judy however doesn't stop Eddie from banging as many other women as his unit can handle. Eddie is an extremely talented and extremely selfdestructive ahole. He's the sort of guy who makes himself late for the most important business meeting of his life because Eddie just has to get a morning quickie from an anonymous red head then incorporates his being late into the pitch that lands the company a big client.Judy's brother Anthony Sebastien Roberts finds out that Eddie is a cheating bastard. He doesn't tell Judy or their parents. He doesn't confront Eddie. No Anthony decides that it gives him an excuse to rape Eddie's friend and assistant Angelina Sable Lauren Lee Smith. Only after that does Anthony blackmail Eddie with evidence of his cheating. Eddie lies in court about Angelina to get Eddie acquitted. But in a case of leaden irony Judy finds out about Eddie's infidelity on her own and breaks up with him which leads to her father firing Eddie.Ugh. I've already gone into more detail than this thing merits. To wrap things up  Angelina starts hallucinating Anthony winds up dead Eddie is put on trial the story bounces back and forth from being about vigilantism to personal redemption to familial dysfunction and Judy reveals herself to be one of those women with colossally bad taste in men.The acting in One Way is okay. Lauren Lee Smith is fairly good as Angelina until the character gets saddled with a mental condition and Stefanie von Pfetten is appealing as one of the wimpiest empowered women you'll ever see. Til Schweiger iswell he's Til Schweiger. If you like the stuff Til Schweiger does you'll find Til Schweiger doing it here. The rest of the cast is asked to do too many ridiculous scenes and speak too much bad dialog to fairly evaluate their performances.The direction is also okay but it's a little disturbing that the best staged and most affective scene is the rape of Angelina and the worst staged least affective scene is the revenge rape of Anthony. I mean writerdirector Reto Salimbeni can only make the rape of Anthony work by equating being handcuffed with being paralyzed from the waist down which creepily makes it seem as though he put much less thought into it than he did with the more realistic violation of Angelina.One Way certainly has narrative ambitions. It's trying to take on subjects of morality ethics and responsibility. Unfortunately those concepts aren't addressed with much talent or skill. It's a little like listening to a 6 year old try and tell you what War and Peace is all about.There are moments in One Way that make you think that this film might have turned out better in an alternate dimension where radical changes were made to the script. We can only watch the movie that was made in this dimension though and that's not something anyone really needs to do.".

I'm well acquainted with Til Schweigers work but I thought his acting was awful in this film full of clichs and hamminess. He was even better in King Arthur another bad film where he only had a few sentences of dialogue. Even though he was typecast as a villain in that one his acting was miles better than in this latest offering.The supporting cast were also pretty bad in this film especially the guys who played the boss of the advertising agency and his son they were just awful.The filming of the violent attacks were needlessly graphic in this case and did not lend to the gravitas of the film. Other films have done this in a much more poignantor relevant manner e.g. Lilja4Ever The Accused Boys Don't Cry Irreversible...etc. etc.The whole concept of the victim introducing an imaginary hero to help her cope with the trauma of rape didn't work at all in this instance and I thought this was a very weak point in the script and it's direction.The plot of the film is actually very interesting material and if worked with in another way could have been great. I intend no disrespect towards the makers of this film as releases like these are normally a labour of love and an awful lot of very hard work goes into them but i cannot give this film a good rating as it simply badly executed.".

	schema:headline " One Way 2006 is an excellent film that you will want to come your way.";
	schema:reviewBody "From the start of the film the audience knows that this is going to be a complex and not a simple whodunit. The audience is enlightened by the completely truthful depiction of rape as violent. Beyond lust or sexual molestation rape is brutal and violent. It is not at all uncommon for the victim to wish the rapists and any accomplices dead. To survive the victim must initially fantasize a murder of the perpetrators and holds on to a strong feeling of revenge.There is the wealth and power of the Birk family who maintains a 'we against them' philosophy to coverup any corruption and to protect each member of the immediate family. A strong matriarch and patriarch holds the family together no matter what. Somehow I think the entire family knew about the evil deeds of the son but protects him anyway with the help of corporate lawyer with a track record of winning most if not all of his cases. The son engages in blackmail to selfishly hold onto the Birk fortune he covets wealth at any cost. Things get so chaotic and heated that towards the end of the film the daughter is pitted against the son even after he is sexually violated here one of the victims gets her moments of revenge and shot to death. But has justice been served?I will not give any more details because I do not ruin the excitement and thrills of the film. If you are like me the film will hold you on the edge of your seat. The film is riveting.I was disappointed that the film has a rather bittersweet ending. I so much prefer happy endings. But the film is true to life. Yes life does have its compensations. Unfortunately however there may be some harsh realities and shattered dreams. In the end do the victims win? And will the perpetrators be brought to justice? Is there equality and fairness in the judgments made? Does life go on after injustice and rape? Find out the answers to at least some of these questions by seeing this very worthwhile film which really makes you think about the issues surrounding corporate power coverups and corruption the judicial system ethics morality rape status and wealth etcetera.This film is a mustsee and I rank it a 10 out of 10. The ensemble cast is superb as is the direction and writing by Reto Salimbeni. The editing is well executed and the music aptly adds to the film's mystery suspense and tensionwhich constantly builds and increases the tautness of the spellbinding thrills of this crime drama. I hope that we will see more of these fine actors including Eric Roberts.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the start of the film the audience knows that this is going to be a complex and not a simple whodunit. The audience is enlightened by the completely truthful depiction of rape as violent. Beyond lust or sexual molestation rape is brutal and violent. It is not at all uncommon for the victim to wish the rapists and any accomplices dead. To survive the victim must initially fantasize a murder of the perpetrators and holds on to a strong feeling of revenge.There is the wealth and power of the Birk family who maintains a 'we against them' philosophy to coverup any corruption and to protect each member of the immediate family. A strong matriarch and patriarch holds the family together no matter what. Somehow I think the entire family knew about the evil deeds of the son but protects him anyway with the help of corporate lawyer with a track record of winning most if not all of his cases. The son engages in blackmail to selfishly hold onto the Birk fortune he covets wealth at any cost. Things get so chaotic and heated that towards the end of the film the daughter is pitted against the son even after he is sexually violated here one of the victims gets her moments of revenge and shot to death. But has justice been served?I will not give any more details because I do not ruin the excitement and thrills of the film. If you are like me the film will hold you on the edge of your seat. The film is riveting.I was disappointed that the film has a rather bittersweet ending. I so much prefer happy endings. But the film is true to life. Yes life does have its compensations. Unfortunately however there may be some harsh realities and shattered dreams. In the end do the victims win? And will the perpetrators be brought to justice? Is there equality and fairness in the judgments made? Does life go on after injustice and rape? Find out the answers to at least some of these questions by seeing this very worthwhile film which really makes you think about the issues surrounding corporate power coverups and corruption the judicial system ethics morality rape status and wealth etcetera.This film is a mustsee and I rank it a 10 out of 10.

	schema:headline " Unique excellent unpredictable thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "One Way is an interesting unpredictable sort of genre bending thriller that shouldn't be judged by its cover which makes it out to be an action flick. Not even close. It's the story of several different characters who intersect by the mistakes they make and the lengths they go for redemption and revenge. In the opening sequence we see a young girl pursued by a pack of perverted hooligans through the woods. After being sexually assaulted she is visited by a hulking military general the excellent Michael Clarke Duncan who seems to be her guardian angel brutally dispatching the youths with an automatic machine gun. The story then switches randomly to a cocky adulterous ad executive Til Schweiger trying hard not to ham it up who's in crisis with his suspecting wife arrogant boss Art Hindle and his boss's son a vile prick with a penchant for sexual assault himself. Lauren Lee Smith plays the older version of our heroine in the prequel whose continuing story collides with Schweiger's predicament for some really surprising thrills that take you by surprise. It's a really unique setup without any sort of warning or conventional intuition as to where it's going to take us and eventually gets to some dark places of morally frightening danger. Smith is excellent in the intense lead role that requires some harrowing work which she pulls off without a hitch. Sebastian Roberts is a snivelling little piece of human garbage as the boss's son and Schweiger's brother in law and provides an antagonist that you just love to hate and gets what's coming to him in a a disgusting sequence that lets just say sneaks up on you....from behind. Michael Clarke Duncan is only around for a few scenes but makes his usual impression and is unforgettable as the sympathetic general. Eric Roberts shows up out of nowhere in the third act nailing his role as a slick defence attorney and Kenneth Welsh kills it as the rival lawyer. Stephanie Von Pfetten is heartbreaking as Schweiger's put upon wife who has deep issues of her own that come piling out in a devastating courtroom sequence. If you enjoy thrillers that spin a left field unconventional narrative where you never really quite know who's who or where things are going give this one a watch. It's a unique treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a lover of Chopin the man and his music for years and years and have always been fascinated by George Sand. I rented this film on DVD with English dubbing and watched it last night with great expectations. I recently purchased IMPROMPTU the other ChopinSand biopic and found it wandered quite far from the actual events of their lives. So I was disappointed with that one and was hoping CHOPIN DESIRE FOR LOVE would be just what I wanted from a Chopin biography. It was not.What would be so hard about making a film based entirely or at least mostly on true events? Why do filmmakers seem determined to turn the lives of these historic geniuses into soap opera frivolity? If you have ever read a biography on Chopin or even just listened to his music then you know what a highly intelligent sensitive perfectionist almost otherworldly man he was. I want a movie about Chopin with an actor and a script that are as sensitive and detailed as he was. This film seemed like a cheap madeforTV movie with overacting cheesy drama and unnecessary sexual situations. I'm mainly referring to the scene of Solange frolicking nearly naked in the river in front of Chopin. There is no documented proof that there was ever anything beyond mild flirtation between Solange and Chopin if there was even that. He was older frail and sickly and she was young sexy and looking for money. She used him for sympathy and he did have it for her. Oh and the scene with the maid and Chopin! Completely made up for sex appeal! What were they thinking? Perhaps they just wanted to show that Chopin was starved for sex while living with Sand but there were other ways to show that. Chopin would be sick over this one and George Sand would never have stood for that under her own roof.Chopin struggled with depression and sickness and even had a few hallucinations from time to time. His own genius mind drove him mad with striving for perfection in music dress and appearance. Neither movie I have seen has touched on this aspect of his life very well if at all. They have portrayed him as a whining snob and not much else. There was far more to him. In my opinion he was very misunderstood. This is just something else I would love to see played out on screen.On a positive note there were a few little details in this movie that lovers of Chopin might really appreciate. For instance in most scenes the actor playing Chopin wears gray pants. This was Chopin's favorite color for his suits. There were also scenes of Chopin in a room with gray and green walls which were the true colors of the wallpaper he chose for his apartment in Paris. I also liked the fact that the actress playing Sand in this film actually resembled the real woman whereas in IMPROMPTU Judy Davis looked nothing like her. They didn't even try with Davis except to put her in a man's clothing. In the first party scene of this film the actress is dressed and has her hair done exactly like Sand in a well known painting. I loved the way she looked here.All in all I would have to say that for Chopin and Sand fans this movie is severely lacking in historical truth and nuance. At the same time for those who have no knowledge of Chopin's life it must be very confusing tedious and hardly entertaining. I hope one day that a good detailed biographical film will be made for Chopin. Perhaps lack of interest from the public is why we've had two duds about him. However I think if a well made film were to be done many people who never knew about Chopin would find themselves fascinated and wanting to know more about this amazing composer's sad and hauntingly beautiful life story.".

In my opinion the greatest moment in the film is when Chopin composes his Mazurka in D major Op. 33. He hear his worker Jan play something on the violin and from that he composes this Mazurka. By the way Those of you who play the piano check out this mazurka  Op. 33 no. 3.

Adanczyk plays the great composer giving us the compassion and sympathy for Chopin. The film covers his longterm relationship with Madame George Sands and the struggle between Chopin and Sands children. It is a sad love story but makes one love Chopin even more for his sensitivity and love for Sands his country and his music. Throughout the whole film the best of Chopin is played. There is much more to the composer than the film portrays yet this film is an excellent introduction to his life. I did not want the film to end. His Waltz in A minor 17 plays throughout the film which brings out a happiness yet a sadness in oneself.".

The film covers his longterm relationship with Madame George Sands and the struggle between Chopin and Sands children. It is a sad love story but makes one love Chopin even more for his sensitivity and love for Sands his country and his music. Throughout the whole film the best of Chopin is played. There is much more to the composer than the film portrays yet this film is an excellent introduction to his life. I did not want the film to end. His Waltz in A minor 17 plays throughout the film which brings out a happiness yet a sadness in oneself.";

	schema:headline " The Life of Chopin The Soap Opera";
	schema:reviewBody "Chopin's music has always been deeply touching also soulsearching and quite haunting when played very well. Even when a filmTV series does stretch the truth a bit it does deserve to stand on its own two feet there are historically flimsy films that are still great films in their own way but there are also others where the historical flimsiness is the least of its problems. And actually that is the case with Desire of Love. It is beautifully filmed while the costumes and sets are just as striking as well as the scenery. Chopin's music is phenomenal and the way it's played has all the impact the music ought to have and the players allow the music to speak for itself. The acting is reasonably good and the actors do what they can Danuta Stenka is very impassioned and with a physical likeliness to George Sand herself it is like Sand come to life. Piotr Adamczyk is credible as Chopin as well. Desire of Love however is one of those instances where there are good intentions and ideas that are not executed very well at all. The dialogue is very hamfisted not very natural in flow and with the bouts of tedious melodrama too much like an overdoneoverwrought soap opera. The direction often plays too much of a moodpiece and sadly there are not many moods to be found here so it was a wellintended approach that backfired. The story is rather pedestrian pacewise and is very disjointed with everything jumping around and about as often as it did too often it was not easy to fully follow. While some of the content in Desire of Love probably was accurate very little is done to help us learn of the context of each piece or to fully get and identify with the characterswritten in a rather shallow way and the connection between Chopin's life and his music is very poorly explored. And as great the music is and how wonderfully played it is a lot of it was only in snippets the music deserves better than that. In conclusion visually and musically outstanding and with a decent cast but dull hamfisted disjointed and just not as interesting as it should've been. 410 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Kids return was never given theatrical release in the US probably because Takeshi doesn't actually act in it and it doesn't focus on Yakuza. Despite this it is one of his finest films and definitely among his most accessible.Made during his recovery from a motorcycle accident the film focuses on a group of highschool students as they prepare to enter into the adult world. The two lead characters are Shinji and Masaru delinquent losers who are looked down upon by their teachers and feared by their classmates. After they're set up by the administration and thrown out of school they fall into amateur boxing and embark onto different paths. We follow not only the two hoods but their classmates as well at they all enter into various occupations trying to become adults and live a good life and for one reason or another failing.All this seems fairly conventional until you remember that it was written and directed by Beat Takeshiwho lends it his trademark melancholy sense of style and injects the script with just enough  irony and pathos that it resonates. On a technical level this is one of Takeshi's finest achievements. I've often felt that in his other works his simple still frame compositions and slow editing rhythms didn't quite synch with the material almost as if they resulted more from not knowing what to do with the camera than any kind of personal vision. Here he proves me wrong. Kids Return is directed by a man with a confident and assured hand the shots while still easy identifiable as Kitanoesque can we just coin that now are framed with a poetic eye fusing themselves to the material to lend it the perfect sense of mood. The editing is smooth craftsmanlike aided greatly as always by the brilliant music of Jo Hisaishi.The real difference here though is the writing. Kitano forgoes his usual rambling improvisational scene construction for a work that is very structured. The plot is circular and the kids' lives are given a clear step by step descent into nothingness with an edge of Aristotalean inevitability thrown in. The result is something that is not only more coherent but somehow also manages to be more naturalistic than his other films. Again Takeshi's hand is still felt from the affectionately stupid pranks of the leads to the recurring appearance of a twin comedy group who banter in the style Kitano's own The Two Beats. But it's organized more confident. He knows what he wants to say and how he wants to say it.The acting is uniformly great with Masanobu Ando a long way from his almost demonic role as Kiriyama in Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale a definite standout as Shinji. With little to no dialogue he still manages to convey a sense of likeability and character. Ken Kaneko plays the more garish of the two but still maintains the air of innocence that the part requires. There are also fun cameos from Takeshi regulars Ryo Ishibashi who happily is spared any nasty encounters with a piano wire Ren Osugi and Susumu Terajima. Perhaps the ultimate compliment to the actors and to the film itself is that we don't seeing the man himself onscreen. There's no doubt that Takeshi has one of the brightest larger than life screen presences in all of cinema. He so dominates the movies he acts in that they would fall apart without him there. Kids Return however stands alone with a strength that seems to almost grow with his absence.Final moments bring our kids back to the school ground where they grow up and the summation given by Masaru transcends the events beforehand in a way that would have made even Ozu proud. Where do you go when you've got nothing to look forward to and the entire rest of your life still left to live? Kitano's encounter with death has somehow made him even more pessimistic but at least he came out with something to say.".

Some of them succeed and some fail. Now the feat was to link all these single story lines together and make one film out of it. And Kitano really succeeded in this sector. And again this film has a lot of autobiographical elements in it. Kitano's own past as a delinquent or comedian for example.The music was again a real pleasure. Joe Hisashi really knows his craft to compose very fitting melodies which always remind me of old Japanese folk songs and use them perfectly timed in Kitano's films.If you've seen other Kitano movies and missed this one you will definitely like it. For those who want to try out a Kitano film for the first time watch it! It will be a very contemplative and rewarding experience.".

But he has come back from the death and tell us what life is all about. If you read his biography watch his films in time order you feel like you are watching his lifetime. You would see how Kitano portrays life and death from his own experience in real life.Take his accident in 1994 as a mark. Before his accident Sonatine and Violent Cop are bleak and sad. They showed life affairs that can not be escaped. The whole world wants to swallow our heroes but they are too tough to be gobbled. But in the end the heroes choose death to end this permanent fight against the brutal world. After the accident in Kids Return it's not how to die to escape its about how to live to face this brutal world. Remember the time when he made Kids Return the Japanese still haven't recognized his talent and he had to endure many critics that had lead to his self destruction. But after he left the hospital he appeared in Gonin The Five as an actor directed Kid Return. Kitano could drop directing and become a comedian again becuz Japanese like him as a comedian that way is easier but he didn't do as they wished Kitano Takeshi has never lose his belief in himself. In Kids Return I feel like Kitano wanted to begin his life again left behind all the critics and desire to be recognized by Japanese. No matter how things get bad life just begin when you feel that you are ready. It's never late to begin your life yes never.One more thing I want to say after this film Kitano made Hanabi which received the Golden Lion at Cannes. Japanese started to recognize him as a director. At that time he's 50.".

Not to be bothered with such fruitless endeavors like going to school and learning something useful they would rather clown around harass teachers bully younger students and shake them down for money sneak into porn theatres perform standup comedy manzai routines or set fire to a teacher's brand new car  just good clean fun.As they say in the vernacular what goes around comes around and the coming around this time is in the form of a friend of one of the bullied students who unfortunately for the boys is a skilled street fighter. Their encounter turns their attention to a boxing gym where they give up on school and train for revenge against the oppressor.

Shinji passively follows an older cynical boxer who teaches him some illegal tricks to succeed in the ring as well as some strange ways to lose weight.Things work well for a time until both of the lads crash and burn and realize how much better it is just to hang out and be happy than actually do something constructive. Meanwhile a gentle boy named Reiko Atsuki Ueda marries his perennial sweetheart Sachiko Yuko Daike but decides to pass on college. He gets a job in a corporation which doesn't work out and he is soon eking out a living as a taxi driver a depressing sequence which seems to be in the film for no reason other than to show us how the education system failed again.Kids Return is a very well done film with some excellent boxing scenes and a few good laughs but there does not seem to be any lessons learned here.

	schema:reviewBody "Life's hard for a couple of juvenile delinquents in Japan. Takeshi Kitano's marvelous 1996 film Kids Return skirts around the fringes of his better known gangster pictures to look at the seeds that once planted might turn a boy into a gangster or as happens here with one of our antiheroes a boxer. This is a very likable smallscale film full of all the affection of friendship where even violence seems like a necessary evil in the process of growing up. Drawing superb performances from his young cast Kitano who wrote directed and edited the picture keeps things light and easy with just the right degrees of sadness and humour. This may not be one of his better known films but it's just as good as anything he's done.".

Shinji delivers goods to a house and meets up with his friend Masaru who is looking for a job. He tells Masaru he is not still taking boxing lessons. They are both aimless and want to enjoy their youth without any responsibilities. Instead they want to live their youth through each other. Masaru offers him a ride through the city. Instead of going to history class they ride their bike in the quad. On the roof they make a man out of materials with a paper drawing of the teacher's face and a flashlight as a penis and two ping pong balls as the testicles. They hang it outside and the window and wiggle the ropes controlling the fake flashlight penis making everyone snicker inside the classroom.

Shinji watches but doesn't participate. The two are unlikely friends and Masaru is the cocky extrovert and Shinji is the loyal introvert. At the caf a shy student Reiki leaves a love letter for the waitress and as Shinji and Masaru leave Masaru takes the letter. They read the letter while biking and laugh at Reiki's love confession to Sachiko.As they get in trouble for throwing a dart to a kid's head in class the office workers and principal tell them they don't need to be good students and they don't even need to come to class. They just ask them to leave other students alone. One teacher comes in to park his car and tells them they should have been expelled a long time ago. Later he finds his car torched in a pan shot starting from the students watching on the staircase to the sad teacher's sad defeat by his car. When kids don't have money that they can take from them Masaru punches one and tells him to get a job.At the office again Shinji and Masaru are accused of setting the teacher's car on fire.

Without Masaru the next day at school it is Shinji who is bullied. They go to a boxing ring to join and practice. At the adult video store other students dress in pathetic disguises with drawn ties glasses and cheap suits to pretend to be older executives. The woman sells them the tickets and when they are gone complains how stupid they are. When they return to the restaurant Masaru sees the Yakuza boss and tells him thanks for the food from the other day. The boss tries to buy them cigarettes and alcohol but they tell him they can't have it since they must be healthy to box. Masaru decides his boxing name will be Dynamite Punch. He tells the boxing president he wants a true fight and one kid offers to take him on only because they hate each other. Masaru fights dirty and beats the kid. He wants Shinji as a boxing partner.

It's the tale of two kids that go to high school together an the story of how one becomes a gangster and the other becomes a boxer. It's an interesting tale and certainly tells a story of youth feeling that pressure to succeed and perhaps doing questionable things to do so.It starts off as a high school drama but then slowly turns into a film that is half yakuza drama and half boxing story. The interesting thing is that there are also a few other characters we see throughout that if i'm being honest I don't completely know why they are there. I think it's perhaps to emphasize the idea of youths in Japan being pressured to be successful. We see a duo of comedians and a guy who is in love with a girl at a Cafe and we see little snippets of what they are doing edited in between the main plot. It's interesting and kinda works. The relationship between the two friends really works. We see their dynamic and when they drift apart you believe it. You also grow to like the characters and kinda root for one if not both of them. The ending is also pretty great if I do say so myself. The film isn't quite a masterpiece like Sonatine but it certainly is up there with his best works.

	schema:headline " Kids Return vs. Tokyo Fist";
	schema:reviewBody "It's Tokyo the midNineties and you fancy punching the poopoo out of someone. That's how total cult directors Tsukamoto Shinya and Kitano Takeshi felt at least. Coming a year apart  much like your mother's sex life  both made Tokyobased films centred around boxing 'Tokyo Fist' 1995 and 'Kids Return' 1996 both bringing their own unique flair to the art form. To start the films are very similar 'Tokyo Fist' starts with salaryman Tsuda bumping into an old school friend Kojima a parttime boxer. Likewise 'Kids Return' begins with former best friends from school Masaru and Shinji happily bumping into each other on a Tokyo street both recognising that their lives have taken a downward spiral since they last saw each other. However due to the nature of both directors the similarity largely ends there. 'Tokyo Fist' is very much along the lines of Tsukamoto's most famous work 'Tetsuo Ironman'. Focusing on ideas of revenge and aggression Tsuda soon becomes paranoid that his old classmate might be knocking up his missus Hizuru. His paranoia gradually drives Hizuru away as their quiet life becomes loud aggressive and full of bloodsplattering scenes with her ending up in the arms and bed of Kojima played by Tsukamoto's brother Koji. The anger and rage building inside him exemplified by the everpresent loud music Tsuda joins Koji's boxing gym determined to beat him in the ring much like Koji is doing to Hizuru. The film then becomes a loud brash experience with fast camera movements editing and thrashing music leaving the viewer out of breath just watching it. And as ever a confusion is created as to what exactly is going on throwing in extreme moments to push things just that little further. Rage obsession and fetish are themes running throughout Tsukamoto's works and 'Tokyo Fist' is no exception working as a more polished version of 'Tetsuo Ironman'. The special effects are still a little budget but creative in the excessive blood pouring and Hizuru's new fetish for piercing any part of her body possible. Punch punch punch is the style for the boxing scenes with Tsukamoto creating a work to seep into your mind and punch your brain into dazed confusion.But where Tsukamoto chooses to show graphic violence and gore this is the very thing that Kitano often avoids. Since starting with 'Violent Cop' the violence is Kitano's films is more in the mind than on screen. The use of still cameras and editing means that actual acts of violence fall out of shot or are skipped for comic timing. The majority of punches thrown in 'Kids Return' are at punching bags or in sparring practise. 'Kids Return' is seen as Kitano's most autobiographical work set in the part of Tokyo where he grew up and featuring events and job roles that he himself experienced while growing up. The two friends Masaru and Shinji drift through school seen as the ultimate prodigal sons by their teachers. Neither has much direction simply wreaking havoc on the lives of their classmates. Meeting his match Masaru decides to take up boxing but soon realises he hasn't the discipline for the sport. His perennial sidekick Shinji however does and his talent is quickly spotted by the gym's coaches. Masaru then drifts away becoming a low level yakuza.For Shinji boxing is a sense of direction after days drifting rather than an act of aggression. 'Kids Return' is all about direction when entering adulthood mirroring roles taken by Kitano himself. Meek Hiroshi tries his hand at selling scales and driving a taxi on finishing school  two jobs Kitano had  but soon finds that neither provide him with what he wants out of life. Two students forming a school double act perform standup comedy to their classmates with a manzai act similar to that brought Kitano his initial fame. If anything 'Kids Return' is quite a depressing film. On leaving school hopes and ambitions are quickly lost for all characters with all left feeling lost and abandoned by their seniors. Hiroshi is repeatedly criticised by the bosses of his various jobs Masaru is expelled from his yakuza family for speaking out of turn and Shinji's coaches give up on him once he is led astray by an older boxer who takes him drinking. The boxing in 'Kids Return' is exactly that there is more emphasis on the sport with more realistic bouts and styles. 'Tokyo Fist' goes down the Stalloneform of boxing with nonstop punch fests that would lead to permanent brain damage in seconds but with blood spurting out of eye sockets this is the only way Tsukamoto of the Nineties would work. Both made in the midNineties set in Tokyo and with boxing as a key element the films are very different. Tsukamoto favours highoctane fight scenes and special effects to create a visually spectacular gore fest while Kitano chooses a more mellowpaced drama. At a time when two former boxing film legends return for the undoubtedly terrible 'Grudge Match' 'Tokyo Fist' and 'Kids Return' are both blasts from the past that fall under the same weight class but see a clash of styles.".

	schema:headline " The Kids Are Not Alright";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Kids Return follows two delinquent teenage high school dropouts who enjoy harassing schoolmates and teachers. Their nonchalant lifestyle leads them to two different paths seemingly successful.Masaru Ken Kaneko and the gentler associate Shinji Masanobu Ando are accompanied by a recurrent musical score every time they're engaged in an activity hinting that life can be beautiful and hopeful with possibilities. They're absorbed in their fantastical world enjoying a series of adventures fun for them however damaging to their peers. They're typical bullies who burn their professor's car for the slightest reason and horrify their classmates in order to take their money which they spend in their usual hangout. These repulsing actions predict a dark future as per the school staff but yet are somehow envied by other teenagers.Some of their victims decide to revenge and hire a boxer to teach the pair a lesson Masaru ironically gets knocked down aggressively. As failure is not an option he decides to train and get even while dragging his shy friend along the way.In the gym the trainers notice Shinji's natural talent in boxing contrary to what everybody expected due to his more stoic nature. But after a failure in an impulsive challenge Masaru decides to quit for a more dangerous endeavor encouraging his friend to stay and pursue a chance that will change his life.While Shinji focuses on his training to become a ring champ his best friend joins a local Yakuza gang Japanese gangsters in the hope he'll become a leader one day their paths diverge to an uncertain course.The kids are not totally responsible of their choices but rather drawn into a series of decisions that are led by pure coincidence. Meeting the Yakuza boss in a restaurant left them with a shallow interpretation of the 'cool' rich man strong and respected by his surroundings. Truth is once Masaru gets involved with them there's no turning back.While Shinji has been devoting all his time in the gym with the admiration of his boxing mates jealousy of the older generation threatens his success. One of the old champs convinces him to enjoy life outside the training ring with an unhealthy lifestyle and Shinji's natural inclination to follow changes the course of a promising career.Kitano shows a deep understanding of a troubled youth introducing humorous angles in their portrayal. At the same time he raises realistic questions on the consequences of roaming without a purpose without guidance.

	onyx:emotionText "The film Kids Return follows two delinquent teenage high school dropouts who enjoy harassing schoolmates and teachers. Their nonchalant lifestyle leads them to two different paths seemingly successful.Masaru Ken Kaneko and the gentler associate Shinji Masanobu Ando are accompanied by a recurrent musical score every time they're engaged in an activity hinting that life can be beautiful and hopeful with possibilities. They're absorbed in their fantastical world enjoying a series of adventures fun for them however damaging to their peers. They're typical bullies who burn their professor's car for the slightest reason and horrify their classmates in order to take their money which they spend in their usual hangout. These repulsing actions predict a dark future as per the school staff but yet are somehow envied by other teenagers.Some of their victims decide to revenge and hire a boxer to teach the pair a lesson Masaru ironically gets knocked down aggressively. As failure is not an option he decides to train and get even while dragging his shy friend along the way.In the gym the trainers notice Shinji's natural talent in boxing contrary to what everybody expected due to his more stoic nature. But after a failure in an impulsive challenge Masaru decides to quit for a more dangerous endeavor encouraging his friend to stay and pursue a chance that will change his life.While Shinji focuses on his training to become a ring champ his best friend joins a local Yakuza gang Japanese gangsters in the hope he'll become a leader one day their paths diverge to an uncertain course.The kids are not totally responsible of their choices but rather drawn into a series of decisions that are led by pure coincidence. Meeting the Yakuza boss in a restaurant left them with a shallow interpretation of the 'cool' rich man strong and respected by his surroundings. Truth is once Masaru gets involved with them there's no turning back.While Shinji has been devoting all his time in the gym with the admiration of his boxing mates jealousy of the older generation threatens his success. One of the old champs convinces him to enjoy life outside the training ring with an unhealthy lifestyle and Shinji's natural inclination to follow changes the course of a promising career.Kitano shows a deep understanding of a troubled youth introducing humorous angles in their portrayal. At the same time he raises realistic questions on the consequences of roaming without a purpose without guidance. Being nihilistic in his approach doesn't deny his affection to these young men with great potential for success while bridging to the inevitable adulthood  leaving the audience thoughtful.Find all of our film and festival coverage as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Kids Return";
	schema:reviewBody "Today is the DirectorInFocus day with 3 movies by writerdirectorproducercomedian etc Kitano Takeshi. And the three movies are all quite different in nature with this one being one of Kitano's directorial efforts without being in front of the camera Hanabi being the violent movies he's come to be famous for and Kikujiro at the other end being nonviolent but full of heartwarming fun.Kids Return is a semiautobiographical movie and you can see shades of Kitano reel or real in some of the characters. Primarily it focuses on the lives of two slacker best of friends Masaru Ken Kaneko and Shinji Masanobu Ando who play truant frequently and are ever threatened with expulsion from school. They have no aim in life and are drifting and wasting their time and youth away acting up as the ruffians and bullies in school.Two events change their lives though. One is a run in with a boxer who inspires them to pick up boxing so that they could get a rematch of sorts. The other is the Yakuza represented by a group who frequents the same diner they go to. From then on the movie picks up as we follow the very different paths these two buddies take. I kinda like the way the movie presented this aspect of life  that even amongst the best of buddies there will come a point in time where your ideals and aspirations take you down different paths. But although your lifestyle might have changed at the end of the day when you get together you're still the best of friends. This is very true that you never really left each other and the door is forever open for you to catch up from where you left off. Different paths different lives parallel outcomes.The movie's very easy to follow with its straight forward narrative as we follow the timid Shinji in his path towards glory in the boxing ring and observe from the side the decisions that the brash Masaru make which allows him to rise amongst the gangster ranks. More screen time is devoted to Shinji's though as at certain points it looked as if it was the Japanese version of Rocky Balboa. Punctuating the movie isn't The Eye of the Tiger but Kids Return has a catchy enough soundtrack courtesy of Joe Hisaishi who frequently scores Takeshi's movies.The movie however doesn't just bore you with these two friends as there are enough side characters from the same school like the disillusioned teachers and fellow students turned comedians and one a sales failure turned taxi driver to add some layers to the story. But ultimately it's life as it goes full circle and it makes you wonder whether good guidance is always that important factor to break the negative lifestyle anyone is living in.Oh and did I mention this movie had one of the more memorable movie props  a puppet with a makeshift dick made out of a flashlight and two bulbs taped together. You gotta see it to believe!".

Is like in the Oshima's film about youth every thing had a bad end often that end is without a moral maybe this is the real power of Kitano's movies. The only guide is the man in him self alone. Every man is self care the life is the thing it is. Kitano refuse the fantastic view like in the new Japanese cinema for example Kitchen by Morita and decide to take an overlook of the facts that show us. That is the reason why I give 9 stars to this movie.".

It may even be disquieting at times for those who have grownup believing that they must never laugh at particular social groups but the film is clearly sympathetic to those whose dignity is compromised daily by their circumstances of life. I defy anyone not to cry with laughter at the restaurant and chickencoop scenes.".

Back then I loved movies and still do and just saw anything I could see. The chicken coop sequence was uproarious and I found the waterfall sequence with the nude teenagers quite beautiful.

It was directed by Franco Brusati and this may be his best achievement. This immensely famous bittersweet comedy stars Nino Manfredi as a Chaplinesque immigrant waiter Nino trying desperately to assimilate among the cool and methodical Swiss.  His presence in the country is as a temporary worker and much of his time is spent trying to stay afloat and to avoid deportation.  Right from the start the film captures the pain and confusion of the outsider with incisive precision as when he is denounced for public urination.There are many great scenes. One is when Nino finds employment in a chicken farm and lives among a family of eccentrics who find the impersonation of chickens to be the highest of mankind's callings. Another scene in which Nino watches a group of Swiss youth bathing in a lake and looking like gods in some kind of sensual Valhalla encapsulates his feelings of inferiority and alienation. An Italian worker drag show funny and sad is performed by these men that have left behind friends and family in sunny Italy to return only at Easter and Christmas. Another great moment occurs when Nino modifies his appearance to attempt to look more northEuropean and  cannot help but revert to his Italian persona when the locals cheer on the Swiss soccer team and he vociferously applauds an Italian goal.Nino Manfredi rarely had a better role than this one and Anna Karina with whom he is tentatively in love is fine as Elena the Greek teacherinexile with a musicalprodigy of a young son. Johnny Dorelli is memorable as the wealthy Italian industrialist who befriends Nino but who overdoses when confronted with financial ruin taking with him some of Nino's own money. Bad luck dogs our hero but he seems to emerge from the tunnel of despair with renewed hopeand literally so at the film's end.The term Bread and Chocolate in Italian refers to a snack of Nutella spread on bread and is the equivalent of peaches and cream or fine and dandy which is used with irony here in this great commedia all'italiana.".

A drama full of comic and hilarious situations where the director really knows what is the difference between comic and drama and how to put them next to each other without failing to send the message. But more important the comic is on the highest standard of intelligence simple and efficient as you expect from a movie that has cinematic power inside as well as an important theme to explore and expose immigration.

	schema:reviewBody "A Film Review of Pane e Cioccolata Written By Jeremy LawrenceThe film Pane e Cioccolata also known as bread and chocolate 1973 directed by Franco Brusati is one of the remarkable films that installs the perception of both lifter and of sorrow. Brusati takes the audience through the life of an illiterate southern Italian immigrant as he tries to find refuge in the economic system of Switzerland in order to earn enough money to support him self and that of his so called families back home in Italia. As he progresses through the story unusual problems arise that involve differences in culture as well as a specific stereotype problems created by the society and even by himself. Threw out the film Nino Nino Manfredi is thrown into situations that arise because of his lack of a formal education and of his difference in cultural practices. For instance in a spectacular scene ware Nino is confronted by a Swiss police inspector Giorgio Cerioni who presents Nino with a photograph of himself urinating in public his cultural differences are evident. But at first the inspector tells Nino that he has committed an obscene act in public. Nino is appalled by the accusation but when the inspector tells him that the act was of him taking a pepe in public Nino is Lost and can not see why the act was so offensive that he should be fired for the act alone. What is missing is that in Nino's culture of uneducated southern Italians hicks the act is a trivial one and an obscene act is much more sever infect Neno rebuttals that he has not done an obscene act in private for some time. This and a plethora go to show the distance that Nino was from the members of his surrounding communities. Finally after trying to assimilate into the Swiss culture Nino gives up and decides to change his physical appearance to better resemble the traditional blond hair. When he travels into a pup for a drink he does not know how to answer the water. When a soccer game between the Italian team and the Swedish team appears on the television Nino tries to hide his indignation of the Swiss towards himself and root for the Swiss team. To all that are in the pup the fact that Nino is not a Native German speaker is in explicitly evident. He is ultimately rejected from the society and is imprisoned ware when he is released his blond hair was cut off. This further goes to illustrate his lack of acceptance from the members of the Swedish society. But when her tries to return to Italy he abandons the train and returns to Switzerland. Throughout his struggle Nino is constantly rejected and a pone boarding the train that will take him back to Italy he is reminded of the stereotypical cultural influence of the fellow train occupancy as they brake out into song. This further goes to demonstrate his unwillingness to return to the foreboding family back home and reaffirms his belief that wail he may not be educated he is at least trying to make ends meet. But one must wonder if he were smarter why did he not go to the Italian speaking part of Switzerland or after a few years why he could not speak more German than the hand full of words he admitted to know. But all in all the stories goes to show that racism and prodigies are not always the solution and that wail one may be illiterate that the circumstances that perspired against that person may or may not lead that individual full circle. This film has much more to say and I the writer do not have the space to elaborate. For example there is the social implications of the forged friendship of the Italian Industrialist and Nino. But for all purposes this film encourages those who take the time to watch the film to engulfed ourselves in Nino's struggles and to relate to Nino's desperation and a lack of social mannerism and lack of cultural adaptability.".

From this effort here's hoping that Collora can get more work behind the camera. No matter what the budget.";

I thought the villians costumes looked amazing I assume someone broke into the Fox props department for those.  This was short but darker than even Burton's first Batman movie though this one relies a little heavy on his script at least at first.  The directing was great too there were several well composed shots which says a lot about an 8 minute film.  I loved the fact that Bats was in his classic black and grey costume which was made of cloth and not rubber.  If you have the disk space and the time to DL this you won't be disappointed.".

Obviously they do so I plopped myself down got myself a Mountain Dew and watched an awesome 8 minute Batman short.Here's how it goes. Joker escapes from Arkham and Batman finds him in an alley. They do their usual We both have problems routine which was pretty well done since they do this all the time in the comics. Anyways after a little laughing and shoving out of nowhere an Alien shows up. And as you Alien fans know if there's an Alien around a Predator shouldn't be very far either. Since Predators hunt Aliens as a sport....if you didn't know. Anyways what follows is sweet little piece of filmmaking with fantastic direction and cinematography. You can nitpick till the cows come home about this or that but when it comes down to it this is one coolass short. My only problem was the Joker...the guy playing him looked the part but did not sound the part. Sounded a little too nerdy. Instead of sounding hysterically evil he sounded hysterically nerdy. No biggie though.Just like Lobo's Paramilitary Christmas Special this is another must see short that every comicbook fan should check out. 8.5 outta 10".

Like many here I'm a comic fan that grew up with the various television shows and comic stories. Batman is a character that is constantly undergoing changes due to various writers artists and medium representations film television comics books. Still I think Collora really focused on the basics. His Batman looks great in the old gray outfit no body armor or muscle padding. Personally I didn't have a problem with Bartram's acting. It wasn't like he was given a lot of dialog. He pulled the fight scenes off just fine.That brings me to another point Batman's fighting. As time has gone by Batman has become a great martial artists the film BATMAN BEGINS does a good job of describing how he became such a skilled fighter. Still in earlier versions Batman was more of a street fighter less about martial art techniques and more about a hard hitting slugger. He had some training but wasn't the martial artist he is now ofter viewed as. I don't have a problem with Batman the martial artist neither do I have a problem with Batman the street fighter. I think there is room for both representations. I don't know if this was Collora's intent or if he was just limited by time and money. Whatever the reason I like the way his Batman fought.The story isn't well defined but it doesn't need to be. The idea of Batman taking of a classic villain like the Joker and then crossover characters like AVP was cool. I bet most viewers were caught off guard when the film suddenly ended having forgot that they were only watching an eight minute film. We the viewers wanted more. BTW I think Koenig did fine as the Joker. Perhaps even if Collora doesn't get the nod for a Batman film Koenig might find a place in the Nolan Batman films.Obviously this film wasn't meant to have a beginning or an end just a snippet of a story that makes the viewer wonder What if? With films often approaching or exceeding the 100 million dollar mark I often wonder where all the money goes. Collora made this film for a reported 30000. If he were to have filmed a 2 hour film and kept the same level of effects costumes and stage sets the cost would have been about 600000. Now imagine if he were given 10 million to spend on sets and special effects both CGI and traditional FX. My impression is that he could deliver a film that would appeal to many viewers and due to the low cost of production generate more money for the studios and DC than the Burton films maybe even approaching the success of BATMAN BEGINS. It amazes me that studios give such men as David Goyer and Paul Anderson a shot at writing and directing while Collora has been passed over.".

This movie was unimaginative and offered nothing new to what I've already seen. In short I could have made this movie if I had 30000 to spend. I could definitely have come up with a better storyline than this that's for sure. The Joker escapes from Arkham Asylum and Batman confronts him in a darkened alley but The Joker isn't the only foe he encounters. Batman has to fight an Alien and The Predator. The ending has Batman sandwiched between a group of Aliens and Predators and then the credits roll how original is that? If Sandy Collora was offering Warner Bros. a lifeline to direct the then vacant Batman movie he offered nothing new. I'm glad it has since gone to Chris Nolan who is an extremely talented director and would love to see his take on Bats. I don't doubt Sandy Collora's love for comic books because I can tell he is a very passionate fan. I respect him for that but this movie is not innovative and is NOT the best Batman adaptation ever seen that would be Tim Burton's Batman 1989.".

True the latter two weren't yet produced at the time Dead End was made but even so. There are portions of Batman Forever which blow Dead End away in terms of quality.Don't get me wrong for a fan film this isn't that bad. It has some good atmosphere some good camera work and stunts some decent costumes. But Clark Bartram may look good in the suit and a crappy suit it is too but he'd make a woeful Bruce Wayne as he does in Sandy Collora's woeful World's Finest followup to this. Collora is an artist a special fx technician. He's not a writer or a director. And I think that shows in this. The dialogue is atrocious. I wish talented people in their chosen fields would stay in those fields. Everyone and their dog seems to think they can write and direct these days. Most suffer from delusions of grandeur.

The twist in the middle is a fun thing but it would be a better movie if it stick to the Comic Book Way.SPOLIER In the middle of the movie suddenly The Joker gets grabbed by Ridley Scott's Alien and the creature start fighting our dark knight.

The fight is pretty cool you know Bats is strong and he just need one punch at the time. Arnoldstyle not Bruce Lee type of thing. KICKS ASS. The twist in the middle is a fun thing but it would be a better movie if it stick to the Comic Book Way.SPOLIER In the middle of the movie suddenly The Joker gets grabbed by Ridley Scott's Alien and the creature start fighting our dark knight.

This movie is in the same niche genre as Away from Her  or even The Bucket List but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar Ellen Burnstyn is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughterinlaw. She figures it out enroute and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her  not even a little bit.Throughout the course of the movie we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias why she favors one son over the other how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene!This isn't a feel good movie but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect they are there for a reason...Hagar isn't my mother  she isn't even my motherinlaw or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women and men in my life.

It's not a funny feelgood movie  it's more along the lines of a feel and think movie.The director does an excellent job of character development  letting you into the heart mind and hurts of Hagar little by little. At first her attitudes and behaviors don't make much sense. As her story unfolds she becomes someone you can understand. As in life... understanding brings empathy. I found her likable by the end of the movie  particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake.Hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful  and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world. Her youngest son John who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat  and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare.It's fun to see Ellen Page acting in this movie. She is so very different than the young woman that she plays in Juno. It gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability. If you loved her in Juno you'll love her in The Stone Angel.Of course there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played. Never once in the course of this movie did I ever think of Ellen Burnstyn  I always and only thought of Hagar. She swept me into her character  hook line and sinker.Kari Skogland's capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of Canada's most cherished authors is impressive. She brilliantly brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman Hagar  the stone angel.".

	schema:headline " If you loved The Notebook then you'll surely find Stone Angel to be another gem!";
	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama which owing to its rather unimpressive 6.6 rating I nearly missed as I rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 710. Having said that I'm so glad I gave Stone Angel the viewing it so very much deserved. And so should you if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form.I must say that in many ways though not all viz. its themes execution style production etc. Stone Angel very much reminded me of the much praised The Notebook. I am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie so I can only assume that those who've written comments have yet to see the Notebook. They may not share any Alzheimer's theme yet I can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed The Notebook you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with The Stone Angel. But even If you've not seen The Notebook nor read the book on which this move is based which incidentally I haven't either you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly  as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers. This is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time's passing how life changes as the years pass and what might have happened in one's life as one gazes back through the years.This bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 810. I can only blame its current lowish rating of 6.610 on the 11 of idiots who gave it 110. After all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment. Nonetheless if those 11 who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look... for even a few seconds at the movie's premise and promotional lines? Oh dear... Whatever the world is coming to don't miss this most underrated gem of a movie  but only if you have a brain i.e. your top ten doesn't include Transformers Fight Club nor The Terminator.".

Having said that I'm so glad I gave Stone Angel the viewing it so very much deserved. And so should you if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form.I must say that in many ways though not all viz. its themes execution style production etc. Stone Angel very much reminded me of the much praised The Notebook. I am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie so I can only assume that those who've written comments have yet to see the Notebook. They may not share any Alzheimer's theme yet I can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed The Notebook you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with The Stone Angel.

Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film. The characters have so many complexities everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters rather than being spoonfed an opinion. You can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life.

	schema:reviewBody "In Canadian director Kari Skogland's film adaptation of the Margaret Laurence novel The Stone Angel Ellen Burstyn is Hagar Shipley a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her wellmeaning son Marvin. Filmed in Manitoba Canada and set in the fictional town of Manawaka The Stone Angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in Canadian high school English classes for almost half a century.The title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on Hagar's mother's grave which serves as a metaphor for Hagar's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime. Burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the egodriven selfdefeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father her wellmeaning but alcoholic husband and both of her sons. As she nears the end of her days she reflects that pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear. I was alone never anything else and never free for I carried my chains within me and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched.Confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home Hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships her recollections shown in flashbacks without voiceover narration. The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl. Chaperoned by her Aunt Dolly she meets her future husband the previously married Bram Shipley ColeWings Hauser a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the Native American population. The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role. Despite Hagar's pleading her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot. This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka condemning the young couple to a life of poverty.Going through the motions of her marriage to Bram Hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town's upper classes. When she produces two sons Marvin Dylan Baker and John Kevin Zegers she is unable to give them the love that they need. Every joy I might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning she reflects all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearancesWhen did I ever speak the heart's truth? Like the biblical Hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride Hagar leaves Manawaka to live in Ontario but eventually returns to the Shipley farm.As the scene shifts back to the present Hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by Marvin and his wife Doris Sheila McCarthy Here she meets a young man named Leo Luke Kirby who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. The Stone Angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where I felt any stake in the story's outcome although the spirited performance by Ellen Page as John's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film's second half.".

The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. She WAS Hagar through and through. Christine Horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead I am sure. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on overall a 9  out of 10.

Are we trying make some points for the sake of making some points e.g. the Muslim girlfriend and the Native people. Hagar and co. are everything but politically correct in the book so why should we see that in the film version. Modernization may be an excuse for a lowbudget operation but using that as an excuse to send subliminal politicallycorrect messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel and the film seems like throwing punches below the intellect.There is also the audience. It seems that we have been conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovable. Why should be laugh every time Hagar is at her tantrums? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted her readers to laugh at or with Hagar. These people are frustrated and are full of angst and all we do is to laugh at them.

As a 90yearold Hagar is ailing and losing her memory and her son Mervyn wants to place her in a retirement home. This brings out all the bitterness and regret that she has kept inside and we see scenes from the past that tell us the story of a rebellious young woman loving mother and the victim of a broken marriage. The movie is a realistic portrait of one woman's life with all its heartbreaks dashed hopes loves and loyalties. Hagar looks back on a life she lived on her own terms. Brought up as the daughter of welltodo merchant in a small Canadian Prairie town she rejects her father's wealth and marries the guy she falls madly in love with against her father's wishes. The marriage between two unconventional young people who enjoyed great sex and fun eventually lost its lustre. Hagar's husband was marked by alcohol and an out of control ego that eventually took its toll on both of them. Certainly Hagar knew her own failings contributed to the downfall of the marriage. She relived these failings in an encounter with a young woman well performed by Ellen Page who exhibits the same weaknesses as she had. The movie is based on a Canadian book by the same name written in 1964. I read the book many years ago in a Canadian literature course but I can see how this movie has much in common with another movie Rachel Rachel based on A Jest of God also by Canadian author Margaret Laurence. Margaret Laurence was a great writer whose gift was to write realistically about women who run up against the unwritten rules of mid20th century life and the harsh consequences that result especially in small towns. I found this movie was a brilliant tribute to Margaret Laurence and great viewing pleasure.".

	schema:headline " There's a difference between being stupid and being bad";
	schema:reviewBody "Is NAVAJO JOE a stupid movie?  Oh yeah you better believe it.  Is it a bad movie?  Surprisingly no.  To a significant degree NAVAJO JOE makes up for its farcical plot with its great style.First Sergio Corbucci knew how to make goodlooking movies.  Or at least he knew how to make this one look good.  He laps up the shots of the sere Western landscape Spain as usual in spaghetti westerns stands in for the American frontier.  He knows whose faces the camera loves and gives them lots of affectionate closeups.  He knows how to put a rose against a background that makes it look even redder like a spot of blood on the screen.  Kudos to cinematographer Silvano Ippoliti but the cinematographer can only photograph what the director tells him to and Corbucci knew what to shoot.Second Corbucci manages to keep his leading man off of the screen most of the time.  Burt Reynolds is atrocious.  His stuntman on the other hand is superb.  They combine to give us Navajo Joe one of the most athletic western heroes you'll ever see.  Unlike the typical western lead who gets most of his exercise transferring his Colt .45 to and from its holster Joe believes in getting close and personal whenever he can usually by flying through the air climbing onto rocks and roofs and otherwise dealing with the situation acrobatically.  The movie poster ridiculously shows Reynolds aiming a bow which he never once uses in the movie as any smart Indian would Joe uses a Winchester rifle for longrange combat.  But he uses even the Winchester athletically holding down the trigger and pumping the lever action frenetically to shoot down his foes.Third that Leo Nichols' you saw credited with the music is really Ennio Morricone who with all due apologies to Nino Rota is the undisputed king of Italian film music.  Like many of his themes it is a choral piece apparently inspired by Indian tribal songs but reworked to fit Morricone's own standards and it is superb.  NAVAJO JOE is the only movie I have ever watched solely for the music.  It is amazing to consider that Morricone did four better themes for Leone alone while for most film composers this theme would be a career best.Fourth the movie exposes some of the injustices that European settlers did to American Indians without ever giving in to the modern assumption that the Indian victims of these evils must themselves have been saints.As you can see the elements of a classic western were there.  But alas Corbucci dropped the ball short of the goal line.  For one thing he hasn't got a clue what to do with Nicoletta Machiavelli.  She's the topbilled lady and she's gorgeous but she doesn't get to take any part in the action.  She doesn't even get to kiss the hero.  It goes without saying that the characters are paperthin and the one who is most humanized is not Joe but Aldo Sambrell's villainous Mervyn who has a funny scene where he tears down the Wanted' sign for his brother and crumples it up but carefully removes his own and puts it away for safekeeping.Furthermore NAVAJO JOE is a textbook example of what Ebert called the Idiot Plot that is a movie whose plot can only proceed if everyone involved is an idiot.  The initial massacre which motivates the hero for the rest of the film depends on his wife being idiot enough to show not the slightest suspicion when an armed horseman rides up to her when she is alone and defenseless.  Joe's survival is due largely to Mervyn's inexplicable decision never to send more than two or three of his thirtyorso outlaws after him at one time.  The secondary villain fails to see that once he has guided Mervyn to the gold Mervyn will have no more use for him.  Mervyn's hardbitten brother Jeffrey is given an invitation that has TRAP' written all over it and proceeds directly into the trap without the slightest suspicion.  The most absurd part of all though is when Mervyn drags the servant girl Estella into the street right under the muzzle of Joe's rifle and threatens to shoot her unless Joe surrenders.  Does Joe a shoot him through the head or b surrender?  You guessed it he surrenders.  Now does Mervyn having seen that Joe will cave in to any threat to Estella threaten again to shoot Estella unless Joe tells him where the money is? Nope he spends fruitless hours beating the living dung out of our hero and when that doesn't work strings him up by his heels.  He doesn't even muss Estella's hair.NAVAJO JOE was Dino De Laurentiis' answer to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. Obviously it doesn't even come close FISTFUL was every bit as stylish as JOE and had a good story too.  But if you measure JOE by what it achieved not by what it tried to achieve you'll find it's pretty decent. Rating  out of Recommendation Western fans should catch it on TV.".

	onyx:emotionText "Is NAVAJO JOE a stupid movie?  Oh yeah you better believe it.  Is it a bad movie?  Surprisingly no.  To a significant degree NAVAJO JOE makes up for its farcical plot with its great style.First Sergio Corbucci knew how to make goodlooking movies.  Or at least he knew how to make this one look good.  He laps up the shots of the sere Western landscape Spain as usual in spaghetti westerns stands in for the American frontier.  He knows whose faces the camera loves and gives them lots of affectionate closeups.  He knows how to put a rose against a background that makes it look even redder like a spot of blood on the screen.  Kudos to cinematographer Silvano Ippoliti but the cinematographer can only photograph what the director tells him to and Corbucci knew what to shoot.Second Corbucci manages to keep his leading man off of the screen most of the time.  Burt Reynolds is atrocious.  His stuntman on the other hand is superb.  They combine to give us Navajo Joe one of the most athletic western heroes you'll ever see.  Unlike the typical western lead who gets most of his exercise transferring his Colt .45 to and from its holster Joe believes in getting close and personal whenever he can usually by flying through the air climbing onto rocks and roofs and otherwise dealing with the situation acrobatically.  The movie poster ridiculously shows Reynolds aiming a bow which he never once uses in the movie as any smart Indian would Joe uses a Winchester rifle for longrange combat.  But he uses even the Winchester athletically holding down the trigger and pumping the lever action frenetically to shoot down his foes.Third that Leo Nichols' you saw credited with the music is really Ennio Morricone who with all due apologies to Nino Rota is the undisputed king of Italian film music.  Like many of his themes it is a choral piece apparently inspired by Indian tribal songs but reworked to fit Morricone's own standards and it is superb.  NAVAJO JOE is the only movie I have ever watched solely for the music.

Like most Westerns by Corbucci Navajo Joe has a sociocritical message as it portrays racism and the genocide of the Native American population. Predominantely however Navajo Joe is a very entertaining Spaghetti Western with an excellent score by Ennio Morricone.A gang of unscrupulous bandits led by Duncan Aldo Sambrell ride through the American Southwest and kill every Indian they can find for the onedollar reward on an Indian scalp. Joe Burt Reynolds a Navajo warrior and merciless avenger starts haunting the scalp hunters and soon becomes their worst nightmare.Burt Reynolds is decent enough as the eponymous hero. Reynolds is certainly not a great Spaghetti Western antihero but he fits the role better than one would suppose. Nicoletta Macchiavelli does a good job as Estella a beautiful half Indian half white woman who lives in a white community. The best performance in this movie however comes from Aldo Sambrell in the role of the scalphunter Duncan a despicable man who is nothing but greed and concentrated hate. The score by Ennio Morricone is brilliant as always Quentin Tarantino used some of it for Kill Bill Vol.2. If you like Spaghetti Westerns you have to love Sergio Corbucci. Navajo Joe is not quite as brilliant as his masterpieces Django and The Great Silence but it is without doubt a more than worthwhile Spaghetti Western and recommended to every fan of the genre.".

Burt is okay  he neither adds much nor takes much away. Regardless of whether Burt is in it or not it's a solid early Spaghetti Western from the second best known Sergio  Sergio Corbucci. I've said it before but if it weren't for Sergio Leone Sergio Corbucci would probably be regarded as the best director to have worked in Spaghetti Westerns. Navajo Joe isn't anywhere close to being as good as some of his other films Django The Great Silence etc. but it's enjoyable enough and offers one of the few examples where Indian characters play even a small role in a EuroWestern. Sure there are plot holes and characters routinely take the most stupid course of action available to them but it's all good fun.Ennio Morricone is in my opinion the greatest composer to ever work in films. His score for Navajo Joe is another winner. It may not be as well known as his work on Leone's Dollars Trilogy but it's almost as good.

	schema:reviewBody "Daniel Baker pull your head out of you know what! First off Burt Reynolds had to leave during filming of Navajo Joe for a commercial which infuriated Corbucci. Reynolds thought he was going to become a huge star doing a spaghetti western and believed he was going to work with Leone. I believe deep down in his little heart he knows this was one of his better roles he has played.The opening scene was great with Aldo Sambrell Mervyn Duncansmiling at Joe's wife Cristina Sani. I didn't think Indians feared anyone especially Navajo..Answering Daniel's second intelligent remark! It shows Duncan's hatred for his own being half blooded Indian and during his childhood being called a halfbreed. He collects Indian scalps for a dollar a head. Which is funny how Joe makes a deal with the townspeople for a dollar a head. When Duncan learns that he has a bounty on his head he sacks the local town and make's a deal w Dr. Lynne in stealing the train carrying 500000 on board. One by one Joe eliminates the Duncan Gang and Dr. Lynne is killed by Duncan. It is a great final showdown with Merv Duncan and Joe in the Indian Burial ground of his ancestors. Like Corbucci's style the hero is killed off unlike Great Silence were the hero dies and the villain lives. The hate for one another destroys each other it is a cool Ax to the head scene which is edited in most versions. When you see Joe's horse ride into town with the money we know Joe has died....Niccoletta M. plays a small role in this film as a half breed as well but the opposite to Duncan's character.Ennio Morricone uses an unusual alias as Leo Nichols. Great music great camera work and great acting. It is a shame Reynolds only contribution to this genre. The saddest part is it never gave Aldo Sambrell a chance to play a lead role only more smaller parts. It is rumored to have a full version were Joe is visited by Nicolleta M before he dies in the burial grounds bullet ridden.".

Curiously Morriconne would tweak it some and use it again reworking it much of it for the movie BURN! starring Marlon Brando. In Italy and other countries it's considered wise to reuse a good thing Nino Rota for example wrote his main score for THE GODFATHER from some previous film and as a result his score was disqualified for what would have been a certain Oscar win.

	schema:reviewBody "This cynical Sergio Corbucci horse opera about the eponymous Native American hero wreaking vengeance on a murderous gang of cutthroat renegades for murdering his woman and massacring his village qualifies as a stalwart traditional Spaghetti western with nonstop riding shooting and killing galore. Killing constitutes a virtual reflex action in this savage aboveaverage shoot'em up. Gunsmoke actor Burt Reynolds must have been in the best shape of his life to pull off some of his stunts. He leaps and he lunges as if he were a born acrobat. For example trussed upside down by the evil villains he gets a little help from a sneaky city slicker and crunches up to untie his ankles. Remember how Richard Gere did situps dangling by his ankles from the ceiling of his apartment in American Gigolo? Burt performs similar stunts and is as nimble as a ninja. Masquerading as Leo Nichols Fistful of Dollars composer Ennio Morricone conjures up another memorable atmospheric orchestral soundtrack with traditional Indian chanting screaming and steel string guitar thumping. Quentin Tarantino thought so much of it and he sampled Morricone's score in his two swordwielding Kill Bill sagas. Hercules Samson and Ulysses lenser Silvano Ippoliti confines all the rampaging violence very skillfully with his widescreen compositions so it looks very cool. Some of Ippoliti's more imaginative images occur when he hides the identity of one of the villains during a saloon conference scene.Navajo Joe is one of a fistful of westerns where the only good Indian isn't a dead one. Few American westerns would celebrate the Native American as Corbucci does in Navajo Joe. Joe is pretty doggoned smart for a savage. Veteran Spaghetti western villain Aldo Sambrell is as treacherous as they come. So filled with hate is he that he kills without a qualm. No sooner has Mervyn 'Vee' Duncan Aldo Sambrell of For A Few Dollars More shot killed and scalped Joe's Indian wife than Joe hits the trail in pursuit of Duncan and his gang. Gradually Joe begins to whittle down the opposition. Meanwhile Duncan discovers that the authorities in the town of Pyote where he once sold scalps have posted a bounty of both himself and his halfbrother. Just before Duncan's blondeheaded brother Jeffrey Lucio Rosato of 4 Dollars of Revenge'' drills the sheriff with his sixshooter the lawman informs an incredulous Duncan that he is wanted for murder. Duncan points out that he has been bringing the sheriff the scalps of Indians for years. The scalps you brought then were those of troublemakers the lawman points out. According to the sheriff things have changed. Now you're attacking peaceful tribes killing even the women and the children. A prominent doctor convinces Duncan to rob a train heading for the town of Esperanza. He warns Duncan not to try and blow up the safe because an explosion will destroy the halfmillion dollars in the safe. He knows the combination and they can split the loot. This part of the Navajo Joe screenplay by Fistful of Dollars scribe Fernando Di Leo Hills Run Red writer Piero Regnoli and Mafia scribe Ugo Pirro sounds somewhat like For a Few Dollars More when Colonel Mortimer persuades El Indio to let him open the safe because too much dynamite might destroy the loot. Before Duncan leaves town his gang and he set it ablaze.Predictably Joe intervenes and steals the train from Duncan after the villainous dastard has massacred all the passengers including a woman and her baby along with a U.S. Army escort. Joe takes the train to Esperanza and offers to liquidate the gang if they will pay him a dollar for each head. Eventually Duncan captures Joe and tries to learn the whereabouts of the money but Joe refuses to talk. Duncan ranks as one of the most heartless outlaws. He shoots a preacher point blank in the belly with his sixgun after the minister thanks him for not wiping out their town! This trim 93minute oater features a lean mean Burt Reynolds wielding a Winchester like a demon and decimating the ranks of the bad guys. The Spanish scenery looks as untamed as the ruthless desperadoes that plunder one town after another. Django director Sergio Corbucci never allows the action to slow down. Despite its many sterling qualities Navajo Joe never achieved the status of other Corbucci westerns like The Mercenary The Grand Silence and Companeros. If you think about it Navajo Joe is a genrebending western because an Indian saves a town of mostly white citizens rather than terrorizes them!".

Duncan points out that he has been bringing the sheriff the scalps of Indians for years. The scalps you brought then were those of troublemakers the lawman points out. According to the sheriff things have changed. Now you're attacking peaceful tribes killing even the women and the children. A prominent doctor convinces Duncan to rob a train heading for the town of Esperanza. He warns Duncan not to try and blow up the safe because an explosion will destroy the halfmillion dollars in the safe. He knows the combination and they can split the loot. This part of the Navajo Joe screenplay by Fistful of Dollars scribe Fernando Di Leo Hills Run Red writer Piero Regnoli and Mafia scribe Ugo Pirro sounds somewhat like For a Few Dollars More when Colonel Mortimer persuades El Indio to let him open the safe because too much dynamite might destroy the loot. Before Duncan leaves town his gang and he set it ablaze.Predictably Joe intervenes and steals the train from Duncan after the villainous dastard has massacred all the passengers including a woman and her baby along with a U.S. Army escort. Joe takes the train to Esperanza and offers to liquidate the gang if they will pay him a dollar for each head. Eventually Duncan captures Joe and tries to learn the whereabouts of the money but Joe refuses to talk. Duncan ranks as one of the most heartless outlaws. He shoots a preacher point blank in the belly with his sixgun after the minister thanks him for not wiping out their town! This trim 93minute oater features a lean mean Burt Reynolds wielding a Winchester like a demon and decimating the ranks of the bad guys. The Spanish scenery looks as untamed as the ruthless desperadoes that plunder one town after another. Django director Sergio Corbucci never allows the action to slow down. Despite its many sterling qualities Navajo Joe never achieved the status of other Corbucci westerns like The Mercenary The Grand Silence and Companeros. If you think about it Navajo Joe is a genrebending western because an Indian saves a town of mostly white citizens rather than terrorizes them!";

While it was Sergio Leone who made the masterpieces Corbucci carved out his own little niche and made several important contributions to the genre. Navajo Joe is also known for featuring the upandcoming Burt Reynolds in one of his earliest roles.Unlike Sergio Leone Corbucci seems to have had a really passionate agenda for making what he saw as inflammatory antiwesterns. Here his mission is to restore the balance of treatment of Native Americans in the Hollywood western. He wasn't being quite as radical as it at first appears though seeing as Robert Aldrich had done the same thing ten years earlier with Apache starring cinema's other famous Burt Lancaster. Joe is an interesting character compared to the usual spaghetti antihero though as his extortion and cynicism are continually influenced by this higher purpose he has of seeking justice.Italian westerns were really becoming big business by this point and Navajo Joe has somewhat bigger production values than Corbucci's earlier films. The dubbing is of a much higher quality than that in Django although it's still not great. Nothing can cover the weakness of the plot  aside from the Native American angle it's a fairly basic train robbery story. There's a halfhearted attempt at injecting some mystery and suspense into it with the Doctor Lynn character doing an inside job but this never really gets off the ground. The actual dialogue is terrible too.Corbucci showed promise as a director in Django but in Navajo Joe the direction is nothing special. Whereas Django made great use of interiors and dark spaces Navajo Joe is in 'scope and mostly set outdoors but Corbucci really has no feel for landscapes. He gives a great rough and ready feel to the action scenes but overall there are just too many zooms and pointless camera moves.Although he would later become a big star back home Burt Reynolds isn't particularly good here. He moves fairly well and gives Joe just the right note of selfabsorbed nonchalance but when he opens his mouth terrible things happen. He puts in these little pauses as if trying to deliver lines like John Wayne except he falls well short. He actually manages to do the seemingly impossible and do an unconvincing job of dubbing himself. The only acting performance really worth noting is that of Aldo Sanbrell. Sanbrell was one of the most prolific spaghetti character actors playing thirdbadguyontheleft in dozens of pictures. Here is a rare chance to seem him in a lead role and he's actually not bad. Not good but not bad either.Burt Reynolds once stated that this was the worst film he ever made. It's probably not as anyone who's seen the Smokey and the Bandit sequels will testify but it is a fairly bad one and if Reynolds wasn't familiar with exploitation cinema he no doubt wondered what the hell he was doing. Corbucci had already made one of the best loved spaghettis Django and would go on to make some real classics The Mercenary The Great Silence but Navajo Joe was a real step backwards in his career.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Durbin Film with a Sad History";
	schema:reviewBody "Deanna Durbin sang with one of the most beautiful voices ever recorded. This film generously preserves some fine samples of that fact. But perhaps the prospective viewer should know that its story line is much simpler than film stories today where intricate plot twists and violent thrills are expected. Director Henry Koster crafted a sweet comedy about a superstitious but strongminded country girl who is fated to meet a selfcentered but talented corporal who tries to act like a big shot. Henry Koster proves his craftsmanship in his ability to knit together so simple a story and make it interesting and even in places arresting. Durbin plays a Hungarian peasant from SzilagySomlyo. It's fun to hear her say it! It happened to be producer Joe Pasternak's childhood home town. Also how amusing it is to see Durbin an AllAmerican Girl dressed up rather like Eva Braun! Durbin is so beautiful that it does not matter. The title SPRING PARADE makes no sense to the story line and that is a clue to understanding the larger but sad history of this film. The truth is that the film was first made by Pasternak in 1934 when he produced movies for Universal Studios in Austria and Hungary. Today the first film is identified by either of two names FRHLINGSPARADE or FRHJAHRSPARADE which mean spring's parade. It tells a probably somewhat fictionalized story of the composition of a famous Austrian military march the Deutschmeister Regiments Marsch by Wilhelm August Jurek in 1893. In the story Jurek is inspired by the rhythmic tapping of his girlfriend in an openair Viennese restaurant. The climax of the story comes at the end of the film when Emperor Francis Joseph I praises the march while reviewing his troops. Jurek's regiment plays it while passing by. The title SPRING PARADE in that context makes sense. In the Durbin version the march is replaced by the composition of a waltz. In 1934 Hitler had been chancellor only a year and a story about a popular march from 1893 was unexceptional. By 1940 however a movie about a rousing German march would be exceptional. The year 1893 gives the viewer of SPRING PARADE a peg to hang the story on. Now we know that it comes after the assassination of the Empress Elisabeth Sisi. It adds poignancy to the scenes of the lonely emperor in his royal apartments. In the 1934 film Joe Pasternak made a big mistake. The screen credits attributed the story to Ernst Marischka but in fact Marischka wrote the screen play from an original story by Ernst Neubach who was not credited. After World War II Neubach settled in France. In 1949 he sued Universal Studios for violation of his copyright and won. Universal Studios lost all rights to what was for them a most cherished film. And it disappeared from the public square. No studiomade VHS DVD or BluRay disc has ever appeared. One can reasonably wonder about its current status as a property. Has it passed into the public domain? In 1955 FRHJAHRSPARADE was remade in color by Ernst Marischka with the title DIE DEUTSCHMEISTER starring a young Romy Schneider. Wouldn't it be nice if say a manufacturer like the Criterion Collection would release a threefilm set with FRHLINGSPARADEFRHJAHRSPARADE 1934 SPRING PARADE 1940 and DIE DEUTSCHMEISTER 1955 all restored with extras like sections subtitles and commentary? Detailed information about SPRING PARADE can be downloaded in PDF format from the academic journal Modern Austrian Literature Volume 32 Number 3 or 4 1999 Special Issue Austria in Film. The paper is Spring Parade 1940 Imperial Austria Lives Again at Universal by JanChristopher Horak pp. 7486. The Packard Campus of the National AudioVisual Conservation Center of the U. S. National Archives at Culpeper Virginia owns a copy of SPRING PARADE and they have given it at least three public showings. It is probably a clean positive without breaks. The music of SPRING PARADE is significant with a fine march two waltzes and a comic song by Prof. Robert Stolz from 1934. The talented Gus Kahn contributed new lyrics to the music that Durbin sings. Charles Previn of Universal added his own march which is very fine and needs to be heard today. Finally Mr. Kahn wrote lyrics to Hans J. Salter's Blue Danube Dream which reworks the Blue Danube Waltz. Durbin's performance of this is magnificent. Just on the music alone this film has cultural significance. It and its sister films should be conserved restored and seen again as they were meant to be seen.".

	schema:headline " This is a good movie but transfer needed a better source";
	schema:reviewBody "I purchased a VHS copy from Movies Unlimited that was in new condition. The tape however had some flaws possibly related to the source material. It looked like there was a few seconds missing between a couple of reel changes and a dropout possibly due to missing material or a bad master. It's difficult to tell. The footagesound was also distorted at times for some of the songs which could be due to my tracking on my VCR. I had to set the tracking manually to get the best picture and my VCR won't go to auto track once a manual setting is set. My parents have a cheaper VCR and played the tape with auto tracking. The tape had a bit of fuzz near the bottom of it but the audio may have been a little better with worse video. The transfer was produced by some small company with Hollywood in their name. It was better than not having access to the title. Of course I wished for better footage.As far as the theme and subject of the movie this movie is almost in the same vein as the original Good Fairy in that the actress in both films is playing a country girl with little experience going to the big city. This in a sense is a type of variation in the Good Fairy theme with different typical Deanna Durbin musical twists. If your a fan of Deanna Durbin films you'll find this has all the typical things that happen in one of her musicals. When there's a problem she'll usually end up singing her way out of them. In this case there are a few minor plot differences and twists that aren't in a typical Deana film yet enough of the same types of things that a fan will feel at home in watching this movie. This movie might rate as one of the top 5 or 6 of her films. And I give it a high rating SK skuddles is in a typical role as well. I think other criticisms of this film are to harse. I think this is a fine light Deanna Durbin film with enough quality to make it rate highly in a film you should watch if your a fan of her movies. The only problem is the transfer and copy that's available. I own a nonlinear editing system and wonder about the chance of finding a 16mm copy of this and maybe actually making an attempt at a transfer and edit into the other copy giving me a better master for my own home use. I almost feel like going after this as a personal restoration project but I'm afraid there isn't decent source material to be found and think that the one out there is probablyunfortunately the best source available.These kinds of things happen. Of course you have to rate this within a mindset of when it was produced and the type of movie it is. This is from a different era and to a large extent based on themes in Deanna's other copy of The Good Fairy movie theme mixed in with a little bit of the shop around the corner. It's a good theme mix. In some ways it's almost a perfect composite of other Deanna and other classic films because it has so much other little things put in. Having so many little things in it makes the film appear and actually looser in it's script it's not as tight a script but it can't be because it's more of a mix of other film themes all thrown in together. But even with it's loose plot it fits together pretty well.I've put in my opinion without putting in enough to create a spoiler. I think it's worth watching and owning. If it came out from a good copy of 35mm interpositive wow I'd be really happy. I don't know if I can find better audio from her audio CD recordings that might be edited into a working dub but I'm tempted to look.Why do I watch these films. Well I put them together for my mom mostly. She likes light musicals with good singing and many of Deana Durbin films fit that bill very well. This film rates up there just below her best films in my opinion. There are 21 of her films out there. Many can only be had if you buy the PAL UK version of the DVD collection and do your own conversion to NTSC using a DVD player that can play Europeon PAL and transcode it back to the USA standard. Some of the PAL titles have distorted sound as well probably because the loss of decent film source copies of the movies. Truly a tragedy. Thank God for folks like Keno who try to restore and offer rare films before they are completely gone. Also one more correction. Deanna Durbin films being Black and White are not rare all of her films were black and white except one. This is due to her high popularity and the studio had to cut corners to afford to have her in the film so they cut by not shooting in color for all of her films except one.If your looking for an awesome older musical with charm check out some of her movies. Totally family friendly with some great film moments in many of them.".

Well I put them together for my mom mostly. She likes light musicals with good singing and many of Deana Durbin films fit that bill very well. This film rates up there just below her best films in my opinion. There are 21 of her films out there. Many can only be had if you buy the PAL UK version of the DVD collection and do your own conversion to NTSC using a DVD player that can play Europeon PAL and transcode it back to the USA standard. Some of the PAL titles have distorted sound as well probably because the loss of decent film source copies of the movies. Truly a tragedy. Thank God for folks like Keno who try to restore and offer rare films before they are completely gone. Also one more correction. Deanna Durbin films being Black and White are not rare all of her films were black and white except one. This is due to her high popularity and the studio had to cut corners to afford to have her in the film so they cut by not shooting in color for all of her films except one.If your looking for an awesome older musical with charm check out some of her movies. Totally family friendly with some great film moments in many of them.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was remade by Ernst Marischka the original story writer of this film in 1955 with Romy Schneider as Die Deutschmeister. having seen both the movies I found that the second one was far superior to this which is a rarity. Normally when the movies are remade the socalled superiority is attained by more glitz and in the way it weakens the plot. But not in this case. I like both the heroines Deanna as well as Romy and incidentally they were almost the same age when their respective movies were made Deanna must have been about 18 and Romy about 17. If I compare the two Deanna was a bit superior as far as this moviepair is concerned but Romy matured only after she stopped Sissy and similar movies. The other superiority of this movie is obviously the Deanna's singing Probably to overcome that Marischka didn't make the other one Musical. And the male lead Robert Cummins too in my opinion was better than Siegfried Breuer. But there it stops.The plot and the story was far superior and engrossing in the German movie whereas this particular movie has too many loopholes in the plot.If I leave alone the actors who were American Marischka and Pasternak were AustroHungarians Koster was German under this conditions the mistakes made seem quite surprising. Thankfully Marischka corrected them and also changed the plot a bit in the German movie.Probably due to these glaring errors I could not really enjoy the movie despite Deanna and some very good songs. The role of Koster's future wife Peggy Moran seems to be interesting. She is introduced as Archduchess but definitely she wasn't one. Emperor's Aide Wiedlemeyer should have contradicted at that point after all he might have missed Counts Minor Princess'  some Duchess' but definitely not an Archduchess. In addition her behavior or even Marten's didn't fit the chair. Similar to this there are many other loopholes including the meeting with Emperor where Deanna didn't really maintain the 'Awe' which would be natural or later the attempt to refuse Kaiser's invitation which everyone should know is an Order in a disguise and are nonrefuseable. To summarise watching once was a bit drag but not too much of it but it is not repeatable the other one being more coherent is a far better watch.".

Deanna is Ilonka a peasant girl from a small village far out in the boondocks with the hayseed still literally sticking to her. A hawker at the village fair sells her a fortune which predicts she will marry an artist in Vienna meet the Emperor and other nonsense which Ilonka swallows whole. Arriving in Vienna almost by accident she immediately starts rubbing her hayseed customs up against the sophistication of the city with close to disastrous results in some cases and situations the writers seem to have thought funny in others. Witness the scene in a ritzy Vienna caf when Ilonka haggles with the waiter about the price of a serving of asparagus and the waiter gives in! This kind of humour palls rather quickly. One could go on as Ilonka pursues her fortune but you get the idea. If this isn't enough for Deanna to deal with there is the constant sabotage from those two most annoying brats of all cinema sometimes known as Butch and Buddy. This is something of a departure for Deanna who tries valiantly against heavy odds especially having to sing a succession of boring waltz songs! And contend with Bob Cummings boisterous performance at the same time.One doesn't know how well this did at the box office when in general release but since Universal never issued a VHS or DVD they must have written it off as a regrettable mistake. Not even in the UK where the rest of the Durbin canon is available in PAL format is a good VHS or DVD available.

	schema:headline " An Excellent FrenchCanadian Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a sometimes touching sometimes disturbing and sometimes funny look at a girl's transition from childhood to womanhood. Hanna's the main character life story closely mirrors the development of Quebecois society and the film's 1963 setting furthers that idea. Hanna is caught between her father's Jewish background and her mother's traditional Catholic upbringing. She spends her summers in rural Quebec while living in the rapidly changing city of Montreal. Also she is influenced by JeanLuc Godard's nowclassic Vivre sa vie and Hanna attempts to emulate the behaviours of that film's prostitute protagonist. This is a film very concerned with the beauty of selfexpression while also acknowledging the challenges such pursuits present to us all seen especially in the father's tormented dream of being a poet. Though the film deals with some very traumatic subject matters it also leaves us with a glimmer of hope that is beautiful in its ambiguity.Lea Pool's direction wavers between high degrees of realism and stunning experimental styles and she weaves them together seamlessly to reflect Hanna's state of mind. Lovers of classical cinema will certainly enjoy this film. Some of the camera worksuch as the film's opening few minutes and Hanna's flight through the streets of Montrealare nothing short of spectacular.Finally the acting of the film's central three characters Hanna her father and her mother is exceptional. Hanna's exchanges with her exhausted mother are genuine and heartfelt while the fits of rage directed toward her father are equally so. Both parents play their roles with enough pathos to be convincing but they stay well away from overacting or exceeding what the script requires of them.Young people may struggle to identify with the themes of the film but a slightly older audience will certainly be left with much to reflect upon.".

A good story a wonderful sense of image and the actors are all very well directed. I think this is an effort for Pool to go mainstreem. But for me as an historian this movie have big problems... The story is set in 1963 the song Mockingbird heard in the movie tells me that. The way Leo Pool describes Quebec society and the culture of the French Canadians of the time had nothing to do with 1963.  It's all look like 197376. It had no historical respect of the facts of 1963. For example Lea Pool shows us the JeanLuc Godard movie Vivre sa vie and the young Karine Vanasse identifies herself to Anna Karina in that movie. In the early sixties most of the nouvelle vague French cinema like this Godard film were not released in Quebec. By that time censorship was very strong and I'm sure that the prostitute character of miss Karina in that Godard film was banned from the Board of Censorship.  The Godard movie is from 1962. By that time French movies always takes three and sometimes four years to get to Quebec's movie theatres. For me it's impossible that this movie was shown in Quebec in 1963. Let's also say that in 1963 the legal age to go to a movie house was 16. But Karine Vanasse is 13 in that movie! Also the way the father of Karine Vanasse wear his hairs is absolutely 197375! The facts that most of the young girls wore trousers is also strange! So is the girl kissing Karine her brother kissing her in a so natural way is simply impossible. Lea Pool was born in Switzerland. She cames to Quebec en 1978. Critics says that Emportemoi was about her life as a young teenager. It could be better if the film was set in Europe. In Europe the Godard film was shown the cultural aspects of the people were more liberal than in Quebec who was still a very Catholic and conservative society by that time. These little facts annoyed me. When you make a movie set in the past it's very important to respect the period. Leo Pool didn't. I don't mean that Emportemoi is a bad movie. Not at all! It's fanastic and young Karine is superb so is the great Pascale Bussires our best actress in Quebec and Canada. But if an historian was part of the crew to tells miss Pool what's illogic it could be a lot better.".

Graded by the standards of its genre it works.It's about two kids one of whom is played by Johnny Depp who gain access to a private resort in the middle of the Caribbean presumably. There's no backdrop. We don't even know how they got in to the resort. And they look about 16 so it's odd to see them going after women in their 30s and 40s sometimes succeeding.Depp wasn't famous yet correct me if I'm wrong but this was his first starring role in a film to speak of? and this certainly didn't help boost his career he took a considerably smaller role in Oliver Stone's Platoon the year after but he displays charisma and good charm that would carry on into his later movies.The film's takeitasitis attitude makes it entertaining. It's a simple sex comedy with crude laughs and running gags a lot of which aren't very funny a few of which are almost all of which are at the least amusing.Worth catching if you see it on cable some time.".

I'm thinking of movies like Fraternity Vacation Hot Dog Malibu Express etc.Private Resort is one of those movies for me. I'm really surprised it is not more popular and a 3.7 IMDb rating just seems insanely low to me.You've got Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow very early in their careers running around and getting into all this wacky hi jinx at a fancy Florida resort. Although they came just to have some fun and chase some girls they find themselves getting into a bunch of different hilarious situations. Hector Elizondo is also really funny in this movie as the bad guy with the bad toupee. And who can forget Andrew Dice Clay in a memorable role?Definitely not an Oscarcaliber epic but just one of those hilarious 80's sex romps. These types of movies disappeared for about 10 years but I'm glad to see the cycle is coming back around with movies like American Pie Old School Eurotrip etc. Lots of laughs gorgeous babes and fun in the sun. This is a pretty underappreciated 80's comedy classic in my opinion.".

However that means it is the best of the 4 or 5 spring break comedies that came out between 19831985 really the only two years of the 1980's that had spring break comedies. Therefore I'm talking about movies like Spring Break Where the Boys Are Hot Resort and Fraternity Vacation so which also means this is pretty much just a sex comedy. Of all these Private Resort is by far and away the best one. It follows two young guys Depp and Morrow who are just looking to get laid and in the meantime get in trouble with hotel security Andrew Dice Clay and Hector Elizondo before his Chicago Hope days. Also not to mention the beautiful girls throughout the movie but what else do you expect? As a result this is a truly underrated sex comedy but don't bother to watch it on Comedy Central because like Casino and Goodfellas it has to be seen uncut.  out of BABABA BABABABABA......".

Meanwhile a jewel thief looks to steal a diamond necklace from a martial arts expert grandmother. It's definitely very silly but highly amusing. There's plenty of slapstick and overall cheesiness but the humour works and it has the right energy. Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow's onscreen camaraderie is a delight to watch as they provide the funniest scenes. Both actors have come a long way since and it was fun to see them as their young selves playing horny kids. Hector Elizondo is funny too. There's plenty of nudity to keep the viewer further entertained. It also depicts the 80's fashion with big puffy hair and funny clothes. Overall it's a fun little flick that has some nostalgic value.".

I recommend this to any person who has not seen it yet. Even though the movie is 15 years old 1985 it is very very funny.As a good comedy I'll give it an 8 out of 10.";

The chaos and confusion that ensued had me glued to the screen for the rest of the film. Great slapstick comedy hilarious situations and all the actors were excellent.

And the script makes sure to include plenty of outrageous farcical situations in which to place our protagonists and antagonists. It's a gorgeouslooking picture in more ways than one with very polished photography and the pacing is acceptable enough to make the picture clock in at a fairly painless 82 minutes. It's not always terribly funny  in fact sometimes it is lame and awkward  but it does have enough chuckleworthy moments to make it an okay view.There are a notable amount of familiar faces here. Rob Morrow and Johnny Depp right near the beginnings of their careers are Ben and Jack two young adults who are guests of the title locale. Their obvious mission is to score as much action as they can but fate will have other things in store for them. The main story thread is that when Jack attempts to get it on with Bobbie Sue Leslie Easterbrook best known as Callahan in the Police Academy series the two of them end up incurring the wrath of a supposedly professional jewel thief The Maestro Hector Elizondo.Rob and Johnny are lively and engaging although it's been said that the two of them were so embarrassed by the movie that they vowed to track down and destroy every copy! Elizondo certainly does look embarrassed but he still soldiers on admirably and he and the rest of the cast do attempt to milk the material for as many laughs as they can. Emily Longstreth Karyn O'Bryan Hilary Shepard Ms. Easterbrook and Lisa London offer lots of eye candy and it's also fun to see people like Dody Goodman Michael Bowen The Diceman a.k.a. Andrew Clay and Tony Azito.Private Resort is no classic but fans of the genre will likely be satisfied.Six out of 10.".

Leslie Easterbrook plays his MILF wife.It is all rather crude farcical and hapless. The film has a thin plot and is not really funny but contains enough TA to keep horny teenagers of the time happy.

If you're not into very violent movies this isn't for you. It was action packed and pretty intense squeezing in an actual storyline with all the gore was pretty seamless. The fight Choreography was fantastic and the cinematography was beautiful reminiscent of the Kill Bill series as far as blood and choreography. The last fight scenes have to be my favorite out of any actionmartial arts film and had me in awe. The lead actor Rain does a good job and the overall storyline was fairly well written. I read that the screenplay was rewritten in 50some hours I'm not sure what it was before but the outcome was decent. All in all a good flick and I recommend it highly.".

It's quite obvious that the people responsible for this film set out to make the most ass kicking Ninja movie ad they even one uped themselves. i remember when I was younger Ninjas were kinda cool but since than they've lost their flair and so has the martial arts genre in general this one brings all that back with a hellacious gut punch. Visually the film is incredible. It's unlike anything you've ever seen. The fighting is quick furious and the story although not completely involving is involving enough so that we kinda like the characters. What the film does explosively well is decapitate disembowel and explode it's victims across it's blood soaked screen. Imagine slow motion shots of a man diving out of the way of 100's of ninja stars slicing people in half with samurai swords and being born out of shadows literally. It's an exciting piece of cinematic brilliance. i can't speak for the actual quality of this film despite the visual flair but I don't think anyone seeing Ninja assassin will be going in with a too critical eye. It delivers on its title and the trailer's promises and more. It's just freaking crazy as hell.".

Have a ton of Ninjas kill each other. Ninja Assassin is a fun guys night out type movie at least that's how I saw this movie. Though some people walked out booing I walked out cheering because I came in and honestly just wanted a huge body count and a ton of blood and boy did they deliver.My only major critique was the CGI blood... Though there were gallons of it coming out they could have stepped it up some more...In a way this movie was like Rambo...Equal budget of 50 million unbelievable carnage and pure fun... But the difference is that its acrobatic its hacking slashing gallons of blood and Ninjas with blades on chains  ...So all in all a solid 810 for me.PS.

There is a lot of bloodshed in this martial arts fest.The story of the movie is good and keeps going at a good pace so you never feel bored. Of course the story is straight forward and have no surprise twists to the plot  but an action movie of this caliber doesn't need plot twists.The martial arts choreography and fighting scenes are brilliant fast and hard punching. There are lots of really cool weapons being used in the movie as well.There is just one bad thing to the movie and that is why would an ancient clan of Japanese ninjas speak English? It makes no sense as Japanese people are bound to traditions. But of course I suppose this is kept in English to reach a wider audience. But had they actually done it in Japanese there would be a much more wholesome feel to the movie. And also again why would a Japanese clan take in nonJapanese children and train as ninjas?Anyway the cast of the movie is good and it is refreshing to see new faces to the martial arts scene. The dialogue is straight to the point no clumsy halfhearted dialogue going on here which also helps the movie to keep going.So if you like ninja movies and action movies this is definitely a movie you cannot allow to miss out on. Top notch action from beginning till end. But do take notice that there is a lot of blood in this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "If the Wachowski brothers' Speed Racer was the ultimate tribute to family friendly classic cartoons Ninja Assassin is the ultimate tribute to 80s martial arts B movies like Enter the Ninja video games like Ninja Gaiden and the Ultraviolent anime genre titles like Ninja Scroll.Already noticed the name ninja in all the titles mentioned? well what a coincidence!. It is violent it is bloody and packed to the gills with action. Every thing else ends up playing second fiddle to the fights.Unfortunately every else also includes the story which is a hodgepodge of very familiar elements. Raizo played by Korean star Rain is an orphan raised by a cruel master Lord Ozunuplayed by Sho Kosugi famous for his starring roles in what else 80s ninja movies like Enter the ninja. to be part of a secret clan of ninjas that have been responsible for countless assassinations over the centuries. Through a series of flashbacks intercut with scenes of a half naked hunky Rain training with some vicious looking weapons Raizo's tragic story is fleshed out. We see his tormented childhood days as a ninja trainee his only emotional refuge an orphan girl who like Raizo is part of the clan. One day his friend tries to escape from the harsh ninja way of life and is executed prompting a change of heart in Raizo who eventually betrays his clan after a narrowly botched mission. Now on the run hunted by both his former comrades and a special international task force Raizo finds an unlikely ally in the form of Mika Coretti a Europol agent who is close to exposing the secret existence of the Ninjas and hence targeted for assassination.Simply put the unoriginal storyline is highly predictable and filled with B movie clichs from stem to stern. It is a definite step down from the philosophical Matrix trilogy or the sophisticated and political V for Vendetta. Characters are at best cardboard cut outs and at worse painfully bland. None of them come across as emotionally engaging. Raizo is especially underdeveloped despite being the main character. His internal motives for his betrayal are never fully explored and the cheesy romance bit not to mention the whole big about the heart' feels like a tackedon afterthought. The acting is passable nothing better than the level of a TV series but the script manages to have a couple of witty lines of dialog.Though Ninja Assassin is no work of storytelling perfection it delivers what it promises lots of fights and lots of violence. Limbs are lobbed off stomachs are split open and heads are busted as the movie slashes its way from one fight scene to the next delivering scenes of wicked weapons and bloody carnage that make even Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like a tame PG film. The fight choreography is well executed with a good mix of slow motion and frantic closeups. Special effects and CGI are used to effectively give the movie a very comic booklike feel not surprising since the Wachowski brothers are avid comic fans and one of the screenplay writers is also a comic book writer. Thankfully some erratic camera work especially during the scene where Raizo is being chased through a busy street does not feel distracting but enhances the frantic and lightning fast pace of the fights. Blood flows like rivers as Raizo proceeds to disembowel enemies en masse definitely not for the squeamish.On a whole Ninja Assassin feels like a hackandslash video game come to life from the first skirmish to the climatic showdown involving modern day special forces taking on an army of ninja warriors . Some cheesy bits here and there require a certain suspension of disbelief but the film's portrayal of ninjas in general is gritty and realistic yet preserves their mysterious and legendary status. It is refreshing too to see that Raizo is not some invincible killing machine as he does tire and he does take his fair share of hits even going down a couple of times.Forget Naruto and all those brightly dressed magic power spewing ninjas of recent anime. Ninja Assassin is the buttkicking face slashing answer to all that. A respectable reimaging of a dated genre and 99 minutes of nonstop violent escapism once you look past its narrative flaws.".

	schema:reviewBody "Teen ninja protg Raizo Joon Lee confesses to the love of his life fellow student Kiriko Anna Sawai I have no heart in Ninja Assassin. Raizo has sacrificed all to transform himself into the perfect weapon. His Sensei Ozunu the great Sho Kosugi reminds the grown Raizo charismatic Rain the orphan he trained as a son Never forget who you are. The Way of the Ninja is merciless and unforgiving and Kiriko's life is forfeit. Raizo now renegade seeks only vengeance upon the Ozunu Clan. The perfect assassin must now become benevolent protector and avenging angel? Raizo discovers who he really is.This is the paradox of Director James McTeigue's bloody and stylish Ninja Assassin. Although the story by Matthew Sand and J. Michael Straczynski glosses upon this internal conflict in a standard issue vengeance tale the spectacular bloody mayhem and Rain's cool presence overcome much of the routine narrative exercise. Ninja Assassin does not always make sense but it is captivating to watch. Whether it is blindfolded Raizo wielding his chain and blade against sword wielding rival Takeshi or Raizo fighting to the death in a burning clan compound the movie is engrossing.Rain as Raizo has a commanding screen presence. I don't think Rain is a trained martial artist. However he is a trained dancer handsome with a shredded body. Working with martial arts choreographer Chad Stahelski student of Dan Inosanto Rain generates a graceful deadly fighting style. McTeigue's quick cut editing may mask some of the martial arts precision or may be this is just his kinetic visual style. The sword fighting is more kung fu than bushido but the effect is slick and powerful. Martial arts master Kosugi as Ozunu displays the more traditional katana technique in the climactic duel with Raizo. Ninja Assassin has visually stunning and bloody martial arts fighting scenes.Set in Berlin Europol Agent Mika Coretti intrepid and spirited Naomie Harris believes that the recent series of brutal political assassinations are the work of a mythical Ninja Clan. Her boss Maslow solid Ben Miles is reluctant to engage Mika's theory however he too discerns a shadowy conspiracy. When Mika get too close to uncovering the Ozunu Clan Takeshi strong and malevolent Rick Yune and his ninja seek to kill her. Raizo Rain is forced to protect Mika who inadvertently interferes in Raizo's revenge and his deadly score to settle with Takeshi.Raizo is now compelled to protect Mika with his life. During the Ninja attack at Europol Headquarters he tells Mika They won't stop until you're dead. Mika finally gets that Raizo is the only one who can save her. Aside from some trite attempts at skewed martial arts wisdom about pain and vanquishing weakness Ninja Assassin is a decent hero story. Raizo is sympathetic in his transformation. Trained to be the perfect shadowy assassin one must know that he is not really a good guy. Rain as Raizo is compelling in this paradox. Raizo's vengeance is very human but as noble protector he becomes hero.Ninja Assassin ultimately works despite itself. Director McTeigue brilliantly avoids tripping over himself by allowing the visceral action to morph and evolve. And Raizo is not some invincible cartoonhe is brutally bloodied in his horrendous battles. Ninja Assassin is thoroughly engrossing escapist fare.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie about Ninjas doing Ninja things being stealthy practicing badass moves and killing lots of other Ninjas. If you don't mind a plot that comes straight out of a not very good video game there is enjoyment to be had here. Sho Kosugi is excellent as the master ninja and a great choice for throwback fans of much better Ninja films like Revenge of the Ninja last time I saw it I was 8 years old so... . Rain the hero ninja barely says a word through the movie and when he does he sounds a lot like another immortal swordsman Christopher Lambert.Unfortunately the Wachowski siblings seem to be getting much worse at special effects. Some of the scenes look absolutely unbelievable and the Ninja training ground almost looks like a student work for a 3D class. It must be noted that the extremely graphic decapitations look great though. Each decapitation is enhanced with buckets of blood that will make any Tarantino fan giddy with dark and kind of disturbing joy.If you're looking for a realistic Ninja movie I know I am I guess you'll have to Watch Leon again and pretend he's Asian. There are a billion plot holes here Ninjas are unkillable until the movie decides they should be cannon fodder. Your suspension of disbelief will be pushed into overdrive but in the end a movie about Ninjas doing Ninja things is always going to be at least decent. Well if you're into low art anyway.Oh and the movie gets an extra point for playing Being Boiled by Human League during the end credits.".

Gimme some Ong Bak or even some Bloodsport and I'll be satisfied.This is not a martial arts movie. This is not even an entertaining action movie in the slightest.The story amounts to REVENGE! like all good action movie plots huh? and of course the acting and dialogue is never up to par. But you don't come into a movie called Ninja Assassin looking for Mametlike dialogue do you? The prerequisite action is here...kinda. If by action you mean we're going to CGI the crap out of these fight scenes and make everything all blurry and dark so you don't see how bad they actually are. That's what you meant right? Rain I feel is a pretty good looking chap who's about as charismatic in the role as an Asian pop star pretending to be a martial arts master can be. And when he's laying waste to dozens upon dozens of pajama clad ninjas in some fairly slick  wellchoreographed fight scenes that comes maybe 50 minutes into the movie you almost find yourself enjoying the film. But then we see a ridiculous amount of blood being shed heads being cut off and severed arms flying at the screen. That's the exact moment where you'll find yourself completely taken out of the action. You'll then realize how stupid all of this is and how there's absolutely nothing entertaining about CGI fight scenes in a liveaction martial arts movie. It's a copout you start to wonder whether Ninja Assassin is an actual movie or just the trailer for the video game tiein.At this point your mind begins to wander. You find yourself asking questions such as Why is this movie so fake? What's the point of having cool fight scenes if you just crap it up with ridiculously fake CGI blood and gore? Why does RickyOh seem like a far more realistic and realized martial arts film when compared to this mess? Why did I spend my money to watch this film?.Luckily for you you have the ability to spare yourself from asking that last question.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read several reviews that were harping on the film and making comments about how many people walked out of the theater after the first 15 minutes. If any human being actually went into a film called Ninja Assassin and walked out in 15 minutes...they deserve losing their ticket money. How can you possibly go into a film called Ninja Assassin even if you had no idea what the plot was and be disappointed because the film gives you exactly what the title says it is. So I went in with the expectations of seeing Ninjas and Assassins and low and behold that is exactly what I got. But imagine my shock when it turned out that critics were once again wrong!! The film actually does have plot and in fact they give a solid back story on the main character set up a really solid story and deliver the most blood splattering ridiculously over the top violent film I've seen all year and sometimes that's just fun!! Are there gaping plot holes? Yes of course. Is some of the story cheesy a little but hey I expected the entire film to be nothing but cheese and much to my surprise it was remarkably serious with decent performances and some very classically artistic special effects. Well worth the price of admission for a solid action flick with a throw back to Ninja films of old.Korean music star Rain heads the cast as the outcasted Ninja trainee Raizo. Rain moves like a dancer and his martial arts is literally pure poetry making this film less cheese and more stunning just by his work. His quiet brooding character isn't exactly full of flare but he still makes a decent hero although he feels a little empty. I'm not sure he's come to his own in acting. Naomie Harris is lovely and plays Europol Researcher Mika. Much like the character of Raizo she isn't given a lot to work with but she has a good screen chemistry and her and Rain make a good team. She actually almost makes it believable she could go up against unstoppable Ninja's with a gun and pure wit. Ben Miles plays a sadly small role since I think he could have done something with the role. He plays lead Europol agent Maslow and I just felt like I wanted to know more about his character but he's basically supporting at best.Director James McTeigue certainly has an action career ahead of him. Having worked on the Matrix series Dark City and a Star Wars sequel he certainly has some great experience under his belt. He also scored big with V for Vendetta which was brilliantly made. You can see McTeigue's style even in this film with the incredible way the Ninja's move in the shadows without making it seem cheesy or chock full of CGI. The story which critics harped on claiming none existed is not full of depth but it is still there. On top of that we get a complete background on the main character and where he grew up and how he was trained to be what he is. The battles were brilliant and blood was flying everywhere. The death scenes were ridiculous and over the top but still horrendously gore filled. This is truly a red blooded action flick that will leave you cheering. Will it walk away with awards? Definitely not but is it worth the price of admission? Hands down yes! An awesome action flick which is harshly critiqued. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Ninja Assassin is set in Berlin where Europol researcher Mika Coretti Naomie Harris has a possible lead on several assassinations Mika believes that Government's are paying a Japanese clan of Ninja assassins to take out anyone they want. The last bureau investigator to make the connection Alexsei Sabatin Wladimir Tarasjanz was thrown out of Europol  was then murdered Mika is convinced she is right  continues to pursue her theory  talks to Alexi's widow who gives Mika a file about the Ozu Ninja clan that her late husband had built up. Going back to her apartment Mika is attacked by the Ozu Ninja who now want her dead as she is too close but Mika is saved by another Ninja who introduces himself as Raizo Rain who was once a member of the Ozu clan but turned his back on them after they killed his girlfriend  now wants to bring them down. On the run from the Ozu clan  Europol both Raizo  Mika have to deal with Ninja assassins  armed police as they go on the run...This American  German coproduction was directed by James McTeigue  if you want lots of bloody Ninja fighting action  martial arts moves then Ninja Assassin is the film you need to see if your a Ninja martial arts or action film fan then it's very hard not to like Ninja Assassin. First of all the plot isn't anything groundbreaking a superhuman Ninja assassin decides killing people isn't the life for him so turns against his master  clan  sets out to put an end to the Ozu Ninja assassins. The first half of Ninja Assassin is split between the present day action of Europol agent Mika uncovering the existence of the Ozu Ninja  flashbacks from Raizo chronicling his brutal training  the events that had lead up to the present situation I will certainly give the script credit for trying to inject some heart  feeling into the Ninja  giving him some proper strong reasons for his bloody revenge even if it is still a little simplistic. At 100 odd minutes the pace is good  the second half features some truly spectacular Ninja  martial arts fights the likes of which I can't remember seeing before. I did question the climax somewhat though how did Mika get Raizo to swallow that homing device? Why did Europol turn up at the motel if the homing device was on Raizo? How did Mika know the Ozu Ninja would just take Raizo rather than kill him  her there  then? I suppose you could come up with plausible answers for these questions though so it's not a deal breaker or a film killer.I watched Ninja Assassin on Bluray last night  it looked mightily impressive the Bluray also features a few deleted scenes which expand on the investigation by Mika a little bit but nothing major was cut. Where Ninja Assassin excels is with it's fight scenes there are some fantastically cool martial arts scenes here from the Ozu Ninja attacking a Europol building to a great fight on a road with speeding cars zooming past the fighters to the climax set inside a burning dojo with embers floating in the air everywhere as sworn enemies fight to scenes of Raizo slicing the bad guy's up with a razor sharp blade on the end of a long chain. Ninja Assassin is probably as good as the final Ninja scene from Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 2003 only in colour so the copious amounts of blood splatter can be seen in it's full glory. Make no mistake about it Ninja Assassin is maybe the goriest big budget Hollywood flick to get a theatrical release heads are chopped in half bodies are cut in half arms legs fingers  heads are severed people are stabbed cut chopped up  the amount of blood is often quite staggering. I also liked how the makers made the Ninja assassins of stealth who moved silently through the shadows  only show glimpses of them for the first few action scenes. There are plenty of cool poses  stylised action moves to keep one entertained  amused some of the Ninja weaponry is cool too with some seriously dangerous looking Shruiken.With a supposed budget of about 40000000 this is very well made even on high definition Bluray the CGI blood looked alright actually filmed in Berlin in Germany. The acting is fine Rain is apparently a Korean pop star but does look the part here  he obviously trained hard. Sh Kosugi comes out of retirement to play the bad guy in his first film role since Drug Connection 1993.Ninja Assassin isn't going to win any awards for it's intellectual storytelling although it does try to give it's main Ninja character's a bit of depth it's the gloriously gory violent  stylish martial arts fights where Ninja Assassin really delivers the good. The Bluray looks great too by the way.".

The head guy here was more of a Darth Vader and his top student rebels out of some sense of morality. This is one of the few times we have been reminded that ninja were the bad guys. Though they still have magical powers here there is the hint that they would rely on treachery over skill. There is of course no suspense regarding the outcome.But the other is the manner in which the action scenes have been framed for cinema. All these martial art movies emphasize the performance more than the combat. Sometimes the camera gets involved these things are inherently cinematic which is why we have them. But rarely is there some cameraaware innovation.A reader put me on to this otherwise I never would have bothered. Lana Wachowski seems to have had a hand in the middle action sequence. The ones at the beginning and end are ordinary. But the one starting with our young hero escaping from captivity is clearly an experiment by Wachowski and his support team.You don't need a great movie to have these cinematic advances. Transformers and then Speed Racer were dumb as dumb as this but they added to the visual imagination in ways that matter. In this case it is all about slicing time manipulating light in extreme ways and suspending ambiguous causality. I almost imagine that this got made in large part as experiment for whatever the Wachowskis do next.

	schema:reviewBody "Criticizing the Ninja Assassin ReviewersAfter reading a few of the reviews of the movie Ninja Assassins one thing you will notice is that each of the critics is using the same phrases to describe this movie. Either these online critics are plagiarizing themselves or one critic is selling his review to multiple news agencies. I have been noticing this trend in movie reviews for some time now. If these so called critics are selling their reviews then it is unfair to print their messages without alerting the readers that these messages have been recirculated. If these reviews are from multiple sources then the news agencies that pay for them should seriously review their plagiarism policies. I checked the bylines and most have different authors if they are listed at all. You will notice the use of fan boys to describe the lover of martial art movies. The term fan boy is a new nomenclature only recently used within the past three years and cannot possibly be used to describe the decades long viewers of martial arts movies. My last complaint is with the reviews themselves. We do not need dialogue from the movie presented in the review. What is the purpose of including dialogue in the review is it to prove to your publishers that you actually attended the screening or is it that you cannot give a review without spoiling the show for the next potential viewer. Of the many reviews I have read only one offered a semblance of originality. M. Faust who writes for Art Voice a weekly newspaper the review can be read at www. Artvoice.com titled his review Overkill. Faust at least attempted to analyze the plot of the movie although the reviewer believes that plot was miniscule the writer at least acknowledged the existence of one most reviewers of this film claimed to not be able to find a plot to Ninja Assassins. I can only assume that the writers of some of these reviews were asked by their publishers to see the movie why else would they go unless they were a fan of the genre. Also see the reviews at the links below. The first two reviews use the term fan boy and you can find others by simply typing Ninja Assassins and fan boy in your web address search block.

If the body count is proportionate to how cool a ninja is then the unrelenting slaughter makes sense but the supernatural elements and camera tricks seem an unnecessary enhancement for the already believably elite killing machines. At least the creators know that nonstop action is what fans of the genre desire and the brutal combat barely lets up for the few snippets of plot to squeeze their way in. The equally relentless flashbacks hurt though not as much as razorsharp throwing stars to the face.Trained since childhood to be a deadly killer Raizo Rain has since turned his back on the Ozunu clan that raised him and now seeks revenge for their numerous heartless murders. Forced into becoming a coldblooded executioner watching his friends die at the hands of the barbarous teacher Sho Kosugi and being mercilessly tortured into resisting all human emotions fear and pain Raizo has years of pent up rage to unleash on hordes of betrayed ninja assassins. Teaming up with Europol investigator Mika Naomie Harris Raizo steadily butchers his enemies while inching ever closer to the longawaited bloody reunion with his former master.If there's anything impressive about Ninja Assassin it's the violence. Shockingly gruesome starting with a nauseating improvised tattooing opening sequence and graduating to noholdsbarred limbchopping bloodshed this film prides itself on inventing new ways to savagely dice up the human body. Definitely not for the squeamish the swordplay doesn't retain an exaggerated feel often enough  occasionally it's borderline realistically appalling. Extreme gratuitous and oftentimes comical the action is intense but the story is weak and the characters are very thinly drawn.With overdone cinematic fire garnishing the best fights chases through heavy traffic thundering noises annoyingly superhuman skills and more slicing cutting and stabbing than could ever be considered reasonable Ninja Assassin is exhaustingly awesome. A lethal monster trained to avoid feelings is difficult to sympathize with but some clever editing fixes the issue with surprising uniqueness. Comparable to the fourth Rambo film in the level of pure wanton bloodletting but not as realistic Ninja Assassin brings edged weapon gore to all new heights.The Massie Twins".

	schema:headline " Way too much credit is given by saying to check your brain at the door";
	schema:reviewBody "I loathed the very existence of Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. I knew I would hate it but somehow managed to go in hoping for the best with lowered expectations. It made things worse. After surviving that obnoxiously loud and repugnantly offensive film I figured I could make it through anything. Even something as silly looking as Ninja Assassin. But sadly I was incorrect.After a ridiculously awesome and gory opening scene setting the stage for what is to come Ninja Assassin jumps headfirst into the story of Raizo Rain a ninja living in Berlin who wants to claim revenge on the makeshift ninja orphanage that raised him. Through mindlessly edited flashbacks sequences the audience discovers how he became the ninja he is and why he seeks revenge. And there is even a subplot about Europol agents trying to find ninja gangs corrupt governments and kinds of other ideas better stuffed down the rabbit hole.In a word Ninja Assassin is just awful. I realize action flicks are usually left mindless for a reason but this film brings the word mindless to a new level. The confusing plot line is held together by mere threads throughout the film with no semblance of even attempting to try and make sense of itself. I realize I managed a description of the film but trying to piece together motivations actions and reactions is simply an exercise in futility. There is simply no point. And even looking at it simply as a genre flick made simply for people to either laugh at its stupidity during a drinking game at home or the type of movie people go to see to be wowed by the sheer amount of carnage on screen it simply fails to live up to any measure of decency that any good movie should.I was impressed by how much story the filmmakers manage to stuff into the film but after an hour of watching a half baked storyline padded out with heavily effects driven action sequences the film just became more boring than anything else. And for a movie that practically drowns in how much blood is spilled that says a lot. After the opening scene the film just fails to live up to its own desire to be a ridiculous actioner. It knows it has the ability to be the film that brings ninjas back to the box office in droves but it lacks the capacity to go the distance and truly be that film. Some scenes are just so horribly written that one wonders why anyone ever thought it was a good idea to make this movie.For anyone who argues that the action sequences that drive the film are what make the film acceptable think again. These scenes are so effects heavy so filled to the brim with CGI that I began questioning if Rain was a CGI character or not. I realize it is hard to make throwing stars fly through the air and look realistic when impaled into someone's chest or eye but there must have been a much better way to put some of these action scenes together than like this. It just feels so haphazard so badly choreographed. Remember when Bruce Lee and his stuntmen could pull sequences like these off in real life without the aid of a computer? Remember when the Wachowskis made The Matrix back in 1999 with all the fight scenes and sparingly used CGI well at least in comparison to its two effects happy sequels? Ninja Assassin is nothing like either of those examples and it is a real disappointment as a result. Some of the movements and money shotstyle deaths are simply incredible but they lose their lasting effect because of how silly and fake some of the effects look.Worse yet is the extremely obscene use of blood. Now I am not one to wince or be disgusted at the sight of a film simply filled to the top with blood. I adore Kill Bill Volume 1 and had a great time watching the absurdly noholdsbarred ending of Rambo. But even at their silliest the blood in those films stayed remotely realistic key word being remotely and was not overdone as much of an oxymoron as that sounds. But Ninja Assassin cakes on the blood in every scene ridiculously shooting out of every possible angle in every possible direction. And none of it looks real. The scars and after effects of what causes the injuries this blood spills from are really well done but every cause of injury is not. The blood is just too digitally animated for this kind of movie. It needs more in the way of realism in these wonderful makeup effects. Hell some of the shots are so dark and so quickly edited that it attempts to mask how horrible some of the blood effects look. Sure there are plenty of wow moments but not enough for any of this overused CGI to be acceptable.Getting into any pretense of discussing the acting is to acknowledge that there is in fact acting occurring during the film. Yes Rain surprised me but only because he spends most of the film grunting yelling or staying mute. As for the rest of the cast they either look uninterested confused or doing the same thing as Rain.It simply boggles my mind to think Ninja Assassin was ever made at all. It has a really bad ass opening sequence a few cool moments of action but no other redeeming qualities. It does not even become so bad that it becomes good. It quite honestly wallows away in silliness from beginning to end. I wish I could say this car crash of a film kept me mildly entertained but even that is giving it too much credit.2.510.".

Of all the movies that have Ninja's this one seems like it really had unlike the other ones where ninja's were mostly very good swordsman and martial arts. This one has almost all of the ninja characteristics like Stealth Healing Speed and Accuracy Coming to the plot its an extraordinary one but enough to show case the Ninjaness. Even though there might be lot of blood and violence its realistic and justifiable. The graphical effects could've been a little better If you love Ninja's and can tolerate a bit of violence then this is the movie for you. Don't justify this movie based on the rating from here as lot of people don't like to see blood n gore content and also its lack of plot would not satisfy people. There are a couple of scenes which you wouldn't like to miss if you love ninja stuff so watch out".

One of the most bloodiest movies i had past through as throughout the movie my little brother was closing his eyes on seeing the blood spill. No story base is seen in this one  to be true. But the action sequences adds the mush spice to the movie which holds back the viewers to the seat. Some sequences like those fight inside the toilet n the closing fight sequences were just rocking as this much thrill is what that lacks in now a days action flicks. Chinese teenage girl was cute by the way n emotional aspects did worked out on the flash back sequences. If you are an hardcore action lover who enjoys humor  cables  sword  blood  then Ninja Assassin is a sure watch. The genre is back guys. Am giving a perfect for this insane action flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably one of the best qualities not only God no I find in movies is honesty. It does not matter the genre or subgenre spoof action buddycomedy romcom or in Ninja Assassin's case ninja movies. If a movie is true to itself and its audience I respect it. One should not make a movie called Ninja Assassin and expect either a wide range of moviegoers or Oscars. It's made specifically for those interested in well ninja assassins.And boy they weren't lying. This was an ultimate ninja movie. Hardly original SEE Below extremely bloody gory yet ohsomuch fun.Raizo Rain is the top ninja at some secluded ninja academy where kids are kidnapped young called son and daughter of the master and turned into you guessed it ninja assassins. Only Raizo gets seduced by love SEE the JedI academy and when his one human contact with a rebellious young daughter with a heart gets a sword through that same organ things begin to change within Raizo.Given the opportunity to kill another disobedient young girl he snaps and escapes nearly dead SEE The Bourne Ultimatum. Present Day Ontherun Raizo protects Mika Harris while she's targeted for assassin due her investigation on the gangs of ninjas. His previous feeling emerge once again stating she too has a good heart. The rest of the movie plays out like too many movies to list but Raizo Mika and the entire policeSWAT battle the Ninjas. Ok for the finale SEE XMen The Last Stand. I've left out a lot so that not to give away too much. But I will say the movie starts off with a bang rarely lets up  action and blood galore and despite the clichs and multiple movie reference it was a joy to watch this strictly made for entertainment action and ninja action film. This also stems again from the movie never swaying from what it was meant to be in the first place. I can't imagine this movie would get a wide variety of viewers or huge boxoffice. But it should impress those with an urge to see lightentertainment with zero depth. Don't think too much and you'll probably find yourself wrapped up in their world.In addition to the movie's sincerity to its genre and me getting enthralled into the world of the secret ninja assassins I loved the blending to oldworld Ninja lore and the modern world. Instead of watching a movie like Jet Li's Hero there's more than a few scenes I loved watching with Ninja Vs. Guntoting Cops Ninja Vs. Car and fullon Ninjas Vs. SWAT team with modern warfare. Also I loved the trafficstreet fight scene. The bad it mimics hundreds of movies in a mere 99 minutes contains far too many flashbacks the blood is mostly CGI  that was distracting looked horribly fake and mostly humorous and they never ever proved to me that Raizo was the 1 assassin. I mean I truly believed The Bride was the best of the martial arttrained assassins in Kill Bill Vol. 1  2 thanks to Tarantino and that Bruce Wayne was the best of the martial artwarriors in Batman Begins thanks to Nolan. I'm guessing we're simply supposed to take their word for it but it was never really shown until only he can take on 50 guys at one time and survive albeit enormously cut up. Finally I understand their culture or at least the one portrayed in the movie but the severe attacks and abuse of the children was disturbing to say the least.Seriously would anyone go to see Ninja Assassin in the theatre or rent on DVD without the slightest clue of what to expect? Anyone expects anything different than the title itself or the poster is probably the same person disappointed when they saw Titanic and was upset it took place on a boat.I say see it only if you're into this sort of thing. It's not for kids  for the love of Pete it's extremely gory and bloody.Side Note Happy Mondo? I usually don't name names in my reviews but this guy has bugged from before the movie opened to weeks after to see this. Every day. EVERY day. Not because he would ever see it or enjoy it but he knows I typically find these types of movies silly and thought it would be a riot to poke fun at me. I guess this time I surprised even myself.".

	schema:headline " Touching story of WWII's forgotten victims";
	schema:reviewBody "I love the old WWII movies and how they portray what life was like for the men and women who served  and what it was like for the families etc. But of all the ones I've seen I don't think I've seen a single one that highlighted the plight of the children. I'm glad this one chose to bring this sad effect of war to the public in this film.The movie starts more like a documentary with a female narrator telling part of the story. At times the narration is a little annoying. But most of the rest of the film unfolds naturally without the narration. The film is a heartbreaking tale of the orphaned children of the war. They have nowhere to go and are shuttled from orphanages to resettlement centers. I was so shocked when I first saw the children  they looked so emaciated and dirty. They all seemed to have shellshocked expressions on their faces. I think the director Fred Zinnemandid a great job of casting and going for a realistic portrayal and not trying to gloss over the true realities. Being of Austrian Jewish heritage the story no doubt hit close to home for him.The actual location shooting in bombed out cities of Germany was also quite stark and realistic. I'm glad they chose not to try to replicate the devastation in a studio. Being filmed in 1948 3 years after the end of the war  I was shocked to see how much destruction was still evident with huge piles of rubble laying around. The cities looked deserted.This was one of Montgomery Clift's first films. He doesn't appear until 36 minutes into film. He delivers a fine performance given his inexperience although he was experienced on the stage. He is still in possession of his youthful good looks which deteriorated later. Too bad he lived such a young tragic life as he was quite a natural talent. The young boy is quite a good actor for his age and manages to express his desperation through his body language and action since he doesn't speak for almost 23's of the film.There are many memorable and shocking scenes the drowning of one of the children the young boy searching through a crowd of women for his mom several scenes of his wild and desperate attempts to escape at all costs and the hordes of children exiting from the train as they arrive at the settlement center. Many of these scenes are some I will never forget. I'm shocked so few people have seen this given only 37 comments and 1000votes on IMDb at this time. I highly recommend this film if you are interested in movies about the sad effects of war.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SEARCH MetroGoldwynMayer 1948 directed by Fred Zinnemann as mentioned after the opening credits was produced in Switzerland and in the United States occupied zone of Germany through the permission of the United States Army and through the cooperation of the I.R.O. It was the first postwar movie to be filmed in an occupied zone. Looking at the background of destroyed buildings and broken streets it's just a crucial reminder of the suffering amongst those European families and how horrible a war can be. Currently shown on Turner Classic Movies and once available on video it's become one of the most requested from viewers and rightfully so. Running at 105 minutes there isn't a single frame wasted in the story no scenes are unnecessary. The plot in brief Set in post World War II a war orphan Ivan Jandl in his only movie role is sheltered by an American G.I. Montgomery Clift while all that time his mother Jarmila Novotna who has survived the hardship of the concentration camp searches for him knowing in her heart that he is very much alive. And when the G.I. decides he wants to take the boy he calls Jim back with him to America suspense builds for the viewers knowing that the mother is not that far away and how they nearly miss each other in a couple of scenes. Aside from this being Clift's first movie to be released and his second film role and that Ivan Jandl as Karel will steal one's heart especially with his sad face Aline MacMahon 18991991 as Deborah H. Murray superintendent of the orphanage for war orphans as well as the off screen narrator gives possibly the best dramatic performance of her career so sincere and natural especially her devotion to those other children one forgets that she's just an actress playing a role. Even her somewhat sad face adds to her personality and character. I only wished she had won or at least been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this performance. She deserved it. Clift whose gun chewing soldier character comes about 45 minutes into the movie also gives a sincere performance and was nominated for Best Actor. Wendall Corey appears in support as Clift's Army buddy Jerry Fisher.I rank THE SEARCH one of director Zimmermann's most admired films and one I never get tired of seeing whenever it's shown. Thank goodness TCM avoids showing the colorized version of THE SEARCH. Be sure to have your tissue box handy. ".

I for one prefer this over From Here to Eternity Raintree County or even The Heiress. This is because I rarely have encountered a movie that has so pulled me in emotionally to the story. I'm a guy and I don't just start bawling at everything but I defy ANY person to watch this film with a dry eye! It just doesn't seem possible.The story is less about G.I. Clift than about a sad but adorable little boy he encounters wandering around in postwar Germany. At first the boy is wild and doesn't trust anyone as he and his family had been through the holocaust. Somehow in the concentration camp he and his mother had become separated and at the end of the war he had run away from the allied resettlement program because he had a natural fear of ALL soldiers. Despite these tragedies the boy did not give up hope of one day finding his mother though Clift plans on taking him back to the States because he knows it is hopeless to go on searching.You've GOT to see this film! You've GOT to show it to your kids! Although the Diary of Ann Frank and Shindler's List have received a lot of attention this little film is every bit as poignant and important for understanding the real impact of World War II.".

The actress who plays the child's mother Jamila Novotna was in real life better known as an opera star but she also did other films.

So The Search ended up being the movie going public's first glimpse of Montgomery Clift.They didn't get to see him until the film was only just about half way finished. The only character who is continuously on screen through out the film is little Ivan Jandl. What a performance too. The worst thing that could have happened to this film is to have some name Hollywood kid actor play that role. Young Ivan comes across as a real kid who went through horrors unimaginable in first world countries today.Ivan is Czech and his family are singled out by the Nazis and put in Auschwitz. Father and sister are killed mother and son are separated. The film is their search for each other.Ivan after VE Day is in another kind of camp a refugee camp run by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency. He's almost comatose from the shock of four years of horror. To him the men in uniforms are still to be feared even though it's not Nazi uniforms. He makes a break for it and GI Montgomery Clift picks him up and takes him back to his dwelling.Ivan and Monty kind of grow on each other but at the same time Ivan's mother played by Czech opera star Jarmila Novotna is pursuing her quest for her little boy. She comes to the UNRRA camp which is headed by Aline McMahon. This may very well be her best screen moment. McMahon also narrates large chunks of the film describing the enormous task the UNRRA had in reuniting families all over Europe in addition to a whole lot of other things like food clothing and shelter. Clift and Ivan have great chemistry. And no one ever portrayed sensitivity better than Montgomery Clift on the screen. You know how much empathizes with Ivan's plight with every look every nuance every gesture. Fred Zinneman got a great performance out of him and later on Zinneman directed Clift in his greatest film role in From Here to Eternity.The film was shot in postwar Germany and the landscape itself and the looks of the people tell what they've been through. I wouldn't be surprised but that Clift's performance in The Search later on led him to being cast in The Big Lift another film set in post World War II Germany.Probably it was just as well Clift got his first exposure in this film. It guaranteed him costar status with John Wayne when Red River finally did come out. The Search 56 years later is a moving movie experience.".

I think it is also one of the finest and earliest of Montgomery Clift's performances. A bit of an unknown gem nowadays. If you get the chance to watch it catch it  some may think it too sentimental but it's more than worth the effortlessness of seeing it. For the Pity of War alone...Wilfred Owen dixit  WWI";

	schema:reviewBody "MONTGOMERY CLIFT is the nominal star of THE SEARCH but it's little Ivan Jandl that audiences were likely to remember after watching this spellbinding story of his plight as a victim of war amid separation from his mother. Clift is firmly in command of his role as a compassionate soldier who takes the boy under his wing and teaches him to communicate in English. Wendell Corey is excellent as a soldier friend of Clift and opera singer Jarmila Novotna is totally convincing as the boy's mother intent on being reunited with her son.Another pivotal role is filled brilliantly by ALINE MacMAHON in a part that surely deserved an award nomination. At any rate Clift deserved his nomination as Best Actor and Ivan Jandl fully deserved his special Oscar as the juvenile lead. His facial expression and eyes tell the whole story without a single bit of dialogue. The only other child actor I can compare him with at that time is Claude Jarman Jr. who showed a natural skill for performing at a tender age.The impact of the devastation of war on ruined buildings is caught by the camera vividly in on location footage shot in Germany under Fred Zinnemann's expert direction. But it's the impact of war on the very young children that is the focus of this film and to that end it succeeds brilliantly in capturing the grief and loneliness of all those victims of war in a way that is sure to stir your emotions.Summing up gritty postwar film honest emotionally and powerful in its presentation. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I dream of giving birth to a child who will ask Mother what was war? Eve Merriam.When seeing this wonderful postwar production one could almost swear that it is a product of Italian Neorealism. Opening at the UNRRA camp with the sad image of war orphans it powerfully addresses viewers' hearts. Are there any other creatures on earth more harmed by the terrifying reality of war than innocent children? Those who want to live at the dawns of their lives? Those whose simplicity of happiness lies in smiling faces? Those who 'have the right to better things' in this corrupted world? Yes the story places us on solid ground of this tragic reality not making anything look sweeter nicer but simply the very dramatic way it is. We are among those who did nothing wrong to anybody and yet are suffering so intensely as 'nameless human beings.' The search...we soon realize that it is not merely a search of a stolen thing which affects employment but a search of a human being and a human perception  a human whose dignity has been terribly robbed.Many of the extras scenes shot in actual ruins of post war Wuerzburg Nuremberg Ingolstadt along with the languages used by the children including Czech and Polish supply the movie with an almost documented material something Bosley Crowther New York Times March 1948 accurately referred to as an illusion of absolute naturalness. From the moment we pay attention to one of the kids a 10year old Czech boy Karel Malik who does not know nor remember anything after he was separated from his family from his mother we know him from a touching flashback we follow his story and empathize with him. Though there is a fence in his mind his pursuit of freedom and happiness does not close him within the walls of the camp. Together with another boy he escapes the ambulance and ironically amids the ruins of destruction he meets a true friend who shows him that people may talk instead of yell people can build instead of destroy people can give instead of take. Yet his longing written deep in his heart a longing for a mother reveals the story's humane power. For its authentic depiction great credit is given to director Fred Zinnemann scriptwriter Richard Schweizer and his collaborator a Swiss producer Lazar Wechsler.Much could be said about various performances but the one that truly deserves a very special note is Ivan Jandl's. A talented boy found by Mr Zinnemann in a school group in Prague evokes extraordinary feelings in viewers to this very day. His achievement certainly belongs to the very best child performances ever seen on the screen. Let me again refer to Bosley Crowther who notes that young Ivan has such tragic expression in his slight frame such poetry in his eyes and face and such melting appeal in his thin voice that he is the ultimate embodiment of the sorrowinflicted child. Unforgettable from the moment at the UNRRA when his only answer is Ich Weiss Nicht I don't know to the vibrant scenes with Steve played brilliantly by Montgomery Clift Ivan did not know English but learned his lines phonetically. He shows us a great ability to display feelings of trust yet a state of mind still affected by trauma. Consider his moment with one American boy Tommy. Winning a very special Oscar the Juvenile Award as a Czechoslovakian inhabitant Ivan Jandl was forbidden to travel to the USA in order to receive the awards. Despite his great performance the drama of his role somehow influenced his real life from that moment on. Pity Ivan Jandl had not lived in the USA...Americans indeed had more breathing space and naturally greater possibilities for a career. Along with RED RIVER 1948 THE SEARCH may be considered a movie that made Montgomery Clift a star. He handles his role nicely as the one who 'tames' a nameless boy first but the one who soon becomes a friend of the boy whom he calls 'Jim'. Note that he first fulfills KarelJim's basic need of food seemingly simple but so meaningful in the depiction of reality and then he renews hope in 'Jim' gives him some possibilities for 'normality' and teaches 'Jim' English. Indeed the scenes of 'natural English lessons' belong to the best ones that these two young talented actors have. The unforgettable moment of the two however is the moment at the birches and their conversation about the mother who is alive. After this film Clift's talent was recognized and he made some of the greatest movies in his short but fruitful career in Hollywood.Among the cast a person whose career influenced more music than film is Jarmila Novotna an opera singer who gave her performances at MET as well as at the Vienna State Opera and Opera Berlin. She subtly plays Ms Malik Karel's mother. She is one of the most humane characters that Hollywood ever depicted one of the most sympathetic characters who fills her search her longing her waiting with helping others. By helping others she helps herself not out of some religious duty but out of heart's call. From the supporting cast Aline MacMahon deserves attention as Ms Murray a compassionate UNRRA worker.Much suffering had to be endured and much burden within the patience of the search so that both grown ups and children could be amazed by the wonder of Schalom Peace. This masterpiece is a must for everyone who is able to accept some thought provoking aspects. Are you ready to empathize with these characters? Are you ready to notice the very special treasure you are looking for? Are you ready to be engrossed by the wondrous idea hidden in the film's morale? Without its core search of human perception within yourself the movie is a mere product of its time  the past. Yet there is something more to be conveyed. 1010".

That is what a kid does. In this film Ivan Jandl actually becomes his character Karel so well that it seems like we are watching a documentary of a real war orphan instead of a movie. This is one of the most heartbreaking and yet uplifting films I have seen in my 60 years. I don't know how I missed this film for so many years and I thank Turner Classic Movies for the chance to finally see it. The expressions and emotions displayed by Ivan are so real that several times I wanted to pull the kid out of the film and just hold him for a while. Someone commented that Karel did not produce any tears when he cried but in reality we must remember that these children were walking zombies living in horrible conditions completely against the nature of childhood. I could believe that the tears had probably dried up long ago and would only come if he saw his mother again. Montgomery Clift portrays a realistic role in that like most men of that era he cannot make himself pick up the kid and just comfort him and that very fact makes the pain and suffering of the little boy all the more agonizing for the viewer to watch. I was very pleased to learn that Ivan received a special Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work in this film. I hope that throughout his short 50 years of life this recognition gave him great personal joy in spite of the political persecution brought against him in the past for having a part in the film.".

It wasn't until I watched it again recently on Turner Classic Moviesuncut and uninterrupted that I remembered seeing it so long ago. Clift plays a post World War II GI responsible for locating parents of misplaced refugee orphans. I understand that this was Montgomery Clift's second movie but the first one released and the first one seen by the American public. To be sure Clift is a magnificent actor but little Ivan Jandl as the displaced boy searching for his lost mother is truly superlative. Jandl's engaging performance very nearly overshadows Clift's debut. So worthy was Jandl's acting that he received both the Oscar and Golden Globe awards for best performance by a juvenile actor in 1948. Several scenes are so memorable. In particular when Clift's character gives the little boy a new pair of boots Jandl's enthusiasm at receiving such a simple gift is so genuine. Another touching scene is set around the dinner table of Clift's neighbor. Jandl is dressed in a pintsized replica of Clift's army uniform complete with jacket and tie such an endearing image when he starts to recall memories of his missing mother. Superb acting! Surely this movie has a happy ending reuniting a lost little boy with his searching mother. It is truly a major human tragedy that Ivan Jandl's life didn't have such a happy ending. It seems to make this film even more poignant in retrospect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Search 1948This is a critical film in director Fred Zinnemann's career. After years of doing shorts and B features and after WWII had ravaged the world he turned to a subject that must have ripped him up every day he was shooting. The story of orphaned kids most of the Jewish in the rubble of postWar Germany. You see both his parents were killed by the Nazis in the war. And here he was a man with roots in documentary film in the 1930s making real one of the remaining problems recovering from Nazi mess these displaced children. The black and white filming is gritty and polished at the same time and much of it is shot on location in the real ruins of Germany in the American sector in Nuremberg. For that alone it's worth seeing. By the way the interior work was done in a Swiss garagethe crew for the whole film consisted of a total of ten Swiss technicians and a truck. Though the movie was an American release the main producer was Swiss too. All of these are reasons why it feels different than what Hollywood might have attempted on studios lots and probably failed at least in authenticity.Throw in that Montgomery Clift is starring in the lead role and you have another reason to watch. He's really wonderful already feeling like the mature charming disarming young man he is famous for on screen. Be warned howeverhe doesn't show up until nearly halfway through. The first half of the movie is touching but makes for disappointing drama forming a quasidocumentary overview of the horrid situation but with a voiceover that means well but makes it almost sentimental instead of tragic. Be sure to stick it out until the real plot kicks in with Clift sitting in a Jeep. There are other actors herethe mother looking for her child is an opera singer in real life and is more pathetic than persuasive and the chief nurse played by Aline MacMahon is terrific. Still the movie and the screen time in the second half is Clift's thankfully and the boy's. This child was discovered while scouting for the movie apparently and is a Czech kid names Ivan Jandl. Amazingly he knew no English when the movie started and was coached by Clift as they went very much like happens in the movie. This obviously makes it more convincing top to bottom. And makes you love Clift even more. He took the role quite seriously studying according to a TCM article worth googling American soldier engineers by living with them especially trying to get the way they walked. Fascinating details for a movie that depends on its verisimilitude above all.If there is an inevitable arc to the events you'll have to live with it. And if some of the acting is average and some of the plot requiring patience you'll have to live with that too. It's not a gem taken whole. But the best of it is remarkable. An absolute mustwatch if you like this period the director or even this kind of shooting which has an echo of Rome Open City and other European productions shot in the actual remains of Old Europe.".

And here he was a man with roots in documentary film in the 1930s making real one of the remaining problems recovering from Nazi mess these displaced children. The black and white filming is gritty and polished at the same time and much of it is shot on location in the real ruins of Germany in the American sector in Nuremberg. For that alone it's worth seeing. By the way the interior work was done in a Swiss garagethe crew for the whole film consisted of a total of ten Swiss technicians and a truck. Though the movie was an American release the main producer was Swiss too. All of these are reasons why it feels different than what Hollywood might have attempted on studios lots and probably failed at least in authenticity.Throw in that Montgomery Clift is starring in the lead role and you have another reason to watch. He's really wonderful already feeling like the mature charming disarming young man he is famous for on screen. Be warned howeverhe doesn't show up until nearly halfway through. The first half of the movie is touching but makes for disappointing drama forming a quasidocumentary overview of the horrid situation but with a voiceover that means well but makes it almost sentimental instead of tragic. Be sure to stick it out until the real plot kicks in with Clift sitting in a Jeep. There are other actors herethe mother looking for her child is an opera singer in real life and is more pathetic than persuasive and the chief nurse played by Aline MacMahon is terrific. Still the movie and the screen time in the second half is Clift's thankfully and the boy's. This child was discovered while scouting for the movie apparently and is a Czech kid names Ivan Jandl. Amazingly he knew no English when the movie started and was coached by Clift as they went very much like happens in the movie. This obviously makes it more convincing top to bottom. And makes you love Clift even more. He took the role quite seriously studying according to a TCM article worth googling American soldier engineers by living with them especially trying to get the way they walked. Fascinating details for a movie that depends on its verisimilitude above all.If there is an inevitable arc to the events you'll have to live with it. And if some of the acting is average and some of the plot requiring patience you'll have to live with that too. It's not a gem taken whole. But the best of it is remarkable. An absolute mustwatch if you like this period the director or even this kind of shooting which has an echo of Rome Open City and other European productions shot in the actual remains of Old Europe.";

As a avid reader and history buff of the Second World war the film remains to date as one of my most favourite as I think that it is one of the few that really addressed the situation of the children refugees of the war. The story line is more or less accurate to a point as it is similar to whatever I have read on the period based on fact. The boy played by Ivan Jandl was as in the movie Czech and I am given to understand that he was later on persecuted by the Communist regime of Czechoslovakia for being US friendly. It is also a fact that though he was awarded a special Oscar he could not receive it. For a child of 10 his acting without mouthing any script is amazingly superb maybe due to the fact that he had lived out such instances. Montgomery Clift  one of my personal favourites does not seem to act but live his role with ease. Aline MacMahon also does justice to her role and Jarmila as the mother is also excellent. However if it was not for the masterful direction of Fred Zinneman and the actual locations filmed in the bombed out post war Germany amidst the destruction and ruins maybe the film may not have been so good. Some of the scenes are etched in your memory eg. 1 The wistful and longing look of the boy whilst at dinner sees another boy being fondled by his mother. 2 When initially the children are being interrogated by the the Refugee Centre head a french boy recounts the horror of his being orphaned in Matheusen camp and another girl recalls collecting her mothers blouse after she perished in the gas chamber. These scenes can never be blotted out from memory. Don't miss a chance to view this classic.".

Aside from very realistic portrayals from all of the actors I was especially impressed with the look of the filmmany long sequences occur without minimal dialogue and looked like they were straight out of classic silent cinema...no words were necessary to communicate the story.Being quite a fan of old movies I was surprised I had never heard of this gem before.

	schema:reviewBody "See the IMDb page for Noi albinoni for cast names none are known in the U.S.When I first heard the title of this film a while back I wondered why a film about the composer Albinoni would be coming from Iceland of all places. Then I learned it's about a somewhat wayward teen living in a frigid remote and lonesome village in Iceland.Noi is a high school dropin.  That means he occasionally attends classes to catch up on his sleep after being awakened by grandma with an effective but uncommon alarm.  He's an albino but little is made of that his mutation being essentially a metaphor for the opacity of his slow largely aimless direction.Noi lives with his grandmother but he has a not atypical buddyadversary relationship with his taxi driver drunkard dad.  About the only real emotion this kid shows is concern for his father's feelings when the polite but exasperated principal expels the teen  sending in a Panasonic tape recorder to sub for his classroom presence was the last straw for the threatened teachers.Noi doesn't work and he basically spends his time doing very little not that there's much to do in the snowbound neighborhood.  A very pretty bookseller's daughter Iris from the city is visiting her dad and working in a usually empty cafe appended to a gas station.  Noi pursues her with the languid inattention that seems to characterize his life.This isn't a typical bored teen flick.  Noi seems to have real promise and no motivation.  The ice walls surrounding his village are a prison and he has no plans to break out other than a ludicrous failed bank robbery and a car heist to set him off on a road to nowhere.  As a collection of sketches suggesting that natural boundaries have consequences for a kid with a different take on life Noi is interesting.Ultimately Noi must face a challenge dropped on him literally by a natural disaster.  What if anything he learns from the experience is unclear. There's no neat ending to this movie.The excellent cinematography highlights the barrenness of Noi's village.  I almost sustained snow glare watching this short film.And speaking of its shortness I do wonder why this ninetythree minute movie had an eightytwo minute running time in France.  What could there have been to cut?  There's enough minimalism in the full version.810".

	schema:reviewBody "In the spare and poetic Noi the Albino the title character is a seventeenyearold gifted underachiever who lives with his grandmother in a dreary little village on the coast of northern Iceland. This would be a harsh isolated environment for anyone to grow up in but it is particularly trying for a misfit adolescent with few social skills and no real hope for the future. Noi whose generally aloof alcoholic father lives on his own in a different part of town spends most of his time trudging purposelessly through the snowy streets of the village or holing up in the basement room he's carved out for himself as a kind of sanctuary from a world too utterly depressing to contemplate. Bored by school and bereft of friends this young man drifts through life dreaming of the day when he will be able to live on a very different kind of island in the South Seas a location light years removed from this place where the interiors are every bit as stark and forbidding as the whiteonwhite world outside.Noi the Albino is one of those films in which the very lack of anything significant happening becomes the central theme and message of the work. Noi lives a life that is so uneventful and boring that it would drive virtually any one of us to the brink of madness. We hardly blame him when we see him dozing through his classes at school or pilfering change from a mock slot machine set up in the local restaurant. Yet despite the fact that virtually nothing of consequence happens the film itself is a fascinating mood piece that seeps into our bones and makes us sympathize with the plight of the strange young man who occupies center stage in the drama. Most of the adults in Noi's life seem to sense his potential but for some reason he is totally unwilling to tap into it. What's impressive about the film is that it doesn't try to explain why that is though we sense it has something to do with the stifling environment in which he lives. Noi becomes emblematic of all people who lead lives of quiet desperation tucked away in remote virtually uninhabitable corners of the globe far removed from the bustle and excitement that can be found only in places with large and diverse populations.As Noi Tomas Lemarquis gives a beautiful subtle performance creating a compelling and complex character using little more than body language and facial expressions. The final moments of the film are truly heartbreaking as Noi learns the value of what he has  even though at that point the realization comes too late.Written and directed by Dagur Kari with an artist's eye for lyricism and austerity this is a bleak but intriguing little film that will stay in your mind long past the closing credits.".

Noi is a comingofage comedydrama with a morbidly deadpan sense of humor but it is also a film that tackles a very serious subject the physical and emotional isolation of bright teenagers growing up in an environment that does not nurture them. Set in Bolungarvik pop. 957 in Iceland's Western Fjords the stark quality of the remote village sheltered between the seacoast and the frozen mountains has a bluish glow that makes the world seem ominous and the relentless quiet of the secret snow conveys a tone of oppressive solitude.This is the environment a gangling 17year old named Noi must face each day. He is a notorious underachiever whose routine consists of avoiding school and trying please his alcoholic father Kiddi Throstur Leo Gunnarsson. Convincingly portrayed by Icelandic actor Tomas Lemarquis Noi is an enigma. With his shaved head pallid complexion and intense eyes it is hard to know if he is an albino or a devotee of Hari Krishna. We first meet Noi in his bed as his grandmother Anna Fridriksdttir tries to wake him up for school by firing a rifle over his head. Though he is considered by the school psychiatrist to be exceptionally intelligent Noi is not fond of school and makes his teachers crazy with his lack of punctuality sleeping in class and general uncaring manner. When he goes too far by placing a tape recorder on his seat to record the lecture while he goes home his expulsion from school is the predictable result. Feeling trapped Noi retreats to the basement of his grandmother's house where he can think about an exotic destination to escape to made more real when his grandmother gives him a stereopticon to view pictures of a land of beaches and palm trees. His interest in life picks up when Iris Eln Hansdttir a young city girl shows up in town from Reykjavik to take a job at the local gas station. Awkward and stumbling Noi manages to get a date but her father a local bookseller warns him to stay away from his daughter. On their romantic first date they break into a local museum Iris taking it on herself to break the glass on the front door while Noi attempts to jimmy the lock. They come across an exhibit showing places on a map but as they discover there's no button for Iceland a rather apt metaphor.Noi takes a job digging graves in the local cemetery where the priest hilariously attempts to use a remote control from his house to direct him where to dig a grave and the two haggle over the depth of the grave to be dug beneath tons of ice and snow. Noi's exasperation builds until he takes things into his own hand which leads to a series of seriocomic adventures more emotionless than anything this side of Fargo. While the ending may ultimately be liberating I was unprepared for the film's sudden dark turn. Kari however pulls it off and makes us care deeply about what happens to the icy town and its eccentric inhabitants. Noi Albinoi is an excellent first effort.".

Although Ni is well intentioned he lacks motivation and is prone to having spells of exceptional bad luck. He is disruptive at school if he bothers to show up at all. Ultimately he is expelled and his alcoholic dad finds Ni a job working for a priest in a graveyard. As the scenario unfolds he woos another somber and beautiful teen named Iris Elin Hansdttir who works as a gas station attendant and caf clerk. His relationship to Iris appears to be the only thing going well in Ni 's life still it is just a fragile illusion.It is winter in Iceland such that the fjord is cut off from the outside world while surrounded by an ominous mountain and buried under a shroud of snow. Beautiful shots of glaciers and chilly seasides allow the tedium of this desolation to be a lot more tolerable. If you have ever been in a dead town out in the boonies somewhere this one is even more comatose by comparison. It is hardly surprising that everyone is so somber and alienated from one another during the dark threehour days of winter.Please remember that this is not simply another typical bored teenager filmunderneath it all Ni seems to have real promise although his motivation is virtually nonexistent. The walls of snow and ice surrounding his village give the illusion of a natural prison. Ni's desperate plans to break out fail miserably during a ludicrous failed bank robbery and an aborted car theft further adding to his despair.The movie directed by Dagur Kri is largely bleak and sometimes slow moving yet it is temperamental seductive and distinctive. There are no cheap thrills sexy scenes car crashes or violence however the cinematography and the unfolding human drama draw you in like bees to honey and hold you there to it's amazing finish. It is not until a natural disaster so totally shatter Ni's universe that the film begins to offer the hope of a new beginning for Ni.Ni is completely believable for anyone who ever recalls being a teenager. He is the embodiment of a disturbing reflection of the aspirations naivety and unmanageable emotions many teens feel at that age. This film kept me enthralled and touched in equal measures right down to its startling climax. This movie is a must see for anyone who appreciates that life is different when you are just 17.".

In winter the fjord is cut off from the outside world surrounded by ominous mountains and buried under a shroud of snow. If he feels like it or when his grandmother wakes him up by firing a rifle through the window next to his bed he attends school. But most of the time he aimlessly drifts around dreaming of escaping this whitewalled prison with Iris a city girl who works in a local gas station. But his clumsy attempts at escape like robbing a bank spiral out of control and most of his attempts to get out end in dismal failure.I feel very lucky for not living in the godforsaken place Ni has to spend his days. We're never quite sure how to understand this seventeen yearold boy. Director Dagur Kri consciously poses the question Is he the village idiot or a genius in disguise? When a psychologist drops by to assess the boy's problems at school he claims the boy is a genius. But in real life his behavior ranges from the socially handicapped to plain idiocy. Tmas Lemarquis is impressive with a restrained performance mostly reliant on facial expressions or body language.I saw Dagur Kri's recent film DARK HORSE 2005 before this one and enjoyed it much more but that's not to say either one of them is better than the other. Dark Horse is much lighter and optimistic in tone but lacks a really believable central character while Ni Albinoi has a better story with a more fulfilling resolution plus the for me at least quite unique Icelandic setting complete with the strange isolation and the icyblue cinematography. A wonderful if somewhat distancing experience. The ending is shattering.Camera Obscura  810".

	schema:reviewBody "I would happily claim Ni albni to being the most visually perfect film I have ever seen even with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford Barry Lyndon Paris Texas Werckmeister Harmonies etc in mind. It features delicate hues of green blue and red that capture every defining detail that merge together within the frame with Ni's pale white skin blending in with them  showing how trapped he feels despite being unique. Also the Icelandic landscapes had me in a state of absolute awe at once being cold and warm. Pure magic. Ni played enigmatically by Tmas Lemarquis is a very arrogant and ignorant youth who just doesn't want to think or know. He does however obtain complex physical tasks like hacking into a gambling machine and changing it so he wins or breaking into cars and buildings  clearly showing his lack of morals although that isn't surprising with a drunk father figure evidently senile grandmother and no apparent mother. He never looks to the consequences or even distant future he claims he wants to be a lawyer which is taken as a joke. He seeks no guidance or assurance and takes what he wants when he wants. There is a beautiful and calming side to him as he lets a fly crawl up and down his hands which would otherwise be irritating. The film itself opens with symbolism which pretty much sums him up straight away where we see Ni's house being snowed in and we see him having to work hard to get out although we never do see if he does and are left to assume the film is told in sequence. The love interest ris is a naive new arrival the sleepy limited town who initially does not seek any attention from Ni but then takes what he gives in the end we discover it is a case when the man likes the woman more than she does which is woefully saddening. She is also the daughter of Ni's good friend which adds a touch of recklessness to his character. The score is a subtle and pleasant addition which reflects how Ni feels whether near ris in his isolated hideaway or in danger. Dagur Kri seizes all these moments with secure confidence amplifying the emotions provoked. A lot of humour as well like when Ni attempts to rob a bank then after being casually kicked out he returns to make a withdrawal. All the characters are well developed and recognizable in their roles in the film. It was the ending that truly made me realize how much I cared I cried when I thought something inevitable was about to happen and then I cried again when the exact opposite happened. It is so blunt and powerful that I just could not help myself. This film is heading straight to my top 10 of alltime.1010".

There is a beautiful and calming side to him as he lets a fly crawl up and down his hands which would otherwise be irritating. The film itself opens with symbolism which pretty much sums him up straight away where we see Ni's house being snowed in and we see him having to work hard to get out although we never do see if he does and are left to assume the film is told in sequence. The love interest ris is a naive new arrival the sleepy limited town who initially does not seek any attention from Ni but then takes what he gives in the end we discover it is a case when the man likes the woman more than she does which is woefully saddening. She is also the daughter of Ni's good friend which adds a touch of recklessness to his character. The score is a subtle and pleasant addition which reflects how Ni feels whether near ris in his isolated hideaway or in danger. Dagur Kri seizes all these moments with secure confidence amplifying the emotions provoked. A lot of humour as well like when Ni attempts to rob a bank then after being casually kicked out he returns to make a withdrawal. All the characters are well developed and recognizable in their roles in the film. It was the ending that truly made me realize how much I cared I cried when I thought something inevitable was about to happen and then I cried again when the exact opposite happened. It is so blunt and powerful that I just could not help myself. This film is heading straight to my top 10 of alltime.1010";

The DirectorAuter Kri makes a valiant effort by writing the screenplay and making an unalloyed soundtrack of his bands music which ebbs nicely with the desolation and not opting for a Sigur Rs opus note the polarity of Noi listening to ska and black metal in the taxi. I've also made some biblical assumptions as far as content is concerned since a member on here made it known that Ni means Noah in Icelandic. The video quality caught me off guard at first giving the impression of a university student at the helm but after several minutes the effect is interesting and even promotes the mood of the film especially at nightex low angle of Iris outside the museum. There are also moments of sparse dialogues throughout which lend a viewer to dwell and dwell on meaning afterwards. I would advise viewers prior to engagement to slow down any Michael Bay metabolism you might have to give this film an honest chance. This film is rife with awards and because it's independent one may get that Pulp FictionTrainspotting itch before hand which would be a GIANT mistake.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm fond of Scandinavian movies but I have just never been a too great fan of Icelandic movie. Yes I know Iceland is not really Scandinavia even though it officially is on paper. Let's say it's more of a semiScandinavian country. Just like in every other Scandinavian movie this movie tries to take a realistic approach with slow moving scenes and lots of different characters and build up involved. Only difference is that there is some more quirkiness added to it all. Most of the characters and some of the events seem definitely weird ones. In that regard Icelandic movies are somewhat similar to Danish films that often also features quirkiness. Perhaps no coincidence since Icelandic used to be a part of Denmark for a long time until 1944. Now nothing wrong with some quirkiness but if it plays a too big part in the movie it goes at the expense of the credibility and the realism of the whole movie. In my opinion this is the case with Ni albni.It's obvious that the main character is living a very boring life due to the place he is living at. But why bother us with it? We see how all of his days are always basically the same and that there is absolutely nothing for him to do. It's a good portrayal but it just isn't the most engaging or interesting one to watch as a viewer. Like I said it's a good portrayal and definitely a well made movie with all of the right intentions but that doesn't always make a great movie as well when the movie doesn't have the most engaging story.And then the ending. Sigh well I don't know I definitely can understand the filmmakers motivations and intentions of it but it nevertheless comes rather sudden and isn't in context with the rest of the movie. It gives an already 'depressing' movie an even more depressing ending.I'm probably sounding too harsh since I definitely enjoyed watching Ni albni but in some cases an enjoyable good watch isn't the same as a great movie.The atmosphere is definitely good. Due to the nature conditions the movie also has a very special kind of lighting that adds to the movie its special atmosphere. It's a very cold feeling and bleak looking movie that often uses empty long shots of the empty snowy streets and white covered small houses with little of valuables in it. There is nothing wrong with making a little depressive humble movie with some much required comical undertones that doesn't really have a story in general movie terms but is more a sort of an observation of life. But to devote an entire movie to the boring life of a gifted which is mentioned but never really shown throughout the movie except him being able to solve any kind of puzzles quickly. We only really get to see him as a lazy person who doesn't bother with anything.. Icelandic teenager is perhaps a bit too much of one thing.The sort of movie that is still good and fun enough to watch it once when there really is nothing else on.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

His father  a local taxi driver and sometime loser  shows up to drive him to school. At school Noi is bored beyond belief and quickly gets away to go to the gas station where he meets a new employee Iris Elin Hansdottir daughter the book store owner with whom Noi often plays MasterMind and wins easily for free girlie magazines.You see there's not much to do in this small town Noi skips school whenever he can he plays games he wanders around the town and for more fun he does things like getting his grandmother's shotgun to blast away at stalactites hanging off the large mountain that overlooks the town. When all else fails he gets down into his private cubby hole under the floor of his grandmother's house where he lives with her and his father to think and read. Part of Noi's problems is that he's a bit of a klutz for example while trying to help his father with cooking he spills a whole vat of animal blood over his dad and his grandmother. It's a comedic scene and yet there's an underlying seriousness.Smitten by Iris at the gas station however Noi begins to make an impression upon her  or so he thinks  while her father of course warns him off. To compound his problems the school authorities have Noi examined by a psychologist for abnormalities seeing as how he skives off so much from school and just wants to do his own thing.

Well that's the last straw for Noi  he grabs his grandmother's shotgun and sets off for the local bank to get enough money to take himself and Iris away from their poxy existence in such a nonothing town. And that sets off a chain of tragic events that changes Noi's life forever.It's a fitting end and one that is foreshadowed early in the film but that subtle hint was not apparent to me until the denouement is reached. You may fare better.The acting is very visual because the dialog is quite sparse much is conveyed with a static camera simply showing whatever enters and leaves the frame. Hence the cinematography while being traditional  even mundane some might say  is nevertheless effective for the whole setting. It's certainly not a movie for action fans and rev heads however.Recommended for all".

She longs to meet her biological mother so she is forced to run away from home. The stepmother then hires a detective to find her for a large reward. The plot thickens when the stepmother tries to double cross the detective and save the reward money leading to both Heather and the newly hired detective being on the lamb together.The character development is good but not great. The characters are mostly two dimensional. The step mother is the typical wicked kind the FBI agents are stereotypically bumbling throughout. Also the detectives business associate is the typical tightwad. Fortunately the important roles more than make up for the supporting cast.Howard Hesseman makes a wonderful if not formulaic grouch and Love Hewitt is so adorable you'll like the movie just because she's in it. Their characters start out with a lot of animosity which is to be expected only to find that they are more alike than meets the eye.The ending isn't surprising and the movie flows smoothly along without any unexpected twists. There is a story to de told and the director wisely left the twists out instead focusing on the stars keeping everything else to a minimum. Not every movie can pull this off but in this case Hewitt and Hessman are all you care about so more would have been just that more. I'm not going to give away too much but that you will leave feeling better for having seen it.".

The character would like to have money and things but in the same moment he also wants to be save his personality but he undesrtands that it's impossible This is the problem! he repeats .

	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely fabulous film from director Elio Petri this is Italian crime without a car chase or punch up well almost. More than a hint of the politics in the title and this is such a well told tale of corruption and theft. Or to put it another way the rich person's crimes versus those of the poor. What is worse creaming off the cash on a building project or stealing someone's jewellery? When I first heard the film was political and comedic I was very wary but how well this is done and the comic moments are funny and are not slapstick silliness. All the performances are great including a wonderful one from Daria Nicolodi she of many early Argento movies as she hobble about in heels and hot pants. The main storyline follows a humble young bank cashier who takes offence at the crimes of the local butcher who has fingers in many pies and decides to try and teach him a lesson. I had never heard of this film before but am stunned at the quality of the film and can unreservedly recommend this for I sat smiling throughout constantly being stimulated by the arguments around the notion of theft. Major discovery and now for the rest of the trilogy.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young bank worker Total Flavio Bucci witnesses a robbery in which one of the thieves gets caught and beaten by an avaricious rich butcher Ugo Tognazzi. He can't come to terms with the fact that in spite of being always a righteous man he has never managed to gather as much money as all other people including the abovementioned man. He vows to prosecute him and drive him insane by stealing everything that belongs to him along with his lover Anita Daria Nicolodi.In this third part of the neurosis' trilogy Petri tackles inequality in society the issue of property and last but not least money itself. None of Petri's movies is straightforward and this one is no exception. While among Petri's works are more and less demanding ones this one must be together with A Quiet Place In The Country 1968 and Todo Modo 1976 his weirdest creation. Therefore there is nothing strange about the fact that the film wasn't acclaimed in its premiere. It's a bold remarkably modern satire which is bound to leave you confused and make you think about it long after it's over. Apart from his usual collaboration with Agrade cinematographer Luigi Kuveiller Argento's Deep Red 1975 the director utilizes a really grotesque plot and a perfect illustration of this is our protagonist who is allergic to money. In addition to this there is a frequent use of stagey scenes therefore the ensemble looks everything but ordinary. A soundtrack is composed by Ennio Morricone. It is very avantgarde and owing to some creepy whispers included Io ho  I have tu hai  you have egli ha  he has essi hanno  they have already comments the events that are occurring on the screen.The cast isn't too bad unfortunately Flavio Bucci who is surely a good actor appears to be a bit inexperienced in comparison to Volonte for example thus the film lacks a strong leading actor. Daria Nicolodi and Ugo Tognazzi give strong performances. One can spot Salvo Randone as well who as always plays his role very well.With this flick Petri shows that human takes part in the rat race in order to become more powerful socially accepted and approved irrespective of all hidden necessary immoral ways. The character of the butcher represents the rich and Petri points out that all those people who want to dominate are unscrupulous and pitiless as the poor who often are honest ones will never achieve better life conditions since either they are limited by religious as well as state laws or on breaching overtly all those moral boundaries they are banished from the society. The only way to render their life acceptable is to obey the rules and submit to opulent people who are protected on account of their wealth and power. Another interesting aspect of the movie is comparing a bank which is heart of consumerism to the church. To make this allusion even more visible the bank is full of images depicting the Holy Trinity. Also just like in the Holy Church in the rat race which is called here a religion of property there is a certain hierarchy and blasphemies when the clerk Total sets a banknote on fire the director is disgusted and almost throws a tantrum.However it's more fascinating to analyze it than to behold it as the plot seems to flow quite slowly there isn't enough black humor to keep the climax amusing. The script with its full resonance overwhelms the viewer to the extension that one feels a bit tired and the twisted Marxism  Madrakism message appears to be slightly too radical. Nonetheless it does have plenty of splendid ideas electrifying score of Morricone eroticallytinged atmosphere strong direction and hence this is a good piece of political cinema. Although it isn't as marvelous as his previous films it certainly encapsulates the political situation of those times in Italy perfectly.".

	schema:reviewBody "Total Flavio Bucci a young bank cashier has been wondering for some time if his life with its grey dismal prospect is worth living. He is aware of the illicit careers and rise to riches of many of his clients. He decide to start a new life  new clothes new cars new women. His new look begins discreetly a few small robberies in supermarkets progressing to more important fraud.Director Elio Petri best known for Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion 1970 felt that Property emphasized the role of money in our society and how power destroys the individual. Although he had left the Communist Party by this point in his life he still had strong leftist and anticapitalist leanings that are evoked in this narrative. Even the title is a clear allusion to anarchist writer Proudhon. His producer Claudio Mancini has been described s a middle class Communist which I think would also suit Petri very well.Our lead character describes himself as a Mandrakian Marxist and others have pointed out that he commits symbolic thefts that expose the hypocrisy inherent in the concept of property. It really is interesting. He has no intention to better himself but instead prefers to be largely an annoyance to a butcher who visits the bank. A serious thief would I assume be planning a bank heist. What systemic change can be achieved by merely making a few things disappear?Star Flavio Bucci had previously worked with Petri on The Working Class Goes to Heaven 1971 though he is best remembered today for his supporting role in Dario Argento's Suspiria 1977. Coincidentally Argento's longtime partner Daria Nicolodi appears in Property a year before she ever met Argento. Heck even cinematographer Luigi Kuveiller would go on to work with Argento on Deep Red 1975. The Italian cinema is an incestuous world.Another reviewer notes the interesting role Nicolodi plays in this world As much an object in the Butcher's eyes as his other possessions Anita represents one of Property's most interesting and troubling qualities. Utterly passive in the face of multiple sexual assaults and apparently complicit in her own objectification Anita is emblematic of one of the uglier aspects of Italian crime cinema of the era. What I find interesting about this casting is that Anita is seen as property a common sentiment of the time but this fact is made known to the audience. Nicolodi herself could easily be considered a feminist whereas Italian cinema was and is a man's world she left her mark on scripts like few other women.Last and certainly not least we should call attention to the underrated score. The composer Ennio Morricone is anything but underrated. But this is not one of the films he is often associated with and yet I would say it is some of his finer work. Unfortunately the Arrow Video release does not have an isolated score track or bonus disc but if a standalone soundtrack does not already exist I imagine it will soon.Arrow Video brings us a 4K restoration from the original film negative and brandnew interviews with actor Flavio Bucci producer Claudio Mancini and makeup artist Pierantonio Mecacci yet another Argento veteran. We learn much about Bucci's career and his admiration for Mancini whom he says we owe a great debt to. Mancini speaks widely including on Todo Modo so viewers are able to get a sense of that debt Bucci mentions. Mecacci has plenty of stories about a strike and other noteworthy events and speaks fondly of his work with Nicolodi for being the makeup artist he was very much involved in every aspect of the shooting.".

The performances from a cast that includes Jessica Lange and Anne Heche are solid although somewhat unfairly Jason Biggs will always be the guy who humped the pie in my eyes and in the case of Christina Ricci who played Wurtzel herself exceptional the soundtrack's cool well it does include The Pretenders Lou Reed and Bruce Springsteen after all and if you haven't read the book you'll probably like maybe even love it. However therein lies the problem a film based on an international bestseller is surely aiming itself at a target audience of its readers and for this film that's the very people who are least likely to enjoy it. The film sucks out all the depth that made the book so brilliant and so important to millions for example instead of being a emotionally messed up young woman who fears abandonment and uses sex and anger as defence mechanisms Wurtzel becomes a bitchy whiny slut who is difficult to relate to or feel sympathy for. Furthermore the time constraints lead the film to focus solely on the Harvard years cutting out the important childhoodteen years and leading to a resolution which occurs far to early making depression seem like a problem which can be solved within a year. However I suppose the biggest problem the film has to overcome is the fact that reading Prozac Nation is a highly personal and private thing meaning no film will be able to compare to the one the readers have already seen in their heads.".

	schema:reviewBody "Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film. Ricci is my favorite actress She is so gifted so natural her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates which gives credence to the often misapplied term star. The film misses its mark for lots of various reasons but perhaps most notably for the story's seeming unadaptability to the screen in making it a compelling narrative...more on that later. The cast at first glance is excellent but come to think of it Jessica Lang as the Jewish mother is too Protestant and not exactly right Ann Hetch doesn't come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book and when your making a movie how can you justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in the film's construction first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the Elizabeth Wurtzle character and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in. Unfortunately do to the flashback construction Lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book. This is a major problem. This story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch. She is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors both society and the home and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case. She is so talented and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her victimization. This is missed on the film.Ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say it is a biopic of one severely affected girl but also it is a film about a nation who can't get its act together that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at Harvard are even more messed up than the average college enrollee. The film finally isn't able to get either of these messages across compellingly and that's too bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can't function without a chemical crutch? These are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional America but that doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes.Ricci's performance is tight and heartfelt and one of the best of her acting career.Michele Williams is also superb in her role.".

The movie obviously compressed a lot of details in the book but I think if it had just focused on the main crisis of the book the character's descent into depression would have been easier to understand and empathize.  As it was it tried to do that but it also tried to cram in other things and I feel that if I hadn't read the book or gone through something similar myself I would not have understood why Lizzie was so afflicted at this particular point in her life.I thought the acting was excellent Michelle Williams and Jason Biggs were great and Christina Ricci was phenomenal capturing the entire range of the pain and anger and selfloathing of depression.  I thought Jessica Lange put in a good performance although her bizarre accent and the fact that she in no way resembles the darker and petite Christina Ricci was really distracting.  I was simply unable to believe she was her mother and certainly not a Jewish mother.If you're a fan of one or more of the actors I would watch the movie for the sake of appreciating their skill.  Or if you've suffered from severe depression then watch it and know that there are other people who feel the same way you do and think the same thoughts as you and who would understand why you feel and act the way you do. Otherwise skip it.  If you don't understand depression before going into the film it is unlikely that this it will shed any light on the topic for you.  It's pretty much impossible to understand unless you've been there yourself.".

I liked this movie so much that I can't wait to read the book when I find it the film is based on the novel of the same name.The movie tells the true story of Elizabeth Wurtzel played by the beautiful Christina Ricciand her battle with depression. She gets tired of life and nears suicide. However she struggles to stay alive throughout her life in the 1980's when sex and drugs ruled.Christina Ricci was the best at acting in this film. Her performance was very realistic and true as the depressed Elizabeth. I myself had to combat depression before so I know the things she was going through and I know how she feels. She was really trying her best to survive in the movie and I appreciate the filmmakers efforts to show it on the screen. And aside from her character in the film Christina Ricci herself was beautiful her gorgeous nude body is shown at the beginning of the movie! The movie put great effort to give the background scenery an 80's feel since the book was based in the 1980's. However I noticed that there were glaring anachronisms mistakes in the timeline setting of the movie that distracted me slightly from the story. But still I got over it and continued watching the movie.The anachronisms was one of the two things that I didn't like in the movie. The second thing I hated was Elizabeth's mom played by Jessica Lange she was a very annoying and clichd character. Without Jessica Lange's exaggerated performance the movie would have been nearly perfect.Aside from those two things the movie was very good and interesting. I never imagined that there would actually be a true story about depression portrayed in a movie. It was good to see this movie since it would help spread awareness about depression. It's too bad that the author of the book didn't like the film.I give this film an 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe Erik Skjoldbjrg holds the record for most 'J's in a director's name but apart from that he also shows good restraint and a keen eye for narrative and detail in helming 'Prozac Nation.' Basically a period piece set in the mid 80's the film relates the collegiate memoirs of Elizabeth Wurtzel who now writes a music column for The New Yorker. Christina Ricci plays the part of Wurtzel and does passably well though I couldn't help noticing the actual Wurtzel bears more than a slight resemblance to Anne Hathaway. The film gives a sympathetic account of Wurztel's struggles with substance abuse and depression while being a journalism prodigy and dealing with undergraduate studies at Harvard. Friends and family run out of patience in trying to secure help for her as she tailspins into a suicidal funk. Eventually she allows herself to be medicated on Prozac which sort of stands as the anticlimactic resolution of the film. Jason Biggs does a fine job portraying her first serious lover and they have a couple very powerful scenes together which I would recommend that people watch if they are at all concerned about heir own tendencies to romantically obsess over other people. Jessica Lange falls a bit into melodrama in portraying Wurtzel's frazzled mother but Michelle WIlliams gives a very strong performance as Wurtzel's supportive but overwhelmed roommate. Anne Heche turns in a meh performance as Wurtzels's shrink. Lou Reed plays himself and in one incredibly frightening scene he gently strokes Ricci's face don't get too alarmed it happens in a fantasy sequence. I find it sort of sadly hilarious that this film which appositionally refers to America in its title never received a U.S. theatrical run. Americans should probably all watch this movie.".

About 20 when it was filmed Ricci is in the role of Elizabeth Wurtzel whose autobiography forms the basis for this movie. The subject is depression and Liz suffers so badly that she cannot function at Harvard and cannot keep girlfriends or boyfriends. Finally with the help of her shrink and an appropriate dose of Prozac she is finally able to clear her mind and do some productive writing.Ricci does such a remarkable job here that it is hard to take your eyes off her. She makes the difficult role very believable. Jason Biggs is good as a toned down Rafe from Austin who becomes her boyfriend. Anne Heche has received some criticism in her role as the Psychiatrist Dr. Sterling but I thought she played it rather well and I don't often like Heche. Jessica Lange is in fine form as the mother Mrs. Wurtzel .".

	schema:headline " A Unique and Original Film With Outstanding Acting";
	schema:reviewBody "It's silly to berate a movie that hasn't even come out. Having read the book and been down the road of chronic depression for many months I have to disagree with the first preview that claims this movie unworthy because of the image Wurtzel gives us of depression. Depression sorry to burst Violetta's bubble it a unique personal hard fought battle for evey individual who suffers from it. That just happened to be Wurtzel's experience with her own depression. Needless to say I give the book my highest rating and hope to do the same with the movie. Prozac Nation was one of those movies I wanted to see as soon as I heard about it. I have seen the trailer a few times and couldn't wait for the film to be released into theaters. It was at first in limited release which I don't understand why since it is a mainstream movie but anyway it finally arrived to my local theater today. So as soon as I could I rushed to the theater to see Prozac Nation.The movie's plot is very simple but at the same time very complex Lizzie played by the beautiful and talented Christina Ricci is a depressed girl. Following up his critically acclaimed debut Insomnia 1997 Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjaerg makes his first Englishlanguage feature with this adaptation of the novel by Elizabeth Wurtzel. Christina Ricci stars as Lizzie a prizewinning student heading off to Harvard where she intends to study journalism and launch a career as a rock music critic. However Elizabeth's fractured family situation including an errant father Nicholas Campbell and a neurotic bitterly hypercritical mother Jessica Lange has led to a struggle with depression. When her allnight drugfueled writing binges and emotional instability alienate her roommate and best friend Ruby Michelle Williams as well as both her first Jonathan RhysMeyers and second Jason Biggs boyfriends Lizzie seeks psychiatric counseling from Dr. Diana Sterling Anne Heche who prescribes the wonder drug Prozac. Despite success as a writer that includes a gig writing for Rolling Stone and some mellowing out thanks to her medication Lizzie begins to feel that the pills are running her life and faces some tough choices about her future. Prozac Nation 2001 is a longtime dream project of star Ricci who also serves as one of the film's coproducers. Prozac Nation then starts to develop into an unusual and original movie which I for one have never seen before. A lot of symbolism terrific acting and a lot of dark past scenes ensue.In this film I really could not believe the acting. It was terrific all around. Christina Ricci proves that she can hold a lead role and do it flawlessly. Her role was perfect and involved a lot of different emotions which she played off like a natural. But Christina Ricci's acting isn't the highlight of this film that award goes to Jessica Lange who plays her role like she actually was going though this in real life. Her incredible acting kept getting stronger throughout the entire film. The supporting actors and actresses were all good as well. Michelle Williams who played Ruby was really good in her role. Emily Perkins who played Ellen was very good as well as Anne Heche who played the doctor Sterling.The film's script was another strong point. It was very good! I never knew what was going to happen next. I thought I did a few times but I was wrong. The script also had a lot of symbolism in it and if you watch the movie closely you will be able to catch it. I also like how the movie didn't have the typical Hollywood ending at the end. It was very different and I didn't expect what happened to happen. The writer Galt Niederhoffer did a great job and surprisingly this was his second film. I wish I could shake this man's hand for making such a great piece of cinema. I am really looking forward to his next movie Lonesome Jim that comes out in 2005. I loved the director's use of camera angles and the many views of various landscapes and the sky. It was very creative.So what else can I say about the film it was very independent like which I am sure will turn the normal moviegoers off right away. The movie moves slowly to build its story and suspense. It does this flawlessly. It's really amazing. If you want a great movie that has an unusual and original story great acting and lots of hidden messages and symbolism then go see Prozac Nation and enjoy. If you don't like movies that make you think then skip this one because it's not for you. It was a terrific film from a great new director.I've been looking forward to seeing Prozac Nation since I first saw the poster for the film. The poster itself seemed rather amusing and then when I had seen the trailer for the film and wanted to watch the film even more. I usually enjoy Christina Ricci on the big screen. She is definitely a great actress. Lots of clever dialog great acting and a unique story ensue.The acting in the film was top notch. I think Christina Ricci's performance was very noteworthy. I liked her character. Lizzie was nice girl who was very sweet and innocent. Jonathan RhysMeyers performance was another great role for his resume. I liked how his character had many sides to him. I felt they all played their characters well.I think what is amazing about the script is the fact that a. the writer never wrote a film anything like it before and b. it's a very original film. I know I haven't seen every movie but I never seen a movie like this. The story was unique the characters were likable and the dialog was rather clever. I applaud these two screenwriters for their effort on the script. Sadly I doubt the movie will do well. There was only three people in the theater counting me and the story is rather odd and original so I don't know if it will really trigger much interest from the typical moviegoers.Erik Skjoldbjrg was the director of Prozac Nation. I have not seen his movies Insomnia yet but I'll watch it as soon as I can get my paws on it. I liked how in the film Erik Skjoldbjrg really captured being in Harvard and being depressed showing everyone in the opening scene of the film. It really lets you know how life is for Lizzie. The director also did a good job of directing the actors and making them connect. I really felt for the characters in this film. I liked that they had this great connection with each other on screen.So to summarize I overall really enjoyed Prozac Nation. The cast is great as is its story. I feel the film won't attract much attention since the crap fest wholesome teen movies and sex comedies rule the box office it's an indie film and the fact that Prozac Nation itself isn't aimed at the average moviegoer crowd. I recommend this film though to anyone who wants to see a film that is smart original and witty. It delivers great performances and some sad moments. I really enjoyed the film and will probably go see it again if I can.  My final rating for Prozac Nation is an 810".

Based on Elizabeth Wurtzel's novel.I saw this film after reading the excellent book by Elizabeth Wurtzel. I had very high hopes but unfortunately they weren't meet in this one. Maybe be I was expecting it to live up to Girl Interrupted starring Winona Ryder. But there was just something that didn't quite work in Prozac Nation. Still there's no denying that Ricci gave everything she had to this project creating an incendiary performance that's startling in its starkness. She refuses to soften up the tarttongued often obnoxious Wurtzel nor does she comfort the audience with little Can you believe how nasty I am? asides the way many actresses do when they're called upon to play unlikable characters.The movie though is perhaps too crystal clear. Ricci and the other actors are very good at establishing exactly what kind of people their characters are and how they will respond in all circumstances. Consequently there are few surprises. No one can step out of character to lend Lizzie a helping hand. In fact the movie is practically a commercial for medication over human compassion which is unfortunate though possibly true in many cases.Skjoldbjaerg's attempts to visualize Lizzie's moods through speededup action and fuzzy double images remind you of bad student films of the '70s and '80s it was awful. Otherwise he directs with intelligence and is smart enough to realize that with Ricci as his star the less fuss the better. Cinematographer Erling ThurmannAndersen goes for somber dark tones while editor James Lyons moves things along at a crisp pace.Overall I wasn't terribly impressed by this film. Christina Ricci's performance was amazing and touched me it pushes the film up about a mile. Maybe you should read the book then watch the film and decide for yourself but in comparison between them I prefer the book. This thin drama is only 98 minutes long but it moves so slowly it feels like the cinematic equivalent of reading a book with very small amounts of text could have been much better with a different director and script. OK but not what I thought I'd see it is certainly worth it for Ricci fans though which is definitely me.6.110See It If You Liked Girl Interrupted I Never Promised You a Rose Garden The Basketball Diaries Thirteen".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems no matter what I see her in Christina Ricci seems full of promise but fails to deliver. Sure she can cry and scream but Prozac Nation sees Ricci totally out of her depth perhaps I'm being too harsh.... okay I'm shifting the blame to the director. Jessica Lange is outrageous and almost reaches Faye Dunaway heights of megadramatisation. Unfortunately I think Lange peaked with Frances and it was all downhill from there. There was every chance of this film being slick and witty while tackling depression head on. What we get instead is poorly acted hysteria dressed up with a stereotypical try hard eighties veneer. I really had no sense of the films eighties backdrop since I was unsatisfied with the lame attempt at making believe it was the eighties just because ms Ricci wears a madonna inspired dress to her lost my virginity celebration. Cmon everyone you are ALL better than this. The filmmakers should hang their heads in shame and as a result of disappointment Elizabeth Wurtzel could probably make a bundle if she sued for irrepairable emotional damages as a result of the finished product. go on lizzie sue!

It seemed odd that the writers would include this comment without giving us any examples but this script is a lesson in incompetence. It has no discernible structure or flow at all instead it consists of a series of awkwardly strungtogether scenes of Lizzie screaming then ends. Character development? No... Scenes of her everyday existence i.e. going to classes that might possibly be important details? No... Screaming at maximum volume? CHECK. It's not quite enough I'm afraid. 110.".

It tries to get us into the mindset of this character person and it kinda succeeds in doing so. It is a drama and therefor won't really be the movie Ricci fans might seek out to see her in her Eva costume.

Because I love everything that Christina Ricci does I was very excited at first but as the movie continued I started to wonder where it was going.  Based on a true story it is simply about Christina Ricci's character and her struggle with depression drugs friends and family as you can probably tell from the title.  In my opinion this movie moved too fast and it was way too dramatic.  I would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes and the movie moved through her life extremely fast and this left no room for us to connect with Christina Ricci's character.  Christina Ricci's performance was fantastic as always but Jessica Lange stood out throughout the whole movie and I believe this movie's success will be all because of her and Christina Ricci.  I would rate this 4 out of 10 and I would suggest you rent this one or read the books by Elizabeth Wurtzel they are good and definitely worth checking out.".

In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a story of success only one of selfdestruction as we watch Liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her. The film examines divorce family dysfunction drugs alcohol and prescription medication as possible reasons for Liz's unhappiness. But none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory.At some point in the film it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems. No light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in The United States of Depression. In the story Liz had a caring therapist Anne Heche a caring roommate Michele Williams a caring boyfriend Jason Biggs and a troubled but caring parent Jessica Lange. In a key scene in the film Liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the breakup of the space shuttle Challenger. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz's life the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery.This film reminded me of a generic madeforcable victim film on the Lifetime network. An excellent cast was wasted especially in the earnest performance of Christina Ricci. The reallife Elizabeth Wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit.".

The essence of Wurtzel's novel is lost in its screen adaptation and despite thescreenwriter's attempts to structure a plot around a series of disconnectedepisodes within the book each character is underdeveloped and the collegesetting laughable. What certainly worked for the film was a terrific ensemble cast particularly Jessica Lange who is suitably understated and moving in her portrayal of a destructive mother. This for me is Christina Ricci's 'GirlInterrupted as she also produced the project indicating that there is anattachment between the actress and the piece. She for the most is utterlyconvincing as the selfindulgent erratically manic and destructive Elizabeth honing the precocious depressive tremendously well. Which is either engaging or incredibly unnerving for the audience. Depending on your position theaudience must understand that Elizabeth is not a character that we aresupposed to empathise with or pity but be affected and repulsed by and Iguess that is what can distract viewers from the film's loose narrative. Despite its perks the film plunges into soap style melodrama that distracts and disengages from perfectly good performances. The film is saturated with camera shots that are out of focus and sped up frames that keep Elizabeth 'The Outsider still and detached from everything around her and whilst this can work on atelevision show like Party of Five or 'Dawson's Creek the seriousness of the material does not call for lazy film making. Prozac Nation is an overall unsatisfying movie experience and for someone who waited four years to see what was constructed I must say that I agree with Elizabeth Wurtzel's thoughts against it. What I feel really indicated the drop in quality was the film's jacket tagline 'The most controversial film of the year. If that is not a shameless call to eccentric or thrill seeking audience members  then I do not know what is... it takes a very serious issue and attempts to make younger people interested and attracted to the idea of mental illness with little originality or inner truth. Jessica Lange and Ricci are superb and work extremely well together though are drowned by the morose structure dull musical selection although the score is lovely and severely underdeveloped and stock supporting characters.".

Jason Biggs is miscast in a dramatic and romantic character having a flat performance. The lead character of Elizabeth Lizzie Wurtzel is unpleasant and in the movie she is a spoiled ungrateful daughter confused and contradictory and does not have motives to have such destructive behavior.

The direction is good inclusive with some great sequences with the camera and Christina Ricci Jessica Lange and Anne Heche have great performances. Jason Biggs is miscast in a dramatic and romantic character having a flat performance. The lead character of Elizabeth Lizzie Wurtzel is unpleasant and in the movie she is a spoiled ungrateful daughter confused and contradictory and does not have motives to have such destructive behavior. I really did not like this boring film. My vote is four.Title Brazil Gerao Prozac Prozac Generation";

Brit and American POW's are on there way to more secure territory for safekeeping in Germany.

How many of them will live? It actually is a movie that seems very real in what could have happened and may for all I know be based on a real life story. In two scenes I got so caught up in it that I got pretty emotional which in a war movie for me means it's good.I cannot rate it highly on too many technical merits it's production values resembled late 50's American TV to me but I will give it a good A grade for realism the refugess and POW's do not have a polished look to themselves like a Sinatra had in Von Ryans Expess another movie about the same topic that I loved but for different reasons these characters look very very real so I will say that while it was made on a low budget it has a lot of heart and more than makes up for it.Since it's public domain you may be able to find it easily online I highly recommend it its very powerful at times and very truthful for a movie that was released in 1946.

And then quite unexpectedly it turns into a serious adult drama.The duo meet an Italian girl who advises them to hop a ride aboard a northbound train. Then they find refuge in a Catholic church along with a dozen other refugees of all ages from the Nazis. They are a mixed group and each subset speaks its own language which requires subtitles. That in itself is a rarity in a 1945 British movie about escapees from the Nazis. We hear English Italian French German and Dutch. And although the refugees are a pathetic bunch their individual sorrows aren't dwelt on for easy pathos.The terror of imprisonment and probably death lingers constantly in the shadows but the only German soldiers we see are silhouettes against the snowy mountaintops or halfheard voices from the other side of the door. Missing The arrogant Nazi officer with the sneer and the monocle that is so often present in these kinds of films. Also missing Long impassioned speeches about freedom and democracy and you and your kind. These are just a handful of impoverished people in rags trying to find food and a place to warm up. By Jupiter if I didn't know better I'd be thinking neorealism.I don't know where the movie was shot but the locations exceed our expectations. The British film industry was about on its knees during this point of the war and yet the evocation of a bombedout Italian village is successful and the Alpine snow is definitely bone chilling.The dialog is adult too. A little girl asks her grandmother where the English soldier has gone now that he's buried. Asleep says the grandmother. And her son Bernard who sacrificed himself for the rest? Asleep too  deep and safe.".

As German fascism cast its shadow across Europe Lindtberg emigrated to Switzerland where after several years of controversial filmmaking during and after World War II he was eventually naturalized. The Last Chance is a work of historical fiction which draws its power from consistent plausibility made possible by its historic and geographic context. The story takes place mostly in the Italian and Swiss Alps late in Mussolini's rule. It follows two young POWs  one British and one American  who escape from a prisoner transport train in Northern Italy and hatch a scheme to hike across the mountains to neutral Switzerland. The relationships these soldiers develop along the way  with those who help them inform on them shelter and clothe them and particularly those who come to depend on them  show us a side of World War II which is not often wellexplored in nonpropaganda films of the era. Although The Last Chance is powerfully antiwar it is by no means a propaganda film. Rather it is a thoughtful work of social realism depicting the power and value of humanity to overcome its own tendencies toward collective insanity. Filmed near the end of world war II under what must have been very challenging conditions Lindtberg's few advantages must have been that it would be easy enough to find destroyed villages burnt out buildings and talented actors willing to make a film celebrating the human spirit for little money. The exceptional realism of the sets the effortless cinematography and the talented international cast very few of whom are known for any other films make the film very easy to watch and no suspension of disbelief is required as the script story and action of the plot seem to fit right in place.There are no recognizable stars in The Last Chance but the casting is perfect and there are some very powerful performances. The two leads John Hoy and Ray Reagan  neither of whom ever made another film are very good and most of the Italian cast members give noteworthy performances. Praised as a masterpiece of suspense by none other than Alfred Hitchcock The Last Chance is a war film which contains very little battle action and a surprising amount of philosophical dialog. It may be one of the lowestbudget films to win both a Palme D'Or 1945 and Golden Globe 1947 and the courage of its director in making it when the outcome of the conflict it depicts was far from clear is mirrored in the courage of the protagonists. Lindtberg also drew from his own intimate experience with central Europe during the war to create the memorable characters and story line of this brave film and it shows.".

To answer the first would be 1944 45 just before the fall of Berlin and the place neutral Switzerland and last but not least the film maker a refugee from Nazi Germany.The overtones of the movie are compelling and profound but needs to be viewed in aspect to its time of making and the situation prevailing.The plot revolves around two POWs one British and one American who escape from a POW train just after Mussolini has been ousted from power in 1943 Italy and try to make it to the Swiss border first by boatassisted by a lovely Italian girl and after being assured that they can rejoin their ranks since an Armistice has been declared. They are later forced to take recourse of action to once again escape as Mussolini is rescued by the Germans and Italy is once again at war with the Allies. They are then assisted by a local priest to join up with a batch of refugees probably Jewish but we are never told of their religion the only clue offered to the viewer is that some are not present in church are of different nationalities and one refugee is writing about the plight of minorities in Europe  possibly about Hitlers final solution all of whom seek the refuge of neutral Switzerland and then possibly America.The two POWs are joined by a British Major who has been cut off from his regiment and wants to rejoin his ranks but circumstances force him to accompany the refugees. We are also shown some vignettes of the war atrocities by the Nazis as viewed by the two POWs when they escape in a goods train and of people being separated and sent to concentration camps. All these atrocities are depicted subtly but leave no doubt to the viewer in the message that it conveys.How the small group struggle to reach Switzerland braving the weather the Nazis and other odds form the rest of the movie. Interestingly the British POW is shown as the strongest member of the crowd as he after being wounded insists on the Swiss army permitting the refugees to stay if he is to accept medical attention being covered by the Geneva Convention. He succeeds in getting the refugees asylum but loses his life due to his injuries in the process. The film is very evident in its portrayal of the futility of war and its strong antiwar ethos is subtly enveloped in the greater message about war torn Europe. The acting by nondecrepit actors is adequate and at times outstanding. The direction is good but the camera is outstanding. A must see for all film buffs of the genre.".

It is thought that the bombings will stop and the guns will be silent throughout the troubled land. But like fourth and fifth century barbarians the Nazis invade Italy from the north and move as far south as they can. So Italy becomes divided between the Allied and Fascist  Nazi sectors. Italian partisans always proallied of course attack a POW train taking allied prisoners to a military prison in northern Italy. A captured American sergeant Jim Braddock and a British lieutenant John Halliday escape and aided by an attractive local girl Tonina eventually make it to a small village. The ultimate goal of the escapees is neutral Switzerland as the American and British allies hold southern Italy too far away to traverse. The allied POWs find refuge with a most kindly and understanding Catholic priest Romano Calo who we soon discover is hiding European refugees of various nationalities in his church. There Johnny and Jimmy meet Major Telford a British officer who became separated from his regiment. Not only does the priest hide the soldiers but he also tries to find food for them. The situation is precarious because there is a local exfascist official who resents his new treatment and who has knowledge about the priest. Plus the German soldiers will need little prodding to shut down a Catholic Church and maybe even shoot the priest. Meanwhile Nazi paratroopers in a daring move have rescued Mussolini from capture September 1943 and he is back in charge in the north although of a truncated area and only as a puppet ruler. The village is now under siege by the Germans and the Italian partisan army is holding back the German forces but not for long. The three allied soldiers agree to take the refugees to a town where a trustworthy Italian guide resides. But when they arrive they discover that the Germans having discovered a hidden shotgun have used their excuse to shoot all of the town men without exception including the guide. Now the escaped POW soldiers must make their move through mountain snow to escape to Switzerland without a guide. Do the allied soldiers take the refugees along even though they will be slowed down by them? The movie is one of sacrifice and moral choices not military action. How far does one go to put his life in danger? For instance risking her own life it is the Italian girl who initially helps the escaped allied POWs. Then at the German checkpoint when he is as close as anyone can be to certain death in the tensest of situations the wagon driver saves the two POWs. The Catholic priest who pays the ultimately price has sacrificed all to help ordinary people Italians Dutch French Slavs even nonCatholic Christians and Jews. Contrast these with the innkeeper an exfascist who yearns for his old position. What do the three soldiers decide? And what becomes of them? How many will escape? This powerful film was filmed during World War II but not released until after the war ended as there could have been reprisals from the Nazis. This suspense thriller is recommended especially for World War II aficionados.".

But you want something more specific don't you? Fair enough.It's a story of refuges trying to get away from the Nazis and we begin with a British and American soldier for much of the film as they make their way into a village. Later they are joined by a British officer and civilian refuges.Along with the other characters we are treated to some very believable people as three dimensional as you get and the directing and camera work lets us follow the story as well as the people and their emotions in this odyssey.There are heroics but these are incredibly believable heroics and we get the full motivation for everything that happens. The camaraderie of the times is beautiful and is something missing in today's movies.This is a smart movie. Not only do we get awesome intellectually stimulating ideas drama and story but we also get awesome camera directing and action. This is well paced certainly more fluid and active than 95 of the movies that have been made since 1965 if I am to pick a year in which a modern era begins.Thumbs up. If you get a chance this is a movie that will excite you on all levels for all audiences.".

That is because there weren't any.What inspired me about the films authenticity was how the escaped prisoners of war overcame the language difficulty  one of the men had a working knowledge of the Italian language that he would have picked up as a prisoner of war. Language problems are always something that more commercial War films often seem to short cut  as if the film audience is supposed to believe that everyone in Europe speaks English.I searched for years to see if I could find any reference to this film and eventually found it in a copy of Leslie Halliwell's Film Goers Companion. The advent of the Internet allowed me to watch the film again on YouTube.What is also quite unusual about the film is that the leading roles are played by actors who themselves had served in the Second World War had been captured and had escaped to Switzerland  very brave men.It is also interesting that the supporting cast consisted of many wellknown European actors and actresses. Performers such as Luisa Rossi and Therese Giehse were very famous at the time. The latter was once described as the greatest actress in Europe. It is surprising that I have never seen the film shown again on the television since 1962.The film has many poignant moments which adds to the whole defined aura of the film.The Last Chance neither glamorises nor comes over as an antiwar film but serves as a reverent tribute to the brave men and women who served in such a conflict where so many people suffered and died.I give it 10 out of 10.".

The location setting stands this film apart as well as the fact that we never see a German Nazi's face. They are only seen from a distance or passing by outside. We do get betrayal within a group of villagers a priest who shelters refugees and an escape plan that has to constantly change. Ultimately the film is predictable and some characters can be annoying. Something else to consider is that the 3 main characters were all reallife soldiers who had ended up in Switzerland. Two of them were prisoners of war who had escaped from Italy and 1 had to make an emergency landing after a bombing mission and was detained there. It is this fact that swung the balance in favour of keeping onto this film to view again as we get a slice of reality. Unfortunately the sound quality is poor.It's always interesting to learn something new about WW2 and I never knew the role of the Italian Resistance on their home turf. So I appreciate the topic.".

	schema:headline " Early WWII film of escape and flight from Nazis";
	schema:reviewBody "The Last Chance is a movie about escape and pursuit. It is about Italian villagers helping Jews and Allied POWs escape and about the Allies helping the Jews as well. The setting for the film was 1943 and the place was northern Italy. This little known film was made in Switzerland and released in Zurich on May 26 1945  less than three weeks after the end of WWII in Europe. It opened later that year in New York City Nov. 27 in Brussels Dec.2 and in Paris Dec. 19. It appeared in most other European countries in 1946  but wasn't shown in Italy or Austria until 1947. It was distributed by MGM. Most of the cast were unknown outside of Europe. The main supporting actors had much more movie experience than any of the three male leads who played the Allied soldiers fleeing the Nazis. Ewart Morris appeared in only one other movie and John Hoy and Ray Reagan appeared only in this film. Even with their inexperience the three leads were very good. Characters in the film speak four languages  Italian English German and French.The quality of the film I have is very poor. The movie was obviously made on the cheap but it is very well done and is an excellent story. Very little costuming or casting was needed of German soldiers. Instead much of the filming was done of the escapees and villagers helping them. Excellent filming techniques were used. The use of key lighting with lots of shadows reminds one of the early styles used by Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford. The movie most likely was filmed in Switzerland and part of Italy around Lake Maggiore. This 52500acre lake 23870 hectares straddles the border of Italy and Switzerland. It was a route frequently used by escaping POWs and downed Allied pilots. Other war movies have been made with escapes by way of Lake Maggiore. At the time of filming director Leopold Lindtberg would have had no difficulty finding a burned or war damaged Italian villages in the area. Many locals would be able to serve as extras for the townspeople in the film. These were people who had lived through such treachery and horror within just the past year or two. The film won the grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946 and earned a Golden Globe in 1947. The Last Chance is a very good war drama from WWII. At the start of the war Italy was a fascist state and ally of Germany. But the people overthrew Benito Mussolini in 1943. And throughout the war Italians aided Jews fleeing the Nazis. They hid and helped American British and other Allied downed pilots and they helped escaping POWs. Thousands of Italians were killed by the Germans for aiding escaping Allied soldiers. No other nation during WWII did more to help those fleeing the Nazis. This is a fine movie about that time and effort.".

	schema:headline " Passion of the Passion of the Passion";
	schema:reviewBody "In narrative painting a story is told by the image either through the composition or devices such as registers or continuous narrative. In a film the story and image are separate and the image is usually a reenactment of the story. JeanLuc Godard would say and has said more or less that all art forms have an interrelationship and interchangeability. With this philosophy in mind he used his work to try to break down film from its conceptual boundaries of the narrative. In a sense this is a beautiful gesture and I'm not denying this but this manifestobased approach to art making leads to a lot more of explaining yourself than creating original work. The Godard film I want to put in question is called Passion 1982. It scandalizes the film vernacular of that postmodern trope the film within the film. It goes behind the scenes of filmmaking but the mockfilm which is also titled Passion has no plot. It simply recreates a few painting masterpieces on film with real characters on a real scale. The seminal painting reenactment is Eugene Delacroix's The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople. Delacroix truly wanted to revolutionize narrative painting of the Romantic period in France. He was fed up with the conservatism introduced by painters like David. So rather than painting simple yet psychological moments in a narrative like The Death of Marat he tried to expand the modes of depicting narrative. The result of this effort is evident in The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople completed in 1838 at the height of his career. His mode for this painting is somewhere between narrative registers and a theatrical moment such as the moment Gricault chose for Raft of the Medusa. Elements of story are scattered around the chaos of the historical event a woman kneels over her fallen friend an old man tries to protect a young woman from the crusaders on horseback another man fights a soldier on the steps of a temple etc. At face value it looks a bit like an epic painting but it isn't. Epic paintings always have a shining moment in Delacroix's every moment shines in its own way. So while Delacroix's practice wasn't necessarily interdisciplinary it most certainly zigzagged across painting genres. This aspect of the work is probably one of the Godard's interests in Delacroix being that Godard was a seminal figure in the development of the shiftiest art movement to date postmodernism. The understanding that there are separate shining moments in both Godard's Passion and Delacroix's The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople is very important to the interpretation of these works. As Jerzy the director of Godard's film within the film said An image is not beautiful because it is brutal and eerie it is because the solidarity between ideas is distant and just. This line is incredibly profound because it lays out the truth of art and life in general before the work that truth is that all ideas are conceived disparate from one another because ideas come out of experience which coincidentally is a paraphrasing of another one of Jerzy's lines. This idea becomes more important as the movie progresses. The other paintingreenactments which appear closer to the beginning of the movie are simply still images transferred to three dimensions and then recorded on film but when he gets to the Delacroix scene which was the most modern of the paintings and also stretched the concept of narrative the most he is true to his philosophy. The characters begin the scene by reenacting the sacking of Constantinople so as to have the experience each one on an individual level to be able to depict it. The action which was being filmed didn't even seem important to the filmmakers in fact some of the production assistants were yelling at the actors especially the women who were pretending rather convincingly to be raped and harassed to get back into their places as if they were supposed to be standing still. The action became a way for the still image to fall into place on a more real level than could be composed a testament to Godard's philosophies. So there you have it another piece of writing about ambitious men who wanted to make their mark on civilization and if you pay attention to the gender relations in this movie this is appropriate to mention. There's a lot of pressure out their for the ambitious man and he is extremely sensitive. It's a tiring job for people who are more interested in theory than something more tangible medium over message. And so they deal in epics and ambiguity. Godard intent on advancing the medium of film is torn between writing stories and making abstractions that somehow incorporate characters. His answer make a film about a filmmaker making a film with master paintings in it. In the end he creates a crypt filled so much with briefly explored theories which may be too much to really comprehend that it essentially becomes meaningless. Let's face it Godard's Passion is a puzzle and Delacroix's The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople is a puzzle with historical information behind it. I'd have to say that watching Godard's Passion was like being spoonfed personal beliefs not a work but his philosophy. But I liked it. As an artist it is liberating to think of what Godard proposed with his reenactment of the invasion of Constantinople. Maybe if I get into the right groove my work will somehow form out of a rehashing of my experiences and I can make my experiences as exciting as a reenactment of The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople.".

	schema:reviewBody "If one were to hold up a camera to life and to film for ninety minutes the result would be more than likely a boring snapshot of the banal and mundane. These snapshots of life would have no narrative would be disjointed and chaotic for such is life. Godard's Passion struck me as just that a snapshot of the banality of life the disconnected seemingly meaningless misadventures of ordinary people captured in one moment of time. But of course these are not ordinary people in ordinary circumstances these are the creations of Godard's imagination yet the presentation of the content of the film is without structure narrative or any of the Hollywood conventions of 'good filmmaking'. I found the film compelling and intriguing I wanted to know more about the people and the universe that they populated. The lack of narrative structure was not a negative factor in my enjoyment of the film for the anarchic content was of itself enough to keep my mind from wandering away from it. Godard's reflexive jibes at cinema convention were acerbic and witty carrying with them a tremendous knowledge of the mechanics of filmmaking. The story of Passion what story there is is subservient to the process of filmmaking and Godard's desire to subvert it. For me that is what makes this film so entertaining.The influence of Godard's work on other filmmakers is probably most profound in European cinema where the role of the Auteur is if not quite nurtured respected. It was a delightful surprise for me when having seen Passion I began to draw connections between Godard's storytelling and popular TV comedy. The First Series of the BBC comedy 'The Office' by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant leapt to mind as I mulled over Passion. The nonstructure of Passion is very much evident in The Office where the stories unfold as snapshots and moments in time captured and heavily influenced by the presence of the cameras. The Office is probably the most original piece of TV comedy since Monty Python's Flying Circus yet I can see the influence of filmmakers like Godard in its presentation. Although there exists an A plot B plot and guest plots typical TV structure in The Office it is the presentation that makes all the difference. If handled in a more traditional fashion it is highly unlikely that The Office would ever have been made never mind popular. Even the origins of The Office pay homage to the antistructural approach of filmmakers like Godard. Conceived and performed as an adlib piece on a BBC director's course by Gervais and Merchant it shined with originality and a deep knowledge of and healthy disrespect for convention much like Godard really.The success of The Office owes much to its originality and wit but also to the possibility that the audience is searching for a new experience in terms of storytelling both on television and film. The irony is that this type of storytelling has been with us since Godard and long before Godard. Perhaps the audience has finally caught up with the filmmakers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Passion was the kind of JeanLuc Godard picture I would watch rather late at night ironically enough thinking of it and other works of his like digging into a good book as something fulfilling before conking out. There are things that make this effort quite reccomendable albeit I'm not sure how I would react to it overall if seen again in the context of a sunny day and some more concentration going on. What remains striking even when Godard was at his most slummingit points in the 80s and he had quite a few are the images as done by a master of the camera. The opening shot is one of these with the airplane far off in the sky letting out its white line of smoke photographed to a classical composition playing in the background. It has a feel of the documentary but the push of something more operatic in the meaning behind the image. This could go for what is most significant about the rest of the film where per usual as one of Godard's most lovehate subjects cinema itself is dissected though what could be more like abstract documentary figures as characters.The one asset to a film like Passion at least in comparison to other works at this period for the filmmaker is that there is at least something of a story going on something that doesn't shut out a viewer entirely by the banality of overused semantics and images that end up evoking a disinterest in the distance of subject to viewer. There's even a couple of conversations one sees from time to time with the characters that go towards at least coherent and at best with a good edge at the struggles of filmmaking and the hassles of love or halfhearted lust. The only problem then comes with some of this just being so experimental that it ends up closing off some viewers. I remember one segment that had the inklings of being a compelling scene where Godard shows the filming within the filming if it is that maybe it isn't of a period piece being filmed. There's many faces and narration going over each face and image but one's attention at least mine anyway waxed and waned. This may or may not be Godard's fault in fact one of the points that Godard has in his main filmmaker character having to make a film on TV is how mixed forms of media can be sort of antithetical. But to say that there are more than a couple of scenes and moments that foreshadow Godard's decent into pure uncaptivating selfindulgence in his later years is present even amid the nudity and classical music.".

	schema:reviewBody "JeanLuc Godard makes me think clearer. After having read the other comments accusing Passion of being boring and pretentious crap I can only say that I strongly disagree. Comments like those just make me angry. JLG's films are definitely not boring unless you are completely unintellectual and don't have a clue of what is going on. Passion and JLG's other films are fresh and intellectual and philosophic. Godard is unique. It is as simple as that. Newcomers might look after some kind of plot and find themselves confused. I don't know why they do because a film does not have to have a fixed plot a story or something like that but in a way it gets one by itself. Godard clearly points out in the film that in cinema there are no rules.Maybe you could say Passion is about art. And Poland Godard never hesitate of adding political aspects in his later films. A lot of classical music is played during the scenes and Godard keeps turning the music on and off like he uses to. At one occasion he is playing Mozart's Requiem then he turns it off in the middle of the piece. Then he turns it on again from the beginning turns it off and starts over. My intuition told me that the music would continue once the same track had been played three times. And so it did. You can trust Godard. The visualizations of classical paintings by Delacroix Rubens and Rembrandt are spectacular. Overall it is a beautiful film with cinematography by the legendary New Wave cinematographer Raoul Coutard. The first half contains some scenes were the photo and the voices are not synchronized giving a messy impression which doesn't have to be negative. This impression is increased by the several childish quarrels among the characters.910".

Passion has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil but I have unfortunately bought an imported VHS and today I have decided to watch it. What a waste of time! There is neither storyline nor screenplay the characters have the first name of each actor or actress there is no edition and the viewer sees disjointed scenes on the screen. This dreadful mess is about a Polish director who is the alterego of Godard that is filming a movie without story or money and has simultaneous affair with the owner of a hotel and a worker of a factory.

	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever watched a movie and been aware of how much your emotions are being manipulated? Your buttons being pushed?Just before I watched this film I'd seen neuroscientist Susan Greenfield say how modern media encourages a sequence she calls arousaladdictionreward. And stimulating that mental pathway releases dopamine which inhibits the part of the brain associated evaluating social behaviour planning complex cognitive behaviour personality expression and decision making. Most films are designed to produce emotional response. We are aroused for instance by the plight of the leading lady addicted to the drama long enough to see what happens and then suitably rewarded when she marries and lives happily ever after. Not only have we been told what to feel but our critical thinking is subjugated into passive viewing. Unbiased appraisal of hypothetical outcomes is largely overridden by dominant subtexts. Critical thinking off mainstream message on.Godard claims he makes films to invite audiences to think not to feel. The complex concept and metaphor rather than adrenalinfilled stories can at first seem boring. Lacking in formal narrative they flop at the box office yet go on to critical acclaim and canonical status. Passion examines this discrepancy between a film as a piece of art versus the demands of commercial cinema.Passion is a film within a film. Jerzy a Polish filmmaker in western Europe is recreating tableaux vivants  masterpieces by Goya Rembrandt El Greco Ingres and Delacroix. Tableaux vivants were a popular 19th century precinema entertainment described for instance in Sontag's novel The Volcano Lover. Actors don't speak or move and Jerzy is obsessing over light and shade while making up scenarios on the fly. His aesthetically ambitious film is two billion francs over budget. Money is needed. Meanwhile backers harangue Jerzy over his lack of storyline.The filmmakers occasionally go to a nearby hotel and factory to find extras. Jerzy seduces both the factory owner's wife and a worker Isabelle Isabelle Huppert who has been laid off and wants her money. They are attracted to the artistic environment finding an aesthetisized mirror of their daily life. Squabbles offset seem to be echoed in set pieces for instance where a Crusader carries off a halfclad maiden. The idea is voiced that work and love share the same movements underlined with typical Godardian 'food for thought' such as One has to work on loving or love working.With painting image takes precedence over movement. The viewer supplies movement or 'narrative' by imagining a backstory or the painting's creation. With film movement takes precedence over image. Brechtian techniques can be used to jolt audiences into awareness of stillness or a concept contained in the film allowing us to approach it from different angles much as we would a sculpture. Some techniques here used by Godard include extended Lcuts we hear one woman talking but the camera is on another woman who is talking at the same speed her voice muted symbolically unheard. We watch an actress as she watches herself on a video monitor where she is struggling to lipsynch an operatic aria. That the film mirrors the film within the film and also its own making focuses our attention on the idea of what we are watching rather than the visual spectacle itself. Godard breaks down the barrier between documentary and fiction It's not a lie but rather something imagined not the exact truth nor the opposite of truth. It's set apart from the real as it appears by the thoroughly calculated approximations of verisimilitude.In making his Passion the word can be taken in all three senses Godard like Jerzy experienced resistance from actors because action is organised around images rather than a script. He created scenarios on a daytoday basis as the film was being shot. For nonGodard fans Passion is less hard work than his most abstruse work but still takes effort to figure out what is happening rather than dismiss it as meaningless selfindulgence which on casual viewing would be very easy to do. Once that investment has been made it contains not only considerable satire but enough material to engender repeat viewing. Although there are some political overtones they are more in the background than with his earlier work. The film can also be admired for sheer exquisiteness attention to detail and perfect lighting in its recreation of famous paintings. Amidst the mayhem of the studio and the baring of the director's soul the young woman dancing clumsily around with a robe falling off the young girl told to lie naked in the pool as a starshape or the cherub with a pointing finger  all are transformed into images of utter beauty. Godard's rendering of Rembrandt's Nightwatch is uncanny to anyone familiar with the painting. Goya's Nude Maja closely resembles Godard's live copy. The characters in Godard's version of Ingres' Small Bather might be inexact but a comparison draws attention to the perfectly reproduced luminescence of the woman's skin  an effect achieved by perfect lighting  lighting that makes the human image semidivine. An image is not powerful because it's brutal or eerie muses Jerzy but because the solidarity between ideas is distant and just.Passion is an outpouring of the creative process inspired according to Godard by Titan's Bacchus and Ariadne. Together with First Name Carmen and Slow Motion it is is one of three films by Godard showing directors struggling with 'impossible' projects. I sometimes find Godard almost spoils me for conventional cinema. Like one of his characters I find myself muttering Don't push my buttons! OK?".

What has to be confronted is that the work is essentially diaristic and subjective these films are the more or less uncensored insides of Godard's head not a white paper on a topic no matter how challenging or frustrating to expectations.It also must be acknowledged that for Godard even ideation is essentially sensuous aestheticisable ideas like a piece of irruptive slapstick staging a stale aphorism a blast of the Mozart Requiem are objects of delectation and desire and finally repositories of aesthetic emotionhandwrapped presents. To say that the ideology of Godard's Maoist period was finally another aesthetic object for him is not to condescend to him as a radicalchicster. Very simply Godard is an artist for whom the gland that produces aesthetic feeling works ten times more overtime than anyone else.This produces the jarring and sometimes tonic feeling that we are overhearing the disordered and associative thoughts of God as He falls asleep. In a late lyric work like HELAS POUR MOI this quality becomes transcendent the film is like a communication from a higher alien intelligence. In PASSION that desire to aestheticize everything in sight to wave a wand marked excruciating beauty in essence to make like a cinematic Goldfinger is tripped up by the story Godard was required to tell in order to receive funding.The necessity of telling a story is one of the many subjects that flit by in this production which followed Godard's minorly popular comeback EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. And the story Godard tells is so halfheartedly offered it disrupts the allpervasive atmosphere of heightened lyricism he generates elsewhere. In essence it's the same old movie about the making of a movie the director Jerzy Radzilowicz is an idiot caught between a virginal proletarian Isabelle Huppert! and a slatternly hangeron Hanna Schygulla. The director pontificates the producer Michel Piccoli avoids paying checks and the inevitable phone calls for completion funds are delivered in dirty rooms.If this reminds you of everything from BEWARE OF A HOLY WHORE to LIVING IN OBLIVION you're right but nothing in those movies compared to Godard's strategy of contemptuously making his stars Huppert and Piccoli stutter and cough respectively. Or to the moment when a grip tells a child extra out of nowhere O those who will come after usdo not harden your hearts against us.PASSION reminded me of John Simon's review of LE GAI SAVOIR which began in the manner of I have seen no movie more illucid arbitrary and yes insane as...

Miss Lucachevski the tall and very elegant scriptgirl says that she is tired of working on a production that produces nothing and we can feel her frustration. Jerzy asks her to read a passage from Les Miserables about Enjolras's passion then he makes the bloodless remark about bloodless times I've used in the summary. Radziwilowicz is a puddingfaced actor who shows us little of what he's feeling. Hanna Schygulla on the other hand is extraordinarily animated and focused as the uneasy female angle of the triangle with Michel and Jerzy. She is photographed better here than Fassbinder managed to shoot her in his films. MacCabe's book on Godard tells how she came to work one day after a night of excess and Godard insisted on shooting her with every wrinkle lovingly recorded. Whatever she is gorgeous every bit as striking as Anna Karina or even Jane Fonda to name two of Godard's leading ladies.The enactments of the paintings are ravishing worth the price of the video in themselves. Myriem Roussel posing on the pool deck for the Ingres Bather is stunning the entry of the crusaders into Jerusalem will delight you. A knockout.".

An art historian might appreciate the messages hidden within the old master painting being turned into a movie by the director at the centre of the piece. For the rest of us it's hard to follow threads of the various partially connected stories in which largely unappealing characters bicker berate and bed one another. Jerzy a Polish movie director has literally 'lost the light' in his big budget production. His efforts are hamstrung by news of Solidarity's emergent uprising in his native land the financial demands of his producers and his involvement with two women  the owner of the hotel in which most of his film company lodge and a dowdy sacked worker at her husbands factory. That's pretty well it. There's not much more. The images of the old masters Jerzy is attempting to turn into a film although he seems to have little concept of exactly how are nicely lit but the films exteriors around the promising location of Lake Geneva are drab the interiors even worse and despite some big names among the cast there is little charisma in evidence. I've watched it twice and sadly 'Passion' an oddly inappropriate title in itself made no more impression on the second viewing. The Godard of 'Pierrot Le Fou' a film I loved seems a long way from the Godard of 'Passion'. Other reviewers have clearly found a meaning and beauty that I have missed. But hey! If it floats your boat then thats good.".

The result is one of Godard's better latterday works but having now caught up with his successive work apparently also featuring the uncredited hand of Carriere PASSION I find myself once again bewildered while his next few films  FIRST NAME CARMEN 1983 DETECTIVE 1985 and HAIL MARY 1986  once again show a marginal improvement by all accounts he would again alienate much of his audiences with the remainder of his filmography of which I am only familiar with the equally frustrating NOUVELLE VAGUE 1990.Apart from the aforementioned Carriere PASSION also reunited Godard with Raoul Coutard although Vittorio Storaro had actually been his first choice  director and cinematographer had not worked together since their 1960s heyday more precisely on Godard's surreal road movie masterpiece WEEKEND 1967  as well as actors Isabelle Huppert from SLOW MOTION where she had played a prostitute and Michel Piccoli from CONTEMPT where he had been a cuckolded screenwriter. The latter film would make a telling comparison with PASSION since they both deal with the world of international moviemaking but while the earlier example did not sacrifice entertainment value when expressing its intellectual integrity the same cannot be said of the film under review! In fact the filmwithinafilm being shot here seeks for no particular reason to recreate some famous tableaux on celluloid underscored by an operatic soundtrack...but never having been too much of a fan of paintings or opera regarding them as highbrow artistic mediums PASSION becomes a pretentious ride to nowhere Poland notwithstanding! Indeed exiled Polish filmmaker Jerzy Radziwilowicz decides to head back home at the very end and both Hanna Schygulla and Isabelle Huppert decide to join him on a whim.The film's Polish director seems more interested in and distracted by the two stars Schygulla plays a hotel owner who is factory owner Piccoli's mistress and Huppert a rebellious factory worker than in getting anything shot in a way I can relate to his inertia since these past two weeks I have not gotten much 'work' done because of a trio of female friends I have been in contact with! Besides Jerzy is forever complaining of the inadequacy of Mr. Coutard's lighting amusingly everybody appearing in the film plays a character with a similar first name as the actor playing him! Ultimately however for all the film's intermittent and frankly slight amusements Piccoli has an annoyingly consistent cough a penchant for roses and is made to dodge one persistent creditor throughout the film the sheer fact that female 'actresses' on the set do nothing but pose and shed their clothing for gratuitous fullfrontal nudity at times makes the film seem uncomfortably like a highbrow Tinto Brass effort or a lowbrow Peter Greenaway one! The film was included in Lionsgate 3Disc Set of Godard films along with FIRST NAME CARMEN DETECTIVE and OH WOE IS ME 1993 like its predecessor Godard shot a featurette on the making of his current film but unfortunately it has not been included in the enclosed supplements and this is one of the reasons why I opted to obtain the film from ulterior sources. Despite my reservations PASSION was up for the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival where it competed against eventual cowinner CostaGavras' MISSING Lindsay Anderson's BRITANNIA HOSPITAL Werner Herzog's FITZCARRALDO Wim Wenders' HAMMETT Michelangelo Antonioni's IDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN Jerzy Skolimowski's MOONLIGHTING The Taviani Brothers' THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS 1981 and Ettore Scola's LA NUIT DE VARENNES and ironically won a prize for Coutard! and nominated for a couple of Cesar awards where it competed against the Carrierescripted DANTON and THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE!.".

Ultimately however for all the film's intermittent and frankly slight amusements Piccoli has an annoyingly consistent cough a penchant for roses and is made to dodge one persistent creditor throughout the film the sheer fact that female 'actresses' on the set do nothing but pose and shed their clothing for gratuitous fullfrontal nudity at times makes the film seem uncomfortably like a highbrow Tinto Brass effort or a lowbrow Peter Greenaway one! The film was included in Lionsgate 3Disc Set of Godard films along with FIRST NAME CARMEN DETECTIVE and OH WOE IS ME 1993 like its predecessor Godard shot a featurette on the making of his current film but unfortunately it has not been included in the enclosed supplements and this is one of the reasons why I opted to obtain the film from ulterior sources. Despite my reservations PASSION was up for the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival where it competed against eventual cowinner CostaGavras' MISSING Lindsay Anderson's BRITANNIA HOSPITAL Werner Herzog's FITZCARRALDO Wim Wenders' HAMMETT Michelangelo Antonioni's IDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN Jerzy Skolimowski's MOONLIGHTING The Taviani Brothers' THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS 1981 and Ettore Scola's LA NUIT DE VARENNES and ironically won a prize for Coutard! and nominated for a couple of Cesar awards where it competed against the Carrierescripted DANTON and THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE!.";

Nick Cassavettes deserves a lot of credit for creating a film that faces the issues without getting too maudlin and does so with sensitivity and objectiveness. The performances are good from everyone. The casting of Cameron Diaz isn't perhaps the best but I admire the effort she put into the role. She did very well. The character development is outstanding you get to know each character and you understand each of their perspectives. Joan Cusack is particularly affecting in an offbeat role for her.

	schema:reviewBody "Nick Cassavetes is almost like a walking advertisement for Kleenex at this point. After such shameless melodramtic weepers like John Q and The Notebook I wasn't so keen on seeing My Sisters Keeper based on the book by Jodi Picoult. Yet every once in a while a chick flick comes along that touches the chick in every man.Cameron Diaz plays Sara Fitgerald who along with her husband Brian Jason Patric makes the decision of genetically engineering a child who will be a direct match to their leukemiastricken 2yearold daughter Kate. Abigail Breslin plays the engineered child at age 11. Her name is Anna who since the age of 5 has had blood taken from her and been put thru medical procedures to help keep Kate alive. Anna loves Kate played as a teenager by Sofia Vassileva but when her parents want to give Kate one of Anna's kidneys Anna finally says enough. Sure that no one is looking out for her interests Anna hires a lawyer Alec Baldwin and sues for the right to her own body. Sara a woman who has made caring for Kate her fulltime job is upset while Brian understands. Meanwhile Kate feels guilty that her disease is tearing the family apart.Cassavetes and coscreenwriter Nicholas Leven are dealing with a straightup tearjerker here but it's astonishingly free of heavyhandedness and it cuts deep with probing questions and real emotion. These are characters with feelings and concerns torn between such complicated issues as saving a daughter by experimenting with another sacrificing your own body even though you know it will diminish quality of life and dealing with how a disease can burden a family. The movie uses flashbacks such as Kate being diagnosed as a young child her parents being given the choice of invitro and a very young Anna disturbingly forced into operations and forwards Kate lying in a hospital bed looking at a scrapbook of her family that add dimension. As do the switching of narrators each character getting a chance to offer their points of view and feelings about how the diagnosis and everything after it has effected them.Unfortunately it's also going in a lot of different directions and add in a dyslexic and lostintheshuffle brother Evan Ellingson and it's sometimes hard for Cassavete's to keep track of all of them. The second act in particular has very little to do with the SaraAnna conflict and the more lighthearted scenes such as the family frolicking happily on a beach together seem odd because you feel like there is some contentiousness between Sara and Anna that really doesn't come out til the ending courtroom scene.However these are small problems rendered almost excusable by powerful performances. Abigail Breslin has surpassed Dakota Fanning in allout maturity juggling her characters fears for her own well being with the remorse of not being strong enough for her sister. And Diaz is strongwilled but obsessive perfect as a onetrack minded mother so intent on trying to keep one daughter alive that she's not even thinking about anything else. Jason Patric is the open and understanding father and Alec Baldwin is good comic relief playing a lawyer so cocky he sued God. And Sofia Vassileva is nothing short of powerhouse her heartbreaking performance rising above all the cancer makeup and bloody vomitting and nosebleeds to find Kate's burdensome guilt and brave soul. And only stonehearts won't share in her joy as she gets dressed up and goes to prom with another terminally ill boy Thomas Dekker.I'm not saying this movie isn't a cheap excuse to make you cry but as far as cheap excuses go this one is richly made. My Sister's Keeper is as surprising and heartfelt a piece of work as I've seen all year long and the acting is about as good as it comes. With this and his previous Alpha Dog Cassavete's signals himself as a real filmmaker as he rarely ever hits a false note. In a year filled with movies that I've seen fail at finding the humanity in their stories this one is a keeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've read My Sister's Keeper you'll be disappointed. Was the acting good? In some cases great! Kate's character will probably get an academy nomination if not an award. Everyone did a great job as far as performances are concerned. HOWEVERHollywood made some big mistakes here that some of us won't forgive them for. For the sake of time which is money I understand clipping portions of the story that neither make or break it. Taking away the attorney's Campbell Alexander exgirlfriend was understandable but sad but downplaying Jesse's arsonist revenge against mom and dad which highlights how angry he is at being deserted in sissy's favor is just plain wrong. There was too much time wasted on extended family involvement and not enough given to some of the other characters including dad. We get the gist he's a fireman but his role in the book was much more important than that. And as to the ending? HOW DARE THEY? The most important message in Jodi Picoult's story is how ironictragic it was that Sara worked so hard ruining Anna's life to save Kate. She could have loved Anna to nth degree while helping Kate but wastes so much of their lives hoping for something that appears to be impossible. Then when she begins to see the light and time for goodbyes have come Anna dies in the auto accident and becomes a kidney donor for Kate after allallowing her to live after alland removing Sarah's opportunity to love Anna forever. Was it painful? Yeah! Was it a warning to all human beings who need to remember to love while you can and not take things for granted. Yeah! Did this movie deliver? No. Not for me. Was it a good movie for itself? Sure. Enjoy it. As for me and Jodi Picoult I'm just disappointed. Had they left the story intact and kept the messages both the obvious and the more subtle intact I think this could have been an academy award movie. As it is I think it will just go down as good.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have seen the trailer you know what you are in for. Kate has leukemia and is dying from a very early age only prolonged due to the chemotherapy and her little sister. This sibling Anna was a testtube baby devised as a curea literal spare parts factory. The family's mother gave up her law practice to stay home and be there for her daughter while the father works as a firefighter and does what he can to bring money in. As Brian Fitzgerald says being the parent of a sick child is a fulltime job. Sara's main focus is in saving her daughter no matter what even sometimes to the detriment of her other children. Brother Jesse is neglected in his schooling and Anna is looked upon to endure excruciatingly painful procedures at risk to her own wellbeing in the hopes they help Kate. As the day of reckoning looms closer Anna finds a lawyer and decides that she is finished being a lab ratshe wants to live her own life without worrying. The Fitzgerald family was already hanging by a thread and this action is the last straw threatening to break them apart forever.Whereas the story itself is somewhat obvious why is it that Anna decides now to stand up for her rights? it is with everything else that surprises. Number one on that list is Cameron Diaz. I am a selfproclaimed nonfan of this Alist actress for a number of reasons. I believe she has gotten by on her looks which confuses me to no end and of late has been looking way too old to play the roles she has namely the bubbly blonde airhead. Here however she is a mother that cannot accept the fact that her daughter is dying a mother that lets the pragmatic lawyer come to the surface micromanaging in a utilitarian way seeing that her dying child needs help and that pain for her other daughter is justified. The grief the tiredness the dedication and the hidden love behind a stiff faade of mechanics rather than heart all show on her face. Probably her best performance ever Diaz is playing someone her own age and shows that she can act if given the chance. I thought she did well in In Her Shoes and she builds on that success here. I hope she sticks with it because this is a Cameron Diaz I could watch.Nick Cassavetes director and cowriter of the film is the second surprise. Son of prolific auteur John Cassavetes I used to laugh at his early work. I mean John Q is far from a masterpiece and then there is the infamous The Notebook the film lingering with the potential of being forced to watch on request by every man's girlfriend. But 2006 brought the solid Alpha Dog and coupled with My Sister's Keeper maybe that Nicholas Sparks yarn no longer appears as scary as it once did. Cassavetes shows a nice touch in tempering the emotionally draining with subtle comic relief. You get inside of each character learning what they think during their moment of voiceover and flashback. I loved the collaged scrapbook as well. What a powerful little prop that expressed so much of the past as well as so much hope for the future.The acting is stellar throughout including some stalwarts like Jason Patric as father Brian and Alec Baldwin in a rare serious role as lawyer Campbell Alexander. Even Joan Cusack brings some emotional weight in a role as the lawsuit's judge her life mirroring that of Diaz's Sara. Evan Ellingson is also very effective as Jesse the keeper of Anna's secret and silent presence of strength for the family watching everything fall apart trying his best to stay sane and hope it all works out. And you can't say enough about young Abigail Breslin my vote for best child actor around. Dakota Fanning has nothing on this one as Breslin acts with the poise of an adult while still being a child rather than a twentyyearold in a twelveyearold body.The real shining star however is Sofia Vassilieva as Kate. This is a powerful performance that resonates every single second. Combining the angst of an adolescent with the pride and vanity of a young girl who has lost her hair and a body slowly shutting down this young lady captures the pain and heartbreak perfectly. Oftentimes too that heartbreak is not for her mortality but instead for what her condition is doing to those she loves. You will see the helplessness in her eyes as she watches the tears anger and frustration of those trying to fight for her life. But through flashbacks we also catch glimpses of the moments in her life that helped her feel like a normal kid. Thomas Dekkar's Taylor is a big part of this but her family is as well. Those moments in the photo booth or on a trampoline amongst hundreds of bubbles are the ones that linger in your memory. They are the moments of innocence of childhood that we hope all our children experience. My Sister's Keeper succeeds in showing us not to take life for granted because it can be taken away without notice. Kate Fitzgerald knows this fact and she just hopes to be able to convey it to her family so that when she is gone they will be able to live on.".

I hope she sticks with it because this is a Cameron Diaz I could watch.Nick Cassavetes director and cowriter of the film is the second surprise. Son of prolific auteur John Cassavetes I used to laugh at his early work. I mean John Q is far from a masterpiece and then there is the infamous The Notebook the film lingering with the potential of being forced to watch on request by every man's girlfriend. But 2006 brought the solid Alpha Dog and coupled with My Sister's Keeper maybe that Nicholas Sparks yarn no longer appears as scary as it once did. Cassavetes shows a nice touch in tempering the emotionally draining with subtle comic relief. You get inside of each character learning what they think during their moment of voiceover and flashback. I loved the collaged scrapbook as well. What a powerful little prop that expressed so much of the past as well as so much hope for the future.The acting is stellar throughout including some stalwarts like Jason Patric as father Brian and Alec Baldwin in a rare serious role as lawyer Campbell Alexander. Even Joan Cusack brings some emotional weight in a role as the lawsuit's judge her life mirroring that of Diaz's Sara. Evan Ellingson is also very effective as Jesse the keeper of Anna's secret and silent presence of strength for the family watching everything fall apart trying his best to stay sane and hope it all works out. And you can't say enough about young Abigail Breslin my vote for best child actor around. Dakota Fanning has nothing on this one as Breslin acts with the poise of an adult while still being a child rather than a twentyyearold in a twelveyearold body.The real shining star however is Sofia Vassilieva as Kate. This is a powerful performance that resonates every single second. Combining the angst of an adolescent with the pride and vanity of a young girl who has lost her hair and a body slowly shutting down this young lady captures the pain and heartbreak perfectly. Oftentimes too that heartbreak is not for her mortality but instead for what her condition is doing to those she loves. You will see the helplessness in her eyes as she watches the tears anger and frustration of those trying to fight for her life. But through flashbacks we also catch glimpses of the moments in her life that helped her feel like a normal kid. Thomas Dekkar's Taylor is a big part of this but her family is as well. Those moments in the photo booth or on a trampoline amongst hundreds of bubbles are the ones that linger in your memory. They are the moments of innocence of childhood that we hope all our children experience. My Sister's Keeper succeeds in showing us not to take life for granted because it can be taken away without notice. Kate Fitzgerald knows this fact and she just hopes to be able to convey it to her family so that when she is gone they will be able to live on.";

Taylor says That could be me tomorrow. He unwraps a stick of gum and gives it to Kate. Then he unwraps a second as well and gives it to her. I was in tears. Director and Writer Nick Cassavetes's scene is sweet and understated in its humanity. Not all of Cassavetes director of The Notebook and Writer Jeremy Leven's My Sister's Keeper is as gentle. Their My Sister's Keeper based on the bestselling novel by Jodi Picoult is a heart wrenching tear jerker that will both stab and touch your heart. It may be one of the best movies of the year. Alec Baldwin is amazing reminding us what a powerful actor he can be. Sofia Vassilleva is astounding. Thomas Dekker is awesome. Cameron Diaz gives perhaps her best performance ever.In My Sister's Keeper 11 yearold Anna Fitzgerald spirited Abigail Breslin is expected to donate her kidney to her leukemia stricken older sister Kate Vassilleva who is in renal failure. However as it turns out Anna was specifically sired to provide body parts for Kate be it bone marrow platelets and now kidney. Weary of the overwhelming responsibility for an 11 yearold Anna hires famous attorney Campbell Alexander to file for emancipation from her parents. Her mom is Sara Cameron Diaz a former attorney who retired to care for Kate. She swears to her husband Brian quietly strong Jason Patric I'm not going to let her Kate die! Sara slaps Anna when she receives the court summons. Enraged Sara confronts Alexander Baldwin in his office confessing that he is good and almost had her believing that he cared about Anna. In utter solace Alexander admits Funny? I was about to say the same thing to you. Baldwin is so powerful. His Alexander illuminates the heartbreaking question We know that Sara would die for Kate but does she also love Anna the daughter they had entirely to save her sister? Abigail Breslin is stellar in both her heartbreak and joy. Cassavetes paints a wonderful scene as fireman Brian watches Anna spend dinner with the other firemen at his station. It is the only time she really gets to be an 11 yearold girl and not her sister's keeper. Brian says to Sara What if she doesn't want to do it? For Sara that is not an answer. Here Diaz is painfully human as a mother outraged by the unfairness of life. She will not let go even if costs her the love of one daughter.To that end Cassavetes has the electrifying Joan Cusack as Judge De Salvo who hears Anna's case. Turns out this is her first case since suffering a nervous breakdown following the death of her 13 yearold daughter in a hitandrun accident. In her meeting in chambers with Anna Anna asks De Salvo What did it feel like when she died? Cusack is shockingly and powerfully silent for a minute as a tear runs down her cheek. Anna apologizes for asking. Cusack says Death is death. That is counterpoint to Sara. Finally Sara's sister Kelly beautiful and strong Heather Wahlquist implores Sara You gotta let go There is a surprise in My Sister's Keeper though in retrospect it makes a lot of sense. In the dramatic court scene brother Jesse surprisingly strong Evan Ellingson screams to Anna Tell them the truth! But it is the quiet moments that moved and had me in tears. Suffering Kate confesses to Anna I'm sorry I let them hurt you I was supposed to protect you. Vassilleva as Kate is amazing in scene with Diaz as she tells her Mom It's okay. Life goes on. Death is death. And you gotta let go. Nick Cassavetes's My Sister's Keeper is beautiful and moving in its simplicity as the story celebrates life family and power of love. See My Sister's Keeper.".

	schema:headline " We make choices in life every day and you should make a choice and see this movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Sara Cameron Diaz and Brian Fitzgerald Jason Patric have just been informed that their young daughter Kate Sofia Vassilieva has leukemia and that she only has a few years to live. The doctor suggests to the parents that they try an unorthodox medical procedure of producing another child in a testtube that would be a perfect match as a donor for Kate. Sara will try anything to save Kate and they have a new baby Anna Abigail Breslin to be used as a donor for Kate. The first thing they use is blood from the umbilical cord for Kate. As years go on the doctors must take bone marrow from Anna to give to Kate. At age 11 the next thing Anna must give to her sister is a kidney. Anna has had enough of all of these medical procedures and she decides to sue her parents for medical emancipation and the right to decide how her body will be used. The whole family is being torn apart by Anna's decision because everyone knows what will happen to Kate if she doesn't get a new kidney.My Comment Everyone knows from the movie trailer that the story is about a young girl who has cancer. You would think that it would be a depressing movie but you would be wrong. It is a story of some of the choices we make in life. Having a testtube baby as body parts for another child was a choice made by the parents. Anna wanting to stop giving her body to her sister was a choice. As with all choices there are consequences. Kate will die without a new kidney. There are many very hard choices in life and in death that we must make and this is a good movie to show you the way. Diaz as the pragmatic lawyer who was fighting to the very end for her daughter lost focus on life and the rest of her family. I believe that this is Diaz's best part and performance as an actress. Sofia Vassilieva played Kate who was in pain for most of her life. Sofia played Kate so well that you could see the helplessness in her eyes as she fights for her life. Anna was also part of this pain and Abigail Breslin played this part as a professional. Actually the whole cast was outstanding throughout the film. I loved the collaged scrapbook with voiceover and flashbacks that Kate made to give to her mother. This is a good movie to see with your loved ones. New Line Cinema Run Time 149 Rated PG13 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "In Los Angeles the eleven year old Anna Fitzgerald Abigail Breslin seeks the successful lawyer Campbell Alexander Alec Baldwin trying to hire him to earn medical emancipation from her mother Sara Cameron Diaz that wants Anna to donate her kidney to her sister. She tells the lawyer the story of her family after the discovery that her older sister Kate Sofia Vassilieva has had leukemia how she was conceived by in vitro fertilization to become a donor and the medical procedures she has been submitted since she was five years old to donate to her sister.

The greatest problem is the shallow and unrealistic Hollywoodian approach reducing the strength of the powerful drama and I believe that this theme would be better explored by an independent director in a more realistic environment.

	schema:reviewBody "Is there anything that can really be criticized about this movie? I know that some people are upset that the movie's ending is substantially different from that of the book on which this was based but I've never read the book  so I don't care. I have to judge this movie on its own merits and it's absolutely brilliant  the story the acting the writing. The movie offers the viewer an ethical dilemma. Kate Sofia Vassilieva is dying of leukemia. When she was first diagnosed her parents Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric decided to have another child Anna played by Abigail Breslin in the hopes that her placental blood would help cure the condition. Instead it simply adds years on to her life as she slowly declines and Anna becomes a more and more unwilling yet repeated donor of blood bone marrow and  as the movie picks up the story  now a kidney. To prevent it and knowing that it will mean Kate's death Anna hires a lawyer to sue her parents for medical emancipation  the right to make her own medical decisions.Although moving this wasn't as much of a tear jerker as I thought it would be. Instead it does focus on that ethical dilemma from a variety of perspectives primarily raising the question of whether one daughter's life should take precedence over the other's quality of life. Cameron Diaz was fantastic in a role that as the movie began I didn't really think would fit her very well. Instead she was totally convincing as the mother in denial. She can't accept that Kate is dying she can't accept that Kate is tired of living she can't accept that Anna is tired of being Kate's only lifeline she can't accept that her own family is increasingly turning against her views on this. She has two daughters  one who needs to be told that it's OK to die and one that needs to be told that it's OK to live and she can't meet the needs of either. We see where the movie is heading almost from the beginning which is one of the complaints of those who loved the book  it had a surprise twist ending apparently as opposed to the predictable ending in this one. The problem with twist endings though is that they can seem artificial and unreal. The movie's ending  while predictable  was also powerfully real as is the movie as a whole. I was truly surprised by how much of a chord it struck in me. 1010".

	schema:headline " Started Out Good But Became Too Melodramatic";
	schema:reviewBody "I will say this My Sister's Keeper was one of Nick Cassavetes' better movies to date. But what started out pretty decent ended up being a melodrama that was so wrapped up in wanting to tug the tears out of its viewers that it was about as subtle as a punch in the face. And it seems that this is not the first time that Cassavetes has had this problem. We've seen it before from him in The Notebook and especially in John Q. It seems he can't help himself. For some reason he does not trust his actors to do the job. When all that is needed is a subtle look or some reflective quietness amongst the characters Cassavetes finds it necessary to tell us every single thing that they're thinking or not thinking for that matter. Indeed he packs way more dialogue into a scene than is needed and what we get as a result is a screenplay that is somewhat sappy and very manipulative. But that's not to say that there weren't any strengths to Sister's Keeper. There were a few. The acting is pretty good. In fact I think the most restrained performance came from Jason Patric and his restraint made it the best performance in the film. I also thought the scene where his character grants his daughter's wish by taking her to the beach in spite of his wife's desires was particularly moving. It was a scene that felt real and genuine and because of that it worked quite well. There were others albeit not as many as I would have hoped for. Too bad though. This was a film that had some promise but because of the melodramatic screenplay never lived up to what it could have been.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was quite eager to watch this movie first of all because I'm a great fan of Mrs Picoult and her novels. I hoped to see a very refined story of happiness diluted in tragedy and family bond that overcomes everything.Unfortunately the movie doesn't quite meet the expectations of a book reader.I don't even pay attention at the fact that not all the key plot lines were shown  that's understandable not all movies can last 3 hrs like my beloved Titanic. But the ones that remain are mostly rudely messed up with. Let's start with the age of the main character. In the book she's 13 in the movie  11. Not that much of a difference it might seem. No there is. The girl is trying to demonstrate and prove that she can make her own decisions about her body and health. With a 13 y.o. girl that looks quite credible. With an 11 y.o. kid that looks quite ridiculous and sometimes her actions looked stupid especially since the girl starring in the movie looks very childish. Not to offend the very girl of course.Secondly the character of Jesse. Perhaps they chose an actor who's too young again. Perhaps something was wrong with directing. But a young guy with serious psychological problems and yet some life philosophy portrayed in the book turned into a capricious kid. Still to director's credit the importance of this character for the plot was underlined in a proper way.Lastly the ending. Without the author's agreement the creators of the movie changed it completely. In the movie Kate dies and Anna thinks of her often after that. In the book however Anna and her solicitor Alexander get in a car crash and Anna dies. Her kidney is given to Kate and the latter suddenly recovers completely from her disease. Kate's death also has a point I mean the movie does have an idea and something to think over but that's something totally different from what the writer was trying to tell which I consider not really appropriate. My rating is not higher because I had read the book before watching but not lower since if you haven't read the book you'll most probably love the movie a lot.".

The movie was brilliant moving and beautiful and the acting was remarkable. Abigail Breslin the girl from Little Miss Sunshine was wonderful and I loved her as Anna Fitzerland.

See in the book Anna gets into an accident resulting in her death. Her kidney is given to her sick sister who recovers and lives. In the movie Katie dies. I would prefer the book's ending but still I loved every bit of the movie.So If you've read the book you may not be very happy with this change but I still recommend you to watch it since it will bring tears to your eyes.I apologize for any grammatical mistakes.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll start off by saying that as a movie this flick can stand on its own two feet  for about 5 minutes. If I'd never read the book this movie COULD conceptually fly. The cast does a good job of portraying a somewhat believable set of characters Diaz plays the suffering all consumed mom to the hilt Vassilieva does a great job at playing the cancer stricken Kate Breslin captures the role of Anna very well a girl older than her years carrying the weight of the world on her small shoulders. This is where the similarities end.The rest of the characters evolve into people so far removed from those we fell in love in Jodi's beautiful novel that they are barely recognizable. Baldwin never quite fulfills the role of the intellectual and tenacious defenselawyer. The brief 5 minutes of firefighting followed by another even briefer scene in the fire station are the only nods we get to Brian being a firefighter which ultimately has everything to do with Jodi's alltoo important connection between Brian and Jesse's crucial reconciliation. But I guess this isn't important since Jesse is really a noncharacter. He could have been just as easily written out of the script for all his importance in the film all we see him doing is hanging on street corners.The ending was such a HUGE disappointment as others have already mentioned that all I'll say on that is this it made the whole case courtroom and therefore Anna's role piece of the moviebook null and void. If Kate dies who the heck cares that Anna wins the court case? It was anticlimactic to say the least.The similarities between the movie and the book that spawned it are so few and far between that I can only describe them this way Someone heard that Jodi wrote a poignant bestseller about a girl who has APL and her sister who sues her parents for medical emancipation so as not to continue being a donor for her and thought this was a fabulous movie idea. They then went and wrote their own script about it. It's like a brand new piece of Wrigley's chewing gum... you unwrap it place it in your mouth chew it up and spit it out. The end product looks nothing like what you started out with.In all my years of movie viewing this is the WORST book to movie adaptation and I consider myself a painfully difficult movie critic as do my friends and family. I almost walked out right after Kate died Anna's monologue was so drippingly sweet it was painful to the earsbut I stayed in deference to my sister who was with me. I've never wanted to get up and Hiss and BOOOO at the end of a film but I did at the end of this one.A friend of mine said Jodi's book was about medical ethics and I believe that is why the courtroom drama was such an important part of this book.The directors thought otherwise. This is a clichd movie about a cancer victim and her family with 10 seconds of courtroom thrown in for good measure. Add in an ending that audiences EXPECT rather than the one Picoult fans fell in love with and all together you are knee deep in doggie doodoo.".

Add in an ending that audiences EXPECT rather than the one Picoult fans fell in love with and all together you are knee deep in doggie doodoo.";

	schema:reviewBody "I almost walked out of the theater. I haven't seen anything good directed by Nick Cassavetes. I didn't think he could do any worse. I find his style to be immature from a film making standpoint. My Sister's Keeper was awful. I don't understand why the movie was given the same title as the book. Keeping the names for some characters is not sufficient. The aunt was even changed. What happened to career woman Aunt Suzanne? Obviously these little fowls in the screenplay pales in comparison to the new ending. The girl with cancer dies. This can be expected. This is not the beautiful tragic fabricated irony created in the novel. I was disappointed with every aspect of the movie. Casting was nothing special. I don't understand why Cameron Diaz is being praised for an average performance. After reading the novel she did not effectively bring the true Sarah character to the screen. The cinematography was nothing bad soundtrack and awkward editing only contributed to an awful adapted screenplay. I recommend this to no one even if they have not read the book. Characters were dropped changed along with the settings. I don't see how that movie came from the novel. I truly did not like this movie at all. I cannot even begin to describe the details that were totally adulterated. They couldn't even get the story right so why should I expect they to maintain any integrity of the story. I highly recommend the book but don't waste your money or time on this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Sister's Keeper is based on the novel by Jodi Picoult. It runs 109 minutes long perfect time thank GOD it's not as long dragged out and dreadful as Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. Attended a screening of this on Tuesday and was shocked. I thought it would feature a dysfunctional family blabbing for an hour and 50 minutes for nothing. It was far from that. Story is told in a different way. Flashing between different times without being too confusing. It was a very sad movie but wasn't depressing rather educating about life lessons. Cameron Diaz was great in this. I usually hate her but this is the best I've seen her in so far. Sofia Vassilieva was good as a teenager with cancer and I loved how she comforted her family. In the end everyone in the theater was crying. Great movie. Go see it.By the way you should DEFINITELY see this over Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. Surprised there were 800 people at the screening of that trash and not many people came out to see this great piece of work.Overall Rating 8.1 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Interesting entertaining and sad. Great movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers! Those who want to see the movie or book might not want to read this.I read the book and it was interesting while some things were different many things were the same. They edited a lot out of the book such as the story of Julia and Campbell that was boring and clich anyway but I would have liked to have seen her character. Breslin did a great job playing Anna! I think she is a great actress and perfect for the role. The actress who played Kate was great too we should see more of her. I heard Dakoda Fanning was considered for the role but didn't want to shave her hair whether that's true or not I don't know. Cameron Diaz did a great job! This role was completely different than any I've seen with her this was the first time I saw her play a mother and she did a great job. She is a talented actress and is usually played in comedies or cartoons its nice to see her play a serious role. One thing in the book that was different than the movie was Kate died in the movie if you didn't read the book don't read this part its a spoiler for the book Anna died in the end of a book as the result of a car accident with the lawyer Campbell who drove her home that day. Either way it was sad but in the movie it was more expected. Many people were angered by the ending of the movie but I think both were fine endings either ending could happen. However the author left the ending of the book for interpretation and there are many different ways to interpret if. In movie they sort of spoon fed it. I would have liked the sisters to live not just because it would be less sad but I wanted to know if She would have donated the kidney neither the book nor the movie gave that opportunity. Another thing different in the movie which you may feel is not important but made a difference to me was that Sarah only gave up being a lawyer when her daughter had cancer in the book she gave up law to raise her family and had not practiced law since Jesse was born. The reason that made a difference to me was because she fought as Kate's lawyer and in the book they mentioned she was rusty and had not practice law in a long time. Even in the movie it had to be at least since Anna was born because she gave up law to take care of Kate but they didn't really mention it her not practicing law in a while I don't think and it seemed like she really knew what she was doing. Also Kate mentioned how much her mother gave up for her and how she gave up being a lawyer perhaps that was why they changed it. At the end of the movie they mention her going back to practicing law in the book she didn't either way is fine just different. Sarahs sister Kate's and her siblings aunt whose name was changed in the movie played a bigger role which was interesting it was more interesting to see another adult other than the parents playing a big role in the whole thing. In the bookalthough Sarahs sister named Kelly in the movie stayed over a lot and helped a lot she did not move in with them and give up her career for them which is not bad just different then the movie. The actress that played Kelly was very talented! She was a beautiful actress for some reason she looked tiny in the movie but I looked her up after seeing her and she is on the tall side but probably because she is so thin she looked tiny. I liked how they changed judge De Salvo to a woman played very well by Joan Cusack! I don't know why but a woman who lost her daughter seemed to have more in common with Sarah and she understanding of both of them. She is a great actress! I heard a rumor that she was supposed to play Julia but for some reason I could not picture her playing that role she is beautiful but just different than how I pictured Julia. Although Alec badlwen did a great job his character was not as likable in the movie and he did not have as much of a relationship with Anna. He seemed to have no sympathy for Sarah or Brian whereas in the book he seemed more compassionate. All in all great movie and great actress! Abegail Breslen has really grown since Kid Kiterage and American Girl!".

Sister's Keeper pretends to be deep and original and profound. And then with a rigid predictability Sister's Keeper refuses to be anything but dumb dumb dumb and with the thud of a maniacal assassin's butcher blows mercilessly repeated to the cerebral cortex again dumb. What McDonald's is to cuisine Sister's Keeper is to profundity.The cast is terrific. Cameron Diaz is especially impressive as a nasty mother. If you've only ever seen her as a blonde bimbo before this you won't know that she had it in her. David Thornton stands out in a small role as a doctor named with a flatfooted obviousness Chance. Alec Baldwin is perfectly cast as a sardonic lawyer. Joan Cusack chews the scenery as if she were in a threehandkerchief weepie from the Golden Age. Jason Patric is convincing as a well meaning fireman dad facing huge life questions.What utterly stinks here is the script. This bad script is no accident. It's the result of smug arrogant and shallow writers who assume that audiences are not up to the challenge of watching a real wrestling match with real issues.There are moments that manage to create a simulacrum a phony imitation of real art that with real courage and real artistry addresses real issues. Sara Cameron Diaz in moments reveals how utterly loveless a mother can actually be. Taylor Thomas Dekker betrays the sadness of a young man dying of cancer. Dr. Chance David Thornton is convincing as a nice guy who is perfectly willing to toy with human life and human fate.But this is a movie deeply religiously committed to never rising above a twodigit IQ a coward's take on the Big Questions and a shopping mall's imitation of real village inhabited by mannequinsashumans. Every second of verisimilitude of fealty to real life as real people really live it in all its overwhelming beauty and heartbreak is immediately undercut by a nauseating overlay of saccharineandhydrogenatedoilrich Twinkie filling. Not a single character is allowed to stray beyond the safety zone of what the filmmakers think their audience can handle  i.e. grade school kumbaya sermonizing from the Pastel Church of Politically Correct Sophistry  before that character is suddenly embraced in a warm huggy slowmo gauzy lens scene of frolicking on the beach. This is a movie about early death and designer babies grown in test tubes to exploit their bodies in organ harvesting. Could it not have ONE scene that grated that challenged that colored outside the lines of a Thomas Kinkade print? There's so much that's phony here I don't know where to start. That a mother and daughter could live peacefully and calmly under the same roof while the mother wanted to cut out the daughter's kidney and the daughter didn't want the mother to? Uh I don't think so. That at the climax of the movie one character breaks down in sobs remembering her own child's death another character goes into an epileptic seizure while a very cute dog can't stop barking? You know what that dog is saying? Timmy fell down the well! Straight from the 1950s Lassie TV series. Can we say Laying it on pretty thick? Oh come on. That a child can die without once questioning religion or God or any belief system at all? Nope didn't think so.Again the cast is above reproach. It's the writers. What makes people willing to watch drek like this and conclude that they've had some kind of profound artistic experience? Movies like this aren't only bad they are criminal. We humans as a species rely on art to educate us elevate us guide us. What movies like this communicate is clear death at an early age from cancer may interfere with your prom night but thoughtful artistic expression is the deadliest and most taboo force of all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike many other films which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness Man Bites Dog or their sheer violence most Peckinpah films Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness but the film's effect derives far more from its slow buildup and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with let alone show any sign of human affection towards them is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip and perseveres even after the final credits  the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds too has never been better. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory'  perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchetjob on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished  the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it  it is unique.".

It is disheartening to read the number of negative reviews for this excellent film which I can only attribute to the onedimensional nature of today's uberblockbusters.  It seems that the finer subtleties of good filmmaking present in Deliverance are lost on today's generation of moviegoers whose cinematic palates have been cloyed with multimilliondollar special effects unimaginative dialogue mindless violence and saccharine plots. Every aspect of this movie has been wonderfully choreographed and combine to create a film that goes well beyond mere entertainment simultaneously shocking and challenging the audience.Everything that occurs in this movie serves a poignant purpose the creators focus on quality rather than quantity. The plot which seems simple enough gradually takes on an eerily disturbing nature. The dialogue is sparse but screenwriters and director use it as a strength allowing events and cinematography to speak volumes about the characters. The violence though disturbing also acts as an integral piece of the film. The scenery is spectacular and Deliverance makes some of the best use of foreshadowing and silence I've ever seen in a movie.Few movies leave such an impression on the viewer.  To this day I can't hear Dueling Banjosor just about any banjo music for that matterwithout thinking of this movie. Nor can I help but feel this movie doomed Ned Beatty's acting career after seeing this film every time you see Ned Beatty in any other role you can't help but remember the infamous riverbank scene. Even people who have never seen the movie know the ghastly meaning of the words squeal like a pig.It is truly worth taking the time to see this film. It is an excellent treatise of the human reaction when challenged with fear danger and adventure.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS! My review is mostly meant for examination by those who have already seen the movie!As others have said this is a truly chilling and sinister film many so called scary films lose their edge over the years by becoming dated but this film feels sinister from the beginning and becomes almost unbearably oppressive to watch. Probably what makes it so chilling is the terrible events are entirely plausible.One reviewer here said that this film was about how violence real violence affects people I won't repeat his review because he explains it more eloquently than I but I totally agree.But interestingly enough as a woman it seemed to me that this movie was also examining masculinity but none of the male reviewers here have mentioned that so I may be wrong. But I feel this way because it is noticeable to me how differently the men react compared to women to trauma. After the male rape not only is it never mentioned again but even initially when Ned is rescued it is not mentioned. I feel women would at least have a cry and hug each other first but I may be wrong because shock can manifest in different ways. However all of the men react in the same seemingly unemotional way of course it is obvious that the men are traumatised by the event but their reaction is to protect their friend and fix the problem. And their way of fixing the problem is by not talking about it. Of course part of the reason this event can't be discussed is because it is so emasculating. But their caring is obvious in little vignettes for instance when Jon Voight helps Ned dress after the rape. Why men suppress emotions is something I have not always understood and at times has annoyed me but this movie was such an insight for me as I finally got it. We women know how to let out emotion safely but men are so trained to suppress it that when it does happen it is often like a dam bursting then they can't control it so it's safer to bottle it up.But the sad thing is though that their suppression will have terrible effects on them this is one of the reasons therapists often say people shouldn't bury their problem never was a metaphor so apt as in this film however letting it out will make them crack so they can't win if they talk about it or suppress it either way it will affect their sanity.Mind you even as a woman I could understand that many women would want to bottle up an event as traumatic as this one.Depressingly enough most movies when women get raped there is often something still sexy about the way it is shot but the male rape scene here is so sudden and so chilling you feel their helplessness and you know that if they aren't rescued that they will be killed and horribly and you know they know this. Often rape reports deal with the violation but this scene really brings home to you the thought of not just the violation but the sheer terror that victims must feel so I think this scene would be equally illustrative of what both men and women would experience.Even before the rape it is obvious to me that all these men feel inadequate as men. Macho Lewis is over compensating whiny Ned boasts about sexual conquests because he knows how unmanly he seems.So they want adventure ie violence so to transform themselves into real men but ironically they don't understand that real violence isn't an adventure. Weirdly enough what should be considered emasculating the horrible rape Ned experiences is actually what transforms him into a real man one who is scared but determined to survive and help his friends.Lewis almost does the opposite he goes from being the strong survivalist though who undoubtedly saves them to being terrified and in visible distress from his injury and helplessness.But I don't think the movie is saying that he is a coward. I think the movie shows them all as true human beings they all show great courage at times but are also reduced to absolute terror at other times as anyone experiencing such horrors would. But that's part of the point is that you can not have true courage without real fear.So unlike the comic book heroes that they wanted to emulate true heroism evolves from enduring terrible trauma.And it makes me wonder if perhaps one of the reasons that war veterans do not speak of war isn't just because of the horrors they saw but perhaps they are also ashamed of the times that they showed fear no matter how courageous they may have been deep down they may feel like cowards.The sad thing is that I think that the characters here will be forever traumatised and feel emasculated by what happened to them but the events were also the making of them as courageous heroes but they probably won't see it that way but I had no doubt that Ned would go away being stronger kinder and less brash to others and that Lewis would become more humble and that Jon Voight would appreciate his family more.This is one of the few movies I've seen adult male rape in and society rarely mentions it too. I think issues such as this should be explored more in cinema so that men who have experienced such terrible trauma can at least feel that the issue is being addressed in some way. Because let's face it part of the reason why Ned and the other characters can't speak about the rape is because society has deemed adult male rape to be an unspeakably shameful subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time four city guys confront nature's wrath in a story of survival. The setting is backwoods Georgia with its forests mountains and wild rivers.The director John Boorman chose to use local people not actors to portray secondary characters. These locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history. No central casting actors could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces voices or actions. I don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.Another strength is the film's theme. Nature in the wild can be violent. How appropriate that the setting should be the American South. Very few places in the U.S. are or have been as violent as redneck country. In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature not separate from it.Deliverance is very much a product of its time when unlike today Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. The film's magnificent scenery the sounds of birds frogs crickets and the roar of the river rapids combined with the absence of civilization all convey an environmental message. And that is another strength of the film.At an entertainment level the tension gradually escalates as the plot proceeds. Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme and then never lets up not until the final credits roll. Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.Finally the film's technical quality is topnotch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogue is interesting. And the acting is terrific. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film it is the music which strikes me as timid.Overall Deliverance almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure. Even for those who don't the gritty characterizations the acting and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film one of the finest in cinema history.".

	schema:reviewBody "After having seen Deliverance movies like Pulp Fiction don't seem so extreme. Maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.When I started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the Dueling Banjos scene. In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible. As I watched DrewRonny CoxRobocopgo head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get. When you think that the kid has a small banjo which he could of probably made by hand compared to Drew's nice expensive guitar you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.As the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits. But what really distinguishes this film about four business    men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip is that director John BoormanExcalibur breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.The acting is universally excellent. With Jon VoightMidnight Cowboy Enemy of the State and Burt ReynoldsBoogie Nights Striptease leading the great cast. Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start Voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. Ned BeattyLife is also good in an extremely hard role come on getting raped by a hillbilly while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert Cowboy Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.Overall Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to anyone except for people with weak stomachs and kids. 1010.

	onyx:emotionText "After having seen Deliverance movies like Pulp Fiction don't seem so extreme. Maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.When I started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the Dueling Banjos scene. In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible. As I watched DrewRonny CoxRobocopgo head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get. When you think that the kid has a small banjo which he could of probably made by hand compared to Drew's nice expensive guitar you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.As the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits. But what really distinguishes this film about four business    men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip is that director John BoormanExcalibur breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.The acting is universally excellent. With Jon VoightMidnight Cowboy Enemy of the State and Burt ReynoldsBoogie Nights Striptease leading the great cast. Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start Voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. Ned BeattyLife is also good in an extremely hard role come on getting raped by a hillbilly while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert Cowboy Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.Overall Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to anyone except for people with weak stomachs and kids. 1010. See this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "To try and explain the greatness of Deliverance you must first understand the impact this film had when it came. Most of us have probably seen a horror film about a gang in the woods that gets harassed and stalked by people. Deliverance is the father of these films and an original that stands really well to this day as one of the best films ever made in the genre. A gang of four guys ventures out in nature to paddle canoes along Cahulawassee River before it gets flooded into a lake. However their boat trip does not turn out the way they had hoped for when they suddenly gets stalked and harassed by the locals. Burt Reynolds plays the outdoor fanatic Lewis who brings his friends on the journey Jon Voght Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. The film is directed by John Boorman from the novel by the same name from 1970.What is it then that makes Deliverance so incredibly good. At the beginning of the film the gang is traveling by car the mood is good and very typical for guys. After having a short break to fill up the cars with petrol and listening to the famous banjo duel Dueling Banjos between Ronny Cox's character and a local boy they head for the river. What happens next out on the river is like a nightmare and also very psychologically demanding. Deliverance always feels so real and genuine that you truly become frightened. How would you yourself react in a similar situation so far away from civilization? After the gang starts to get harassed in the woods the panic and fear increases. They all react differently and rightly so no human being is the other alike. That is just what makes it so good the characters' different personalities. The film then sort of becomes a psychological mind game perhaps mostly taking place in their heads. Are they being followed how will they get out of the situation they are in and what will they say when they return?Besides the psychological aspects of Deliverance it is also incredibly beautiful to watch. It's completely filmed on location out in the woods with actors willing to perform the different stunts themselves. As I wrote when I reviewed The Revenant this is also a man vs wild film. In the beginning we experience nature as incredibly beautiful and stunning but later it quickly turns to become your worst nightmare. Incredibly well done by the director. The absolute greatness in Deliverance lies according to me in the end and the summarization of the film. What really happened and what didn't happen. How do you react to these kinds of situations out in the middle of nowhere? Can we return with our senses intact and how do you change as a person after experiencing something like it? Without spoiling the story too much I've here tried to review and explain what Deliverance is to me. I recommend everyone to watch it and it is very high up on my list of the best films ever made.David Lindahl  www.filmografen.se".

The film still scares the sht out of me! I mean what would YOU do if you were confronted by two hillbillies in a situation like that? It's so easy to remain distant and see the film as entertainment but take a realitycheck and immerse yourself in the story.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps there are other movies that so painfully accurately portray savage violence and the impact it has on the individual but I don't think I've ever seen any. Deliverance is one of the most powerful movies I've seen haunting me with its nightmarish imagery and forcing me to ask myself the question How far would I go in a similar situation? And what effect would it have on me? A rarity for a film it does not soften the blow of the original story its meaning nor the questions it raises for the viewer. People complain about violence in movies but that vast majority of violence is nothing more than glorified cartoonish fiction a testosterone release for boys of all ages. It's false and one dimensionally clichd usually written by arm chair warriors who get their notions of violence from tall tales others have told them usually in the form of more bad fictional violence they have seen in other movies comic books etc. For anyone who has experienced it or honestly evaluated it real brutal violence is not fun nor a cause for celebration for those that survive or win. The swaggering good guy hero may be fun to watch in the western movie and I enjoy a good vicarious release film as much as the next guy but these heroes don't really exist certainly not as the brash righteous hero they're colored as. Real brutal violence is just that real and brutal. There aren't any winners or heroes when it comes to savagery and killing just survivors who are profoundly impacted irrevocably changed in a harsh and painful way. If you're unsure of this fact just ask anyone who really has experienced it not the teller of tall tales as most are but the veteran who lives next door but came back strangely changed and won't discuss the nightmares he's living. Survivors of real savage violence don't brag about it in bars and wear it as a badge of courage. They seldom or never discuss it so unfortunately the naive think the liars who spin tales of false bravado are real. We need real violence in movies the impact it has on the soul of a person. For once I'd like to see when someone gets hit on the head in the film hard enough to be knocked out that almost a third of them will die from their injuries and the remaining survivors will not jump up perfectly fine when it's advantageous to the story but come to and pass out repeatedly experiencing searing headaches unlike anything you can imagine vomiting and unable to stand for hours sometimes days due to their severe cranial concussion. If there were more movies like Deliverence that deliver a real story powerfully and unapologetically violence in movies would become a powerful tool for education very probably reducing its frequency by those who shockingly discover being involved is nothing to be proud or righteous about a lesson learned way too late by so many walking wounded often living right next to to you.As a side note I was told by a literary friend that James Dickey wrote this over the course of a manic weekend on a bet. He was a poet who at a cocktail party on a Friday argued with an acquaintance that writing fiction was much easier than poetry. He set out to prove it and the novel Deliverance was the result. Certainly the novel follows the weekend time line exactly. Great story but I have yet to be able to authenticate it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is one of the best movies I've seen. The acting is absolutely stellar  the chemistry between Jon Voight Burt Reynolds Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox is incredible as four guys from wildly differing backgrounds united by a common thread of humanity. The four cityslickers head out together for a white water canoe trip down a river in the hill country of northern Georgia. The film is packed to the brim with action adventure and the essence of survival. Adding to the intensity is that fact that almost all of the movie was shot on location at an almost inaccessible river deep in the south. Director John Boorman had to use jeeps to truck in the equipment and the 4 lead actors were actually transported by canoe! Voight also performs a rock climbing feat that will leave you in awe according to the making of documentary on the DVD Voight declined to use a stuntman. The whitewater cinematography and choreography is breathtaking especially considering that this was shot in the early 1970s.At first from a quick glance Deliverance appears to be a straightforward adventure story however the film goes down a deeply philosophical route as the four men race their vehicles into the backcountry and then their canoes down the wilds of the river. The film explores our relationship with nature conceptualization of morality and the existentialism inherent in life. The backwoods hillbillies the four adventurers interact with in various ways paint an amazingly complex portrait which ties together the destruction of nature man's evolution from his natural roots to the resigned life of city dweller and the tensions and prejudice inherent in humanity. This is done perfectly without drawing on stereotypical black vs. white or yankee vs. southerner comparisonsall the characters in this film are southerners although each character major and minor for all intensive purposes transcends categorization.The Dueling Banjo scene in which guitarslinging Ronny Cox battles a banjoplaying hillbilly kid the actor Billy Redden was actually a resident of the backwoods region where this was shot sharply complements the men's fight against the river and the river's fight to remain wild. This film simultaneously explores the theme of duality from the confines of 1 the individual's mind 2 Reynolds' group of comrades 3 all humanity as a whole and 4 something much greater. The banjo music in this scene is awesome!!! If you enjoy the song Dueling Banjos I strongly suggest that you pick up the Deliverance soundtrack which also includes 17 additional songs played by amazing banjo musician Eric Weissberg I believe only Deuling Banjos and maybe one or two other songs were actually used in the film.There are some disturbing scenes in this film so it is not for the overly squeamish but if you think you can handle the river I encourage you to take this powerful actionpacked journey into the philosophical backwater of humanity!".

Truly the people that time forgot.There are subtle signs at the beginning of the expedition that the four river travelers may have been better off staying in Atlanta and playing golf.

After that all bets are off . . .'Deliverance' is skillfully directed by John Boorman. He creates wonderful characters creates a sense of awe tension and dread. This is a taunt drama about the worst camping nightmare come to life and how to deal with it. Boorman would later go on to direct 'Excalibur' 1981 and 'The Emerald Forest' 1985.Deliverance is a great sociological commentary on cultural values and differences. It works on a very subtle level with many things to think about. By today's standards the pacing of Deliverance may be too slow for some people. I recommend it but not to those who have the attention span of a flea.".

These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountainland completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these men you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema Deliverance is a very important movie as well. John Boorman's best closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur was  and still is  a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies. Just think about the terrific Duelling banjos musical score and of course the unforgettable homosexual squeal like a pig rape scene. All the actors deliver haha perfect acting performances.

So when he appears in the adaptation of his own book as a sheriff it isn't like some tiny unintimidating author playing a part for a laugh.Deliverance is as deadly serious a 70s hit as anything before or since. The fear factor before that term invoked images of silly people eating insects on primetime TV rises like the violent waters about to break a levee once and for all. The great John Boorman directed this. And to a large extent Dickey was an unofficial and unwanted assistant to Boorman. Or rather a competitor. I can only imagine how an author reacts to anyone taking their creation from the page to the screen and all the struggles involved with that. Apparently Dickey would address the four main actors by their character's name. Burt Reynolds says in his autobiography that he finally told Dickey off and the big man replied That's exactly what Lewis would say! And later on during the shoot before departing he also said I understand my presence would be more efficacious in it's absence! The four men on this trip into the horrors of confronting dangers both in Mother Nature's and deranged human assailant form find out what real fear is all about. Life in the city didn't prepare most of them for the moment when they'd have to fight for their very lives.Ned Beatty was probably the most visible of the rape survivors in film history at least in North America Sophia Loren in Two Women would be the international candidate for that I guess. Certainly as a man attacked by another man he tapped into an energy most males didn't want to acknowledge. But females watching him struggle know what that distress is really all about. Domination and a perverse insidious display of power corruption in the human soul and society at large are the key components of sexual assaults.Until Jodie Foster starred in The Accused Beatty stood almost alone in representing a person violated who found the courage to go on despite the trauma the attack unleashed. How many major stars would play this part then or now without wanting to compromise at least a little bit in the extent of the scene? Reynolds also said that during it's filming the action went on to the point where he couldn't take it anymore and tackled Billy McKinney off Beatty and demanded of the director Why the hell did you let that go on so long? To which Boorman replied Because I knew when you reached your breaking point that's when the audience would reach their's!".

I think Boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film.  How expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done. It showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were.  Case in point  near the end of the duel the banjoplaying boy was smiling loved his banjo but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the duel the kid was too reserved to respond. The river trip never left you bored for sure.  The rape scene was brutal but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of Georgia.  I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. Some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal.  I disagree  if you really payed attention he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following in which Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy.  It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later at the top of the cliff.  It almost appeared that the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expecting to die but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.Anyway a great movie and I was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a 1 I gave it a 10.  This individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias rather than an objective viewpoint and his vote was obviously a noncorrelating attempt to lower the rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't seen this movie in at least 20 years but in the last few it had started to itch away at my mind.  I thought it terrific when I first saw it but had I missed something even so?  Was it more than just a disturbing adventure movie in which city people run afoul of backwoodsmen?      So as soon as I saw the DVD I bought it even though it was obviously another Warner Bros. rushitout nevermindtheextras job.       The movie isn't as good as I remembered  it's better.  Those who are looking for a RIVER WILD thriller or a SOUTHERN COMFORT a DELIVERANCE imitation suspense movie are already looking in the wrong place.  This movie is about what goes on inside people much more than it is about what goes on around them.     I've seen comments here suggesting that Ned Beatty doesn't show enough reaction after being brutally raped.  Huh?  He's stunned for ten minutes then tries to attack Bill McKinney's corpse.  He's still rattled the last time we see him in the movie when he tells Jon Voight that they won't be seeing each other for a while.  Which clearly means forever.  Beatty's life has been changed he'll never get over it.     So has Voight's but in a different way.  For the first time I noticed that three people get into the tow truck when Reynolds hires those brothers to drive their cars to the canoeist's destination.  Sure that's logical  there are three vehicles to drive initially after all.  But why does Boorman take pains to avoid showing us the face of the third person in the tow truck but does show him fingering the gun in the rear window of the truck?       Could it be because this guy turns up later?  Is he Bill McKinney's character?  Or the Toothless guy?  Or the guy Voight kills?  Which of course raises the most important questions in the movie WAS Ronny Cox shot?  And if he was was the guy Voight kills the one who shot him?  And was Voight's victim the Toothless guy?  On an initial viewing of the movie all this seems pretty obvious yes Cox is shot yes Voight kills the right person the Toothless guy.       But then what about the man we later learn has gone hunting but who hasn't returned?  Why is Voight so shocked when he looks into the mouth of his victim?  Boorman and Dickey give great weight to the scene in which Voight fails to kill a deer.  Even if he had it would have been a foolish wasteful act.  The interplay between Voight and Reynolds is also very interesting Voight clearly admires Reynolds on some levels while finding him disgusting on others.        Dickey is primarily a poet secondarily a novelist it's not hard to believe that he intended all four men to represent different aspects of the human condition.  DELIVERANCE is one of the most intricately ambiguous movies of its type ever made it cannot be pulled apart into easilyunderstood sections and where our sympathies should lie is never obvious.  Even the sheriff played by Dickey himself has darker shadings that are partly inexplicable.  And there is that shot of the removal of the graves it's not in there by chance or for local color.     On the surface DELIVERANCE seems to be an exciting disturbing adventure  and it is that.  But just like the secrets the lake conceals there's a great deal more beneath the surface of DELIVERANCE.".

	schema:headline " Brutal Beautiful and Brilliant.";
	schema:reviewBody "Four Atlanta friends  Lewis Burt Reynolds Ed John Voight Bobby Ned Beatty and Drew Ronny Cox  decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River out in the Georgia wilderness. They see it as a test of manliness whilst also wanting to experience this part of nature before the whole valley is flooded over to make way for the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. But the perils of nature are not the only dangerous things in their midst unfriendly wood folk are about to bring another dimension in terror.Deliverance is one of those films that sometimes suffers by way of reputation. Much like Straw Dogs and 70s films of that type the hype and promise of unremitting hell often isn't delivered to an expectant modern audience. Which is a shame since Deliverance is one of the finest glummest brutalistic and beautiful films of the 1970s.Adapting from James Dickey's novel screenplay duties here also British director John Boorman crafts a tough and powerful film of men out of their environment thus out of their league. As each man sets off initially it's a test of manhood but each guy is forced to deconstruct their worth and it soon becomes more about survival as this deadly adventure proceeds. Boorman aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond has painted a raw and treacherous landscape unconquered by city slickers but dwelt in by inbreds who don't take kindly to the city folk showing up with their machismo attitudes. From the first point of contact with the strange locals where Drew goes duelling banjos with an odd looking child the film doesn't let up much like the locals themselves the film also is remorseless. Some critics over the years have proclaimed that Deliverance is too pretty mistaking lush physicality as something detracting from the dark thematics at work. Not so the Chattooga River sequences are electrifying the rapids scenes brilliantly filmed with Voight and Reynolds doing real work and getting real injuries are merely setting up the unmanning of our macho guys just around the corner. It's a fabulous and potent piece of beauty. With the four cast leaders absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. In fact there are few better casting decisions ever than that of Reynolds as Lewis one can only lament that he didn't have more hard edged serious roles in his career.Minor itches exist metaphors are heavy Vietnam a 70s staple it seems while ecological concerns are hinted at without being as prominent as they are in the novel. Surveying the landscape during the opening of the piece Lewis reflects that man is going to rape this land rape it it's stuff like that that is not totally formed given way to abject horror and survival Lewis again noting that survival is the name of the game. A game of life and death where man's primal being means violence may indeed beget violence. Boorman clearly agreed. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Four Atlanta friends  Lewis Burt Reynolds Ed John Voight Bobby Ned Beatty and Drew Ronny Cox  decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River out in the Georgia wilderness. They see it as a test of manliness whilst also wanting to experience this part of nature before the whole valley is flooded over to make way for the upcoming construction of a dam and lake. But the perils of nature are not the only dangerous things in their midst unfriendly wood folk are about to bring another dimension in terror.Deliverance is one of those films that sometimes suffers by way of reputation. Much like Straw Dogs and 70s films of that type the hype and promise of unremitting hell often isn't delivered to an expectant modern audience. Which is a shame since Deliverance is one of the finest glummest brutalistic and beautiful films of the 1970s.Adapting from James Dickey's novel screenplay duties here also British director John Boorman crafts a tough and powerful film of men out of their environment thus out of their league. As each man sets off initially it's a test of manhood but each guy is forced to deconstruct their worth and it soon becomes more about survival as this deadly adventure proceeds. Boorman aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond has painted a raw and treacherous landscape unconquered by city slickers but dwelt in by inbreds who don't take kindly to the city folk showing up with their machismo attitudes. From the first point of contact with the strange locals where Drew goes duelling banjos with an odd looking child the film doesn't let up much like the locals themselves the film also is remorseless. Some critics over the years have proclaimed that Deliverance is too pretty mistaking lush physicality as something detracting from the dark thematics at work. Not so the Chattooga River sequences are electrifying the rapids scenes brilliantly filmed with Voight and Reynolds doing real work and getting real injuries are merely setting up the unmanning of our macho guys just around the corner. It's a fabulous and potent piece of beauty. With the four cast leaders absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. In fact there are few better casting decisions ever than that of Reynolds as Lewis one can only lament that he didn't have more hard edged serious roles in his career.Minor itches exist metaphors are heavy Vietnam a 70s staple it seems while ecological concerns are hinted at without being as prominent as they are in the novel. Surveying the landscape during the opening of the piece Lewis reflects that man is going to rape this land rape it it's stuff like that that is not totally formed given way to abject horror and survival Lewis again noting that survival is the name of the game. A game of life and death where man's primal being means violence may indeed beget violence. Boorman clearly agreed. 1010";

	schema:headline " Roger Ebert Once Again Out to Lunch";
	schema:reviewBody "Roger Ebert the film critic most palpably in love with his sense of perceived intellect once again proves the phoniness of his objectivity as a reviewer by slamming movies like this one. There are some film critics like Ebert that when they are made uncomfortable by a movie dismiss it without examining it and call it sensationalistic. Mr. Ebert has done this with this one which means this movie has done its job. The critic is too uncomfortable to examine the emotions this movie evokes and uses pseudointellectualism to insulate himself from it. Particularly in his hackneyed statement that the writer of the book made up contrived statements in the movie instead of being real ones. POSSIBLE SPOILERS The premise is simple four businessmen leave the safety of their urban environment to go water rafting they encounter a world outside their safe haven that they cannot control. They eventually run into the wrong people who despise them for simply existing and invading their territory and their journey becomes a nightmare. The movie is a study in how alienated man can become from his own species how superficial the trappings of civilization are and how civilized behavior will not help you survive when encountering simple animalistic behavior. The moral of the movie seems to be there is no morality in survival there is only survival. The men are graphically tortured one raped one murdered apparently by a hillbilly sniper trying to cover their tracks and forced to commit murder to simply survive. Or is it simple self defense? They then realize that if they are honest and report the attacks that were made on them they will be tried and executed simply for defending themselves. They are therefore forced to lie cover up and hide their experiences for life even from their own families if they are to survive in the artificial civilized world they return to. The movie places the characters in unfair circumstances they must survive in and then further unfair circumstances as they must hide what happened to them to escape a place that will execute them if they tell the truth about defending themselves. The unspoken message stay in your own backyard or you'll be killed is very depressing. But then there are residents in Los Angeles that cannot even go into a different neighborhood without gangs targeting and killing them for no reason. When a critic like Roger Ebert is too afraid to really examine the dark statements this movie makes emotionally you know you have a movie that will move you and disturb you. The ironic thing is that now we have movies like Chain Saw Massacre III Devil's Rejects Friday the13th 19 etc that make this movie's violence seem mild. However the hatred alienation and cruelty it examines will haunt and disturb you for years afterwards long after meaningless drivel like the other movies mentioned are forgotten. In this day and age that is no small accomplishment. Eight stars for me. cue banjo music....".

	schema:headline " Disturbing 1972 adventure on the Chattooga River";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1972 and directed by John Boorman from James Dickey's novel Deliverance is an adventure thriller about four guys from the Atlanta area who take a canoecamping trip in the Georgia wilderness. When they run into a couple of violent hillbillies their fun adventure turns into a disturbing test of survival.I didn't see Deliverance until almost two decades after its release. I didn't know anything about the film or anyone who had seen it but it looked like a potentially good adventure story so I finally decided to rent it.The first Act plays out as you would expect four guys escaping the shackles of urban life enjoying a canoe trip and then  WHAM  Act 2 hits you like a ton of bricks. When I first viewed the movie I wasn't braced for this scene. In fact it was so disturbing that it pretty much ruined the rest of the picture for me. I watched it until the end but  that scene  left me dazed and detached. Viewing it again recently I was fully braced and was therefore able to appreciate the film.MISCELLANEOUS THOUGHTS Burt Reynolds is great as the macho protagonist Lewis but he's largely missing during the third act and epilogue. The unassuming Ed Jon Voight takes the reigns as deliverer with Bobby Ned Beatty lending a helping hand.The film was shot on the Chattooga River in NE Georgia which borders South Carolina. The gorge is located in Tallulah Gorge State Park 15 miles West of Walhalla SC you can actually see it via satellite on Google maps. The dilapidated town in the epilogue is Sylva NC 45 miles north of the gorge. Needless to say lush Eastern locations.After the disturbing scene a moral crisis takes place in the remote forest where the four members of the party must vote on a decision. Lewis Reynolds and Drew Ronny Cox make their cases and the other two must choose. Count me with Lewis. At first glance it would seem that Drew is arguing the side of the wimpy moralist i.e. contact local law enforcement and allow the courts to settle the matter. Is this the real reason he takes this position or is it simply because he doesn't want to risk becoming an accessory to a crime? Actually Lewis is no less the moralist  after all he makes a moral judgment and unhesitatingly acts  it's just that he refuses to risk allowing the local authorities and a potential inbred jury likely related somehow to the hillbillies twist his just and necessary actions into a crime.Writer James Dickey effectively plays the towering Southern Sheriff in the epilogue.The Deluxe Edition DVD includes an excellent 4part documentary that runs about 45 minutes. All principle cast members are interviewed as well as director Boorman and the son of James Dickey. By all accounts Dickey had a forceful personality and intimidating presence. He kept calling the actors by the names of the people they were playing even while not filming. One night in a pub he kept referring to Reynolds as Lewis from across the room and Burt refused to answer him. Dickey came up to his table and got in his face. Angered Burt cussed at him and told him to quit calling him Lewis. Dickey paused for a moment and responded That's exactly what Lewis would have said and walked away.Wrong Turn 2003 is a modern horror film that generally speaking tackles the same subject as Deliverance. The problem with Wrong Turn is that it's full of horror clichs and cops an unrealistic vibe. Don't get me wrong it's an entertaining film for what it is but I was never able to buy into the story as a potential reality hence I didn't find it horrifying at all. Deliverance on the other hand is totally realistic from beginning to end and is successfully horrifying precisely because it COULD happen.Speaking of realism Roger Ebert heavily criticized the scene in Deliverance where Ed Voight climbs up the rock gorge arguing that it was totally unrealistic. Is he serious? He needs to get out more. I'm older than Ed in the film and could climb those rocks fairly easily I'm not bragging just pointing out that Ebert's criticism is not valid for anyone who's in remotely decent shape.Also speaking of realism if you suffer from ADHD and need constant unrealistic action scenes and goofy oneliners to maintain your attention skip this one.Lastly Deliverance is about 45 years old and hasn't dated at all. This is a timeless picture.The movie runs 110 minutes.GRADE A".

At the time I thought Burt Reynolds would become one of Hollywood's great dramatic actors but instead he meandered into comedy and superficial roles. I believe he became somewhat of a wasted talent. In this movie however he shines. The acting all round is stellar. The storytelling and direction flawless and powerful. Nature is pitted against man. Man against Nature. Man against Man.

The issue of murder selfdefence escaping from the law but not being able to hide from your conscience the nightmares of Ed  Jon Voight the homosexual rape scene the burial and dumping of bodies the stills for moonshine in the backwoods the duelling banjoes  brilliant scenes that make this film memorable while set against a backdrop of raging rivers and pristine wilderness. The filming of going down river is incredible. No insurance company would get involved in this one so perhaps Angelina Jolie would not be here today if Jon Voight had slipped climbing that cliff.The Church of Christ confronting them on the road at the end the sense of relief out of the water the genial dinner with the gentle town folk the shimmering light in the faces of Jon Voight  Burt Reynolds when they first see the river the nightmarish image of the rising hand out of the water in Jon Voight's dream at the end  haunting images that will last a lifetime.

Julia Lambert and Michael Gosselyn are the royal couple of the London theater scene Julia an actress and Michael a former actor who took over running the theater and its troupe upon the passing of their mentor Jimmie Langton. Jimmie is still constantly with Julia in spirit as she navigates through life. Besides their work Julia and Michael lead largely separate lives they long ago having stopped a sexual relationship. Julia of late has been feeling disenchanted with her life she not wanting to admit it's because she is approaching middle age. Her disenchantment manifests itself in wanting Michael to close their current production early so that she can recharge her juices something he is reluctant to do if only for not wanting to let the theater sit empty. What Julia ends up doing instead is embarking on an affair with Tom Fennel an adoring young American who is young enough to be her son.

Yes acting as a way of life as a way of being. Tricky. Ronald Harwood can write the ins and outs of theatrical life better than any living soul  remember The Dresser?  This is not any way near as good or as insightful but is charming and fun. Lilli Palmer played the part back in the 60's in Adorable Julia and she was adorable indeed as is Annette Bening in a tour de force performance with regular interruptions to give plenty of space to the trade mark Bening giggle. Shaun Evans plays the young man the object of Julia's desire her frustrating emotional holiday and I must admit that's the one element that should have sizzle instead of fizzle. Shaun Evans is a good actor but it doesn't have anything that would make us understand the folly attraction that awakes in Julia. He plays an American but appears bland as bland as a British actor can be when he's bland. I longed for a Billy Crudup or someone younger a Brad Renfro. Can you imagine what the movie would have been like with a Heath Ledger in that part? Unless of course the whole thing was intentional to underline Julia's absurdity. An actress on the verge of a nervous break down. Comparasions with All About Eve are ridiculous. That would be like comparing One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest with The Couch Trip".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not a fan of Annette Benning by any stretch of the imagination. I thought she was far too old to play the schoolgirlish ingenue in An American President and found her lacking in warmth and charisma as the love interest in Open Range. I thought she was okay for what she had to do in Dick Tracy and honestly can't remember her performance in American Beauty.In Being Julia however Benning's performance thoroughly does justice to her largerthanlife character. Benning plays 1930s stage actress Julia Lambert. Julia is by turns melodramatic egocentric overbearing and overwrought. She roars into our consciousness from her first scene to her final curtain. Benning is surrounded by a fine cast of actors and actresses who act as perfect foils for her. Jeremy Irons especially is subtle and subdued as her manager husband Michael Gosselyn. Juliet Stevenson is a sly confederate as Julia's dresser Evie. Miriam Margolyes is a hoot as theatre owner Dolly. Shaun Evans is a feast for the eyes as Tom Fennell the young cad who breaks Julia's heart. Michael Gambon rounds out the cast as Jimmy Langton a ghostly mentor to the very much alive and lively Julia.Julia is not exactly what you would call an admirable human being. She is selfcentered bitchy catty and vengeful. But as the Italians say revenge is a dish best eaten cold. The film keeps us in suspense as we nervously wait for the other shoe to drop for Julia to execute her carefully plotted revenge. When she springs her trap we may shake our heads disapprovingly but we cannot suppress a hearty laugh.By its very nature Being Julia is a film that will not appeal to a young demographic. You have to be a certain age to appreciate Julia's predicament of growing old and feeling that life and love have passed her by. Benning bravely allows director Istvan Szabo to film her in merciless and unforgiving closeup to capture the lines etched in her brow around her mouth and at her neckline. But the film leaves us with a sense of hope that like Julia we may all age like fine wine  or like the beer whose creamy foam Julia relishes like her life itself without the slightest trace of sadness or regret.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being Julia is a very entertaining picture aimed at the over 40 demographics which is nice for a change since most of the films these days are aimed at the 25 and younger crowd. The story is great. I haven't read the book so I don't know if the credit goes to the screenwriter or the author. Annette Bening's performance carries the film. The bad news is it could have been better. My first complaint is the photography has a yellowgreen cast to it which makes the film visually dull. This is a shame since Annette Bening is so radiant. My second complaint is the directing is competent but not much more. It's pretty much what you would expect from a made for TV film but not an art house film. A visionary director could have made this film great rather than merely good. My third complaint is that it is similar to All About Eve Sunset Boulevard and 20th Century but it is not at the same level of those classics due to the reasons given above. This is a film about the theater and in my favorite scene her son tells her that she is always acting. Some people might be turned off by the style of the dialog but it fits the context of the film. One of the devices of the film is that the ghost of her acting mentor is always watching over her like a guardian angel. The ending of the film couldn't have been better but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.Overall this is currently one of the top 3 films in the theater and if you are lucky enough to have it playing in your area you should see it. 810".

	schema:headline " OscarWorthy Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Annette Bening does her best work ever in this film set in the 1930's about the life of an English stage actress. Her performance is overthetop when it needs to be and at the same time evinces a trembling vulnerability as in scenes where she begs her young lover to remain with her. Bening's acting will certainly win her an Oscar nomination and should win her the award. It's far and away the best acting  male or female  that I've seen this year. Admittedly there are many critically praised performances that I haven't seen. The versatile Michael Gambon will probably not be nominated for his wonderful turn as Bening's acting teacher but he is another of the marvelous things about this film. Jeremy Irons is also very good as the stagemanagerhusband as is Juliet Stevenson as the star's personal assistant and dresser. Istvan Szabo the director and Ronald Harwood who adapted the Somerset Maugham story also deserve mention. Go see it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Annette Bening does her best work ever in this film set in the 1930's about the life of an English stage actress. Her performance is overthetop when it needs to be and at the same time evinces a trembling vulnerability as in scenes where she begs her young lover to remain with her. Bening's acting will certainly win her an Oscar nomination and should win her the award. It's far and away the best acting  male or female  that I've seen this year.

In that film there was a raw emotional drama that also involved a much larger cast and almost seemed Altmanesquire. Here the stage seems... well... stagey stilted mannered bythenumbers.

Annette Bening is Julia Lambert an actress in continuous acclaim a woman whose name emblazoned on the brightly lit marquee insures sellout audiences whatever the deficiencies of the play. Only in the England that glittered shortly before the war could an actress confidently proclaim that the stage offered the sole opportunity for true acting  the silver screen was for others.

But she has the dubious benefit of a revered first coach's spectral presence a wellintegrated story line.Lambert is in an affectionately cooperative marriage with actormanagermoney raiser Michael Gosselyn played by Jeremy Irons who provides just the right dollop of frustrated husband and stern business manager. Yes Irons can be funny in a very understated very English manner. This is an amiable couple tied together by their profession and their joint love for their teenage son and some memories. And that's it.A young American Tom Fennel Shaun Evans appears in the West End seeking work in the theater and Gosselyn obliges. An intense affair develops between the much older actress and the callow Yank on the make meaning the stereotypical view of Americans often presented as unquestionable reality in so many British flicks. That Julia is so primed for a seduction that requires the barest minimum of effort reflects her growing fear of becoming older. Or old.

The fates have stolen her beauty the caterers have augmented her figure.Director Istvan Szabo with a crew that is decidedly nonEnglish did wonders bringing this brisk novel to the screen. I suspect he had little to do to allow Annette Bening to blossom in and command the lead role. I've always enjoyed her acting but Being Julia is a quantum leap in accomplishment.

	schema:reviewBody "Bening Julia810.Seeing that most people have already trudged the ground concerning the obvious influence that 'All About Eve' lords over this film let us move past this area for just a minute. Not only does 'Being Julia' walk the same ground as 'All About Eve' its footprints can also be found in many other movies as well movies like 'The Boyfriend' and 'Day For Night' and to a much smaller degree 'My Favorite Year'. Each of these movies provides a fantastic behind the scenes look at how entertainers and artists live and love behind the curtain. Each one provides insight into an aging star's last gasp at greatness or a budding stars rise. However this is where the comparisons should end. I don't feel it's necessary to point out that 'Being Julia' isn't as good as 'All About Eve' not too many films can boast of that claim anyway. What should be pointed out are the many fine performances from its cast most notably from Annette Bening. What other American actress as beautiful or as talented could fulfill the requirements necessary to play Julia Lambert the beautiful aging star of the stage? The role of Julia Lambert provides for the actress playing her a myriad of roles within a role. Julia has a separate life on stage and off stage as well as with her husband Jeremy Irons or with her dresser Juliet Stevenson. Julia is hailed as a British actress yet she hails from New Jersey. Even her son Tom Sturridge condemns her many different faces by saying you have a performance for everybody I don't think you even exist. Being Julia is about a woman on her own road toward selfdiscovery. Along the way she becomes reawakened by young love and falls back into the girl she was before acting took a hold of her. Of course this newly found love turns to betrayal which leads to hurt and then to jealousy. Julia quickly becomes hardened back from jealousy into being vengeful and with this emotion she soon shows while performing on the stage to be quite the master. Julia comes full circle to realize she can be anyone she chooses to be. Her son relents to an acceptance of Julia's many faces and her husband although every bit as two faced as Julia comes around to Julia's reawakening.Bening is not quite the frontrunner to snag the Best Actress at the Academy Awards this year but she could get it as a repay from the her last nomination for 'American Beauty' the year she lost to Hilary Swank in 'Boys Don't Cry'. Ironically Annette could lose again to Hilary Swank this time for 'Million Dollar Baby'. However Annette has many friends within the Hollywood voting machine it could go her way this time. Annette's Oscar nomination is well deserved her Oscar would be fitting in more ways than one.One actress to look out for in the future is Lucy Punch as Avice Crichton. Her comedic talents come into play about two thirds of the way into the film. Avice becomes the target of Julia's wrath during the climactic and hilarious ending of the film.The rest of the cast is very solid. Shaun Evans as Julia's lover who comes in with a bang sorry is decent yet he goes out with a whimper. Evans becomes an afterthought nearing the end of the film. He's relegated to showing embarrassment from the theater seats by the time the story is over. Another highlight in a bit role comes from Miriam Margolyes as the 'lesbian' gossiper Dolly deVries.Just remember even though the cast is very strong this movie is all about Annette Bening which may be the reason why the movie hasn't scored big box office numbers. Even with an Oscar nomination it isn't likely that this film will surpass its 18 million dollar budget. Perhaps people would have flocked to this film in greater numbers if it wasn't about the life of an actress in pre World War II Britain but instead about the future world high jinks of animated elephants and squirrels with dubbed voices from the likes of Will Smith Robin Williams and Cameron Diaz? Come on people this movie was worth at least one visit to the cinema.Just like Peter O'Toole ranted as a drunken and crazed Alan Swan in 'My Favorite Year' I'm not an actor I'm a movie star! Annette's Julia quite calmly relates real actress' don't make films. Perhaps in the future they won't but as for this year I can think of at least one that did.810. Clark Richards".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSI'd wanted to see this for some time and I'm glad I finally did. It was kind of an enchanting little film witty and fun and kind of an homage to the theater in general.The two things that really stand out are number one the glamor of the film. Of coarse period films if their done well really envelop one in the time period the movie is taking place in. In Being Julia the film is not just an homage to the stage it also kind of celebrates the films of yesterday that one really doesn't see these days. The music was absolutely perfect as well. I can say that I more often then not see very modern films however this movie made me kind of reminiscent to see older films even though I generally don't see a lot of them anyway. But that is one of the movie's strengths. It's nice to see a period film that sets the atmosphere so well.The second thing that stands out is the performance of Annette Benning as the sassy Julia. I must say Annette Benning is in my opinion one of the best actresses working today and with every film I see her in even if I don't love the movie she bowls me over with her performance. Here is no different. I really want to see an Oscar for Ms. Benning soon.And of coarse Julia is such a fun character to watch! I just saw The Devil Wears Prada last week and I think Steep and Benning share some similarities. Like Streep with Benning it's not just the words but the facial expressions the brief glances and such! I really doubt I'd have liked this movie as much without Benning in the lead role.The rest of the cast is good too but Benning steals the show and the movie's humor is biting but in a fun way. I would not say this was a movie I loved for me it was more on the like a lot side but it's very definitely worth seeing.If there was anything I didn't like it's just that the movie moves slowly and though you get where it's going it takes awhile to get there. Being Julia wasn't a movie I liked all that much right away it sort of grows on you. A bit of patience is needed but it keeps getting better as it goes along and the ending is really fun and worth waiting for. Annette's best scenes are at the end with the last stage scene being absolutely spectacular. The thing about Being Julia is it never really takes itself so seriously that the witty aspects are lost. It strikes a very good balance between the drama the wit and the almost campy aspect.I would definitely recommend this particularly to Benning fans or people who love the stage. My vote's a 7.5 out of 10.".

It was lovely sparkling wicked subtle fun and definitely an Oscar for Annette Bening. The cast was wonderful and I must mention Michael Gambon one of my favorite actors who was just perfect as the drama teacherdirector from the past  who though long deceased was still coaching Julia from the wings. And best of all this movie really captures in a delightful way with not a trace of bathos the joys pains and ultimate triumph of women of a certain age.".

Normally I stay away from movies about actors for two reasons they're selfserving and they typically have the lead acting irrational overemoting and behaving unstable. While Bening was not quite as far out in left field as most lead characters in this genre she demonstrated a fairly wide swing in shallow displays of emotions and without any real character development it's impossible for me to feel any compassion for these poorrich people with rich people's problems.I watched the clock through the whole movie trying to gauge when the action would finally climax and the end would come. The only reason I kept watching was that I hoped that there would be a turning point when I really applauded our protagonist but it never came. I found everyone in the story basically got what they deservedwhich wasn't much by the way. So much for the real villain getting his comeuppance  it doesn't happen.The saving grace in this movie was Jeremy Irons whom I don't normally care for as an actor. He was smooth and appropriate in his role unsettled by his wacky wife but still holding his courseit's all for the money honey.Not worth the rental price of the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being Julia is like a period version of All About Eve such that it's a cross between Stage Beauty for gender and naturalism on and off the stage issues and Bright Young Things for time period. One problem though is that it's unclear how much subtext is intentional or accidental particularly to an American audience. Though the cast is a mixed Commonwealth crew as indicated by wavering accents are the men intentionally effete other than a charismatic Michael Gambon as a remembered mentor such that we're more surprised that the British upper classes replicated at all rather than that some play for the other team. Or is there a message about masculinity vs. femininity on stage vs. off. Is it to be intentionally satirical that Annette Bening's younger rival is frequently referred to as the pretty one but well Lucy Punch is certainly not conventionally pretty. Let alone that the young man they are competing over Shaun Evans is a bland Ken doll with zero sex appeal.I also assume it was W. Somerset Maugham's intention that the plays Bening's diva is starring in are lightweight Noel Coward imitations accented by the use of a witty Coward song on the soundtrack and that there's a character named Roger for some double entendre tittering. Which all leads up to my assumption that it's intentional that Bening looks so much more beautiful and lively when she's wearing hardly any noticeable makeup especially in the transcendent closing shot much as Juliette Binoche in Jet Lag Dcalage horaire looked startlingly beautiful when she stopped trying to look younger. But all these weaknesses are forgotten as Bening and the film climax to the denouement such that you can't help cheering her victory while humming the lovely soundtrack. The costumes are also wonderful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Istvan Szabo's Being Julia 2004 is a genuine treat for anyone who appreciates a good story told to perfection. It offers the charming Annette Bening her most enigmatic screen characterization to date that of temperamental aging stage diva Julia Lampert. Julia is desirably contemptible wholly exasperating yet wildly energetic and vital. She exudes an air of a haughty exclusivity and yet there's something wonderfully generous and tender in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve. But Julia's open marriage to producertheater owner Michael Gosselyn Jeremy Irons is compromised when transparent American leech Tom Fennel Shaun Evans pursues a romantic dtente as part of his own social climbing agenda. Eventually Julia comes to her senses accepts the advantages rather than the vices associated with being middle aged and embarks upon a dastardly set of circumstances that ultimately culminate in the sweetest of revenges.Based on the W. Somerset Maugham novella 'Theatre' that has been ably adapted for the screen by Ronald Hardwood the film moves through a series of entertaining vignettes that introduce us to Julia's tiny assortment of legitimate friends. There's Dolly Miriam Margolyes the financial backer of most of Julia's plays for perverse sexual reasons of her own Bruce Greenwood as Lord Charles  Julia's most trusted confident with a secret life and Michael Gambon as Jimmie Langton Julia's dead muse who communicates to her through her own fond recollections of his expert tutelage.The DVD from Universal exhibits a quite stylish and handsome image that perfectly captures the 20s look of vintage English lives of the affluent. Colors are richly rendered. Blacks are generally solid. Whites are often more tinted yellow but that's in keeping with the stylized aged look of the original film. There is a definite grain structure to the image that appears more pronounced during darker scenes but again this was apparent during Being Julia's theatrical run so no harm no foul I suppose. The audio is 5.1 and although the vintage song catalogue throughout the film is charmingly represented it is Michael Danna's illustrious Being Julia theme interspersed throughout the film that is most often stands out. It is as poetic melodic and engaging as the film's leading lady. Extras include a making of documentary that is really more of a promotional junket than a comprehensive how we did it look at the film. There's also some behind the scenes stuff and deleted scenes though neither is presented at an adequate viewing quality  instead forcing one to watch a generally badly rendered picture element with no audio commentary to explain just exactly what we are watching. There's also NO theatrical trailer. A shame!".

	schema:reviewBody "The summary line thrust itself on me by sheer chance as I happened to have watched the day before Julia a local stage revival of Annie Get Your Gun. The relevance of Irving Berlin's all time tribute to show business is somehow difficult to resist.There are plays about the live theatre such as riotously hilarious Noise Off illuminatingly relevant Jitters and thought provoking The Dresser. There are movies about the live theatre as recently as Finding Neverland. The theatre features predominantly in Being Julia.I haven't read Summerset Maugham's novelette on which this movie is based but the movie script is attentive to details down to the most unartistic subject of arithmetic. At the start of the movie established stage diva Julia Lambert Annette Bening complains that she is tired feeling like twice her age which makes it 90. Later on revived by an affair with a young American golddigger young enough to be her son Julia in jubilation exclaims that she feels like a 2yearold. Without missing a beat her loyal aid and dresser immediately wonders out aloud how quickly she has lost 88 years.Indeed this is a familiar story of a middleage actress' fling with a young cad. But the plot does not detract from portraying another star  the stage itself. For example in one of Lambert's crowd pleasing finales an important stage prop a framed photo on the piano is placed so far back that she has to really stretch to grab it before she can raise it high in the air to deliver her closing line. Before she reaches the picture with her back to the audience she mumbles about killing or something to that effect the guy who looks after the props. This reminds me of a true incident when Actor A hands a vital envelope to Actor B screaming You better read this bastard and and muttering under his breath between his teeth there's nothing inside. Actor B taking the cue and making the best of the situation turned his back to the audience pretended to take the letter out and proceeded to read from the envelope! Many in the profession of acting will probably have similar tales to tell.The fantastic climax of the movie also takes place on the stage  Julia Lambert's revenge. Young ambitious new comer Avice Crichton scheming to get a part in a new play acting opposite Lambert seduces not only her young lover but also her husband Michael Gosselyn Jeremy Irons. That being the last straw Lambert engineers a revenge on stage that has become one of the most glittering and energycharged finales in any movies that you care to name in any genre.While Annette Bening dazzles you with the glorious glow of a midautumn moon Julia Lambert's glister reflects off the stars surrounding her. Her husbanddirectorproducer Michael demonstrates how a marital relationship can be elevated to the level of mutual artistic admiration. The truest orgasm they experience TOGETHER is not in sex but in the dressing room when he appreciates her particularly brilliant performance that evening and she appreciates his appreciation. Her late mentor and teacher appears in apparition Michael Gambon better known as Dumbledore in Harry Potter movies to provide her with fatherly advice when she needs them. Always there to give her sisterly support is wonderful Lord Charles Bruce Greenwood who portrays a credible Jack Kennedy in Thirteen Days a lover of sorts. Not to be forgotten is young son Roger Tom Sturridge. While most of the relationships in this story verges on being farcical the motherandson rapport here is true and heartwarming. Most realistic is the depiction that while Julia as all mothers thinks that Roger is still an innocent baby her son actually knows all including the licentious relationship between his father and Avice that his mother is not aware of.The finale alone is worth it all. As to Annette Bening at the risk of losing some friends I'll say that if I were a voter for the Oscar I would give my vote to her rather than Hilary Swank although this would be a very close call.".

And the casting of Shaun Evans was a huge mistake. He showed no hint of dashing dangerous charm we want out of this character nor did I believe Julia would settle for. A toothy gin goes only so far. He's a Matthew Broderick starter kit without the sense of selfdeprecation.The twist involving him Julia and the young actress was nice  in fact when this unfolded the movie finally started being about something other than an unbelievable romance.SPOILER. We realize Julia's stage accommodations are just working toward her revenge. And that revenge must've looked great on page. No wait it couldn't have looked any better in the script unless the writer was as drunk as the one in the movie. That revenge simply wasn't justified. So the ingnue wasn't so pure stealing first Tom then Jeremy Irons are we tired of him playing every character the same? but Julia herself began the Thou Shalt Not behavior.

Though I find this latest comedy very good. It's simply a film you have to love. It's not complicated it doesn't make you cry. But it's still a film that is a real joy to watch.The main reason of course is Annette Bening who really deserves a huge amount of awards for this performance. Szab makes us love her despite being a bit evil and selfish. That's because the character is very lively we can understand her motivations and feelings. But all the other performances are quite alright. the score and costumes are wonderful so is the cinematography. I was at the shooting I was the member of the theatre audience. I'm happy that I could be a tiny little part of the key scenes. And they look gorgeous on the big screen! Thanks.".

	schema:reviewBody "W. Somerset Maughan's novel Theatre gets a great treatment for the screen by its adapter Ronald Harewood who also did the same thing for another film based in the theatre The Dresser. Under the direction of Istvan Szabo the movie is good fun to watch as we see a side of the theatre world in a 1930s London.The characters of this comedy are larger than life. There's Julia Lambert the reigning diva of the West End. She is the main reason for an adoring public to go and see the plays in which Julia appears they are assured of a good night in the theatre because she delivers all the time. Julia is married to a powerful producer Michael Gosselyn. They evidently are open minded to any sort of affair each can have on the side as long as it's kept away from home. Talk about an open marriage this couple could be its model.Annette Bening has her best opportunity in this movie in a quite a while. She makes us believe she is Julia Lambert at all times. Her Julia is artificial and superficial but make no mistake she is not a fool! Don't cross this woman or think one can put one over her she'll destroy anyone who is silly enough to do so. Ms. Bening seems to be having a lot of fun playing this woman.The only character that doesn't come across well is Tom Fennel as played by Shaun Evans. This young actor tries but he is not up to the rest of the cast which includes some of England's best actors. Mr. Evans is miscast as the young TOM in one's humble opinion. Maybe with another actor the passion one is supposed to see between Julia and Tom would have been more real.The rest of the cast is excellent. Jeremy Irons as Julia's husband shows he has a natural talent for light comedy. He is great fun to watch as is Juliet Stevenson one of the best stage and screen actresses from the U.K. The brilliant Michael Gambon turns up as the ghost of Jimmy Langton Julia's teacher and mentor. Bruce Greenwood as Lord Charles is equally good. Rosemary Harris and Rita Tushingham make brief appearances. Miriam Margolyes and Lucy Punch round out the excellent group of actors.The film belongs to La Bening who has found in this role a perfect vehicle to shine.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is 1938 and the clouds are building up across the channel from Germany and Czechoslavakia. But we are aware of this and yet are not concentrating on it. For Somerset Maugham is concentrating on his favorite world  where he made his first real mark. In his day Maugham was probably one of the top three or four British dramatists with Shaw Coward and Pinero on the West End. Today everyone who thinks of Maugham the dramatist does not think of The Circle or other plays of his but of Rain i.e. Sadie Thompson. But Rain the play was based on his short story not on any play he wrote. So what is recalled as his most famous play was rally not his.But his short stories and novels remain powerful fodder for movies to this day if his plays seem to be a trifle too elegant for modern tastes. I did see The Circle in 1990 on Broadway and it was entertaining but I thought it required an audience willing to give it some slack considering the dialog it seemed at time too talky. Still if we think Maugham dated just recall three years ago they did a second movie of The Painted Veil. Being Julia is based on a short novel he wrote about one of the great ladies of the West End another Mrs. Patrick Campbell or Gladys Cooper. Julia Annette Benning has had years of success and glamor and she even has had a son by her producerdirector husband Michael Jeremy Irons. But she is bored and has reached that middle aged crisis point. Her friends rally to keep up her spirits such as the theater owner Miriam Margulies her son Rupert Michael Culkin her assistant Evie Juliet Stephenson and her close friend and fellow actor Archie Stephenson Leigh Lawson. She is also getting splendid advice from the dead  her mentor and the man who discovered her Jimmie Langton Michael Gambon whose ghost constantly reminds her of what she has to concentrate on to retain her star status.Rupert when he is visiting happens to bring a young American named Tom Fennell Shaun Evan. Julia has a loosely arranged marriage with her husband so he does not bat an eyelash as Julia and the young man old enough to be her son spend all their time together. The payoff comes when Tom takes Julia to see an experimental play that has a friend of his in it. The friend Avrich Lucy Punch is a young blond woman and Julia sees that the young woman has talent. So she with all the best intentions tells the young woman she can get her a special tryout with her husband at the theater. The young woman is really excited at this good news.But shortly afterward Julia discovers that Tom is not really interested in her as much as in Avrich. Julia pulls herself together to break her affair and does not go back on her promise. She begins to overact Michael notices her overwrought recitation of lines in the play she is in. She is ordered to return home for a vacation. In the meantime Michael meets Avrich at the tryout and sees she can act so he hires her for the next play. Julia is slowly aware that her friends are not really happy about what happened to her regarding Tom and Avrich. She seems to have been used here. She gets her final slap from Rupert who confides in her that he never liked Tom Julia thought they were chums.She is a trooper and she joins the cast for the new play that is going into rehearsals. Avrich is there and they are to share a scene for ten minutes dominated by the young lady. Julia goes along with this and slowly builds up the situation making additions and suggestions that will enhance the younger actress's performance. This surprises everyone but since she is willing to do it they go along with it. But what is she really up to?With Somerset Maughamm you can just imagine  his characters do not fade or go gently into that good night. Let us just say it turns out to be brilliant theater.Benning has probably never given a more elegant and wonderful performance  far from her Presidential girlfriend in The American President who is briefly a doormat for policy. For all her glamor she enjoys a glass of beer with her dinner  a nice touch that. Irons is fine  his role in support this time though he does bring authority to his directing scenes. Lawson gives all his support to Julia only to find she is unaware of his own desires and the scene of this mutual discovery is actually somewhat sweet. Gambon appears every so often shaking his head regarding he temporary lack of commitment to drama. His gray bald pate and his opera cape make him look wiser still. Michael Culkin shows he is growing up in his lunch scene with his mother wherein he shows he is wiser than his years. Although there is a similarity to All About Eve that has been referred to by several people on this board that film created a total schemer in Eve Harrington. Julia unlike Margo Channing is generous to a fault regarding offering help to her young rival at the point it is offered she has seen the young rival acting and realizes she is good  she also thinks of her as a protg. It is only later that she thinks she was set up by Tom and the girl and that is what hurts. And that is what she settles so effectively in the end.".

I watched this movie twice and I'm sure will watch it again. I love that I discovered new things about Julia with the second viewing. Benning has created a character that is so multi layered and complicated its amazing. These huge diva roles are so often approached with the more is more school of acting. Over the top can certainly be fun but when you can vary the levelthats talent. Instead of simply the star Julia is seen as Diva bitch jilted lover loving mother savvy business woman fag hag attentive student and all of this with a definite sense of confidence and vulnerability within each layer of this fascinating character. I was reminded of Diane Wiest in Bullets over Broadwayset in the same time frame and a strong woman with lots of issues. I laughed I cried I identified.The casting was superb for the entire film but Juliet Stevenson definitely rates a mention also. This is the perfect example of understated brilliance. She was great.

	schema:reviewBody "So that's where Patricia Highsmith seems to have gotten the inspiration for her character Tom Ripley! Of course this film adaptation came out after her first Ripley novel but Thomas Mann's short story and later novel had been available in print before that.The similarities are remarkable although Krull's escapades are more romantic comedy where Ripley's are more darkly dramatic. But both men are born con men but get launched on a criminal career by chance at least in this 1957 film and the 1999 The Talented Mr Ripley. Both impersonate somebody with far higher social standing where the gag is that the persons Ripley and Krull impersonate Dickie Greenleaf and the Marquis de Venosta are in real life decidedly not as debonair and classy as RipleyKrull portray them. Both are sexually quite ambivalent willing to use either women or men for their social advancement and both are in an attempt to avoid a larger scandal finally richly rewarded by the very families they defrauded the entire movie. Coincidence? I think not.Horst Buchholz is unquestionably the star and carries the film wonderfully. Krull's story is after all outrageous enough so an overthetop performance would completely ruin the movie. But compared to his later rather cringeinducing overacting in The Magnificent Seven Buchholz finds a more understated approach here which fits the film perfectly.Also given that this movie is from 1957 it's surprisingly direct in sexual matters very different from the typical prudish 1950s movie fare but at the same time not as vulgar as a modern adaptation might be. So in closing I can only express my hope that neither Hollywood nor Bollywood will ever dare remake this obscure little gem of a movie!".

Secondly it is directed by Rahul Rawail some of whose films I had really enjoyed watching and other than that I had seen some clips from the film which looked worthy. But then I watched it and I was completely disappointed. Bekhudi is pretty much the typical Hindi melodrama. It is one of those countless Hindi films centring around starcrossed lovers whose love is impossible blah blah blah and follows their struggle to be together against all odds. The film though starts pretty well fails for the most part and suffers from extremely poor writing. The story is filled with clichs and the proceedings are ancient. That said there were also a few points which made it watchable. First Kajol. She made a confident debut and tried her very best throughout the film. Her character is that of a decisive and stubborn young girl and though it is nowhere close to being a particularly good performance one could foresee the great actress that she would become seeing her dedication to the role. Secondly NadeemShravan composed a great soundtrack of some melodious songs. Asha Bhosle was the voice of Kajol and sang all the songs beautifully. The film also marked the debut of Kamal Sadanah who played Kajol's boyfriend. He was also pretty good though it was one of the few films he has appeared in and no one really knows who he is today. The supporting cast includes Kajol's reallife mother Tanuja as her mother and Farida Jalal Kulbhushan Kharbanda and Vijayendra Ghatge among others. All of them were quite okay in their unimpressive roles. To sum it up Bekhudi is not worth your time but if you are a Kajol fan you can take this one to watch her very first performance in a film. I think this reason is good enough.".

	schema:headline " The tyranny of extreme patriarchy";
	schema:reviewBody "You realise that millennia of civilisation have been quite useless if the functioning of a whole community ultimately depends on whether a man can have an erection or not! The subject of Mauro Bolognini's movie Il Bell'Antonio  male impotence  would be audacious in 2006 let alone in 1960. Yet here it's treated with unflinching honesty one that surprised me for 1960. No euphemisms no sensationalism no malicious elbownudging nor sentimental melodrama but a heartonthesleeve openness which also allows its longsuffering hero to maintain his dignity through a fierce portrait of a ruthlessly paternalistic society. This is all done without the aid of a single sexscene which IMO would have been redundant.The movie shows us upperclass Sicily in the late 1950s though actually it's based upon a novel set in the 1930s  Fascistera Italy. This is a society in which appearing is the essence of being and the accepted norm are arranged marriages between the children of the richest families celebrated by the entire town in the same way as Prince Charles and Diana Spencer's was back in the early 80s. As is the case with the best classic Italian movies Il Bell'Antonio couples bitternessfierce social satire with comedyhumour seamlessly. Superb leads in the form of the timeless Marcello Mastroianni and the divine Claudia Cardinale impeccably playing an unpleasant character for once give the movie extra depth beauty and soulfulness. Claudia is Barbara Puglisi the golden girl that Antonio is expected to marry the daughter of one of the richest families on the island and a virginal socialclimber of the most conventional blinkered obtusely stubborn kind. The even greater tragedy is that despite their marriage having been arranged by their families Antonio really falls for her very badly.Marcello Mastroianni who neither as an actor nor as a man remotely deserved to be considered the typical Latin lover type that Hollywood producers wished to market him as plays the titular lead the beautiful Antonio Magnano. On the verge of 30 in his prime as far as looks health and opportunities are concerned Antonio has just returned to his native Sicilian city of Catania after having lived in Rome for three years. We very quickly gather that Antonio is from an upper class Sicilian family is the apple of his father and mother's eye and something of a superstar in the whole of Catania where his family is wellknown and respected. He is adored by women who believe him to be an irresistible seducer a Casanova with hundreds of notches on his bedpost. He is also courted by important men all dying to act as his patrons in some prestigious profession or the other. Women's heads make 90degree turns when he walks into a room and older ladies gasp in wonder at his handsomeness from their balconies when he walks past them fantasising that he may become their soninlaw. Antonio's father is played by Pierre Brasseur who receives much praise in reviews of the movie. In my opinion he is actually the least credibly cast actor in this movie losing out to Rina Morelli who plays his wife Antonio's mother she really comes into her own in a memorable showdown scene between herself and Claudia Cardinale in a church and in the second half of the movie generally. On the other hand so many of Brasseur's expressions and mannerism betray a blatant Frenchness rather than a credible Italianness or even better a Sicilianness.Mr Magnano Senior swells with pride at the very thought of his son's alleged sexual prowess and reputation. He pretty much bases much of the reasons for boosting his family's public image precisely on Antonio being able to continue the virile oeuvre started by himself in his youthful days all over Sicily! With such a premise you just know that the movie's dramatic climax is going to be the ruinous fall from glory experienced by the poor Antonio who seemingly carries the weight of the whole of Sicily's expectations on his all too human shoulders right from the start! It's as if this poor man were expected to lift the whole island up with his erection. You don't expect the extent of the tyranny of such a patriarchal society on its male children. The story of the dishonoured girl cast out of her society certainly finds a male equivalent in Il Bell'Antonio.Also worthy of note is the Cuban actor Tomas Milian playing Edoardo Antonio's cousin the only sane rational and detached voice among a chorus of shrill scandalmongers. It's thanks to this character that we get to hear Antonio finally speak at the end of the movie telling us his firsthand experience as an impotent Sicilian man catastrophically fallen from glory. I do wonder if before or since this movie such an honest and charitable as well as credible psychological study of male sexual problems has ever been filmed  perhaps in part only in Sex Lies and Videotape. The conclusion of Antonio's story exemplifies the bitterest and most satirical form of socalled happy ending  if the movie weren't already so good overall the ending would be worth the watch alone! For any fan of classic Italian cinema this will be a rare treat indeed. If you love Mastroianni you simply cannot afford to miss this. And for any fan of cinema generally ditto.The literary source the movie is based upon the Sicilian writer Vitaliano Brancati's novel of the same title furthermore lends itself perfectly to this dual mood of fierce social satire and classic Italian comedy. Few men of letters have pinpointed the true natural of latterday Southern Italian machismo as well as Brancati. Clichfree with such an eye for the absurd the comical the downright frightening and angering I highly recommend not only Il Bell'Antonio but also all of Vitaliano's major novels it wasn't just Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa and his novel The Leopard who evocatively captured a longgone Sicily in the written form.".

No euphemisms no sensationalism no malicious elbownudging nor sentimental melodrama but a heartonthesleeve openness which also allows its longsuffering hero to maintain his dignity through a fierce portrait of a ruthlessly paternalistic society. This is all done without the aid of a single sexscene which IMO would have been redundant.The movie shows us upperclass Sicily in the late 1950s though actually it's based upon a novel set in the 1930s  Fascistera Italy. This is a society in which appearing is the essence of being and the accepted norm are arranged marriages between the children of the richest families celebrated by the entire town in the same way as Prince Charles and Diana Spencer's was back in the early 80s. As is the case with the best classic Italian movies Il Bell'Antonio couples bitternessfierce social satire with comedyhumour seamlessly. Superb leads in the form of the timeless Marcello Mastroianni and the divine Claudia Cardinale impeccably playing an unpleasant character for once give the movie extra depth beauty and soulfulness. Claudia is Barbara Puglisi the golden girl that Antonio is expected to marry the daughter of one of the richest families on the island and a virginal socialclimber of the most conventional blinkered obtusely stubborn kind. The even greater tragedy is that despite their marriage having been arranged by their families Antonio really falls for her very badly.Marcello Mastroianni who neither as an actor nor as a man remotely deserved to be considered the typical Latin lover type that Hollywood producers wished to market him as plays the titular lead the beautiful Antonio Magnano. On the verge of 30 in his prime as far as looks health and opportunities are concerned Antonio has just returned to his native Sicilian city of Catania after having lived in Rome for three years. We very quickly gather that Antonio is from an upper class Sicilian family is the apple of his father and mother's eye and something of a superstar in the whole of Catania where his family is wellknown and respected. He is adored by women who believe him to be an irresistible seducer a Casanova with hundreds of notches on his bedpost. He is also courted by important men all dying to act as his patrons in some prestigious profession or the other. Women's heads make 90degree turns when he walks into a room and older ladies gasp in wonder at his handsomeness from their balconies when he walks past them fantasising that he may become their soninlaw. Antonio's father is played by Pierre Brasseur who receives much praise in reviews of the movie. In my opinion he is actually the least credibly cast actor in this movie losing out to Rina Morelli who plays his wife Antonio's mother she really comes into her own in a memorable showdown scene between herself and Claudia Cardinale in a church and in the second half of the movie generally. On the other hand so many of Brasseur's expressions and mannerism betray a blatant Frenchness rather than a credible Italianness or even better a Sicilianness.Mr Magnano Senior swells with pride at the very thought of his son's alleged sexual prowess and reputation. He pretty much bases much of the reasons for boosting his family's public image precisely on Antonio being able to continue the virile oeuvre started by himself in his youthful days all over Sicily! With such a premise you just know that the movie's dramatic climax is going to be the ruinous fall from glory experienced by the poor Antonio who seemingly carries the weight of the whole of Sicily's expectations on his all too human shoulders right from the start! It's as if this poor man were expected to lift the whole island up with his erection. You don't expect the extent of the tyranny of such a patriarchal society on its male children. The story of the dishonoured girl cast out of her society certainly finds a male equivalent in Il Bell'Antonio.Also worthy of note is the Cuban actor Tomas Milian playing Edoardo Antonio's cousin the only sane rational and detached voice among a chorus of shrill scandalmongers. It's thanks to this character that we get to hear Antonio finally speak at the end of the movie telling us his firsthand experience as an impotent Sicilian man catastrophically fallen from glory. I do wonder if before or since this movie such an honest and charitable as well as credible psychological study of male sexual problems has ever been filmed  perhaps in part only in Sex Lies and Videotape. The conclusion of Antonio's story exemplifies the bitterest and most satirical form of socalled happy ending  if the movie weren't already so good overall the ending would be worth the watch alone! For any fan of classic Italian cinema this will be a rare treat indeed. If you love Mastroianni you simply cannot afford to miss this. And for any fan of cinema generally ditto.The literary source the movie is based upon the Sicilian writer Vitaliano Brancati's novel of the same title furthermore lends itself perfectly to this dual mood of fierce social satire and classic Italian comedy. Few men of letters have pinpointed the true natural of latterday Southern Italian machismo as well as Brancati. Clichfree with such an eye for the absurd the comical the downright frightening and angering I highly recommend not only Il Bell'Antonio but also all of Vitaliano's major novels it wasn't just Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa and his novel The Leopard who evocatively captured a longgone Sicily in the written form.";

Is there ridiculous over the top action in this film? Yes most definitely but the problem is in how it is being presented. The other movies made you laugh in their almost comic book presentation and stunts. This film is genuinely trying to sell itself as a serious action movie. They completely took the humour out of all the potentially very humorous moments through the more 'arty' editing over the top score dramatic score soundtrack definitely plays a big part of the different tone in the 3rd movie and generally lousy script.This leads on to the pacing which is far too slow at times.

Jason Statham is capable but the script can't really be saved here.So a dramatically more realistic Transporter movie but sucked dry of all the humorous and fun tone that made the previous instalments so much fun. As I said there are plenty of silly and deliberately humorous moments but the way it was constructed and presented meant I wasn't laughing anywhere near as much as I was in the other films. This in conclusion is the main failure of Transporter 3  510 just for being a new movie in an otherwise cool franchise.".

They're different. This time the rules are the same except they're different. More honest.The plot for Transporter 3 is utterly illogical. Domeheaded Frank Martin Statham is forced against his will by evil contractor Johnson Robert Knepper to transport Valentina a kidnapped girl from Marseilles to Odessa in order to make the girl's father a Ukranian official sign a document allowing a faceless US corporation to dump hazardous waste in his country. Why does it make any difference whether the girl is in Marseilles or Odessa? It doesn't. So why is she being moved? Because otherwise the story wouldn't exist. There the film has no meaning. Considering the threats to the Ukranian official are made by phone anyway the girl could be kept in a room next door or across the other side of the world and it would not affect her father's decision. Now hypothesise that there was actually some reason for her to be in Odessa. Would it not make sense for the corporation to merely hire a private plane to fly her there instead of strongarming a professional killer Frank's transporting skills are constantly secondary to his punchaguythroughawall abilities despite what the titles of the trilogy would have you believe into taking her there by car with a promise of certain death for Frank when he reaches his destination thereby giving him the ultimate impetus to change these plans in a way that would ensure his survival and the deaths of those who made his involvement in this nonsensical exercise in Discordianism compulsory? The answer is yes.Jason Statham does well in his role as any character from any film he's ever been in. Except one I can do it too tagline. He actually achieves his career nadir here when he does a striptease for Valentina the most annoying character ever committed to film. Played by Natalya Rudakova her first and if GodBuddhacontract killers exist her last the character embodies everything wrong with the movie. She is incredibly shallow talks perpetually finds Frank stabbing a metal pole into somebody's throat a turn on and tries desperately to look sexy by pouting or arching her eyebrow in every scene. The attempt to provide her with any sort of dimension beyond 'cardboard cutout' by interspersing every FrankValentina conversation with an elaborate description of what she would like to eat at that given moment is not cute it makes me wish Frank had left her seatbelt undone and driven into a bollard at 80mph. In fact the only instance where her screen presence is appreciated is when she gets punched in the stomach by the villain and falls to the floor crying. It was almost worth enduring the prolix runtime for.Miscellaneous instances of brilliance include Frank smashing head first through the window of his Audi to oust the guy driving it and then a second later we realise Frank has one of those new 'selfrepairing' cars where windows fix themselves and nobody mentions it again. The magic car also manages in true XWing style to lift itself out of a lake using only the force or a handy bag of air before summoning an old man on a tractor to somehow lasso it and pull it to shore whereupon the flooded engine starts first time. Other than the car the highlight of the film is Frank's inexplicable decision to attach an explosive device to the antagonist trigger its timer and then stand next to him looking confused before jumping behind a chair a second prior to the explosion. For an anguished moment I thought Transporter 4 was a nogo but then Frank emerged totally unscathed and I punched the air in unbridled delight.To conclude Transporter 3 is the worst action film of 2008 an ineffable feat considering this is the same year that spawned Wanted. Natalya Rudakova takes it upon herself to make the film unwatchable and not even the ridiculous stunts that would never happen even in a monkeyShakespeare infinity can provide anyone with an excuse to see it.".

However with jerky camera movements and the ridiculous fastforwarding the elements of grace and power were lost. The director tried to substitute plenty of still moments with a shirtless Statham in an attempt to give us some eye candy but none of this did Jason justice nor was it a fitting substitute. Natalya Rudakova was much too young for him as a romantic interest kind of creepy and I was unconvinced by her cheesy accent and her character's incongruent language mastery. Her character went from describing gourmet delicacies in perfect English to saying what means  insert basic word.I loved Franois Berland again and of course Jason put in another outstanding performance. Natalya could have been a fun character without the bad accent and romantic twist to the plot.Please give us a Transporter 4 more in line with the previous two films!!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Transporter 3";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm beginning to see a pattern here and I'm thinking that The Transporter if it has the legs for more movies could be the franchise equivalent of being a poor man's cousin to James Bond. Created and written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen for three installments so far the character of Frank Martin is a roguish looking strongman with a penchant for suiting up when going about being the best of the best in personalized delivery with no questions asked no names and a whole host of other rules which he will of course break during the course of the movie.Like Bond he drives a cool sponsored signature car. While Bond has his Aston Martins and BMWs Frank Martin traded his BM in the first movie for the armoured Audi A8 W12 which he has brought over from the second film and here that sweet supercar got to be put through even more punishment. It also shows itself to be a cut about the rest in being waterproof too and an occasional dunk in the river won't put out the powerful engine with tyres that selfinflate too ok so just in case you don't realize I'm pointing out mistakes.And it follows the Bond formula in having the Chick of the Flick highlight too. Shu Qi came on board in the first film as the vixen who traded her body to convince Frank to take the job. Then we had the good girlbad girl combination for Part 2 with Amber Valletta and Kate Nauta respectively. Here model Natalya Rudakova with her very obvious freckles getting in the way continues from where Shu Qi left off being the flower vase who can't speak English fluently no thanks to her strong accent and that's fine since their characters hail from a nonEnglish speaking country. Director at the helm has been round robin too now by Olivier Megaton with Hong Konger Corey Yuen crafting the first movie before taking the back seat in every film by taking charge of how Frank Martin does hand to hand combat. So we do get to see some consistency in the technique that Jason Statham adopts in performing martial arts and various stunt work on his own and Statham definitely has what it takes to fill up the void of having the lack of Western action heroes on the big screen. I suppose with more hits under his belt pardon the pun he could cement this status and I sincerely hope that he avoids the plague of being relegated in his later years to the direct to video market.As far as the story goes it just provides a basic premise and an excuse to see how our hero gets to sit behind the wheel again. The Frank Martin now is more laid back and spends most of his leisure time with the French detective Tarconi Francois Berleand whom he has befriended now. Until of course his reputation catches up with him and in a Crank inspired moment has to do what he does best for the bad guys much against his wishes. The villains almost always seem to be part of what's topical at the moment and this time Frank Martin has to contend with some ecoterrorists who are blackmailing a minister involving some permit for industrial waste.But who cares about any semblance of the plot anyway? We're looking for some adrenaline pumping high octane action aren't we all? And here's where it takes a slide for the worse actually. Unlike Bond there isn't anything new or refreshing to keep the audience engaged and away from the dejavu feeling. For some reason Besson and Kamen's story seemed to be stuck in a lot of drama and talktalktalk giving our hero not much time to flex his muscles. And when he gets the chance to it's the same old onemansurroundedbythugs routine where he effortlessly dispatches them all with aplomb.Such fight scenes are becoming common in The Transporter franchise and Corey Yeun definitely needs to rejuvenate his action sequences designed for the franchise pronto. There are only two major fisticuffs scenes and they all follow the same routine which spells boring. And apart from that we get the usual complementary car chases which seem to be rather standard with the usual camera shots and angles capturing the action too.Fans of the series and of Statham will no doubt make a bee line at the box office for this but I suspect that should there be any more thoughts on extending the franchise beyond the three films then while the formulaic plot format can be kept the action better be innovative because nobody likes seeing the same thing twice. Since different directors got a chance to have a go at the franchise perhaps a change in action choreographers might give Frank Martin the lift that he needs.".

We're looking for some adrenaline pumping high octane action aren't we all? And here's where it takes a slide for the worse actually. Unlike Bond there isn't anything new or refreshing to keep the audience engaged and away from the dejavu feeling. For some reason Besson and Kamen's story seemed to be stuck in a lot of drama and talktalktalk giving our hero not much time to flex his muscles. And when he gets the chance to it's the same old onemansurroundedbythugs routine where he effortlessly dispatches them all with aplomb.Such fight scenes are becoming common in The Transporter franchise and Corey Yeun definitely needs to rejuvenate his action sequences designed for the franchise pronto. There are only two major fisticuffs scenes and they all follow the same routine which spells boring. And apart from that we get the usual complementary car chases which seem to be rather standard with the usual camera shots and angles capturing the action too.Fans of the series and of Statham will no doubt make a bee line at the box office for this but I suspect that should there be any more thoughts on extending the franchise beyond the three films then while the formulaic plot format can be kept the action better be innovative because nobody likes seeing the same thing twice. Since different directors got a chance to have a go at the franchise perhaps a change in action choreographers might give Frank Martin the lift that he needs.";

How the girl goes unnoticed in the back seat while a gang of EMT workers pry the injured driver out is a mystery to me.

No over thetop villains or undieclad gangsta' chix nothing.The 2 most outrageously stupid scenes  and there are many to pick from has to be the bike chase scene where apparently Martin is a word class BMX stuntracer that can outrun a Audi W12 muscle car. The second was him inflating large flotation devices conveniently stored his trunk while he's deep underwater with only the air from his tires which caused the 2 ton car to rise to the surface and still enough for him to breath on and drive the car when magically towed to shore by a good Samaritan.this all takes place in less than 10 minutes storytimeEven though I don't expect sharp dialog this film takes it to a new low with completely vapid and onedimensional plastic delivery and even less character development.

	schema:headline " Transporter 3 is a great example of good dumbfun... Not to be taken seriously this sequel will leave you breathless with awesome action... A worthy followup...";
	schema:reviewBody "Riding on after the fun and at times hilariously overthetop Transporter 2 Jason Statham is back as Frank Martin aka The Transporter in Transporter 3. And if you enjoyed the previous films I can guarantee you will love this ride of mayhem.This time around Martin has been kidnapped and forced into his new job by Robert Knepper's character the villain known only as 'Johnson.' Johnson has slapped a chemicalbombbracelet onto Martin which will explode if he strays from his car by more than 75feet an insurance policy to make sure he completes his task transporting a sexy young woman named Valentina Natalya Rudakova and two mysterious bags throughout parts of Europe for reasons unknown. There is a plot involving Valentina being kidnapped and being used by Johnson to blackmail her powerful father but it isn't very important to the overall story it is just there to justify the action.And action is something this movie doesn't skimp out on. While not as showoffish as the previous film which had action in everyotherscene this entry in the series definitely has its share of fistfights and carchases explosions and gunbattles. Director Olivier Megaton no I'm not making that up takes over for Louis Leterrier codirector of the previous two entries and does a good job at maintaining the mood set by previous films and he does great with the action. Though I will say the camerawork is sometimes subpar and sometimes a little too Jason Bourne Shaky. But overall if I wasn't told any different I'd assume Leterrier was still directing which is good because a series like this should generally feel consistent.The story itself written by Transporter and Transporter 2 scribes Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is halfway decent for a silly PG13 actionfest and ends up being much better than most will give it credit for. I've already seen the comments of the film being bad but we all know that those aren't the type of people to be listening too. If someone accuses the third film in a silly franchise like this of sucking and then complains about the plot or the characters then that person is taking it too seriously. This ain't a serious movie this is a brain drain movie... where you let your brain shut off and you drain your IQ for the 100 minute running length while letting yourself be thrilled before exiting the theater and turning the ole' noggin back on.This is dumb fun at its finest.Also returning as Inspector Tarconi is Francois Berleand now given much more screen time as the comic relief and the guy who gets to piece together the story for the audience. He does wonderful as always.A large portion of the film involves the lovestory between Martin and Valentina and this is where the movie may become hitormiss for the fans. Essentially Valentina is the AntiFrank Martin she is funloving spunky and very open to anything. Frank finds her annoying at first but you can tell he almost envies her lifestyle compared to his own strict life which he now is starting to realize has been holding him back. You can tell they are a good match for each other because they even each other out. And Rudakova does a good job with the role though the audience may think she goes a little too far during certain scenes where her antics go wild. Still she adds a lot to the plot and keeps the story fresh after all we can deduce that Frank was never able to keep his connections with Lai or go anywhere with Mrs. Billings from the previous films. And hey Rudakova made me fall in love with her and her character so thats gotta count for something.One last comment on Jason Statham the star of the film before I wrap this up. I truly think this series has proved he has what it takes to make it as a bigtime star. He has had to show emotions through a character that likes to ignore or disregard them and he has proved himself physically. He's also a decent actor. I think this series and particularly Statham are not getting the attention they deserve.Allinall I liked Transporter 3 it was a great ride filled with good action cool characters and a silly but decent clichridden story. And hey clichs are clichs but they work! I give it as a fan an 8 out of 10.".

If you have seen the first two of the Jason Staitham action trilogy about a very focused efficient and also highly lucky transporter hired by those intheknow for delivering whatever package is assigned him then the dispension of logic is a common occurrence. This sequel has the package being a politician's Ukrainian daughter to be delivered to some very ruthless clients who want to pollute with toxic waste and need permission in writing to travel ships carrying the stuff over a particular area on the water. So our transporter who is provided extra motivation to deliver his package on time thanks to a metal bracelet which will explode if he is separate very far from his car which also wired to detonate must drive across Europe at great speed and accuracy with the occasional stop along the way in order to survive. The whole film is built around Staitham's abilities to avoid destruction the metal bracelet a major thorn in his side at every possible moment. He attempts to find a means to remove it tries to set up the mastermind behind his predicament by contacting an old frienda cop from a French village and finds himself falling in loveand vice versa for herwith the package who of course complicates matters from time to time. Very much a PG13 actioner with no bloodboo!and when the bad guys get shot we don't see the damage on screen. The reason to see this is the impressive if a bit highly unlikely in a more realistic scenariothis is a Staitham movie if you recall stunt work with one scene having Staitham driving his car on it's side between two semis and on top of a moving train. And the girls get to see their hunk with his shirt off including one fight scene where he must upend a gang with tools using only his wardrobe as a defense! Oh and you just have to see how Staitham gets out of a drowning while under water knowing that if he splits from his sinking car he'll either explode or follow it to his doom. Natalya Rudakova is the hot Ukrainian redhead Valentina he must keep out of troubledanger while attempting unsuccessfully from getting too attached as she makes advances towards him. Franois Berland returns as Inspector Tarconi Staitham's Frank Martin's major ally as he works to find the politician whose deadline to sign the papers allowing access is 24 hours. Robert Knepper is Martin's deadserious rival who seems to have all the cards and tries to betray the transporter on numerous occasions. I just love listening to Rudakova speak in broken English it makes my heart skip a beat.".

I had slightly hoped that that issue would have been addressed at the end of the movie. But it was by no means sufficient to enjoy the overall thrill ride of the direction and editing.The edit cuts were too short most of the time during the fight sequences. I felt they should have been more than just a half second long in many places.The movie scores high marks for making use of many locations.OK but a point off is taken for a physics plot hole if air from car tires is sufficient to lift a car out of water when the air inflates giant bags then it would be sufficient to lift the car out of water when inside the tires.

As a side note I've learned how to make a lobster thermidore.Also if the bad guys had watched the other 2 transporters then they would have surely realised that Jason CANNOT be beaten.

In a cinema I expect to hear things clearly. When the Russians or whatever they were spoke it sounded like they were talking Jelly baby. As a side note I've learned how to make a lobster thermidore.Also if the bad guys had watched the other 2 transporters then they would have surely realised that Jason CANNOT be beaten. Even by a group of 10000000 guys. The guys a soldier. You have to give him that.";

I liked the previous Transporter films and this one is the best out of all of them not mainly because of the action but because this one had a better storyline than the first two. The story is about Frank Martin has been pressured into transporting Valentina by using a device which prevents him from moving 75 feet from his car or the bomb explodes the kidnapped daughter of Leonid Vasilev the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for Ukraine from Marseilles through Stuttgart and Budapest until he ends up in Odessa on the Black Sea. Along the way with the help of Inspector Tarconi Frank has to contend with the people who strong armed him to take the job agents sent by Vasilev to intercept him and the general noncooperation of his passenger. Despite Valentina's cynical disposition and Frank's resistance to get involved Frank and Valentina fall for each other while escaping from one lifethreatening situation after another. Statham again drives an armoured Audi S8 in the film.Other than the story the movie was loaded with ultra cool action sequences and spectacular stunts that will keep you in the edge of your seat. I'm generally not really keen in action movies because they are all the same but Transporter 3 is different and I had a good time watching it. Overall it is a fun popcorn action movie of the year.".

	schema:headline " A distinct lack of action and fun";
	schema:reviewBody "The Transporter movies have never been grounded in reality but up until now at least they were grounded in the realm of fun. With the third instalment new director Olivier Megaton fails to reach the heights of the second and has created a bland and curiously empty entry.I am not what you would call a fan of the Transporter series the first was dumb to a delirious extent and the second while unbelievable incorporated more frequent action as well as a plot far too creative for what a film of such ilk deserved. Transporter 3 drops the distinguishing characteristics from both its predecessors it is not overtly dumb but nor does it have any semblance of a plot. After my first take I was under the impression that the story was too complex to decipher coherently yet as I thought about it more I realized the plot was in fact so faint it was ghostly.In movies like this an inherent problem is the plot is shoved backseat and held hostage to action with the storyline simply stringing along the carnage. But in this film there are only 4 action sequences involving a chase on a bike a handtohand fight that would make a stripper envious a car chase with two semitrailers and the 'climax'. These sequences can't take up more then 25 minutes of the running time which by the way clocks in at a far too beefy 100 minutes. As such we are left with a sans plot flick light on action and the resulting product is less then engrossing.As we always do we meet up with Frank Martin Jason Statham this time vacationing in Marseilles fishing with his longtime friend Inspector Tarconi Francois Berleand. After an accident involving another transporter thrusts Frank back into career mode he is unwillingly absconded by Prison Break's TBag Robert Knepper as a sinister business man with a hidden agenda and adds some much needed spunk to the film. Ordered to drive a redheaded and mysterious Russian beauty across the country Frank tries to determine who his girl is and why she is so important. It turns out that she is the leverage to persuade her father who is a Ukrainian government official to turn a blind eye to the unlawful import of toxic waste into the country. But alas over the course of their journey Frank begins to fall for the damsel in distress and must make a choice between tarnishing his 100 delivery rate and saving his lady love.That essentially summarizes the plot Frank must deliver the girl at the time immediately after her father signs the necessary legal papers. All that is left is an erratic road trip film with its players simply going through the motions.

I am not going to fault her for giving a subpar performance as it was Megaton's choice to cast her but I will doubly fault the director for making her character utterly obnoxious and unlikable.Most of the fight sequences when they finally occur are handled with the same unique flair of the previous films but others like the semitrailer chase seems cheaply shot like the director used amateur affects such as speeding up the film to make the cars appear faster I'm not sure if he did that's just how it came off to me. Jason Statham grounds the film like always and has all the cool charisma and balding dome you could want. Unfortunately the movie as a whole does not deliver the same gravitas as its star and if Frank Martin's adventures become much more nondescript we will end up following his adventures working as a UPS driver sporting a beer belly and a handlebar moustache.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "The Transporter movies have never been grounded in reality but up until now at least they were grounded in the realm of fun. With the third instalment new director Olivier Megaton fails to reach the heights of the second and has created a bland and curiously empty entry.I am not what you would call a fan of the Transporter series the first was dumb to a delirious extent and the second while unbelievable incorporated more frequent action as well as a plot far too creative for what a film of such ilk deserved. Transporter 3 drops the distinguishing characteristics from both its predecessors it is not overtly dumb but nor does it have any semblance of a plot. After my first take I was under the impression that the story was too complex to decipher coherently yet as I thought about it more I realized the plot was in fact so faint it was ghostly.In movies like this an inherent problem is the plot is shoved backseat and held hostage to action with the storyline simply stringing along the carnage. But in this film there are only 4 action sequences involving a chase on a bike a handtohand fight that would make a stripper envious a car chase with two semitrailers and the 'climax'. These sequences can't take up more then 25 minutes of the running time which by the way clocks in at a far too beefy 100 minutes. As such we are left with a sans plot flick light on action and the resulting product is less then engrossing.As we always do we meet up with Frank Martin Jason Statham this time vacationing in Marseilles fishing with his longtime friend Inspector Tarconi Francois Berleand. After an accident involving another transporter thrusts Frank back into career mode he is unwillingly absconded by Prison Break's TBag Robert Knepper as a sinister business man with a hidden agenda and adds some much needed spunk to the film. Ordered to drive a redheaded and mysterious Russian beauty across the country Frank tries to determine who his girl is and why she is so important. It turns out that she is the leverage to persuade her father who is a Ukrainian government official to turn a blind eye to the unlawful import of toxic waste into the country. But alas over the course of their journey Frank begins to fall for the damsel in distress and must make a choice between tarnishing his 100 delivery rate and saving his lady love.That essentially summarizes the plot Frank must deliver the girl at the time immediately after her father signs the necessary legal papers. All that is left is an erratic road trip film with its players simply going through the motions. Along with being neither interesting nor engaging the journey is made much more unpleasant by first time actress Natalya Rudakova who plays the daughter. I am not going to fault her for giving a subpar performance as it was Megaton's choice to cast her but I will doubly fault the director for making her character utterly obnoxious and unlikable.Most of the fight sequences when they finally occur are handled with the same unique flair of the previous films but others like the semitrailer chase seems cheaply shot like the director used amateur affects such as speeding up the film to make the cars appear faster I'm not sure if he did that's just how it came off to me.

Then Transporter 3 rolled into theaters bringing with it the GingerKid from hell.The writerdirector of this debacle have created the most aggravating irritating nonsensical character I have ever seen.The female lead is not attractive. She is a drug addict alcoholic and likes to pee on the floor no really. Obviously the nononsense keepitsimple Transporter character that Statham has spent the last two films molding will hate her right? RIGHT? Every time she started speaking I'd cringe. Each conversation was a carousel of dialogue that spun in circles and usually ended up with her contradicting the point she had been trying to make when she first started talking. The rambling conversations between the two leads which probably take up 70 of the film are completely pointless doing nothing to further the plot resolve any conflict and they certainly fail to entertain.During a fight scene there are no less than 10 cuts where they show her for a few seconds and she raises her eyebrows while ogling Statham. It's possible they just recycled the shot 10 times it's so repetitive. Didn't anyone catch this in editing?!? By the end of the scene you want to cover your eyes each time they show her on the screen.By the point in the movie that Statham is stripteasing for her you're ready to head to the concession stand in the hopes they sell cyanide pills. The main audience for Transporter is guys. Guys like fights explosions and girls. Girls will go along with guys if Statham is in the movie. Statham starts stripteasing the guys don't go to the movie and girls aren't going to the Transporter by themselves. Now nobody sees the movie. I really really hope nobody else sees this movie.I bought the DVD for the first Transporter. I saw the second one and would watch it on TV. I couldn't bear to see the third again. By the time she is finished with the Transporter you feel like you just watched a drinking buddy get beaten with baseball bats for 2 hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am one of the billion fans of the Three Kingdom novels story as well as hundreds episode long TV shows made about it before. And I was really excited to see a 60 million dollar movie being made on the battle of Chi Bi. But it's not the classic it could've been.Don't let your previous John Woo experiences like Face Off or MI2 fool you. This movie is deeply in the Asian style of making. Things to look for are slower pace beautiful sceneryMisenscene cool Asian music a lot of metaphors lots of fighting everybody loves them! awful extras...First off the pace is so so slow. I am a patient viewer and know when directors have to go slow to make an impact with the story but I find some problems with pacing with this movie especially with war scenes. For example are the scenes with the shields reflecting sunlight. We got the point! The shields are a clever move but you don't have to basically repeat 2 shots soldiers turning their shield the horses go wild twenty times. Cinematography is pretty good in this movie. I said pretty good because while it looks good it is bad compared to the likes of Fearless or Hero while it has a lot more to work with than those movies. Computer graphics are not the best but enough for a pass. The flying pigeon scene is a great idea.The musical score in this movie is interesting. I feel it's a little Western influenced because of the symphonyviolin sounds besides the heavy drums and flute. Other than that the music is great. However they could probably utilized the use of musical themes more. I don't particularly like the casting choices for Guan Yu and Liu Bei. Liu Bei is a royal family member filled with kindness and I thought the actor has little elegance or anything royallike in his look and look is important for a character with less chance to be portrayed. You can understand my point when comparing him with the actor playing Sun Quan. Guan Yu is basically a saintlike warrior in the story. His look alone has a lot of characteristics a large man with a graceful look spreads fear on the battlefield but is a symbol of safety for his people... that I think the actor's appearance is not deep enough to portray.The highlights of this movie are the interaction between Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu. Their first encounter is an awesome sequence. Not many words are said but Zhuge Liang fully understand Zhou Yu's character through his acting toward the farmers and his soldiers. This scene is Asian filmography at its best. It shows soldiers preparing for war yet somehow the slow pace works not many words are spoken but great music fills in the space and the character of Zhou Yu's is fully brought out to the audience. The scene of the 2 characters playing music is also great but I feel the repeated shots of the person's face through the candles get boring.On a similar note I like these two actors. Kaneshiro Takeshi did some very good face acting to portray well the wittiness that his look would normally lack as it is a significant feature of Zhuge Liang's characteristics. He also does well in comedic moments. Definitely upped a level from House of Flying Daggers. Leung Chiu Wai is a veteran and he plays Zhou Yu very well he can be calm or determined clever or ass kicking. Also they have good synergy and that's important since they are the two main characters.Forced scenes  The sex scene man sexing up his wife before going to a deadly battle...300 anyone? And it's way too long for a sex scene that's not that raunchy.  Tiger hunting scene too long some blurry shots and bad editing make it obvious that the tiger is from Discovery Channel. This is a typical lame Asian move when they force a metaphorical scene. I'm a little annoyed with the final fight sequence. Here's a little info so you can be on my page Cao Cao has 700000 soldiers and the good guys got more than 30000 heads... There are 2000 cavaliers trapped in your formation CRUSH THEM. I don't like how they focus too much on the cinematic effect badass battle at the end of the movie and make it unrealistic as well as too long. Letting ALL your best generals going SOLO against the enemy may make a heroic scene but only idiots would do it in real life. And if it takes that long to kill 2000 how will you do against the 680000 that's left? However I give props to John Wu for a courageous and excellent interpretation of the Ba Qua formation for your information nobody really knows how to do it so he's quite brave to tryIf you're looking for amazing fighting or choreography go to Seven Swords. I like their decision to make the moves in Chi Bi not too fancy because this is war and it comes down to kill or die. Also this is very early in Chinese history 2nd 3rd century and realistically martial arts styles are not highly developed yet. There is not a lot of comedy but it is well timed and to the right level as well as effectiveness. I also find the battle helmets ugly. Overall I feel like this movie could be 2 hours and more effective than the 2h30min mark it is right now. But it is awesome to finally see a story like the Three Kingdom being put into a production worth its scale. Also the storytelling is great and full of excellent metaphors the characters got depths and smarts. Of course the brutality of war is brought out well. I believe the second part will be a feast.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Battle of Red Cliffs holds a special place in Chinese history and mythology. It was a decisive conflict which occurred at the end of the Han Dynasty immediately prior to the period of the Three Kingdoms and it was fought in the winter of 208209 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao.The 2008 film titled simply Red Cliff was deliberately timed for release in China in the lead up to the 2008 Summer Olympics and was a great success with Chinese audiences. One year later the movie has a limited release in the West where the selling point is not so much the history which is largely unknown outside China as the director Hong Kong's John Woo who is known for such Hollywood work as Broken Arrow FaceOff and Mission Impossible 2.It has to be said that the Mandarin dialogue is leaden and much of the acting somewhat exaggerated but a huge cast and considerable special effects  allied with the director's trademark style  makes the movie visually stunning with clever tactical manoeuvres multiple battle scenes and considerable blood.If it all seems a little confused to Western audiences this is probably because we are seeing it in a rather different version to the original. In Asia Red Cliff was released in two parts totalling over four hours in length whereas outside of Asia the release is a single film of 'only' two and a half hours. For me it's not up there with Hero or House of Flying Daggers but it is wellworth seeing and a pictorial treat.".

In Asia Red Cliff was released in two parts totalling over four hours in length whereas outside of Asia the release is a single film of 'only' two and a half hours. For me it's not up there with Hero or House of Flying Daggers but it is wellworth seeing and a pictorial treat.";

	schema:headline " Stunning Historical Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "This review is of the Chinese DVD Release of the 1st film only... I cannot understand how the previous poster could feel that way about this gorgeous epic. Everything they said they hated were things I thought were well done and wonderful about the film. Of all the people I've shared this DVD with they've all thought it was an amazing movie also.Ever camera shot was gorgeous. The angles were unique without wasted punchins or broll. It's rare to find films so tastefully shot. The color was stunning and the interpretation of the classic tale was unique and never disappointing.Meanwhile With all the characters the actors each held such a powerful presence. It's very tough to develop any character singularly while you have so many important characters with their own mythos and chronicles but each actor really held up to their image and that of the character. Kaneshiro is a very unique version of Zhuge which caught me off guard at first but appreciated after his scene w the Zhou Yu. Zhou Yu was never a character I've cared for but here he's likable and strong. The best fresh interpretation though was that of Guan Yu. Instead of being just another honourable and strong warrior he's rather a warriorscholar more intelligent and more personality than ever before.My only true quarrel is that it ends prematurely that is until we see the 2nd half in 2009. I just wish they could have done the whole saga instead of this little piece.Thank you John Woo for one of the finest Three Kingdom movies ever! I believe this is a great direction for your talents! You've woven the action you're so famous for with a deep heartfelt classic tale! Wonderful job!".

	schema:reviewBody "My favorite scene in the movie was one where Zhuge Liang was lying alone in the a vast meadow. Eyes closed. He was dreaming yet he wasn't asleep. He was dreaming up war strategies and listening to the hooves of the horses of the opposing army. Through this he was trying to figure out the enemy's war formation. This scene was able to establish Zhuge's brilliance and it stayed central to the film's goal war strategy. But there were other scenes of the opener of John Woo's 2 part ethic that failed miserably.I completely agree with bbbgut's review. Being a Chinese American I believe that Asian cinema is still many steps behind Hollywood in many respects. Like so many other films there were so many scenes in Chi Bi that were not central to the story. Instead these scenes were superfluous and cheesy. Half the scenes were just fat that needs to be trimmed.Notable examples are 1 the protracted scene with the old farmer and the boy with the di zi wooden flute 2 the birth scene of the calf 3 the battle of the guzhengs wooden harpsichords and 4 the tiger hunt in the woods.The tiger in the woods scene spent a large part of the film establishing a character King of Eastern Wu who had such a small role in the movie. Of all the characters in the movie the King was probably the least memorable. Yet he received the most screen time in character development. On top of all this the scene was done very poorly. John Woo failed to show how daunting it could be to hunt a tiger and how much courage it takes to confront such a beast. The end of the hunt was terribly anticlimatic. And after this long scene for the King he was barely seen again.For analysis of the other scene read on Through the other scenes John Woo wanted to establish 1 Zhou Yu is an able and learned General disciplined in Sun Tsu's Sun Zi the Art of War 2Zhuge Liang has a keen intellect and is in command of many disciplines that help him as an able strategist. 3 Zhuge Lian and Zhou Yu are way above the rest in intellect and that they can communicate on a higher plain. He established these points quite ineffectively and yet they took so much film time. Instead these scenes left you confused until later on when Zhuge Liang says outright he is very capably in command of 1 The Moral Law 2 Heaven 3 Earth 4 The Commander 5 Method and discipline. 5 aspects of the Art of War. Even at this explicit explanation the audience will fail to equate knowledge of war to a calf being born. To reiterate unless it applies directly to winning the war at Chi Bi LEAVE IT OUT.In a movie you must establish these subtle yet important points as quickly as possible. One is not afforded with the little nuances and side plots that develop the characters unless you want the audience to watch all 120 chapters of the original book in it's glorious detail. In addition you want to stay focused on the central theme of the movie The war at red cliff. It's the title for Christs sake. Unless you want the movie to be named birthing music and war don't include those other scenes. Have other scenes take it's place.Last note instead of the guzheng scene how great could it be if the two strategists could see each others' genius through their battle plans. And we as the audience bear witness to their great minds beginning to resonate with each other. Instead of seeing Sir Isaac Newton and Alber Einstein engage in a piano dual.John Woo says that he will consolidate the 2 part movie in to one for the American audience because Americans don't have the attention span for long films. This is not true since a movie like Schindler's list is worth every minute of the 3hr 15 min running time. Also Part II Chi Bi 2 was just a long protracted battle scene anyway. With the only notable scene being stealing arrows with straw boats.".

But the south is defiance. Lord Liu Bei Yong You tries to fight and has excellent general but is hopelessly outnumbered by Cao Cao forces. He sets out to make an alliance with two other Southern Lords the young Sun Quan Chen Chang and military expert Zhou Yu Tony Leung. Liu Bei uses his chief adviser Kongming Takeshi Kaneshiro to negotiate with Lords. Even with this new alliance Cao Cao still outnumbers the 3 Kingdoms with a force of 800000 troops. Zhou Yu and Kongming sets out the win the coming battle with strategy expert military tactics trickery the weather and spies. Here the two forces set out for the coming battle.John Woo is an action director and the martial arts and the battles are well handle if OTT but that's what John Woo does. He has flair and the fights are bloody. He has fun with the CGI from the battles to following arrows and doves when they are in flight. He gets to combine both Asian and Hollywood style of filmmaking. The music as well combine both Asian and Western styles. The film itself feels like the Chinese Lord of the Rings.Tony Leung is the strongest link in the film he is an expert martial artist and a good actor being in House of Flying Daggers the Infernal Affiars Trilogy and Lust Caution just to name a few. He offers another good performances. Other actors also offer good performances and they was no one who dragged the film down.In China and Hong Kong Red Cliff was split into two films and already out on DVD in Hong Kong. The Western version combines the films and its also the dumbed down version. The English was just weird in context with the rest of film. The film also does change in tone from it beginning. Lets hope that the DVD release in the West will be of both films or an extended edition.".

It's claimed to be based on history not the fiction Romance of Three Kingdoms however characters are hilarious not serious as great politicians should be. It's supposed to be a movies with battlefields and strategies however parts with personal lifestyles are more than that. So it's neither an entertainment movie have so many killings and bloods nor a serious movie about war have so many jokes.Characters of this movie are like from a TV series. Generals showed no special skill in fighting but can manage to kill all of enemy's soldier. Zhao Yun stood carelessly in the middle of a battle to persuade Liu Bei's wife to leave. All the weapons are put on Guan Yu's blade so that he can easily put them out. By a trivial shake Guan Yu's can escape from all of enemy soldier's blade pointing to him. Zhang Fei crushed into the enemy with no weapon in hand. Zhou Yu used his own body to take an arrow for someone and let the arrow stick at his heart's side. Wei's generals chasing a girl into a bunch of dusts without any doubts.Nonetheless officers are not better. After running away from Cao Cao Shu's officers gave trivial analysis for the situation. All officers in Wu behaved like children during the discussion with ZhuGe Liang noisy messy and no serious arguments. Wu's army was described as highly disciplined but the general Zhou Yu could stop the training halfway to talk to a farmer and his servant. Zhou Yu was described as having a sharp ear but could not hear the tiger coming from behind. Again Zhou Yu later gave a trivial lesion about the rope when other characters big heroes were listening seriously. Sun Guan could kill a tiger without any specific skill and training.In other word the director might want too much and go to nowhere. He might want a movie closed to history but his characters are not. He might want humanlike heroes but his characters show no specific skill in both fighting and thinking to be real heroesleaders.".

What is interesting is to see the magnificence of the formations and tactics described in the books all meticulously CGIed for us.Overall this is a big budget production and it does show in the lavish sets costumes impressive battle mobilization etc. This is where I awarded the movie 610.Forget the acting the characters the cringeworthy dialogue playing footsie with history Liu Bei was actually rather cunning and he wove grass shoe soles while he lived under Cao Cao to hide his intelligence and ambition he isn't the clueless good guy as portrayed the insipid and totally pointless pathetically contrived sex the incredibly asinine jokes and lame puns fan and staying cool stretched to unbelievable limits the WTF? anecdotes the stolen ox the music improvization and Meng Meng the baby horse.Unbelievable!! The middle is a waste of time  there is so much more to add and to say yet only extreme cinematic silliness and facile character portraits prevail. The contemporary equivalent of the three rulers are say Mao Chiang Kaishek and Sun Yat Sen and their capable deputies not to mention the brilliant women like the Soong sisters can anyone imagine Zhou En Lai spending his spare time during a period of war against the Japanese or Nationalists teaching children's songs to kids in school or writing calligraphy that insults his opponents??? The original texts are so rich with tactical details ruthless complex and brilliant characters and unpredictable plot twists it would have made a far more interesting film the likes of LOTR. I wish Peter Jackson directed this gem not John Woo. It's as if someone dumbed down and diluted the LOTR trilogy into ....Narnia.If you're looking for a more authentically Chinese film about the glory and horrors of war brotherhood not just between the 3 characters but the heartwrenching element of civil warring Chinese vs. Chinese etc. treachery betrayal love honour watch Warlords. One of the best films ever...epic complex realistic emotionally engaging and unforgettable. Red Cliff comes across as an epic farce in comparison to Warlords.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Red Cliff";
	schema:reviewBody "A friend of mine revealed to me that John Woo acknowledged parallels between characters in his movies and characters from the Three Kingdom era and that General Zhao Yun was one of Woo's personal favourites. This admiration for General Zhao's qualities cannot be more obvious when it is he who opens the first battle proper with a very familiar character episode involving the rescue of the infant son and future lord of his master Liu Bei thereby sealing his reputation of valor earning admiration even from enemy Cao Cao. Fans of Liu Bei's camp will undoubtedly cheer at the appearances of his sworn brothers General Guan Yu who is worshiped as a Deity until this very day and remains one of my favourite characters besides Zhao Yun and General Zhang Fei whose gruffness translates to instant warready prowess. While Liu's army is clearly routed in a military loss it explained the dilemma of Liu's leadership. One which is based on sincerity a quality which persuaded his chief military strategist and genius all round Zhuge Liang Takeshi Kaneshiro to join his cause but one which lacked military strength in numbers despite having some of the best generals of the time under his leadership.Which of course Cao Cao admires and probably is envious about given his superior strength in numbers came from surrendering armies whose loyalty remains questionable and of course with individual generals who can't surpass the abilities of those from Liu. Playing the king like a puppet and having him issue a decree for permission to pursue Liu Bei who has fled southwards he sets his sights also on warlord Sun Quan for a more personal reason akin to the story of Helen of Troy. Zhuge Liang knowing their current weakness seeks an alliance between the armies of Liu and Sun Quan and this forms most of the first half where he had to play envoy to cajole and persuade especially in convincing Sun Quan's most trusted adviser Zhou Yu Tony Leung that war is inevitable and they should form a winwin partnership.And here's where great minds think alike and watching both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang do a friendly pit against each other is nothing short of amazing where so little says so much. It helps of course that both Tony Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro have been paired up as leading men on screen before in Wong Karwai's Chungking Express and in Andrew Lau and Alan Mak's Confession of Pain too lending some much established and credible chemistry as men who share admiration in each other's ability especially when Zhou Yu seemed to have a fairer balance between fighting skill and intellect. With one side having highly disciplined soldiers with good morale and the other having renowned generals to be leaders it doesn't take a genius to realize the advantages gained in fending off a common enemy together.The fight sequences were pure spectacle with old school wire work combined with technological wizardry to showcase some large scale battle sequences at a macro level or to highlight the immense naval numbers that Cao Cao brings to battle. Formations and strategies take centerstage in a first major confrontation on land where one gets to see John Woo's interpretation of Zhuge Liang's bagua 8 stratagems strategy made more entertaining through the continuation of what we have already seen in each general's fighting ability each given a unique style befitting the characters in folklore such as Guan Yu and his Guan Dao Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhao Yun Hu Jun and his spear. There's the usual bellowing cape and slow motion in Woo's signature style but these were kept to a minimum as are the pigeons though they do make an appearance but serving some purpose.Perhaps it is the success of the fight sequences that had left some lamenting for more but bear in mind this is just but the first half of the movie setting things up. The major war sequences of course are left in the second movie which we will get to see come early next year. Like The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions expect the next movie to go on an all out assault. I felt that already is a fair balance of drama and action here especially when this installment has to cover a broad base given numerous characters which should provide fans of Three Kingdoms something to cheer about. Chang Chen provides his Sun Quan with enough selfdoubt and in a small story arc has to seek his inner confidence ala King Leonidas in 300 while model Lin Chiling's much touted debut movie appearance was limited to just a few scenes of loveydovey moments which unfortunately for audiences in Singapore her sex scene with Tony Leung got edited out in order for distributors to get a PG rating to put more bums on seats.I had wondered how Tony Leung would have faired as Zhuge Liang instead of Kaneshiro but felt that the musical chairs casting somehow became a blessing in disguise. Kaneshiro's good looks might have made some doubt his ability to play the smartest man alive during the era but he did an excellent job in bringing out the humility and selfdeprecation of the man whose never flashy nor overconfident of his abilities and one who swears his talents to his lord Liu Bei. Tony Leung on the other hand brought about a fine balance of brains and brawn to the Zhou Yu character whom I suspect in Woo's version would be credited with much success for his part in Red Cliff rather than the accolades all going to Zhuge Liang. After you see the reliable Tony Leung in this role you'll know for sure that Chow YunFatt could probably never had brought the kind of gravitas Leung brought to the role.Red Cliff is hands down highly recommended".

	onyx:emotionText "A friend of mine revealed to me that John Woo acknowledged parallels between characters in his movies and characters from the Three Kingdom era and that General Zhao Yun was one of Woo's personal favourites. This admiration for General Zhao's qualities cannot be more obvious when it is he who opens the first battle proper with a very familiar character episode involving the rescue of the infant son and future lord of his master Liu Bei thereby sealing his reputation of valor earning admiration even from enemy Cao Cao. Fans of Liu Bei's camp will undoubtedly cheer at the appearances of his sworn brothers General Guan Yu who is worshiped as a Deity until this very day and remains one of my favourite characters besides Zhao Yun and General Zhang Fei whose gruffness translates to instant warready prowess. While Liu's army is clearly routed in a military loss it explained the dilemma of Liu's leadership. One which is based on sincerity a quality which persuaded his chief military strategist and genius all round Zhuge Liang Takeshi Kaneshiro to join his cause but one which lacked military strength in numbers despite having some of the best generals of the time under his leadership.Which of course Cao Cao admires and probably is envious about given his superior strength in numbers came from surrendering armies whose loyalty remains questionable and of course with individual generals who can't surpass the abilities of those from Liu. Playing the king like a puppet and having him issue a decree for permission to pursue Liu Bei who has fled southwards he sets his sights also on warlord Sun Quan for a more personal reason akin to the story of Helen of Troy. Zhuge Liang knowing their current weakness seeks an alliance between the armies of Liu and Sun Quan and this forms most of the first half where he had to play envoy to cajole and persuade especially in convincing Sun Quan's most trusted adviser Zhou Yu Tony Leung that war is inevitable and they should form a winwin partnership.And here's where great minds think alike and watching both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang do a friendly pit against each other is nothing short of amazing where so little says so much.

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly I had my doubts about Red Cliff. John Woo in the chair to make a historical war drama? That hasn't happened since... oh wait it's never happened before. Then again if Ang Lee could make a great movie about gay cowboys I'm willing to see what John Woo can do outside his usual territory. That and the film's steady high profile publicity over the past several years made Red Cliff a mustsee for me.For Red Cliff the biggest divergence from Woo's prime time classics such as The Killer is the subdued emotions. Most of Woo's classics were rather inyourface in terms of melodrama but not so in Red Cliff. While I loved his melodramas I believe Red Cliff reveals a matured Woo with improved craftsmanship. Make no mistake he has incorporated his signature themes of male bonding loyalty and sacrifice in Red Cliffbut in a much more subtle and understated manner.Unquestionable some viewers have loved Woo for his badass action sequences. But for me I've always been a fan because of his memorable characters. To this point I was pleased with Red Cliff's strong characters. The film has focused on making the central figures appealing by either embellishing them with an edgy factor or giving them some depth and this is successful for the most part.For me the low point of the movie was the weak acting from Zhao Wei and Takeshi Kaneshiro  not just compared to Tony Leung but on any scale. Kaneshiro is an odd choice to play the historically glorified Zhuge Liang while Zhao Wei's character seemed totally inconsequential.The film also features some annoying cartoonish music which seemed to be oddly misplaced in intense combat scenes.Other than those few shortcomings Red Cliff is a solid film that is both a mega blockbuster and quality filmmaking.".

Just for a piece of information. People don't speak Chinese may still enjoy it because there is less distraction.This film is outrageously funny in the most foolish way. It is the laughing out loud film of the year. We trash this film just like what people do to Transformer 2 in English speaking countries or even worse By the way Transformer 2 is too considered a masterpiece in some non English speaking countries. This film is a complete joke.The dialogues  OMG People just chuckle all the way through the entire films each line is more ridiculous than the previous one not because it is funny but because it is idiotic. For example helping horse give birth in the middle of a war ... then when the leading lady 'gently' cheers the newborn baby horse stand up the cinema just burst into laughter. Was it a joke? that can't be serious To add to this they even give the horse a name Mengmeng. LOL this is just too comical. There are so many lines which will take so long to list. Some of the lines including 'Mengmengbecame very popular and 'fashionable' in China simply because they are sooooo dumb and they represent stupidity now.There are so many things distracting e.g. The tension eye contact or closeness between faces between Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung we audience constantly fear that these two gorgeous actors were going to KISS!!The fight scenes again like Transformers 2 we cannot tell who is fighting which one is which who is winning who is losing ... put in a simple way chaotic. My friend sitting next to me actually went to a nap and asked me to wake HIM up when the fight is over because he did not want to miss the lines people were laughing at all over China.Two people in ancient China making out on a modern Western looking king size bed even comes with two matching bedside tables! This is anything but China.A princess from ancient China strips off in front of a whole court to reveal a military map. NEVER! Forget about culture and class. Forget about her skills as an artist. She made it by writing on that fool's head at least part of it. WOW ... they both can join the circus.Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung communicating by playing fancy ancient Chinese instruments ... we just do not buy this forgive my language bullshit. Kongfu Panda makes more sense!!Frankly the visual are not original or outstanding. It looks worse than standard Hollywood epic movie including some copy and paste from 300. The only major difference is that people are in Chinese warrior costumes. And the music is cheesy and repetitive. All these clichs and irony are so obvious to Chinese speaking audience while so unclear to Non Chinese speaking people. If you saw this film in a cinema and some people were laughing or some eye balls were rolled and you wonder why ... this explains some of it.But this is John Woo when he makes a movie. If it is in English people speak English laugh. If it is in Chinese people speak Chinese LAUGH.".

	schema:reviewBody "Its been years since I last watched a great Chinese movie. Growing up in Malaysia watching many Chinese movies the one I most fond of was Wong Kar Wai Tsui Hark Stanley Tong Jackie Chan and of course the masterful John Woo. In his movies the elements he combined made his movie very unique and distinctive from any other Chinese films i've watched. His use of kinetic shots and slow motion gave a fresh look if not reinvented the action genre while Hollywood was still producing plain and boring action movies.After nearly 18 years John returns to Chinese cinema with a big present install for all of us. And that is Red Cliff. Beautifully shot big on scale actionplenty great performances and a smart adaptation of the historical epic The Three kingdom makes this movie one of the best Chinese epics in decades.with the exception of Hero True to his style. After his last three films i began to think whether John's losing his edge already or is it because the Hollywood system that was in the way. In this case I choose to think the Hollywood system was the cause of it. Red Cliff shows he still have the similar trademark he use in his films. The only difference is that this movie is huge in scale.The themes he use brotherhood humble and honor are one of the driving formulas which made his classic movies a hit with audience is still very visible here. Visuals are breathtaking as this is one of the greatest visual effect shots I ever seen in an Asian movie. For an Asian like me I'm very proud of that. The cinematic shots were stunning and beautiful. One which John's interpretation is still very sharp. The production behind this movie are mind blowingly HUGE. With the amount of extras and props used makes any filmmakerwannabe to ask how did he do that? I couldn't even imagine all the headache he has gone through for this movie.Now in terms of story telling plot and character development the elements which i mention up there surprisingly fits together. The pacing for each scene has a mind of its own. For action it goes into overdrive. Cleverly building in the battle and action the scenes were outstanding. It almost has a classic hong kong action feel to it where every action seems to be very unpredictable. The dramatic scenes and character development fits like a shoe as the acting boost up all the character's emotions. Whether its seriousness ego humor sad or depressed all the characters has it. So to my surprise I still can't get over the fact that John can still balance both action and drama together like he always did in his films. Two thumbs up for that. The plot came in quite well in timing. With no hesitation except for the small intro it goes straight into the battle scenes first before any dramatic scenes take place. Slowly it builds up from the inroduction of characters each revealing themselves in detail to the forming of strategies to stop the invasion and ends in with an amazing climatic battle scene.All in all Red Cliff is one of the best movies in 2008 that I've seen. I'm gonna review Part II later. So to end this review. I gave it A MUST HAVE for people.8.8 out of 10 ratings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why the negatives people? I love this movie so far. It's high class from the start. I think with the release of several similar movies in recent year I must say this one stands out from the rest. I love the humanistic vibes to this movie. The battles and sceneries were all high class and it adds the human compassion to it all. Believe me this movie has a lot of actions and fight scenes in it but it's really the human aspect and the story telling that drew me in. The two main characters in this movie Zhuge LiangTakeshi and Zhou YuTony Leung did a marvelous job of conveying pathos of war and peace. Pretty much all the cast actually did a very nice job. I love action scenes but I can pick on some fight scenes if I was picky but this movie is beyond reproach on some of these insignificant short falls. This is epic and I can't wait to see the 2nd part. This is really the prelude to the epic battle at red cliff but the build up was very nice. Reminds me of Lord of the Ring series in how it ended. Like the first part is the Two Tower and the second part is Return of the King. But unlike the Lord of the Ring which I think has one flaw the parallel story telling of Frodo Gollum and the rest of the fellowship. Yes I know I might be sacrilegious to the book but I felt the mental struggle of Frodo and Gollum detracted from the movie. Yes those two are main arc of the book but I don't think it translate well in the movie. If I were to make LOTR an epic I would cut out most of the Frodo and Gollum scene and it would be one of the best epic story of all time. I feel this movie is of similar quality and I hope part 2 will live up to the part 1 and then some in terms of battle scope. Can't wait for it to come out. I am expecting Return of the King kind of battle. Thanks to all the cast and John Woo for such a good movie. I will buy when it goes on blueray. Bravo!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to my previous knowledge on Sangokushi or Three Kingdom Saga in Ancient China I enjoyed the outstanding performance and the dynamic war scenes. The movie also succeeded to dramatizing Sun Tzu's The Art of War. It was exhilarating to see outnumbered allies made full use of the strategy and fought against their common enemies and ran a dead heat.Usually I do not expect story or drama stuff being described in the action movies but Red Cliff betrayed my expectation in a good sense. There were several scenes that touched my heart. For example two genius war generals who belong to different lords met for the first time and they instantly understood that they were hardtoget friends by playing musical instruments together without using any tricks or politics.In a newspaper article a veteran charismatic movie buyer from Avex had foretold Red Cliff would take academy awards right after he finished reading the script. Though his hitting ration was high I was not sure if he would raise his ratio and salary in the future. But I was sure that Tony Leon had a dominating presence through the scenes and it was highly possible that he would be nominated in his acting.Actually I saw a lady stood up to go to the rest room during the highlight and some left before the end roll skipping the trailer of part two and after the trailer I heard a girl behind me complain against her excited boyfriend about dozens of characters who had lost her. I thought some previous knowledge would be important to fully enjoy this historic war movie.Basically the movie was created for everyone because John Woo focused on the battle of red cliffs which was one of the best highlights in the saga cleverly avoiding another digest version. Also there was a brief explanation about history and people at the beginning being accompanied by easytounderstand Japanese subtitles crafted by Natsuko Toda. Personally I wanted to give my big hug to John Woo actors and actresses all the staffs and their accomplishment Red Cliff Part One.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I am a huge fan of ROTK I've read the complete unabridged novel. I was very excited for this movie I've always thought ROTK needed a big screen adaptation. Comparing the novel with the movie though the movie lacked the excitement tension irony and romance that the novel had.After the first fight scene which contained one of the most memorable scenes from the novel and the movie the fight scenes and their choreography got way too repetitive which coupled with the 30 minute long battle scenes I had myself thinking ah this isn't as good as I thought when will they be done with all this repetitive glaive chinese spear stabbing crap? When the fight scenes were finally done the political intrigue wasn't as enticing as I had hoped either. I was really hoping for Zhuge Liang to be built up as the superhuman genius from the novel I was really looking forward to the movie walking the viewer through his brilliant thinking and tactics like the novel did. The novel did such a wonderful job of showing how clever Zhuge Liang was. He was always one step ahead of his enemies and his friends he always knew what they were thinking in the novel and when you thought he lost his mind and made the worst move possible later on you'd realize he really made an ingenious move and took everything into account with his battle strategies and tactics. The movie didn't show as much of his brilliant planning as I had hoped. To build up tension and excitement for the fight scenes and to make them truly exciting and to make the viewer feel the flow of a battle I think showing Zhuge Liang's ingenious planning is absolutely necessary the movie lacked this.What they did show was a bunch of love scenes with Zhou Yu and his wife and Cao Cao and his mistress. I mean c'mon a love scene gets like one paragraph in the novel and Zhuge Liang's meticulous planning gets like 50 chapters but in the movie we get more screen time of characters feeling each other up than seeing Zhuge Liang larger than life exploits. You also get a lot of screen time for Sun Shang Xiang they've made her a critical part of the movie and she actually participates in the battles I thought this seemed a little silly and it took away from the urgency of the battles at least when compared to the novel. I thought they could have done such a better job with the battle scenes actually all of the scenes. I guess we'll have to wait for another adaptation for ROTK to get the treatment it deserves.".

I have watched Daniel Lee's Three Kingdoms Resurrection of the Dragon and it is just average. I have only seen one movie based on the Romance of the three kingdom. John Woo makes his comeback as a director after so many years. I think it is worth the wait for his highly anticipated movie.The story In Singapore the movie is split into two parts. The second part will be shown next year. This movie is an introduction to the Romance of the three kingdom. The first war starts when the movie starts to hype up those craving to see some good war battles. After the first war you will get introduction of the characters slowly. After the slightly slow pace you are treated to another war. The acting is good with the humour. I think model Lin Chiling should be given some credit as she marks the first acting debut in a Chinese blockbuster.Overall It has both the talk and the action. I must say that it is one of the recently interesting war movies with extended war battle unlike the other recent war movies. It should be good to watch it in cinema. This movie is good for those who want to know about the Chinese history or those who want to see the Chinese history in action.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title may simply be titled Red Cliff but the Battle of Red Cliff was a decisive battle in Chinese history that was fought after the Han Dynasty. And the whole 2 movies revolves around this one grand battle. I never found John Woo to be a director that makes a movie with great plots but what he does excel at is in the action and this movie definitely delivers in the action department although not as much as I expected. The battle scenes were well choreographed some of the flaws in this film is that it has unnecessary scenes that drag this movie when the time can be used effectively more on the actual history other characters and more of what went down. I thought the actors did a good job especially Takeshi Kaneshiro which was a shocker but he played his character very charismatically. But that is also another flaw of the movie they only delve into only a handful of characters and the rest that contributed a lot to the war just seem like cardboard. John Woo may not be a good screen writer but besides the battle the other scenes just dragged the film and although few were very good. You will need some patience to sit through the whole movie maybe I expected too much cause I was left disappointed. There was lack of tension and even the direction and development to be lacking. Despite the flaws the budget really showed in this film with it's sufficient battle scenes. Some that isn't really into the adaptation of popular Chinese history will find this movie sort of boring. I am going to say it a lot of people who are fans of Dynasty Warriors a video game series at least found this movie to be amusing.7.210".

	schema:reviewBody "I usually try to take note of movie publicity because expectations justifiably and inevitably shapes appreciation but I didn't connect the dots when John Woo said he wanted to make an upbeat movie about the historical battle at Chi Bi literally Red Cliff by the Yangtze River in the winter of 208 CE and aimed to reach the level of Troy 2004. I mean how do you make an upbeat warhistorical movie unless it is some kind of fantasy or comedy where the violencepolitics won't really trouble you? And apart from the size of its production and budget Troy doesn't really set any admirable standard in filmmaking....In short I found this movie interesting though neither enjoyable or unbearable. So this movie may be worth your time money if you want to see John Woo have fun with a historical event or the sight of certain actors in period costumeroles  just don't expect a new movie classic even the fun or comedy is nothing special or John Woo to rise above his level gunfight style editing. This is because having some idea about the events at Chi Bi I couldn't help noticing that John Woo's Chi Bi doesn't really build on let alone measure up to the prevailing classics inspiredinfluenced by the historical battle i.e. the 14th century novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms still reprinted annually the 1990s CCTV drama series based on the novel now on DVD or the computervideo games Dynasty Warriors etc. currently in their 10n'th versions etc..That is to say it doesn't have the epic sense of tight plotting in the novel rounded characterization in the TV series or audacious fun of the games etc. and for almost every good or workable new idea in the movie and there is some kind of misstep which undermines it so that the whole is less than the sum of its parts. This might have something to do with the way John Woo went around commissioning separate scripts NOT rewrites for the movie and then combining the bits that he liked no legalcopyright issue here since the writers were all duly paid and credited right up till the time shooting was scheduled to begin when Chow YunFat purportedly left the production because he did not have a complete script. For exampleWARNING SPOILERS AHEAD1 Zhuge Liang dusting himself off in Sun Quan's court and raising a cloud of dust would have shown how far and fast he had traveled but only showed that he was too scatterbrained to dust himself off properly before entering.2 Zhou Yu stopping military training to listen to a flute would have shown how highly he regarded music but also made his military training look sloppy.3 Sun Quan hunting a tiger would have shown the hunter's courage if only there was the budget or effects to show a sufficiently fearsome tiger.4 Liu Bei making shoes for his swornbrothers and saying he's used to it would have shown his humble beginnings as a shoemaker except what does being used to it mean?5  so on and so forth....If this sounds like a bad case of mixing Hollywood practices with the HK directors' habit of shooting from the hip or simply John Woo biting off more than he can chew well it shows in the lack of an established sense of flow scale or depth. The scenes move from point A to C and characters X to Z in a way that feels like a series of movie highlights with the overall result resembling more the kind of costume drama commonly produced by the Chinese film industry rather than any significant milestone other than the size of its production and budget in Chinese moviemaking. Not that oldfashioned HKJohn Woostyled Chinese costume drama is necessarily a bad thing of course I mean it's literally asking to be laughed at spoofed the humor is that obvious.".

	schema:reviewBody "After John Woo's poor running in Hollywood particularly with PayCheck starring Ben Affleck the seasoned Hong Kong director seemed to be humbled returning back to film making for the Chinese cinema. With Hard Boiled and The Killer being some of his early directorial achievements Red Cliff may well be the his next Asian hit.The story is based primarily on the historical records of the Chronicles Of The Three Kingdom with the plot involving the famous Battle Of The Red Cliffs 208 AD in Ancient China.The epic's chief villain is the infamous Cao Cao Zhang Fengyi Prime Minister of the Eastern Han Dynasty who after seizing much power through manipulation and force went on to fight against the righteous warlord Liu Bei and his loyal subjects including sworn brothers Zhang Fei Zang Jisheng and Guan Yu Ba Sen Zha Bu and general Zhao Yun Hu Jun.In desperation Liu Bei enlisted the help of the brilliant strategist Zhuge Liang Takeshi Kaneshiro to persuade Sun Quan Chang Chen Emperor of Eastern Wu into an alliance before Cao Cao's army could completely eliminate his forces. The ensuring event led to the important battle in the Three Kingdom's records.The stellar cast for Red Cliff also included Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Sun Quan's loyal strategist Zhou Yu one of the lead characters in the movie.Supporting roles are played by Zhao Wei as the warrior princess and sister of Sun Quan Sun Shangxiang. Taiwanese sex symbol Lin Chiling starred as Zhou Yu's wife Xiao Qiao who's historically famous for her extraordinary beauty that attracts even the lusty attention of Cao Cao. Overall the roster of mostly Chinese stars for the exception of Japanese celebrity Nakamura Shido as Gan Xing general of Zhou Yu succeeds in bringing Three Kingdom's character's to life.Of course what's an ancient epic without the necessary swordandbow battle scenes? Red Cliff's moments of bloodshed involving spear bearing soldiers and armour clad warriors is the main entertainment obvious reminiscent of fierce combat seen in contemporary Hollywood films of past years including The Lord Of The Rings Kingdom Of Heaven and even 300 the Three Kingdom plot's also about a numerically inferior force against a bigger army.However the cinematography decently done though could have improved further..... much much further. Shortcomings in this department have hindered Red Cliff from achieving an overall result of an excellent historical epic.Lack of tension can be felt in story's development of the road to allout war lacking even in one key scene when Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu attempt to predict Cao Cao's strategy just as the latter was doing it at the same time or in another when Sun Quan was hunting a cunning tiger. Parts of the tiger hunt scene has suspicious signs of footages being borrowed from a wildlife TV program and the progress of other scenes are hampered by unnecessary transitional wipes which bear faint reminders of George Lucas' Star Wars. Maybe that's what Woo's getting on but it's just not working well.Cinematography for Red Cliff's violent melee is also not working to the best of expectations.There's a sufficient handful of moments when lone highly skilled warriors engaged against a bigger number of weaker grunts but other than the usual blade clashes and the liberal spillage of blood there's not much of an excitement in all these. The actions feel old drained of fresh ideas and if you are to believe it the movie's saving grace probably lies in the solid casting and the fact that Red Cliff's a faithful adaptation of popular Chinese history.Still because the current Asian screening of Red Cliff is only part one of a supposedly four hour long movie it might depend on the later half reported to be released in January 2009 to complete Red Cliff as the epic it's meant to be.".

Liu Bei sent the talented Zhuge Liang to Eastern Wu to persuade Sun Quan and his best righthand man Zhou Yu. Although Zhou Yu felt that Zhuge Liang along with ShuHan will be a future threat to Eastern Wu he decided to form alliance for the time being with ShuHan to resist the invasion by Cao Cao. The battle took place in a pass on the Yangtze River called Chi Bi AKA Red Cliffs.John Woo did a fantastic job in portraying the characters in the book of Romance of the Three Kingdoms all the actors and actresses are the best in the contemporary Chinese cinematographic circle the battle scenes are great and this movie is the highest budge film in the Chinese film industry to date. It is a MUST see if you are interested in the Chinese history.".

	schema:reviewBody "To me this movie is a big overhype disappointment! Romance of Three Kingdoms is such great story based on history and the Battle of Red Cliff is THE MAJOR EVENT! I was very much looking forward for this movie but I guess John Woo is just not Peter Jackson! I would have thought he should have learned a lot from his Hollywood experience. Turn out that my opinion of him as an overhype average Hong Kong director is right on just like Tsui Hak! First major problem is the script! Instead of follow the original story which is already full of detail they added in many unnecessary elements such as Zhou Yu help his wife deliver a horse! According to John Woo over a TV interview in Singapore it supposed to make Zhou appear more human but the whole scene is just so pretentious!The part of Zhou Yu and ZhuGe Liang playing musical instrument and the final battle scene was also overly long OK this part is just like Peter Jackson King Kong dinosaur stampede scene!! It just go on and on and I was really bored! There were just too many pacing problems in this movie. It could easily trim by 30 minutes instead of 150 minutes of boredom! The kind of problem commonly happened to Hong Kong movie. The script obviously written by some Hong Kong scriptwriter!Some reviewers said there was element of brotherhood just like many other John Woo movies. To me the brotherhood element in Red Cliff is paperthin!As for the music score it just sounded too Japanese! HELLO! It supposed to be Chinese Classical Story! And the beating drum just sounded too much like Crouching Tiger score by Tan Dun.Special CGI effect of Red Cliff is passable but the concept is certainly very wrong! Red Cliff is part of the Yangtze River and it's so broad you can't really see the other shore! Red Cliff production designer decided instead to make it look more like scenic Guilin in Guangxi which is totally wrong! It certainly looks quite narrow for big naval battle!Action choreography was boring and stupid sometime! Action choreographer Corey Yuen seem not sure whether to design it as fantasy martial art form or realistic martial art form and some scene is just ridiculous! Maybe they think audience taste is still stuck in the 70's Shaw Bros era! Most generals should be fighting while riding horses but instead they walk and fight most of the time! Maybe they should be equipping their actors with better riding scale or use a stunt doubles!Actor wise mainland actor Zhang FengYi as Cao Cao was the only outstanding one. Tony Leung Chiu Wai appeared tired. Takeshi Kaneshiro looked full of confident to the point of almost clueless! Lin ChiLing was more like a flower vase! The rest of the casts were just passable. Maybe there weren't much chances for them to shine as characterization were poor overall.Red Cliff is an overall disappointment either as drama or action movie! If one really interested in Romance of Three Kingdom go read the book or maybe rent or buy the China made series! Even the Japan made anime Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi is much better!And I certainly won't waste my money for the Red Cliff part II!".

	schema:headline " Tries to be too many things fails at all of them";
	schema:reviewBody "You'd be hard pressed to find a better example of a film ruined by trying to be too many things to too many people than Red Riding Hood which opens Friday and by all rights should close Saturday.The most obvious audience Hood hopes to attract is fans of the Twilight film series snagging the director of the first film Catherine Hardwicke and refashioning the Little Red Riding Hood folk tale into in a remarkably halfhearted way a love triangle between three extraordinarily uninteresting characters. If all three had been eaten by the wolf in the first act we might have been onto something.What's weird about Hood which inexplicably counts Leonardo DiCaprio as one of its producers stick to swimming in icy water Leo is that this romantic angle is not its main thrust. It doesn't have a main thrust.In fact for a supposedly sexier take on a classic folk tale it's in desperate need of thrust in general.It flits around the idea of being a more adult folk tale but never commits. It throws in a bit of pretty bad CGI werewolf attack action from time to time but it's nowhere near violent or bloody enough it's PG13 to interest action or horror fans. It has moments of campy fun specifically every second Gary Oldman appears as a sinister Cardinal Richelieutype character but other scenes are played ridiculously straight.Perhaps the film's biggest mistake  and that's saying something  is structuring itself like a Scream film. The Big Bad Wolf is indeed a werewolf and our sweet little Red named Valerie played by Amanda Seyfried has to figure out which of her fellow villagers turns into a beast when the moon is full. Is it her forbidden love the dull as dishwater Peter Shiloh Fernandez who presumably equates to the hunter of the folk tale? Or is it the man she's been arranged to marry the somehow even duller Henry Max Irons? Or is it one the other remarkably dull villagers? And given how dull Valerie is who the hell really cares?On looks alone Seyfried perhaps is perfectly cast as Red considering Christina Ricci might be a bit too old for the role. Seyfried's pristine alabaster skin and enormous eyes give Red just the right look but every time she opens her mouth you're begging for that werewolf to put her out of our misery.To be fair no actor could be expected to excel given the cheesy dialogue and Hardwicke's uninspired direction solid veterans such as Virginia Madsen Julie Christie and Lukas Haas struggle to make an impression with Christie holding up the best. As Red's father Billy Burke seems more zoned out than James Franco at the Oscars suggesting he's only here for one more Twilight connection.Only Oldman acquits himself well simply because he treats the film as the campfest it should have been from the opening credits. He's acting in an entirely different movie a Sam Raimi romp like Army of Darkness or Drag Me to Hell and Red Riding Hood briefly becomes almost fun during Oldman's most animated scenes.The film doesn't even look that great in a technical sense The exteriors look fake all clearly shot on soundstages and not fake in an intentional this is a dreamy heightened reality because this is a folk tale way. They look fake in a we really suck at our jobs way.Red Riding Hood is pretending to be a darker more adult take on the folk tale but it's hardly the first Neil Jordan mined the territory in 1984 with the Rrated The Company of Wolves focusing more on sexual metaphors and heavy werewolf action. It wasn't great but at least it knew what it wanted to be. Red Riding Hood tries to be a little bit of everything but ultimately it succeeds only in being a tedious mess.".

	onyx:emotionText "You'd be hard pressed to find a better example of a film ruined by trying to be too many things to too many people than Red Riding Hood which opens Friday and by all rights should close Saturday.The most obvious audience Hood hopes to attract is fans of the Twilight film series snagging the director of the first film Catherine Hardwicke and refashioning the Little Red Riding Hood folk tale into in a remarkably halfhearted way a love triangle between three extraordinarily uninteresting characters. If all three had been eaten by the wolf in the first act we might have been onto something.What's weird about Hood which inexplicably counts Leonardo DiCaprio as one of its producers stick to swimming in icy water Leo is that this romantic angle is not its main thrust. It doesn't have a main thrust.In fact for a supposedly sexier take on a classic folk tale it's in desperate need of thrust in general.It flits around the idea of being a more adult folk tale but never commits. It throws in a bit of pretty bad CGI werewolf attack action from time to time but it's nowhere near violent or bloody enough it's PG13 to interest action or horror fans. It has moments of campy fun specifically every second Gary Oldman appears as a sinister Cardinal Richelieutype character but other scenes are played ridiculously straight.Perhaps the film's biggest mistake  and that's saying something  is structuring itself like a Scream film. The Big Bad Wolf is indeed a werewolf and our sweet little Red named Valerie played by Amanda Seyfried has to figure out which of her fellow villagers turns into a beast when the moon is full. Is it her forbidden love the dull as dishwater Peter Shiloh Fernandez who presumably equates to the hunter of the folk tale? Or is it the man she's been arranged to marry the somehow even duller Henry Max Irons? Or is it one the other remarkably dull villagers? And given how dull Valerie is who the hell really cares?On looks alone Seyfried perhaps is perfectly cast as Red considering Christina Ricci might be a bit too old for the role. Seyfried's pristine alabaster skin and enormous eyes give Red just the right look but every time she opens her mouth you're begging for that werewolf to put her out of our misery.To be fair no actor could be expected to excel given the cheesy dialogue and Hardwicke's uninspired direction solid veterans such as Virginia Madsen Julie Christie and Lukas Haas struggle to make an impression with Christie holding up the best. As Red's father Billy Burke seems more zoned out than James Franco at the Oscars suggesting he's only here for one more Twilight connection.Only Oldman acquits himself well simply because he treats the film as the campfest it should have been from the opening credits. He's acting in an entirely different movie a Sam Raimi romp like Army of Darkness or Drag Me to Hell and Red Riding Hood briefly becomes almost fun during Oldman's most animated scenes.The film doesn't even look that great in a technical sense The exteriors look fake all clearly shot on soundstages and not fake in an intentional this is a dreamy heightened reality because this is a folk tale way. They look fake in a we really suck at our jobs way.Red Riding Hood is pretending to be a darker more adult take on the folk tale but it's hardly the first Neil Jordan mined the territory in 1984 with the Rrated The Company of Wolves focusing more on sexual metaphors and heavy werewolf action. It wasn't great but at least it knew what it wanted to be. Red Riding Hood tries to be a little bit of everything but ultimately it succeeds only in being a tedious mess.";

The said massacres being caused by a werewolf and the said question being who the wolf is. But as I watched it the question that kept on running through my mind was not who the wolf was but rather who cares who the wolf was? This is a very flabbyfooted selfdelusional mess of a movie that succeeds in making even the great Gary Oldman look as unnatural in his performance as Steven Seagal.Red Riding Hood suffers from a poorlyconstructed screenplay one that seems was written within a handful of days and not given a single second of revision. The writer David Johnson was a production assistant on Frank Darabont's masterpiece The Shawshank Redemption but his talents seem to be more focused on polishing up a movie rather than spinning up a story. The plot of Red Riding Hood is contrived flat and lacking any zest. In fact even though the denouement has great potential to be a real shocker and I'll be honest caught me by surprise it was handled and executed so sloppily and the writing that summarizes it all up was so flimsy and manipulative that it registered no impact on me whatsoever.There are no characters worth caring about and next to nothing in terms of acting. The titular character is played by an upandcoming starlet by the name of Amanda Seyfried although if all of her performances are as uncharismatic and dull as this one I cannot imagine why. In this performance at least she did not strike me as being a natural actress. Then again she has nothing to work with in Mr. Johnson's screenplay. She also has two romantic interests one played by Max Irons and the other by a woodenfaced Shiloh Fernandez. They are just as boring as their characters. They have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever with Miss Seyfried I never felt any passion. Even Gary Oldman so good so many times before is awful here hamming up and chewing apart every scene that he is in. His introductory moment where he explains his experiences with werewolves is handled by him in a way that is so overthetop almost like a really bad vaudeville performance. It's hard to believe that this is the same actor from The Dark Knight The Book of Eli and the Harry Potter movies.If there is one good performance at all it is by Julie Christie who is just as magnetic and wonderful as she was when she graced the screen in David Lean's Doctor Zhivago fortysix years ago. She has a powerful star presence and quality that allows her to overcome even the trashy dialogue and nothingness that she was supplied.Another strike against the movie is the apparent lack of experience by its director Catherine Hardwicke. She was a production designer before this movie she designed the wonderful town reconstruction for Tombstone in 1993 but her skills with a motion picture camera are next to nothing. She doesn't seem to even know the basics about misc en scene and how to structure a sequence. Not even enough to know that a moment where Mr. Oldman gives a last minute warning to a stubborn old villager about the impending threat of the werewolf that she should have had a reverse angle to show the villager's reaction instead she chooses to stick to the back of his head. There is no steady flow of images here with too many medium and long shots and closeups so claustrophobic that they enter the territory of being loony. One scene that was directed particularly badly was a laughable love moment between Miss Seyfriend and Mr. Fernandez. There is a problem with a romantic moment where the sight of two people making love is neither heartwarming nor obviously erotic.But Miss Hardwicke did coordinate well with her production designer for the sets are quite good. And the special effects are decent enough in and of themselves. The werewolf computergenerated of course are much better than the cartoony wolves I saw in Season of the Witch earlier this year. It's only a shame that that wolf was not onscreen more.Red Riding Hood has a feel of so many medieval melodramas of recent years halfhearted and flimsy. It is also crippled by that haunting feeling that even the people who made the movie would not even want to see it. It feels like an assignment done by people hopelessly unhappy in their work who just wanted to get through the dailies so they could go home and relax before getting up to do the same thing again the next day.".

Not even enough to know that a moment where Mr. Oldman gives a last minute warning to a stubborn old villager about the impending threat of the werewolf that she should have had a reverse angle to show the villager's reaction instead she chooses to stick to the back of his head. There is no steady flow of images here with too many medium and long shots and closeups so claustrophobic that they enter the territory of being loony. One scene that was directed particularly badly was a laughable love moment between Miss Seyfriend and Mr. Fernandez. There is a problem with a romantic moment where the sight of two people making love is neither heartwarming nor obviously erotic.But Miss Hardwicke did coordinate well with her production designer for the sets are quite good. And the special effects are decent enough in and of themselves. The werewolf computergenerated of course are much better than the cartoony wolves I saw in Season of the Witch earlier this year. It's only a shame that that wolf was not onscreen more.Red Riding Hood has a feel of so many medieval melodramas of recent years halfhearted and flimsy. It is also crippled by that haunting feeling that even the people who made the movie would not even want to see it. It feels like an assignment done by people hopelessly unhappy in their work who just wanted to get through the dailies so they could go home and relax before getting up to do the same thing again the next day.";

I am not a fan of the Twilight moviesthe first of which Catherine Hardwicke also directed and it didn't look like my kind of film. But I saw it for the wonderful Gary Oldman.I wasn't expecting much and I didn't get much. Red Riding Hoodnot the fairytale by the way does try hard to be a lot of things including introducing a number of horror fantasy and mystery elements. But due to the sluggish pace and disjointed story structurethat is full of overlong filler particularly the celebration scene and the dream sequence was very awkwardly placed the film fails at pretty much all these elements.The script is very clunky underdeveloped and banal as well. A lot of it did not keep my attention and I found myself chuckling into my coke at any unintentionally funny bits. The CGI is quite poor here with the wolf looking as though it was done in a hurry. Hardwicke's direction never rises above mediocre the editing is unfocused and frenzied and the three titular characters are incredibly dull and uninteresting with the romantic elements between them poorly written and directed.The acting doesn't fare much better. Amanda Seyfried is pretty but bland in the title role and shows little or no chemistry with her costars while Max Ironsson of Jeremy Lukas Haas and Shiloh Fernandez show good looks but awkward line delivery. Virginia Madsen and Billy Burke are both wasted both overdoing it in a valiant attempt to elevate their weak materialthese two actors probably had the worst of the dialogue next to the leads actually. And the climax is little more than a mangled mess and devoid of depth.Despite these many cons there are some decent assets. The score is atmospheric enough and the costume and set design are spot on. Plus there are two good performances Gary Oldman and Julie Christie. Oldman does chew the scenery but he looks as though he's having a ball while Christie is very enchanting.Overall not terrible but deeply flawed and overambitious. 410 Bethany Cox".

My wife and I were discussing what to watch one night and it seemed there was nothing immediate to catch our attention so after a little discussion we decided on this film. She said I like fairy Tales and you like Amand Seyfried so let's watch this one it was decided. This is a spin on the classic fairy tale little red riding hood as you may have suspected. RRH takes place in an old style village where there is a history of a Werewolf killing civilians for no reason. This has been going on for years and the village continuously leaves animal sacrifices to keep it at bay but this time he killed a young girl out after curfew why was she out this is where the story starts to unfold.It seems everyone including the werewolf wanted to eat Valerie Little Red Amanda Seyfried and to that I respond Can you blame them? There is some sort of love triangle sub plot that is terrible but it helps divert attention to different wolf suspects. In steps Solomon Gary Oldman as a religious werewolf hunter who has lost his family and has an ax to grind with the wolf. Solomon knows for some reason the Werewolf is among them and uses his deduction tactics to isolate the threats killing and threatening anyone in his path. He is basically a mad priest. So basically the whole movie you are guessing who the Wolf is? Well who is it? I will not tell you you will have to watch it to find out or Google it.This movie was terrible and the only bright spot was Amanda Seyfried not her acting but. Gary Oldman was almost bad in this one also no he was bad but I think it was a bad role choice rather than bad acting. There was a strange face in the village that I had not seen for some time and that was boy star Lukas Haas who seems to be trying to make a comeback. He has been seen in Inception and Red Riding Hood recently Inception being a good choice and RRH a bad one. I do wish Haas some luck and I am always rooting for child stars to not go insane and at least function in society.".

Her entire selfidentity is determined by which of them she chooses and she doesn't actually have sex with either one. Also the movie was directed by Catherine Hardwicke.It isn't what you thought if you figured it out but it is close. Replace the leading candidate's vampirism with lycanthropy and Twilight becomes Red Riding Hood. Hardwicke has remade her first film minus the brand name and the results are equally unappealing. Still the lack of originality extends even further. This is one of almost twenty film versions of the titular short story and the fourth horror movie adaption. Of said films only Neil Jordan's The Company of Wolves does something innovative with the material by subverting it as a metaphor for adolescent sexuality.This version of the story is fodder for Twilight fans who are anticipating Breaking Dawn. It takes place in a nondescript village that could never have existed. White sand substituting for snow covers the ground and poorlyrendered CG snowflakes fall in the air. This production design mimics a snow globe and its inhabitants are as three dimensional as figures you see living in snow globes. The residents speak contemporary U.S. English which bears no relevance to the source material. The story is mostly remembered as a Grimm fairy tale so it could have been set in Germany or even France where it was first published.

	schema:reviewBody "How did this movie get so many bad reviews? I thought this movie was great since it successfully played with people's emotions. Even from the very starting with the shot of the beautiful village the film got me interested. And it kept me interested until the very ending.Let me just say that I enjoyed the romance factor that this movie had. It was sort of clich but I liked it! I was kind of wishing that it didn't end the way it did though. Oh well. It was still great.This movie reminded me of 'The Village'. They kind of have the same premise. The town is being terrorized by some sort of being and all the villagers are scared. I'm just glad that this movie had a better conclusion and ending than 'The Village' had.My only complaint was how they kept on publicizing the fact that the director of 'Twilight' was the one who directed this film. Because of that I couldn't help but compare the two movies when it came to the characters and the romance storyline. Both films had a girl as the main character who had two guys fighting for her. The only differences with the characters from both films were that the heroine in this movie kicked ass and this time the better guy loses.The best thing about this movie is the suspense and mystery that it gives. My guesses of who the wolf was kept on changing throughout the whole film. I checked the rating of this movie a while ago before I went off to the movie theater and saw that it ranked really low below 5.0. I thought the reason for the low rating was because the identity of the wolf was really obvious from the trailer itself and there was no need to watch this movie. BUT the thing is the wolf isn't who you think it is! The movie incriminates and makes you suspect everyone in the town. I honestly did no expect the conclusion. That's what makes this a great movie.Don't listen to the naysayers. Just keep in mind that this isn't a horror movie as the trailers portray it to be. It's a sort of mystery with some sort of romance mixed into it. Give it a try. And don't get brainwashed by those unbelievably harsh critics.".

The town is being terrorized by some sort of being and all the villagers are scared. I'm just glad that this movie had a better conclusion and ending than 'The Village' had.My only complaint was how they kept on publicizing the fact that the director of 'Twilight' was the one who directed this film. Because of that I couldn't help but compare the two movies when it came to the characters and the romance storyline. Both films had a girl as the main character who had two guys fighting for her. The only differences with the characters from both films were that the heroine in this movie kicked ass and this time the better guy loses.The best thing about this movie is the suspense and mystery that it gives. My guesses of who the wolf was kept on changing throughout the whole film. I checked the rating of this movie a while ago before I went off to the movie theater and saw that it ranked really low below 5.0. I thought the reason for the low rating was because the identity of the wolf was really obvious from the trailer itself and there was no need to watch this movie. BUT the thing is the wolf isn't who you think it is! The movie incriminates and makes you suspect everyone in the town. I honestly did no expect the conclusion. That's what makes this a great movie.Don't listen to the naysayers. Just keep in mind that this isn't a horror movie as the trailers portray it to be. It's a sort of mystery with some sort of romance mixed into it. Give it a try. And don't get brainwashed by those unbelievably harsh critics.";

She does have a good casting concept however with Julie Christie Virginia Madsen and Amanda Seyfried as three generations of the same family. There is a distinct resemblance among them. But this marvelous potential is pretty much wasted. Gary Oldman carries his weight well as Father Solomon a priest with colorful trappings who comes to the village to destroy the werewolf who threatens it. Billy Burke is very interesting to look at as the title character's father but he too is given little to do. Seyfried and her romantic leads Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons who looks and sounds nothing like his famous father Jeremy get to look pretty and add another notch to their youthful resumes. There is no suspense at all despite the formality of medieval villagers fearfully wondering who among them is a wolfman in disguise. It's all very similar to another bloated boring CGIdependent medieval fantasy from the 90's Dragonheart which also featured Julie Christie in a matriarchal context wearing flowing garments. The camera swoops down and jiggles through the cotton candy gingerbread housestyle set to the accompaniment of the usual synthesized swooshes inducing yawn after yawn kind of like leafing through a perfumed issue of Vanity Fair while you're waiting to get your teeth cleaned. Movies are becoming increasingly indistinguishable from the overpriced candy bars sold in the lobbies of the soulless venues in which they are shown.".

It seems like the entire script has been written spontaneously along the filming rushing everything into an undefinable genre. What is this film? Watching the cover the trailer and the rumors about this film it seemed to be quite of a thriller. There was not a single thrilling scary or intense scene at all. The action scenes with the random wolf who never manages to scare you at all was completely random and was over within seconds. The romantic genre this movie also suddenly wants to embrace is also a complete fail. I feel nothing passionate or intense among any on the three actors who are supposed to be in a love triangle. All three characters are very random and we never get to know any of them leaving the audience to feel no care or interest in them. Who cares if one of them gets killed by a wolf? Not me. The fact that the whole cover is covered with the grand name Gary Oldman is also ridiculous considering the fact that he also was a random factor in this film running around the poorly made village sets screaming something about killing the wolf but that you as an audience never really catch or even cares about. And then he proceeds to die just as random as he lived. At the end of the film I was left with an empty almost angry feeling that I've been cheated and that this film stole my precious time and my money. It left me with NOTHING. No thrills no romance no laughs no wise morality or any admiration for good actingdirectingetc. This film was so random and awful that I can't even express it enough... I'm so sorry Amanda Seyfried I really admire your beautiful persona but this film is not a proud moment in your career.".

All three characters are very random and we never get to know any of them leaving the audience to feel no care or interest in them. Who cares if one of them gets killed by a wolf? Not me. The fact that the whole cover is covered with the grand name Gary Oldman is also ridiculous considering the fact that he also was a random factor in this film running around the poorly made village sets screaming something about killing the wolf but that you as an audience never really catch or even cares about. And then he proceeds to die just as random as he lived. At the end of the film I was left with an empty almost angry feeling that I've been cheated and that this film stole my precious time and my money. It left me with NOTHING. No thrills no romance no laughs no wise morality or any admiration for good actingdirectingetc. This film was so random and awful that I can't even express it enough... I'm so sorry Amanda Seyfried I really admire your beautiful persona but this film is not a proud moment in your career.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let's start with the fact that I'm not a Twilight hater. I've read the book they were OK. But the movies were horrible but not as horrible as this one. I've read some reviews but I thought I'll give it a try because I really like Amanda Seyfried. Unfortunately no matter how much I like her It was a bad movie. Let me explain the big issues 1. Red Moon. Have you seen anywhere a red moon? Nope you have not. Why ? Because there's no such thing AS A RED MOON. 2. The snow. The snow is white cold and does not look like sand. And you cannot simulate snow with sand. Period. And from this comes item nr. 3 3. This village is supposed to be set in the middle of the mountains and after a heavy snowing It's supposed to be damn cold. Well that's not a problem for Mr. Edward ehmm.. excuse me Harry I guess I did not bother remembering his name or the rest of the metrosexually dressed young lumber jacks. They are dressed in the movie as if it's as much as in autumn with their chest showing out just like in Twilight  Dear Catherine maybe you grew up in Florinda and you haven't seen any snow. The snow usually appears when there is damn cold outside. And you have to dress up in that season. And yes you can see your breath when you are outside. But not in this movie of course. 4. The acting of the characters is quite good well Edward.. ehmmm lumber jack should exercise a little more but the script is so awful and meaningless that even with a good acting you cannot mask that. 5. I forgot about the windows. M'am good work there. You've used blurred windows so then you don't have to worry about the exterior when shooting from inside. Butin one scene if you look out on the window outside is light then in the next scene after the villagers come out from the pub the windows shutters are closed. Good job where is the light coming from then ? 6. The wolf. It's Jacob. A little bit smaller but still him. And he talks of course. And looks awful just like in Twilight. The same crappy CGI. Well there are more... but I guess i've made my point. People don't waste your money. If you want to see Amanda go watch MammaMia.".

Some work  some don't work that well as evidenced by the fact that many IMDb'ers want to talk about why some of the gags don't 'feel right' or seem to 'take too long'.

But we had a few chuckles in this one if not a bunch of sustained belly laughs.Everyone says we should stop comparing Steve Martin to Peter Sellers but if you watched the original films how can you stop comparing? Sellers created this character just as Atkinson created Mr. Bean and Cleese created Basil Fawlty. And Steve Martin tries to do Sellers anyway his 'little yellow friend' line?. He can't quite pull it off and he hasn't really found a shtick that works. For one thing his eyes are always popping like he's trying to pass gas. Sellers' eyes were quiet. His Clouseau was genuinely 'clueless'. And I've mentioned elsewhere at IMDb that Sellers was a major Radio comedy star before doing films  that puts him in a league with Abbott  Costello Burns  Allen Bob Hope and Jack Benny. These guys built amazing gags that kept both live and radio audiences in stitches using wellconstructed devices such as bizarre characterizations rapid exchanges and nifty voices. Mr. Martin's roots in comedy are from a different  and later  era.Overall though if you need an amusing and harmless diversion go see this at the reducedprice theater.

He has faced some pretty amazing obstacles and he has stood in some pretty big shadows. Let's face it. Although his rendition of The OutofTowners was amusing he's no Jack Lemmon. While I LOVE his Sgt. Bilko portrayal he's not Phil Silvers. Cheaper by the Dozen wasn't horrible but he's not Clifton Webb either. He's Steve Martin.You may not appreciate his style of comedy but the Peter Sellersvenerated character of Inspector Jacques Clouseau made for the best use of Martin's prolific use of pratfalls ironic wit and in your face sarcasm than any other character he has tackled previously.But the character portrayed by Martin herein has something I never saw in Sellers' portrayal after the second installment...genuine heart. This is sweetly honest in its attempt. I feel that this will actually turn into a legitimate franchise reboot if the average moviegoer will stop attempting to compare Martin's Clouseau to Sellers' Clouseau. They are two different actors and Martin has stated to the point of nausea that he is NOT attempting to do Sellers' interpretation of the character! As far as the MOVIE goes it is sweet funny and enduring with a strong story a stronger relationship element and a great cast. I did not miss Kevin Kline nearly as much as I supposed I would. John Cleese was a perfect Dreyfus showing us the beginnings of Herbert Lom's trademark twitch when dealing with Clouseau. Very nice! I think when looking back Steve Martin's Jacques Clouseau will be remembered fondly by the new generations just as prior generations stubbornly cling to Sellers' character in spite of Martin's superior portrayal.All in all? I love it. It is an almost violencefree bloodfree honest attempt at a family film. This is great! and I cannot wait to get it into my collection.It rates an 8.410 from...the Fiend .".

The actors were like a surprise to me because I did not know about the cast. The only thing that made made make a face was the pronunciation from the beginning of the film mostly Mrs.Nicole made it too pronouncedof course they were french people but it was too much pointed out.The whole film was too goodI laughed with tearsthe audience was attentive everything went wellso good that I was not expected it I have the opinion that part 2 can not be as good as the 1st one.Regards!".

	schema:reviewBody "Hmmm. Does America really hate itself this much? I guess it does. I'll start off by saying how I'm not much of a fan of Peter Sellers Pink Panther let alone watching Steve Martin laugh himself to the bank with a couple of remakes I did not see the first. But alas I found myself in a theatre full of elderly people laughing and younger people walking out it was a free screening I don't much blame them and I envied my two friends who both said they fell asleep. I unfortunately kept awake in order to sit through theInspector Clouseau had the perfect adjectivesdrab and disgusting display on the big screen. It was obvious from the beginning overlong in the pacing and especially the repetitive beyond belief jokes and just plain sad for the big name actors involved many of whom I enjoy and some that I loveI'm talking to you Emily Mortimer. While others laughed I found myself yawning with a delicate slow moving pat of the mouth as though I was as stale as the script. Maybe my generation just can't understand this type of film but if that's so how could the first have warranted a sequel? We have the originals with a superstar in Sellers and yet we repackage for the youth of today? We need Hollywood to start taking control of the economy because they must be doing something right despite the utter absurdity of their decisions.It all started okayshort quick glimpses of priceless artifacts being stolen around the world. Maybe there'd be some seriousness to the comedy. Then came the obligatory look at the cartoon Pink Panther wreaking havoc in the opening credit sequence and the soon fun began. Ends up the stolen items were red herrings only brought out to hopefully let us understand the importance of the pink panther diamond. You see if that diamond could be spoken in the same breath as the Shroud of Turin it must be quite the hot item. And who is sworn to protect it you might ask? Well the imbecilic French of course I'm sure France LOVES these films headed by a Brit for whatever reason in John Cleese and the hero of the film Martin's bumbling Clouseau. We've seen this thing a million timesof course the idiot will idiotically stumble into solving the case it's just a matter of wading through the nonsense runtime padding until that fateful moment graces us with a conclusion. Hell even the American The Office uses this device every week no wonder it is a waterdowned facsimile of the British original.What does that padding consist of though? Credible guys like Alfred Molina Jean Reno and why oh why did he do it Jeremy Irons joining the ranks of hammy exserious actors like Andy Garcia and Lily Tomlin to make faces and fill the frame with reaction after reaction shot of Martin's shenanigans. If the film is good for anything it is using Aishwarya Rai's sexuality and introducing me to Yuki Matsuzaki who entertains for the most part. Otherwise it is all excruciatingly painful to watch mostly for the fact that you realize how little you make a year and how much they all made for doing practically no work on a film that will be thrown away after opening weekend and probably given a third installment.I really feel bad having very little in the way of backhanded praise for this film. I realize the amount of time and work put in yet can't help but think of how many other more important things that time could have been spent on. When you have to sit through a ten minute exchange between Martin and Tomlin of him checking out an attractive girl in the hall her calling him out him denying it her not believing and then him looking againrepeat  three more times you know that hell has arrived on earth. On top of that come lines like But I can't fly!! and an impromptu singalong manifested from a shampoo name JoJoBa pronounced HoHoBa you can imagine the worried looks to watches wondering how much longer it could go on. Yet there was laughter! I can't fathom it either. People ate some of this stuff up like it was the most hilarious thing they've seen since The Pink Panther 1. I guess I'm just out of touch or else just way too cynical and jaded. Either way if you are like me stay far far away at all costs.".

Yes the part with the Pope was a little over done. The Pink Panther seemed to a bit bigger than in the first movie and looks more like the one from the original films bigger.".

Thanks to Steve Martin's efforts the spirit of Peter Sellers work can live on through modernized takes on the energy and ingeniousness that this state of mind represents.I certainly think Steve Martin's Pink Panther 2 is better than his first attempt. It seems he has somewhat won a greater artistic freedom in creating this second movie as it seems the movie now has less Hollywoodmoments in it and is more about being a constant pure fun experience which is what Pink Panther movies should be about. Sure this is a commercial success especially in Europe and developing countries like India. Well I think that this is only a really great thing cause it should make it a natural thing for Steve Martin to then hopefully agree to make a few more Pink Panther movies and see if he can be even more crazy cool and funny in the next ones.'I was at the Danish premiere yesterday the cinema was far from being full as I think today's youth prefer Hollywood mega productions than witty humor. But I did notice that the people present in the cinema were laughing a lot more than people usually laugh in comedies. The laughing was sometimes really extreme with some certain people in the cinema me inclusive sometimes even laughing continuously for a minute. This is what The Pink Panther should be all about.Please Steve Martin if you read this please consider making another Pink Panther movie rather than to release another Banjo CED or whatever you were planning to do. And when you do please make sure that you and other creative people are in control of the show rather than the people that only think about continuity and Hollywood ethics and who sometimes end up slowing the rhythm down to make it less weird.

I am a big fan of the original movies. What Peter Sellers had that Steve Martin is lacking is the arrogance. I am talking about the arrogance Peter Sellers' Clouseau displayed when had just made a fool of himself. Nevertheless I think Steve Martin made a good Clouseau.

The impressive cast and grand locales almost manage to overcome Steve Martin's utterly horrendous impression of Peter Seller's infamously bumbling Inspector Clouseau but the trite gags and immature pranks tire quickly. A few laughs do find their way into the antics though perhaps more in pity than true amusement leaving part two on par with its deplorable predecessor.When notorious national treasure thief The Tornado returns from years of inactivity a group of the world's finest detectives are assembled to investigate. Due to the fame garnered from his past misadventures in recovering the priceless Pink Panther Diamond Inspector Clouseau Steve Martin is asked to lead the team of specialists including Vicenzo Andy Garcia Pepperidge Alfred Molina Kenji Yuki Matsuzaki and Tornado expert Sonia Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. With his unorthodox and clumsy method of sleuthing it's not long before Clouseau has publicly embarrassed the team of detectives and must now simultaneously regain his image and solve the mystery as well as attempting to foil the advances of Vicenzo on this longtime sweetheart Nicole Emily Mortimer.Obviously the best thing to come of Steve Martin's ludicrous sequel to a pathetic remake is the desire to watch the original Blake Edwards' Pink Panther movies of which there are plenty. In Martin's defense there is something momentarily amusing about adults bumbling around like children cavorting about in absurd dance sequences and muttering in terribly stereotypical accents  but it doesn't last long. Several scenes are so ridiculous they're funny but the majority of the film is so obnoxiously immature that it's just plain stupid. The few genuine laughs are quickly covered up by exasperating slapstick and pointless characters.The unpronounceable hamburger gag overly destructive karate and strained semiFrench lingo are all reused  it's clear that what worked for the first film commercially not critically has returned leaving no room for fresh creativity. Clouseau is still a smallminded nitwit eyecandy supporting ladies are everpresent and the Chief of Police still unbelievably allows the scatterbrained inspector to solve crimes while carelessly destroying evidence and embarrassing the nation. Although you'll lose brain cells watching Steve Martin reprise his mindnumbing role at least the opening title sequence animation and jazzy music remain as accompaniment.The Massie Twins".

	schema:headline " Dream Team Fails to Acquit Pink Panther 2 But Entertaining Enough to See";
	schema:reviewBody "Pink Panther 2 is not a great movie but it is not as bad as some say. A new villain The Tornado snatches away the Pink Panther diamond. But The Tornado has also swiped other bigname treasures The Magna Carta The Shroud of Turin and the Emperor's Sword. It is an international Dream Team of detectives not just Inspector Jacques Clouseau who investigate. Joining Steve Martin Clouseau are some accomplished actors Andy Garcia plays very well Italian businessman Vicenzo Alfred Molina is British inspector Pepperidge and Yuki Matsuzaki is Japanese electronics expert Kenji. The odd lady out and a very key person is the exotic and very pretty Sonia Aishwarya Rai. She is an expert on criminology and specifically The Tornado. The following may contain spoilersMartin is no Peter Sellers. The Englishman ever had poise and charm as Clouseau Something about him fit so well into a French policeman's uniform or a trench coat. Sellers carried himself well when not tripping over something and when he did he seemed oblivious. His manner of speaking was deliberate yet natural sophisticated arrogant comedic aplomb if you will and one reason he was funny was that he was almost always serious. Martin's Clouseau is also egotistical and certainly has presence but not the same poise. He is too goofy. He is taller and gawkier older and more nervous. He also gets depressed when he screws up. Martin is fairly funny when he engages in FrenchtoEnglish mispronunciation dialogue but I take Sellers' smooth manner over Martin's verbose. In fairness part of the problem is the script. Attempting to make the movie funny the screenwriters concocted a substantial amount of cheap lines especially politically incorrect dialogue and behavior for Martin having him contradict his political correctness mentor Mrs. Berenger Lily Tomlin by ogling women and making a bad joke about his yellow friend Kenji and sushi. He embarrasses a comrade in front of others by saying I'm sorry you cannot satisfy your wife and of his secretary he says to a group of detectives Nicole is here to service your needs...use her in any way you wish. The low sexual humor of which there is plenty is not always terrible but if you go there limit it and assign it to characters other than Clouseau. Blake Edwards' Clouseau had wit not cheap humor including in romantic situations.As for the slapstick and other humor it is often predictable and silly. In a lessthanstellar scene at the film's beginning Clouseau bumbles a parking ticket issuance in a hint of more forced humor to come. Still there is enough here for viewers to laugh at and enjoy exerting the right to relax. The same restaurant is accidentally burned down twice by guess who ? and Clouseau has a meeting with the Pope that ends up with Clouseau encountering some fearsome heights. There is a lot of crashing bashing and banging at some point this is overdone. Vicenzo and Chief Inspector Dreyfus John Cleese have a few good moments of humor. An encounter between The Dream Team and a falsely accused Tornado played by Jeremy Irons is fairly funny. This is one of a few moderately good twists concerning The Tornado and those in the villain's orbit.My favorite aspect of the movie is the romantic tension between Clouseau and his sweetheart of a secretary Nicole Emily Mortimer. She is the most compelling person of the film. Finding it difficult to express their love for each other Clouseau and Nicole still feel it and this makes for a good climax seriously no pun intended. Nicole is very beautiful and so is Sonia who has a sexier look and for a while eyes for Clouseau.But the reality is that the overall script does not match the four great Pink Panther works. In the original series of movies things started going downhill in Revenge of the Pink Panther and continued much further in the followups without Sellers. Sellers could not salvage Revenge in which there was too much klutzy humor including overuse of Cato. But Cato fighting is better than fighting with a colleague's young karate kids as Martin does here. Overall the silly overrides the witty or sophisticated in Pink Panther 2.".

The movie was made by Shawn Levy and now we have The Pink Panther 2 this time with Harald Zwart behind the camera. And as much as this has been getting hugely negative reviews I am pleased to announce that I liked this movie a lot! This movie is definitely one of the funniest entries in the Pink Panther legacy. Martin's performance was just as funny as Sellers' performance.New to the arsenal of actors we have John Cleese as Dreyfus instead of Kevin Kline Alfred Molina as Pepperidge Andy Garcia as Vincenzo Yuki Matsuzaki as the nerdy Kenji and the eversosexy Aishwarya Rai as Sonia. All are wonderful in their performances! The characters are all lovable and yet a new plot has been cooking up too.In this hilarious new entry there is a new thief in town entitled The Tornado. The Tornado is an artifacts thief that has been stealing various artifacts around the world and this time has stolen The Pink Panther. This is now the second time the Panther has been stolen. That being said Clouseau is appointed by Dreyfus to a team of just as idiotic yet less bumbling detectives called The Dream Team. The Dream Team are assigned to search the globe for The Tornado and save the Panther but are held back by Clouseau's idiocy which involves having to constantly be reminded by Mrs. Berenger about political correctness Clouseau's burning down a Spanish restaurant dealing with two bratty kids of his partner in the wrong way and much more.Simply put there is no need to compare this to the older entries because this is just as funny as the older ones. Martin is wonderful yet again as Clouseau and is at the top of his game giving his best performance since his performance as Orin in Little Shop of Horrors. Cleese is hilarious too as Dreyfus and Molina is pretty funny too. But who really steals the show is Lily Tomlin as Mrs. Berenger. She definitely has some of the funniest scenes in the movie and my favorite scene of hers is the scene where she asks Clouseau what he would do without objectification if he saw a woman's clothes being torn off while she tried to pick something up. Just how she always jumps in with the Political Corectness factor makes you laugh out loud.Sure there are some discrepancies Yes the opening credits while funny carry on for on a tad longer than they need to yes some jokes are a bit repetitive but overall this is a hilarious success and one of the best Panthers. Just be your own critic and see this movie.".

In any event I feel that Kevin Klein would have made a far better job of the Clouseau role if it had to be done at all. A great part of the charm of the Pink Panther movies was derived from the exclusively sixties flavour the vehicles the fashion and above all the actors who were extraordinarily well cast.

Now Clouseau must not only capture the Tornado but save the diamond again.My Comment This is your typical Pink Panther story of the French police Inspector Clouseau who is a little strange and very lucky. The storyline is not a great detective novel and it never was supposed to be. It is a slapstick comedy of total incompetence. Steve Martin is a wild and crazy guy and does a good job of being the dimwitted Clouseau and he is very good at slapstick. John Cleese did an excellent job as the Chief Inspector. The movie is entertaining enough but I wouldn't want to see it again. I did laugh at many of the slapstick scenes that are classic but it alone isn't enough to carry the whole movie.

Each scene blends perfectly into the next creating and weaving an intricate and detailed story without being self indulgent. The actors make choices that are simple yet powerful.

Stylistically newcomer director Alejandro Monteverde does a superb job pacing the story  combining just the right amounts of character humor and mystery into a package that satisfies on multiple levels  intellectually visually emotionally symbolically etc. The photography  shot in and around the streets of Manhattan and Long Island  is top notch reminding me of James Crabe's amazing cinematography along the streets of Philadelphia in Rocky 1977....and the editing relying heavily on jump cuts keeps the story moving along in multiple time frames to great effect.The actors all shine in their roles particularly Mexican superstar Eduardo Verstegui and Tammy Blanchard who portray their particularly complex relationship  between a cook and a waitress in a Mexican restaurant  with finesse. Additionally the filmmakers do an excellent job presenting Hispanic culture in a manner that shatters the ridiculous stereotypes that are often presented in mainstream television and film. The scenes taking place at the cook's Hispanic parents' house are particularly funny charming and poignant. Also the film portrays some very powerful emotional moments that have tremendous staying power long after leaving the theater.In short this is subtly powerful film that everyone should see.".

This movie proves you don't in fact need sex violence profanity and a bunch of special effects to make a successful picture.

However there were some wonderful thoughtprovoking topics in the movie that provided fodder for a conversation afterwards. Recognizing that life can change for anyone in the blink of an eye as it did for more than one character in the movie the boys were open to discussing how life has choices and as a result consequences.What really made the movie the launching point for the discussion was that there was no message that they were beaten over the head with. The messages and themes flow very beautifully from a story that was very wellcrafted. The characters have depth and the audience can truly empathize with them. It is very possible to imagine this story happening 100s of times in any culture and any community in the United States.This movie is a gift to give yourself and your family.".

The acting was phenomenal the cinematography artistic but simple and the character development very believable. I didn't catch myself questioning any awkward characterizations or transformations. The sheer fact that a movie of this success was made in 23 days with 3 million dollars should be enough to encourage anyone to give it a chance. Hollywood says a movie with a pure message won't sell.

Yes it's pure melodrama but ladies it's so well done that it should keep your husband or boyfriend interested most of the way.This also is beautifully photographed. Man for a smallbudget independent film with basically noname actors this has all the visual slickness of a Spielberg film. Also the food in here looks so good it will have you salivating.The main ingredient in this awardwinning film is charm I would think. Everyone is pretty likable there's a lot of emotion and the characters are very realistic. If you elaborated on the story it might sound extremely boring because mainly it's a day in the life of two people. They both work in a restaurant and she gets fired for being late again and he goes after her to see if she's okay. As the day goes on the two work out past traumas with the ending being a tearjerker feelgood one.For a film in which most viewers probably aren't familiar with the director or the actors it is impressive. What's odd about this film in addition to being interesting despite almost nothing going on is that there is absolutely no profanity or sex either. I suppose some could look at this movie as some sappy dogooder type story but it isn't. It's so professionally done that you kind of feel like a fly on the wall content to just observing and being a part of these people's lives for a day.".

It's very clear that Belladonna and her girls  The Chosen Few  love what they do and do it with absolute gusto.

Belladonna's threeway with a glass dildo is volcanic as is a wet and steamy tryst with a hot black babe. The photography is sharp the lighting flattering and the situations simple but arousing. But it is the sluttish attitude of the women that makes No Warning yet another Belladonna classic and places her firmly on top of the porno heap where nobody but nobody can currently touch her. Though she looked totally delicious in her pregnant state she looks just as hot in her postpregnant body. Like a real trooper she buries her tongue and fingers deep into half a dozen perfect female orifices and encourages every opening within reach to spread the carnal joy. Belladonna is indeed beautiful. Every delectable inch of her.And even better she's getting filthier and filthier. God bless this woman!".
