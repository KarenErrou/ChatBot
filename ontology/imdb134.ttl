	schema:reviewBody "Although this 1920 German silent does not really rank alongside the truly great silent films it remains a fascinating oddity. Based on European Jewish folklore it tells the story a Jewish community in Prague which is threatened with expulsion from the city. In an effort to protect his people Rabbi Loew creates a manlike creature made of clay and uses it to impress the Emperor. Unfortunately the magic backfires and when the Golem falls into the hands of the Rabbi's perfidious assistant disaster results.Much of the film's charm is in its visual style. The sets by Hans Poelzig are a strange but cohesive mixture of medieval nouveau and surrealism and the cinematography by legendary photography Karl Freund uses high contrast black and white to truly remarkable effect. The PoelzigFreund combination would cast an extremely long shadow and THE GOLEM would influence not only such German films as Fitz Lang's METROPOLIS but the entire cycle of 1930s American horror films that began with the 1931 Bela Lugosi Dracula.Several plot devices and the look of the Golem as played by Paul Wegener would also prove particularly influential for director James Whale's famous 1932 FRANKENSTEIN. Whether or not Boris Karloff or makeup artist Jack Pierce knew the film is uncertainbut Whale who was fond of German cinema certainly did and traces of THE GOLEM can be seen throughout his most famous works.Over the past several decades a number of film historians have attempted to reinterpret THE GOLEM in light of the Holocaust. There may actually be a certain validity to this for although the Jews are portrayed sympathetically they are very clearly outsiders and their religion seems less like religion than witchcraftand indeed Rabbi Loew might be said to practice black magic in bringing the Golem to life. This sense of social estrangement and religious stigmatism does seem indicative of the antiSemitism that will ultimately explode into furnaces of Nazi Germany. All the same it is worth noting that THE GOLEM is a fundamentally Jewish story to begin with and it is perhaps best to think of it in those terms instead of using hindsight to impose modern meanings upon the film.There are several home market releases of the film. While I have not seen it I am told the Timeless Studios VHS release is weak I have however seen the Gotham DVD release and although there are some quality issues this inexpensive DVD is not at all bad. Still my preference and recommendation is the Kino DVD. Unlike many Kino editions it does not have anything significant in the way of bonuses but the overall presentation is very fine and likely represents a bestpossible presentation short of full digital restoration.".

Watching it with my son who is 16 he was struck by its uncomfortable prefiguring of Jewish persecution.  I was impressed by the the scarcity of romantic cliches in the story.

I had never seen the film before and was frankly amazed at the imagery in the sets and costumes and editing of the film. The film's director Paul Wegener wearing a thickly padded outfit and wig and highheeled boots plays the main character The Golem. A mythical character from Jewish folklore. For its day the special effects were also intriguing. I resist describing the movie as antisemitic but I believe that the portrayal of the jewish ghetto was depicted so dramatically to show that the jews in Prague were outsiders and not welcome in mainstream society. This is evident in the fact that when a nobleman comes to the ghetto he is greeted by a mammoth closed gate that looks like a precursor to the one used in KingKong. And most notably during the creation sequence a satanic figure appears on screen that would coincide with the European belief a that time that Jews walk handinhand with the Dark forces.As far as the Golem's performance this film is really a precursor to Frankenstein that Boris Karloff must have seen in its original release  there are so many similarites.Biggest Image  at the conclusion the Golem is surrounded by a group of blond Aryanlooking children that clearly distinguish them from the ghetto children that we see earlier in the film.".

CALIGARI 1919 and NOSFERATU 1922. Still the production itself is quite impressive to my eyes the bizarre set design being the best of it but I also love the creation scene with the aid of the demon Astaroth and some notable special effects and the scene where the old Rabbi describes the Jewish pogroms which we see superimposed on the screen to the unimpressed and downright sneering aristocrats not to mention the rather moving way the Golem meets its comeuppance  which I'm sure even you will concede that it clearly inspired one of the most famous sequences in James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN 1931. In fact I'd say that even the domesticated monster of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1935 owes its genesis more to this film than the Shelley original where we see it carrying errands for its master the Rabbi before it runs amok for plot and genredefining purposes. Paul Wegener's acting may feel somewhat comical today but he certainly managed to convey the lumbering creature's brutish strength  coupled with its inherent innocence and highly susceptible nature.Actually this was Wegener's third stab at the character after THE GOLEM of 1914 set in contemporary times!  the 1920 version in fact was identified by the subtitle HOW IT CAME INTO THE WORLD  and the semicomic sequel THE GOLEM AND THE BALLERINA 1917 both of which seem not to have survived alas. Happily though Wegener's earlier THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE 1913 which is another muchfilmed supernatural tale  in which he played the principal dual roles but did not direct  has and in fact was recently released on DVD by of all people Alpha. I caught this on Italian TV several years ago and thought it was pretty good I hope they do a repeat one of these days or else some other DVD company like Kino for instance will take the trouble to release it in a restored edition  preferably with the apparently rarer Robert WieneConrad Veidt 1926 remake in towP.S. There was a French remake of THE GOLEM in 1936 which I've seen and even managed to tape off the TV this too is basically a historical melodrama rather than a horror film but I recall it being very adequate and featuring some expensive production values to boot.".

In fact I'd say that even the domesticated monster of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1935 owes its genesis more to this film than the Shelley original where we see it carrying errands for its master the Rabbi before it runs amok for plot and genredefining purposes. Paul Wegener's acting may feel somewhat comical today but he certainly managed to convey the lumbering creature's brutish strength  coupled with its inherent innocence and highly susceptible nature.Actually this was Wegener's third stab at the character after THE GOLEM of 1914 set in contemporary times!  the 1920 version in fact was identified by the subtitle HOW IT CAME INTO THE WORLD  and the semicomic sequel THE GOLEM AND THE BALLERINA 1917 both of which seem not to have survived alas. Happily though Wegener's earlier THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE 1913 which is another muchfilmed supernatural tale  in which he played the principal dual roles but did not direct  has and in fact was recently released on DVD by of all people Alpha. I caught this on Italian TV several years ago and thought it was pretty good I hope they do a repeat one of these days or else some other DVD company like Kino for instance will take the trouble to release it in a restored edition  preferably with the apparently rarer Robert WieneConrad Veidt 1926 remake in towP.S. There was a French remake of THE GOLEM in 1936 which I've seen and even managed to tape off the TV this too is basically a historical melodrama rather than a horror film but I recall it being very adequate and featuring some expensive production values to boot.";

	schema:reviewBody "This landmark film is one of the earliest surviving expressionist works and it's art direction and photography while not as stunning as a film like Caligari is still extremely interesting with its misshapen sets and its use of light and shadow and light within shadow. Unlike Caligari the themes of this film were resonant long after its release and perhaps still are today.The Golem is a tolerance film that studies in depth the relationship between Jews and Christians in Prague. To his credit Wegener refuses to impose stereotypes on either party instead concentrating on individual characters and using mass characterizations only to highlight the themes of the film.Unlike stereotypical Jews rich guys with big noses who rub pennies together the Jews of Prague are decidedly poor. It is interesting to note that the Jews are all dressed in black and with very few exceptions appear to be bent with age a tribute to an aging and dying religion. However they are also portrayed to be earnest and hardworking with strong communal instincts. The Christians by contrast appear bright shiny and new. They are dressed in light colors and are young and wealthy and outwardly appear to be God's new chosen. However they are also portrayed as foolish bohemians who do not take God seriously. In the end Christian innocents and blondeblue Aryan coincidentallyare able to stop the Golem's rampage but only because he allows it. The final shot shows the Star of David lying in the dust as the Jews come to carry their fallen champion back into the ghetto closing the great door behind them and leaving you with a feeling that they are gone forever. However it should be noted that the Golem is not only a champion to the Jews but a symbol of revival.Another interesting comparison in this film is that between the Golem and Jesus. Like man the Golem is made of sand and clay then given life by a supernatural force. They are both immaculate conceptions with the Golem being motherless while Jesus is born to a virgin mother. Jesus in his time was a champion of the Jews as is the Golem and each of them rebelled against the wickedness of the authorities that governed them.This openended presentation of the struggle of Christianity vs. Judaism is what makes this film truly great. I suspect that this relevant elevation above the ordinary is the reason for its survival even though it is the third film of this series. The fact that Wegener was able to make a film that is so ambiguous is a credit to him considering the circumstances surrounding German filmmaking at the time.Rabbi Loew is portrayed as a wise and heroic leader of the Jewish community which lives in a winding ghetto. He creates the Golem for a noble cause to protect his people against eviction by the Christiansand in this cause succeeds after the Christian court is saved by the Golem from divine repudiation after laughing at Loew's presentation of the Old Testament. The creation scene is particularly interesting not only in its visuals but for the fact that in this scene Rabbi Loew wears white for purity yet performs a ceremony that is holy in nature yet seems like witchcraft. The Golem turns on him when he seeks to continue using the Golem's services for selfish purposes after the Golem has accomplished his mission.Miriam and Loew's servant are portrayed quite differently. Miriam is a dark seductress who is unwittingly the cause of the Golem's destructive rampage. She is only saved from the hands of the Golem by another act of divine intervention when the communal prayer of the Jews in the streets of the ghetto results in her release. She usually dresses in dark colors. However there is also a scene before her affair with Florian in which she wears white purity of a different kind. Also notice how Florian carelessly twirls a flower when he delivers the edict to Rabbi Loew. This is a brief but effective example of his character and foreshadows things to come. Loew's servant is the only other young Jewish character in the film besides a few Jewish children in the street and it is his revival of the Golem during his jealous rage against Florian that sets the Golem on his destructive path. Like Loew he is unable to remove the Star of David from the Golem's chest once he begins to use the Golem for selfish gain. In the end he shares a poignant moment with Miriam where they seek forgiveness and confidence about their actions.The depth and attention to detail that Wegener shows as a director and writer in this film helps to place it among the great films in the brief history of cinema. It's message is particularly haunting considering the events of the next 25 years after its release.".

It really dampened my experience with the ending of both this movie and The Man with XRay Eyes just to name a few.Anywho the version I saw the Kino remaster was great. The picture quality was about as good as you could expect from a film more than 80 years old. The score was very good maybe a tad repetitive but it suit the film. The acting is quite good very reminiscant of the acting style from the midtoearly 20th century.The scare factor? Well probably not much these days. The Jewish ghetto is very well constructed and really suits the setting. The golem himself is not so scary more goofy to me but to people in 1920 I can imagine he could have been quite scary. This is more of an 'interest' movie than an allout scare fest. You can really see where so many of the great horrorscare films over the years got their ideas from after seeing early films such as this.I would definately recommend everyone who is interested in horror to track it down.

The sets the lighting the atmosphere the music and everything make sure that the film always has a nice setting to work it's story from and as a big of fan of atmosphere anyway I found this to be a very favourable aspect of the movie. However for a movie to truly work it must find a happy medium between it's style and it's substance and although the story behind Der Golem certainly has some meaning and a message behind it it is not portrayed in a way that is interesting enough to keep itself afloat and that is the film's primary downfall. The plot follows a Rabbi who creates a giant figure out of clay the Golem which he plans to breathe life into by way of an evil god. However the Rabbi's assistant has other plans for the Golem and sets about ordering it to carry out criminal acts including the kidnapping of it's creator's daughter Miriam.I'm sure you'll agree that the plot line gives the film a nice base to work from and it's certainly intriguing enough to ensure that The Golem will always be an interesting film but the film runs too long and there isn't enough of the plot to stretch for the full running time. It's a shame because with a little bit more meat on the plot the film could have been really great. One thing that you will notice about The Golem is the music which plays almost throughout the film and presents it with a very nice style that sets just the right atmosphere for the movie. The lighting is another prime aspect of the movie and it is a good example of the style of filmmaking at the time that this movie was produced. Acting in silent movies is rather hard to judge but I didn't notice any problems with it and it's about what you'd expect from a film made in the era that The Golem was made. The Golem itself looks a little silly but come on the film is eightyfive years old! On the whole I recommend this movie for people who like this sort of film but I'd certainly recommend Faust Nosferatu and Das Kabinett before it.".

	schema:headline " One of the great horror icons";
	schema:reviewBody "The giant frame of Paul Wegener as the Golem is one of the best known characters from the silent era and one of the first icons of horror. Der Golem is actually the third film to feature the character the first being The Golem 1915 and the second The Golem And The Dancing Girl 1917 which is a short comedy with Wegener donning the costume to frighten a girl he is in love with. Tragically those two films are now considered lost and only fragments equalling about 14 minutes of the first film remain. This film is actually a prequel and it's full title is Der Golem Wie Er In Die Welt Kam How He Came Into The World but is now commonly know as simply Der Golem.The Jews of medieval Prague face persecution from the townsfolk. Terrified of their doomed fate Rabbi Loew Albert Steinruck uses his skills in black magic to create The Golem a mythical figure from Jewish folklore. He is made entirely from clay and has an amulet in his chest that gives him power and when removed turns him back into lifeless clay. He is initially used as a servant and then to terrify the townsfolk who are threatening them. The Golem eventually gets tired of being used as a tool of fear and begins to turn on his creator and starts to lay waste to the Ghetto.Like the majority of films made in Weimar Germany the film has an expressionist tone with lavish artistic sets that dominate the frame. Similar in feel to the great Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari it is however more subtle in its artistic flair and lacks Caligari's rickety although wonderful in its own way sets. It is also quite terrifying in its realisation of a segregation that would occur in the country only a decade later although it does portray the Jews as vengeful and as studying the dark arts.The Golem itself is a great movie monster. Tragic in the same way as Frankenstein's monster he is brought into the world without having asked to be and is expected to carry out terrible acts against his will. Paul Wagener portrays him with all silent intensity and uncontrollable rage with his towering frame sending his enemies running for the hills. He also impressively cowrote and codirected the film. This is an enjoyable film that breezes by in its rather slight running time and can be forgiven for some overacting and the occasional tedious scene.

	onyx:emotionText "The giant frame of Paul Wegener as the Golem is one of the best known characters from the silent era and one of the first icons of horror. Der Golem is actually the third film to feature the character the first being The Golem 1915 and the second The Golem And The Dancing Girl 1917 which is a short comedy with Wegener donning the costume to frighten a girl he is in love with. Tragically those two films are now considered lost and only fragments equalling about 14 minutes of the first film remain. This film is actually a prequel and it's full title is Der Golem Wie Er In Die Welt Kam How He Came Into The World but is now commonly know as simply Der Golem.The Jews of medieval Prague face persecution from the townsfolk. Terrified of their doomed fate Rabbi Loew Albert Steinruck uses his skills in black magic to create The Golem a mythical figure from Jewish folklore. He is made entirely from clay and has an amulet in his chest that gives him power and when removed turns him back into lifeless clay. He is initially used as a servant and then to terrify the townsfolk who are threatening them. The Golem eventually gets tired of being used as a tool of fear and begins to turn on his creator and starts to lay waste to the Ghetto.Like the majority of films made in Weimar Germany the film has an expressionist tone with lavish artistic sets that dominate the frame. Similar in feel to the great Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari it is however more subtle in its artistic flair and lacks Caligari's rickety although wonderful in its own way sets. It is also quite terrifying in its realisation of a segregation that would occur in the country only a decade later although it does portray the Jews as vengeful and as studying the dark arts.The Golem itself is a great movie monster. Tragic in the same way as Frankenstein's monster he is brought into the world without having asked to be and is expected to carry out terrible acts against his will. Paul Wagener portrays him with all silent intensity and uncontrollable rage with his towering frame sending his enemies running for the hills. He also impressively cowrote and codirected the film. This is an enjoyable film that breezes by in its rather slight running time and can be forgiven for some overacting and the occasional tedious scene. It also has some interesting social comments and is a frightening prelude to one of the most horrific periods in Europe's history.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com";

	schema:reviewBody "The Golem may not be quite as well known as that other silent creature feature of its era  F.W. Murnau's extraordinary Nosferatu  but is nevertheless a fascinating work of expressionist cinema from German filmmaker Paul Wegener. Based on Gustave Meyrick's 1915 novel the film is moodily lit and pictorially powerful providing cinema with an early example of one of its most perennially popular motifs the 'rampagingmonsterontheloose'. Even a film as celebrated as King Kong owes much to Wegener's vision in terms of plot and structure. The story is set in medieval Prague. Rabbi Loew Albert Steinrck reads in the stars that disastrous events are on the horizon and urges his assistant Famulus Ernest Deutsch to gather the Jewish elders to tell them the bad news. The very next day a decree is issued by the Holy Roman Emperor Luhois Otto Gebhr stating that every Jew must leave the city by the end of the month or else face the ultimate penalty. Desperate to protect his people Loew creates a clay giant called The Golem and invokes the malicious spirit of Astaroth to bring the creature to life. Animated by this sorcery the Golem Paul Wegener becomes Loew's hulking ally helping him to protect the Jewish community. When Emperor Luhois sees the Golem  and witnesses its incredible strength firsthand when it prevents his palace from collapsing  he decides to reverse his decree and let the Jews stay. Later however Loew learns that Astaroth's sinister influence still lurks within the Golem and this proves only too true when the creature goes on a destructive rampage through the city. Wegener's film is perhaps most impressive for its visual design with Hans Poelzig's sets evocatively replicating the Jewish ghetto of medieval Prague. The whole film is beautifully shot around these sets  the maze of alleys crooked towers and dingy rooms create a perfect atmosphere. The Golem itself is a brilliantly designed creature with a distinctive Eskimolike hair cut and physically imposing appearance. It may not be as iconic as Nosferatu but the image of the creature is still one that stays with the viewer long after the film is over. Inevitably the film's primitive technical 'look' will affect how much of an audience exists for it any more. If you have no interest in silent cinema or expressionism there will be little to entice you to see The Golem. For true movie buffs though this is a real treat. There's so much here that has gone on to influence and inspire future filmmaking generations  watching the film you are actually witnessing the birth of ideas and techniques that have survived and evolved over ninety two years and counting. A humbling experience indeed for any film fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Paul Wegener's The Golem may not rank with The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or Nosferatu with its significance artistic splendour and innovative highlights it does nonetheless serve as one of the shining spotlights of silent films and in particular horror silent films. Oozing German expressionistic techniques throughout director Wegener offers us a story of a Jewish ghetto in Prague being condemned for exile by a new decree from the emperor. This comes shortly after Rabbi Loew has received from the stars a message that doom will come to his people. Loew immediately starts creating a golem  a figure of a giant man made from clay that legend says can be brought to life to protect Loew's people. The story moves from the incredibly fascinating ritual used to create and imbue the creature with life to a storyline of a Jewish girl Miriam in the temple falling in lust with Florian the emperor's messenger to the golem walking around doing everyday activities and becoming the servant of Rabbi Loew to the golem terrorizing. The golem  Paul Wegener playing the part  is unique and imposing. Watch his eyes. They act out loads of emotions whilst the body and facial muscles barely move. The film has wonderful scenes throughout from the secret word being given to Loew to the film in film of what happened to Rabbi Loew's people and the fall of the palace to the flowery ending. The expressionistic acting is all very solid and Wegener's genius is obvious when you see what hats he wears in the film actor and director. Camera work is done by Karl Freund who would go on to direct himself and come up with incredible innovations with camerawork. There is no doubt in my mind what role this film had in James Whale's collective conscience when he decided what his vision of Frankenstein would be. The Golem is a blueprint right down to the scene with the little girl and the flower. As to the whole Jewish question I see so many viewers engage in about whether the film is pro or con there is no doubt the Jews are portrayed sympathetically in the film from their plight from Egypt in the memorable film in film scene to the sense of hollowness and dejection the actors give off. The German officials are portrayed as buffoons for the most part. There is also a negative result though that the black arts are connected with Jews. It is a Rabbi that is able to conjure the spirit of an ancient sorcerer. He controls an inanimate object used to destroy. These are somewhat contradictory and though I believe Wegener's efforts to be ultimately filled with good intent I could see where a film like this could also fuel the most emboldened antiSemites because it reinforces a terrible stereotype. I don't want to get too bogged down with the historical implications of the film as I do not know nearly enough about its impact to say anything with any real meaning with regard to that subject. What I will say is this The Golem is one of the most influential films in the catalogue of silent films and its impact in direction and in the genre are obvious and cannot be overstated really. Every time you see a depiction of Frankenstein's Monster you see its impact.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Golem How He Came Into the World is one of the best and earliest German silent films often categorized under the umbrella of German expressionism. Paul Wegener had made a modern version of the Jewish legend in 1915 which is lost although some on IMDb have confused it with this 1920 film and his 1913 version of The Student of Prague is an interesting although statically filmed early horror fantasy which is also based in literature and set in Prague.Inspired by Siegfried Kracauer From Carlgari to Hitler A Psychological History of the German Film much of the writing on the subject of Weimar cinema has connected the films with Nazism and the rise of antiSemitism and many have discussed this film in that light but that view has probably been taken far enough. The Golem is set in historical although mythologized past antiSemitism and Jewish mystical folklorea much different situation than in the twentieth century. The Golem isn't antiSemitic anyhow.In the film Rabbi Loew reads in the stars that danger threatens his community. He subsequently gives life to the clay Golem which is to serve him in reversing a decree that the Jews evacuate Prague. As others have mentioned the Golem is a precursor of the creation of the robot in Metropolis 1927 both films also contain a vision moving pictures scene projected by religious leaders and of many of the scenes in Frankenstein 1931. Some have even speculated that Mary Shelley's original novel was largely inspired by the Golem stories. Moreover the film is another in a strand of German films with fantastic and horrific themes based on literature and folklore.The Golem is rather representative of its times as far as camerawork and editing which is to say it's adequate and unremarkable. Being postCaligari lighting is used somewhat effectively and the sets by Hans Poelzig Kurt Richter and Edgar G. Ulmer who notably worked on many of Fritz Lang's films are amazing but unique from those in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920 and other expressionistic films. There are however irregular contours and things are askew as in expressionism. The sets also reflect the narrative. Architecture made out of clay and a Golem out of clay. Yet rather than coming from theatre as those in Caligari the sets in The Golem are Gothic and exploit clay wonderfully. And it makes for a visually splendid film.".

Paul Wegener had made a modern version of the Jewish legend in 1915 which is lost although some on IMDb have confused it with this 1920 film and his 1913 version of The Student of Prague is an interesting although statically filmed early horror fantasy which is also based in literature and set in Prague.Inspired by Siegfried Kracauer From Carlgari to Hitler A Psychological History of the German Film much of the writing on the subject of Weimar cinema has connected the films with Nazism and the rise of antiSemitism and many have discussed this film in that light but that view has probably been taken far enough. The Golem is set in historical although mythologized past antiSemitism and Jewish mystical folklorea much different situation than in the twentieth century. The Golem isn't antiSemitic anyhow.In the film Rabbi Loew reads in the stars that danger threatens his community. He subsequently gives life to the clay Golem which is to serve him in reversing a decree that the Jews evacuate Prague. As others have mentioned the Golem is a precursor of the creation of the robot in Metropolis 1927 both films also contain a vision moving pictures scene projected by religious leaders and of many of the scenes in Frankenstein 1931. Some have even speculated that Mary Shelley's original novel was largely inspired by the Golem stories. Moreover the film is another in a strand of German films with fantastic and horrific themes based on literature and folklore.The Golem is rather representative of its times as far as camerawork and editing which is to say it's adequate and unremarkable. Being postCaligari lighting is used somewhat effectively and the sets by Hans Poelzig Kurt Richter and Edgar G. Ulmer who notably worked on many of Fritz Lang's films are amazing but unique from those in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920 and other expressionistic films. There are however irregular contours and things are askew as in expressionism. The sets also reflect the narrative. Architecture made out of clay and a Golem out of clay. Yet rather than coming from theatre as those in Caligari the sets in The Golem are Gothic and exploit clay wonderfully. And it makes for a visually splendid film.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE GOLEM is actually the third Golem film that starred Paul Wegener as the mythical character. The first film THE GOLEM 1915 only currently exists in fragments and the second one THE GOLEM AND THE DANCING GIRL 1917 is completely lost. The film most people call The Golem is this 1920 version and it's more correct title is THE GOLEM HOW HE CAME INTO THE WORLD. Wegener not only starred in the films but he wrote and codirected them as well! The film is a tale based on a Jewish myth about a manmade creature that came to life in the 16th century to defend the Jews from persecution. This film stays pretty close to that legend and there have been other Golem films since.The story begins with a royal edict being announced. It says that all Jews are to leave the land. However the Rabbi is liked by the emperor and so the Rabbi hatches a plan. First he'll build a Golem out of clay and animate it. Then he'll take it with him to see the emperorand threaten to use the Golem unless the edict is canceled. Well the plan works out very well and the edict is reversed. However given that the rabbi used the forces of darkness to make the beast there is a strong chance this blessing will become a curse so he's quick to deactivate the creature. Stupidly his assistant in a fit of rage reactivates it and the creature runs amokburning and killing pointlessly.The story gets high marks for creating an excellent and menacing monsteryears before Universal created what we now think of as horror monsters. The story is also excellentespecially for the silent age. The only negative is that the story ends very abruptly and there just isn't enough payoff at the end. Once they lose control of the monster and it goes off terrorizing the countryside it all ends with a bit of a fizzle. Still for 1920 it's a heck of a good film.By the way seeing this film come out just before the Nazi era is interesting. It could mean that Germans were more accepting of Jews and Jewish themes since the film is about the persecution of them but I also wonder if the Gentiles took it to be a warning about the Jewsas it shows them dabbling into the occult and being a bit of a menace! So here we have a film that could be proJewish or antSemetic depending on the audience! I wonder what the German government in 1933 did about this filmdid they ban it or use it to promote the myth of the evil Jew?For an interesting look at the life of Paul Wegener try this sitehttpwww.missinglinkclassichorror.co.ukwegener.htm.Also if you look on IMDb for information about the first Golem movie it seems that many have confused this for the 1920 filmthis should account for why the film has so many votes even though only a few minutes of film exists today.".

I decided to reinstate my thoughts about it today as I did know it was a pretty good movie at first viewing but I wanted to study what made it so goodThe story is relayed in 5 chapters all of those can consist of intermissions.The first chapter is where Rabbi Low is reading books on how to emanate the Golem they also tried to go to the revered Rabbi so that he can represent the Jewish Community so all ready there is a Jewish Tone to the work. He looks through books of necromancers.The Second Chapter He tries to call it without any caveat. He does interact with it now although foreboding in the beginning he is subservient to his master and obeys him at every lead. Even doing errands it can be deadly.Third Chapter They go to the emperors place and the Golem saves him from his temple being eroded he was there to accompany him while they stare into another place which looks like Metropolis 1927 in the scene where Maria is preaching the construction of the Babel. One of the female character also bribed the guards.Fourth Chapter The Golem becomes deceitful and disobeying one of the counterproductive results to happen to itFifth Chapter Golem opens the Gate.Albeit nobody is in a foray but rest assured trouble was already going to be imminent he protects them temporarily and then it all breaks loose  sort of James Whale's tantamount with Karloff's Frankenstein  a lonely innocuous creature in a bad state and always in trouble even though he's a delicate soul.Der Golem was directed by Paul Weigner who also plays the Golem. It does take time for him to be active so throughout the first 33 minutes the foreground is taken by one of the scenes with a cat on a roof and the stars which already show The Golem but this is the construction of him it centres on.The painted backgrounds must have been laborious work and it pays off this is not as expressionistic as The Cabinet of Dr Caligari but it has the paradigm of expressionism filtered through the clinical feel to the house and the painstakingly subjective feel that you have to embrace in the village of expressionism  it's small but welcoming and distorted. Ornate and exquisite the face of the Golem is so emotive that when he smells the flower he genuinely seems curious about it when he picks up the little Girl we wonder whether or not he was going to kill her or embrace her its deliberate dithering still makes you wonder and we never get to know anywayIn the bit where he turns on his master in an unprecedented and unexpected way the face tells us not the words. Abaroth's book is the liveliness of Golem the amulet powers the Golem so it's pretty easy to dismantle him but it's so hard to tame him. He is by definition in horror the indestructible and this movie gives you the sorcery element with the green tint for the house and even little niceties like red for the fire which should represent it but fails and yet it still constitutes to that sense of fantastical worlds. Golem is to be kept a secret when I seen that I was like No way  you can't hide that thing  it will not conform and of course it didn't. But the way it grinds you into believing this always throws it in your other direction as he veers from unsympathetic to really sympathetic.The romance element in the movie is sort of superficial but overall not bad.It's a great great great film and it's definitely one of the best movies ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dana Andrews is a merchantentrepreneur on the Oregon frontier during its period of pioneer settlement in the 1840s. He's got two women interested in him Susan Hayward and Patricia Roc a weak business partner in Brian Donlevy who's addicted to gambling and a big and mean man played by Ward Bond who wants to kill him. And of course there are the ever present Indians around.Canyon Passage is directed by French expatriate director Jacques Tourneur and I have to say Tourneur did a good job in immersing himself in American frontier culture. I don't think John Ford could have done better with the story the cast and the superb outdoor photography that puts those B studio westerns to shame.Patricia Roc who was a big name in Great Britain made a couple of American films at this time. Until the boundary was finally fixed at the 49th parallel British settlers would not have been uncommon in the Oregon territory so the casting is not as strange as one might normally think. Ms. Roc didn't make much of an impression on American audiences and she was back in Great Britain shortly thereafter. Not too many British players of the period could boast a western in their credits though.Susan Hayward is strangely subdued in this film. She looks a bit out of place in this one. She's far better suited to an urban setting. Later on she did films like Untamed and Garden of Evil but far more of her fiery personality was shown in those roles than in Canyon Passage.Ward Bond is the villain here a misanthropic loner of a man brooding and strange. I guess you can best compare his role to that of Judd Fry in Oklahoma. Has the same kind of problems relating to people especially those of the opposite sex that Judd does. It's one of Bond's two or three best performances on screen.The popularity of Canyon Passage was helped in large measure to the Hoagy CarmichaelJack Brooks ballad Ole Buttermilk Sky which Hoagy also performed in the film. It was a big hit that year both for Hoagy himself and others who recorded it. Carmichael was an amazing triple talent in the entertainment field as composer actor and singer of his own and other's songs. His best known movie parts besides Canyon Passage would be in Young Man With a Horn and The Best Years of Our Lives.Tourneur keeps the film moving at a steady pace and gets quite a lot crammed into the 90 minutes of the film. Western fans who like their films slow and easy will take to this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Canyon Passage is directed by Jacques Tourneur and is adapted by Ernest Pascal from the novel written by Ernest Haycox. It stars Dana Andrews Brian Donlevy Ward Bond Susan Hayward Lloyd Bridges  Patricia Roc with Hoagy Carmichael also supporting and offering up ditties such as the Oscar Nominated Ole Buttermilk Sky. Music is by Frank Skinner and cinematography by Edward Cronjager.More famed for his moody black  white pieces Canyon Passage finds Tourneur operating in glorious Technicolor on Western landscapes. The result of which is as gorgeous as it is thematically sizzling. The story follows Andrews' Logan Stuart a former scout turned store  freight owner who has landed in Jacksonsville Oregon. Also residing here is the girl he is courting Caroline Marsh Roc and his friend George Camrose Donlevy who plans to marry Lucy Overmire Hayward. However there are problems afoot as George has a serious gambling problem one that will send this tiny town into turmoil. Affairs of the heart also come under pressure and to cap it all off the Indians are on the warpath after the brutish Honey Bragg Bond kills an innocent Indian girl.The first thing that is so striking about Canyon Passage is the town of Jacksonville itself this is a vastly different Western town to the ones we are used to seeing. Built in a sloping canyon that helps to pump up the off kilter feeling that breathes within the picture it's also green very green but in a most visually refreshing way. The greenery and red flowers give a sense of harmony a sneaky way of diverting the viewer from the smouldering narrative for Tourneur is delighting in not only painting a pretty picture that belies the trouble bubbling under the surface of this apparent place of prosperity he's also revelling in using various camera shots to embody the unfolding story and the characterisations of the principals. This really is a film that begs to be revisited a number of times because with each viewing comes something new to appraise to pore over to see just why Tourneur did something particular. The host of characters are varied and have meaning each given impetus by the uniformly strong cast the latter of which is also a testament to the supreme direction from the Parisian maestro.I honestly feel that if this was a John Ford film it would be far better known  appraised accordingly. Because up to now it's still something of an under seen and vastly under rated Western. This in spite of it garnering praise over the last decade or so from some big hitters in the directing and film critic circles. Cronjager's Technicolor photography is rich and piercing where Tourneur and himself expertly utilise the Diamond Lake and Umpqua National Forest exteriors to expand mood of the story. Skinner's score is excellent as is Carmichael's wonderfully creepy musical input while the costuming is top dollar. Now widely available on DVD there's hope that more people will seek it out. With its number of finely drawn subplots and its wonderful visual delights and tricks Canyon Passage is essential viewing for Western and Tourneur purists. A film that rewards more with each viewing if you keep your eyes and ears firmly on alert. 910".

Canyon Passage is far from a typical or ordinary Western even though it concerns with theme of the affirmation of the American Myth or the cohesion of community. Most of the events occur off screen the dialogue alludes to previous events that took place before the movie starts the Hoagy Carmichael songs are unforgettable and become more timeless with each viewing.

It starts out looking like a family movie about pioneers in Oregon but develops into a complex story with several key characters the most important being Logan Stewart Dana Andrews a mule train outfitter whose business partner is compulsive gambler George Camrose Brian Donlevy. Set mostly in a mining town with settlers clearing the adjacent land for farms and wary native Americans watching their territory disappearing it is a story that weaves together hit rich quick miners gambling pioneering and a significant romance that brews between Camrose's girl Lucy Overmire Susan Hayward and Stewart with Camrose piling on gambling debts and pilfering the till to pay them off. The precarious peace with the Indians is strained by the building of more and more cabins and when it finally breaks there is a series of ruthless attacks on the settlers that are uncommonly brutal for a film made in 1946. With Ward Bond as mean and sadistic Honey Bragg and Lloyd Bridges as gambling miner Johnny Steele and Hoagy Carmichael as minstrelphilosopher Hi Linnet this rather unknown western by Jacques Tournier known more for Out of the Past and Cat People is a real departure from the WayneFordHawks pictures of this era.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film opens in Portland Oregon in the 1850s businessman Logan Stewart rides into town and withdraws some of his gold from storage he runs a freight business and wants to expand ultimately he hopes to bring the stage coach to the growing town. Somebody obviously knows he has gold on him as he is attacked in his room during the night the assailant gets away but Logan has an idea who it could be Honey Bragg a man Logan suspects murdered a couple of miners a few days before. The next morning he leaves town with Lucy the fiance of his friend George. They are heading to Jacksonville where George runs the gold store... in effect the town bank. For some time after this nothing much happens we see the townsfolk coming together to build a house for a couple of newly wed farmers there is a tense but peaceful meeting with the local Indians and we learn that George likes to gamble rather more than he should. The action kicks off later when a man is murdered shortly after returning to town George is the chief suspect as it is believed that he had been helping himself to peoples gold. Logan points out that the evidence is circumstantial and their 'trial' isn't legal but it is clear that they intend to hang George at nightfall when he sees a chance Logan helps his friend escape. Bragg meanwhile has killed again this time an Indian woman... the rest of the tribe are now on the warpath and many people will die before peace returns to Jacksonville.Given its age I had expected this film to be in black and white but it was in glorious Technicolor... just what the glorious Oregon setting required! The opening half of the film may have been fairly action free but it did a fine job of introducing us to the characters and giving us a glimpse in to the lives of people living far away from 'civilisation'... they may have been in the United States but if something needed doing they had to do it themselves that included defending themselves when things got dangerous. By the time the action started I had grown to care about the characters. The action when it came was more shocking than I'd expected among those we see killed are women and children we have been introduced to earlier on. The characters aren't all what one would expect in a western of this era this is especially true of George who puts his gambling addiction ahead of his fiance and is almost certainly guilty of the murder he was accused of. The acting was solid with Dana Andrews doing a good job as Logan and Brian Donlevy being equally good as his friend George. Director Jacques Tourneur did a fine job perhaps it is because he was French rather than American that this feels so different from other westerns of that era I've seen. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre.".

I agree with those that said there is something mysteriously appealing about this film as I have remembered it since it came out in 1946 when so many other movies have long faded from memory. Ward Bond was not known for playing villains and this performance was truly scary and sinister.  Lloyd Bridges plays the friendly good guy that characterized his roles and Dana Andrews is perfectly cast as the leader. The film is rather hard to find and I am hoping a DVD will one day be available.  It is well worth watching and collecting.".

And he'll get the sassy girl the one who is currently attached to the gambling big spender who is the good man's friend and opposite. Dana Andrews plays the virtuous leading man perfectlyhe's strong without being a tough or outrageous strong man like John Wayne and he's also kind with a smile the shoots off his sombre face like a flash of light. That's he's popular with women is no surprise but he's committed most of all to being a successful businessman and a restless one roving from outpost to outpost in beautiful Oregon.His counterpart is the likable but flawed Brian Donlevy who is really the perfect choice here because he isn't the kind of paradigm we will quite fall in love with. The woman who steals the show is Susan Hayward. And then there is Hoagy Carmichael playing a role he often plays the musician wise man who sees everything and understands it before anyone else. It's a great group supported by hundreds of others yesan ambitious film and directed with a subtle fast touch by the unsung great Jacques Tourneur.So in short Canyon Passage was surprise and a total pleasure. I couldn't take my eyes off of the photography and the rich color good pure Technicolor with the redoubtable Natalie Kalmus coordinating. The plot is strong and Andrews is terrific in scene after scene. Westerns are sometimes difficult to see from the 21st Century without putting it into some history of film context but this one works as a drama pure and simple a drama set out west in the late 1800s. The movie is also unique in being set in the lush mountains near Portland Oregon. The scenery is gorgeous in the big sense but every small scene is lush and forested and rainyalmost the opposite of that dry open blue sky norma in a Western strictly speaking. Interiors in golden lamplight lead to exteriors of dripping greens and blues or the delicate grays of night.Even the music is great especially the lighthearted and clever songs by Carmichael. The great Frank Skinner handled the rest of the score. Edward Cronjager is one of the dozen great cinematographers of classic Hollywood and in this you can see why. It's a complex film visually and it never lets up. Especially the night scenes where the lights and sets could be controlled perfectly are vivid and have that controlled beauty of great studio and location Hollywood. If any of these elements sound good I wouldn't miss this film.".

Dana Andrews delivers a sober acting as a former scout turned store owner . Brian Donlevy gives a fine interpretation as a compulsive gambler friend who goes over the line. Hoagy Carmichael that appears as a tophatted role aptly named Linnet  chirping some songs that include the memorable Buttermilk sky . Carmichael serves as the wandering ministrel to the action .

Right from the opening you get a good feeling of what it was like in Oregon how people lived and thought and we're quickly plunged into their lives. Dana Andrews and Susan Hayward are at their best and most beautiful photographed by Edward Cronjager. Andrews a scout turned trader is not his usual taciturn hero. There's a lightness to him. Susan Hayward's cheeky independence is very appealing and she looks particularly fresh and beautiful. Patricia Roc makes her USA movie debut as Dana Andrew's maidenly sweetheart and Ward Bond is a really scary villain. His menace from his first appearance is palpable I've never seen him photographed to such unnerving effect. Brian Donlevy plays a likable banker who has a gambling problem and is accused of murder. Andrews helps him escape a lynch mob but I'll give no more away. There's even time for a few songs from local minstrel Hoagy Carmichael. This is director Jacques Tourneur's first western and it seems to me that he brings a very European eye to the production  the overall colouring is ravishing.".

His career decline in the 50s and he wound up churning out junk on television.This film made when he was in his early forties has been criticized because it doesn't seem as skillfully done as such lowbudget masterpieces as Cat People. But it's still a distinctive Western.First of all Tourneur didn't simply throw away everything he'd learned at RKO. In those psychological horror stories most of the menace is implied or off screen. He brought that particular trope with him. The majority of significant murders take place off screen. There is a climactic Indian attack but no shoot outs. Nobody is faster with a gun than anyone else. The result is less action and more of an emphasis on the dynamics of personality.Second it's true that there is little of the Angst here that there was in the horror films but Tourneur has handled the tension well and he's trying to do something here that he didn't try in any of his other movies. He's captured a community. The stars are only cogs in a much more complicated social machine. Jacksonville isn't John Ford's kind of community. The crowd may build a house with joint action but they can turn vicious and judgmental and punitive at a moment's notice.Jacksonville is a peculiar community in some ways. Everyone knows everyone else's name and habits. And as benign and affable as they usually are they're intent on shaming Dana Andrews into a fist fight with Ward Bond  in what is probably Bond's best performance. Of course the same applies to Ford's Irish community in The Quiet Man. But this isn't a comic fight between Andrews and Bond. It's brief but extremely brutal for 1946. And it's unconventional in other ways. Usually in Westerns the slug fest begins with fists and when the villain realizes he's outmatched he picks up a piece of furniture or an ax and tries to subdue the hero. In this instance Bond gets the first punch in. Then Andrews gets to his feet picks up a chair at once and slams it down on Bond's back. The chair doesn't break into a thousand pieces either. The bloody fight isn't the least amusing and it wouldn't be equaled until Shane in 1952.The principle is Dana Andrews as the levelheaded businessman who experiences role conflict. He's a friend to his weak partner Brian Donlevy but he abhors his dishonesty. He's had a longtime girl friend Patricia Roc but is increasingly attracted to Donlevy's fiance Susan Hayward. Hoagy Carmichael is around to add some unnecessary numbers to the musical score. Nobody's but Bond's performance stands out. The Indians are tolerant of whites  up to a point  and then they morph into the Goddess of Rhamnous.This is by no means the best Western ever made. It could be argued that it's not a Western at all. But it's tidy and deliberate the dialog by Ernest Pascal has some surprises tucked away in it. Censure on your lips approval in your eyes.".

The Logan Andrews Camrose Donlevy friendship is an interesting and offbeat one especially concerning the lovely Lucy Hayward. In fact that subplot is more like a romantic quadrangle once Caroline Roc is added to the mix. And what great background scenery with the rolling green hills and faroff snowy peak. Note too how combat with the Indians is not on horseback the custom in westerns. Instead the opposing forces skulk through the forest a neat kind of eerie effect. And I've seen a lot of Ward Bond movies but none where his hulking menace is any scarier than here. When he spies the Indian maiden alone and swimming in the lake my imagination shuddered and ran wild.Underrated Director Tourneur hit his stride about this time with Out of the Past 1947 and I Walked with a Zombie 1943 for example. So it's not surprising he would add the brutal but realistic tomahawking of the helpless settlers' wives a memorable if gruesome feature. Anyway Tourneur tries to keep up the pacing despite the passing romantic interludes such that we hardly notice the many characters drifting in and out. Lowbudget Universal really popped a load for this AWestern including the cabin raising sequence that's both well stocked and ironic in view of later events. All in all I don't know where the canyon of the title was but I didn't miss it a bit.".

	schema:headline " Good actioncharacters";
	schema:reviewBody "Canyon Passage is Western entertainment in the best classic era style  with adult characters and psychological nuances but absolutely nothing unsuitable for anyone of any age. It was directed by one of the era's greatest relatively unsung filmmakers Jacques Tourneur who also made the excellent Robert Stack Western Great Day in the Morning but who is best known for his horror and noir works including classics like Out of the Past and The Cat People. Tourneur's camera is always in the right place and never gets in the way but most impressive is the way that he mixes largerthanlife star performances with more downtoearth character performances to create an integrated whole.There aren't a lot of big stars in this film but that's OK because it gives some of the character actors that you see in Western films a chance to do a bit more than usual especially the great songwriter Hoagy Carmichael Georgia on My Mind Old Rockin' Chair etc. who also composed several charming songs for the film. The film's star is Dana Andrews who plays Logan a tough and ambitious muletrain manager in the Oregon Territory. His job is made harder by a variety of difficulties including a partner with a gambling problem Brian Donlevy a nemesis who believes Logan witnessed a murder he took part in Ward Bond and 2 ladies who are interested in his affections Susan Hayward and Patricia Roc one of whom Hayward is already engaged to his partner! As for those supporting players Carmichael's appearance as muleriding mandolinplaying town muse Hi is definitely the cream of the crop. His songs add another dimension to the film and his character functions in a way like a fool in Shakespeare. He is a good observer as he tells us at one point and also contributes his opinions fearlessly. Thus we find him in the pivotal courtroom scene which will decide George's Donlevy fate first cautioning the jury and prosecutor Lloyd Bridges that you can't trust what you didn't see.. and sometimes you can't even trust what you do see! and later giving evidence for the prosecution about George pinching from the miner's gold dust bags. It's not a contradiction in his character rather this duality is inherent in his character a very congenial conversation partner who might tell you some things you'd rather not hear. Logan is angry at Hi when he gives the evidence and accuses him of being a sneak but Hi just says he has lots of time to keep his eyes open you have a big store and little time I have a little store and lots of time. After Logan's store meets calamity he reminds him that now he has no store but all the time in the world  Hi is the kind of bearer of such ideas who you can't become angry at because there's a sincerity in the way that he says them. He represents a certain ironic sense of humor among the pioneer culture that found a way to make light of even the worst circumstances.Ward Bond's performance is also effective particularly for me since I haven't seen anything quite as dark from him before. I loved his menace during the bar fight scene you can see the blood pouring down his face but his voice is still completely steady and determined  that's OK Logan I'll break your back. He says it less as a threat than as a matter of fact. The scene overall is probably the most thrilling and visually interesting fistfight I've seen in any Western prior to George Stevens' Shane so great credit should go to Tourneur Donlevy always puts a lot of effort into his roles and here he's invested the standard good friend with a defect bit with some personality as he did also in the more famous The Glass Key where he was paired with Alan Ladd. I swore I spotted Dean Stockwell as the leading lady's brother but I could be wrong. Jay Silverheels has a very brief but memorable scene where he takes Hi's beloved mandolin and tears the strings off. Fay Holden also appears as the leading lady's mother and we have Lloyd Bridges as a straightforward miner who believes he's been cheated  the audience has reason to believe he's right so it presents an interesting situation with our loyalty to the leading man taking a small hit. The success of the film depends to a certain extent on how much credit you're willing to give Logan for helping his friend when his friend is so obviously not worthy of his trust. Then again it's pretty explicit that the main reason he saves George is because he doesn't want Lucy Hayward to be hurt by seeing him hanged. In fact there's a kind of a dance around Logan's feelings for Caroline through the whole film. Nothing too revolutionary in that regard but it's made very enjoyable by the genuine contrast between Roc's and Hayward's styles. Hayward probably needless to say comes off as far more of a freespirit who could be a companion to Logan without forcing him to settle in one place.Basically this isn't a film that's going to be hailed anytime soon as one of the alltime great Westerns but it should be something that just about any Western fan would want to seek out regardless for the wonderful scenery interesting characters and most of all to see the legendary Hoagy Carmichael perform in a relatively substantial and certainly enjoyable role as a kind of a wise man of the old West. Solid entertainment that doesn't talk down to adults nor load itself down with complexities too far beyond a child's imagination  as such something that might have been common and disposable in its day but which from our perspective is something that should truly be cherished.".

	schema:headline " Romantic drama on Oregon frontier strong on music and scenery.";
	schema:reviewBody "Essentially a romantic drama sited in early Oregon a few years after gold was discovered in the SW region of the state. Most of the action takes place in or near Oregon's 2 largest towns then Portland in the north and the gold mining boom town of Jacksonville near the SW corner.Ambitious merchant Logan StuartDana Andrews is in Portland to pick up some merchandise and currency to take by muleback to far off Jacksonville. Also he agreed to escort Lucy OvermireSusan Hayward fianc of his friend George CamroseBrian Donlevy back to JacksonvilleNo clue how she got to Portland apparently on a pleasure trip. The night before they leave someone enters Logan's room apparently with the intent to stab him. But Logan wrestles him until he escapes out the windowa rather clumsily done incident. Logan isn't positive but suspects it was Honey BraggWard Bond who suspects Logan knows he killed two miners currently blamed on 'Indians'.Why would Bragg trail Logan all the way to Portland just to kill him?. The long horse and mule trip through the wilderness is without incident. On their last day they stop by at the cabin of Ben DanceAndy Devine and family where Logan introduces Lucy to his girlfriend CarolinePatricia Roc a native Brit whose parents were killed by 'Indians hence was adopted by the Dances. After getting to know George a bit we wonder what attraction his flawed character holds for either Logan or Lucy. He seems to be from a wealthy family as does Lucy. Apparently that is mostly what they have in common. Like many characters played by Donlevy he seems to want to get through life in style doing the least amount of productive work.

	onyx:emotionText "Essentially a romantic drama sited in early Oregon a few years after gold was discovered in the SW region of the state. Most of the action takes place in or near Oregon's 2 largest towns then Portland in the north and the gold mining boom town of Jacksonville near the SW corner.Ambitious merchant Logan StuartDana Andrews is in Portland to pick up some merchandise and currency to take by muleback to far off Jacksonville. Also he agreed to escort Lucy OvermireSusan Hayward fianc of his friend George CamroseBrian Donlevy back to JacksonvilleNo clue how she got to Portland apparently on a pleasure trip. The night before they leave someone enters Logan's room apparently with the intent to stab him. But Logan wrestles him until he escapes out the windowa rather clumsily done incident. Logan isn't positive but suspects it was Honey BraggWard Bond who suspects Logan knows he killed two miners currently blamed on 'Indians'.Why would Bragg trail Logan all the way to Portland just to kill him?. The long horse and mule trip through the wilderness is without incident. On their last day they stop by at the cabin of Ben DanceAndy Devine and family where Logan introduces Lucy to his girlfriend CarolinePatricia Roc a native Brit whose parents were killed by 'Indians hence was adopted by the Dances. After getting to know George a bit we wonder what attraction his flawed character holds for either Logan or Lucy. He seems to be from a wealthy family as does Lucy. Apparently that is mostly what they have in common. Like many characters played by Donlevy he seems to want to get through life in style doing the least amount of productive work. He's also addicted to gambling vainly hoping to make a living by it. To cover his gambling debts he steals gold dust he is entrusted with and leans on Logan to bail him out of the rest of his debts. He also tries to strike up a side romance with the wife of a gambling buddy. Later he murders a miner whose gold dust he pilfered to pay his debts.

From the start we notice that Hayward more subdued than usual is interested in Andrews even though she's scheduled to marry Andrews' partner Donlevy.Of course the story takes a few twists and turns as it weaves its way through some breathtaking scenery with Ward Bond as the film's chief villain a man called Honey Bragg who has the Indians on his heels when he murders an Indian girl. But Donlevy is no Mr. Goody either since it turns out he's stealing gold from the miners. We know he's going to get his comeuppance to provide a happy ending for Andrews and Hayward.Plotwise it's oldfashioned stuff that's been done before but seldom has a film been such a pleasure to watch because of the color photography. Dana Andrews is his usual solid reliable self and Miss Hayward photographs beautifully in Technicolor.Not quite as fastmoving as it ought to be but worth watching anyway.".

This was the age of the film noir and often those darker more pessimistic forces were starting to creep into the most unlikely of genre flicks. This being a relatively new phenomenon often not everyone in the production was on the same wavelength and you could get some odd mismatches of tone. Canyon Passage opens with a town drenched in rain a sorrylooking figure on horseback weaving his way amid the houses very different to the usual triumphant ride in from the plains that would kick off your average Western. And yet this opening is accompanied by very typical upbeat Western music. Plotwise postproductionwise this is a runofthemill midbudget horse opera. The only difference is the way it looks.A lot of this is probably down to director Jacques Tourneur. Canyon Passage was one his first features after leaving Val Lewton's horrororientated Bunit at RKO and the clinging darkness of the pictures he made there has stayed with him. Lots of directors have habitually used claustrophobic shot compositions but the form of Tourneur's are eyecatchingly unique often putting actors up against the edge of the frame or placing very large objects right before the camera. He often fills the foreground but rarely uses actual closeups. This can have some unusual effects. When Dana Andrews introduces Susan Hayward and Patricia Roc to each other Andrews is foreground centrescreen his back to the camera with the two ladies framed either side of him. This very oddlooking setup sticks out immediately establishing in the mind of the viewer that there will be some kind of rivalry between the women doing so with greater impact than a more typical shot would provide. This is perhaps Tourneur's greatest asset  being able to give a very stylised look to the whole picture but still making the key individual moments stand out. This is I guess very much a cornerstone of good horror direction as well.And despite the focus on cramped interiors and dismal towns Canyon Passage does not neglect that outdoors that is quintessential to the Western genre. Whilst we don't see much of the open plains this is in fact one of the most beautiful depictions of the mountains and pine forests of the West. Normally the baroque stylings of a director such as Tourneur don't really suit the Western but the screenplay of Canyon Passage is so bland its cast so unremarkable the only standouts being the coolly dramatic Hayward the loveably dismal Hoagy Carmichael and the sheer oddity of seeing Ward Bond play a villain that this is one way of making it worth watching. This could never really have been a masterpiece but its fresh and engaging appearance raises it above the average.".

Paul and Charles travel to the countryside to the manor of Charles' stepfather the millionaire Tho Van Horn Orson Welles that is married with the young Hlne Van Horn Marlne Jobert. Paul is welcomed by the family and along the days he learns that Charles and Hlne had a love affair and Charles wrote love letters to Hlne. One day Tho gave a party for two hundred people and the letters were stole. Now they are blackmailed by the thief that demands a large amount to return the letters and Paul helps Hlne to pay the blackmailer. When the extortionist requests more money Charles and Hlne forge a burglary but the plan does not work well ending in a tragedy.La Dcade Prodigieuse a.k.a. Ten Days' Wonder is a slowpaced dramatic thriller by Claude Chabrol. The story based on the Ten Commandments is very well acted but unfortunately it is not difficult to foresee the twist since the number of characters is only five. This DVD has not been released in Brazil and I have just watched a DVD from Pathfinder Home Entertainment.

	onyx:emotionText "The tormented and unstable young sculptor Charles Van Horn Anthony Perkins summons his old family friend Paul Regis Michel Piccoli in Paris and tells him that he has weird nightmares followed by amnesia and last time he had awaked with his hands full of blood. Paul and Charles travel to the countryside to the manor of Charles' stepfather the millionaire Tho Van Horn Orson Welles that is married with the young Hlne Van Horn Marlne Jobert. Paul is welcomed by the family and along the days he learns that Charles and Hlne had a love affair and Charles wrote love letters to Hlne. One day Tho gave a party for two hundred people and the letters were stole. Now they are blackmailed by the thief that demands a large amount to return the letters and Paul helps Hlne to pay the blackmailer. When the extortionist requests more money Charles and Hlne forge a burglary but the plan does not work well ending in a tragedy.La Dcade Prodigieuse a.k.a. Ten Days' Wonder is a slowpaced dramatic thriller by Claude Chabrol. The story based on the Ten Commandments is very well acted but unfortunately it is not difficult to foresee the twist since the number of characters is only five. This DVD has not been released in Brazil and I have just watched a DVD from Pathfinder Home Entertainment. Unfortunately there are no subtitles and in some moments it is very difficult for a nonnative in English understand the pronunciation of Orson Welles. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Not Available";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great antidetective films of the 60s and 70s such as THE SPIDER'S STRATEGEM BLOWUP THE PARALLAX VIEW in which the traditional detached problemsolving power of the detective is removed and he finds himself lost in a labyrinth.  The detective here Paul Regis is so much the embodiment of reason that he is a professor of philosophy.  He observes analyses seeks patterns in a bewildering maze  his genius results in the suicidal death of the wrongfully suspected hero.The film opens as a young sculptor Charles Van Horn Anthony Perkins wakes up hands bloodied mind disoriented thinking of oceandeep life in a hotel.  He has no idea how he got there and Chabrol visualises his disturbed mind with extreme tilted angles and harrowing electronic music. He calls the only person he knows in the area an old lecturer of his Paul Regis Michel Piccoli and asks him to visit his home a vast provincial mansion presided over by his bulky Americanised father Theo played with a lovely mixture of melancholy and play by Orson Welles and his pretty young wife Helene Marlene Jobert.Beneath the bourgeois facade Paul finds an almost Gothic seething of adultery power games mad old ladies blackmail theft Oedipal trauma. Charles and Helene have begun an illicit relationship and are being blackmailed.  Charles steals the money from Theo and both parties enlist Paul to spy on the other.  Paul finds his detachment however increasingly compromised and in the climactic 'revelation' scene all fingers point at him.This film is based on an Ellery Queen novel exemplar of all that is lucid and simplistic about the detective genre in which complex plotting is always framed in such a way as to be accessible to the reader so he can have a go at playing detective himself.  They follow the usual formulae crimeinvestigationsolution disruptionreassertion of order.Chabrol's film is Ellery Queen written by Borges.  It subverts every tenet of the genre in a myriad of ways.  Although the traditional crime film is deliberately artificial it depends on a surface realism plausible settings and outwardly recognisable characters to succeed.  Chabrol foregrounds his material's gleeful playfulness at every turn.  The viewer is never allowed to lose himself in the plot the elaborate disruptive camera movements the intrusion of decor into the plot the wild playing with time and point of view the 'amateurish' unrealistic acting and stilted dialogue the wayward plotting all point up the artifice and unbelievability of the film the sense of a godlike puppetmaster pulling strings.  This sense is crucial to the story when the narrative puppetmaster Theo is linked directly to the camera i.e. the director Theo's wife bears a remarkable resemblance to Chabrol's wife Stephane Audran.This foregrounding of artifice reverberates throughout the film which creates an opposition between creators Theo Charles and interpreters Paul.  This is linked to the traditional crime story  someone 'creates' a crime that must be interpreted by the detective.  This kind of pattern however suggests a social order in which reality can be known ordered and controlled.  Chabrol suggests that this is not the case.He shows the unknowability in many ways.  The film is set in a rarefied space away from the 'real' world which is also a fantasy set where Theo plays out his dreams of 20s grandeur.  Much of the plot is related by characters whose reliability is seriously in doubt from the start.  WONDER starts with Charles emerging from a dream and the film never loses this sense of the oneiric.  Scenes repeat themselves as characters are lost in a maze literally so with all the repeated corridors and stairs in the film the profusion of mirrors and windows that reflect back or multiply meanings the decor that constantly dwarfs the characters.WONDER is about play but also quotes from a famous play Oedipus Rex which is among other things the first detective story.  Charles sleeps with his mother Helene and tries to destroy his father.  This founding human myth is countered by the father with Christian patterning in a way that foreshadows SEVEN both cancel each other out one is left with neither catharsis nor redemption.  But Oedipus was both detective and criminal andso is Paul Theo says he is guiltier than him.  Images of sight and blindness pervade the film linked in a very real way to the cinema and the final 'revelation' is lit by a lamp half Atlas half eye.  But the detective is truly blind trying like Holmes to fix patterns in the abyss revealing that abyss as he fails to do so carelessly costing lives.  There is ironically no death UNTIL the detective makes his judgement rather than the other way round.The film is also a brilliant family saga the country house a site for all manner of generational psychodramas the paedophiliac implications of Theo's and Helene's marriage are chilling.  But there are Oedipal struggles too and the apparent artifice masks a very personal Chabrol film.  His casting is very deliberate with Welles playing a selfdestructive KANE figure playing God through kindness Perkins invoking both PSYCHO and the Hitch suggestions are both brilliantly  misleading we're all looking at the mother! and enriching the 'innocent' wrongfully accused the Catholic depths the famed concept of transferring guilt and the Wellesdirected THE TRIAL Piccoli veteran of bourgeois bashers Bunuel and Godard as well as a link through LE MEPRIS to Chabrol hero Lang.The film is remarkably perspicacious about class and money the 'God' figure is a poor Frenchman who made his fortune in America  and the country house is used in its double metaphor for both the state at large and the mind. Amid all the sterile despairing  destructive manmade constructs Chabrol has never lost his beautiful sympathy with the French countryside.  This is one of a series of stunning thrillers made by Chabrol in the late 60searly 70s that blow apart the conservatism of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found it quite bizarre that this bizarre movie made in 1971 is rated so low and some reviews are so bad. French director Chabrol unites with french actors Michel Piccoli and Marlene Jobert and Americans Orson Welles and Anthony Perkins Perkins frequently worked with Welles. Loosely based on a mystery novel by Ellery Queen this film is excellent and should be taught in film history classes. It combines elements from European and American cinema and the final outcome is World Cinema with superb acting by Orson Welles. Welles plays his favorite Shakesperian type of character which he portrait in his films Othello Macbeth Citizen Kane Mr. Arkadin and Immortal Story which he made few years earlier. The film has good camera work excellent props statues that reminded me of the one's in Citizen Kane costumes by Karl Lagerfeld and a strange electronic score at the beginning of the film supplemented with classical music as the film progresses. I won't spoil anything by going into plot details but to sum things up this film kind of feels like Citizen Kane part 2 made in France. Welles' character Theo lives in a mansion his wife is having an affair he's lonely he's always buying expensive art and so on. Welles the filmmaker dominates this film it's quite clear that director Chabrol learned a awful lot from him the editing the music camerawork and the dramatic performances all remind me of his work. Highly recommended and it's a shame how hard it is to find a copy of this film cause Orson Welles never acted in a good motion picture after Ten Days Wonder.".

This did not play into the plot at all and I assume it was just the result of bad makeup. Or maybe he was inspired by the character from CANDIDE Dr. Pangloss.Marlne Jobert plays Welles' incredibly young wife. She seemed okay in the part.Michel Piccoli played the guy pulled into the middle of this weird family affair in more ways than one and probably came off the best for his acting.The plot is a weird twist on breaking the 10 Commandments. Over the course of the film Perkins is manipulated into breaking all 10 by his nutty adoptive father. This reminded me very much of a contemporary film with a similar plotTHE ABOMNIBLE DR. PHIBES. However despite PHIBES being a silly horror flick I think I enjoyed watching it a lot more than this Chabrol film. The film while not bad is very difficult to believe and the acting at times is a bit overthetopespecially from Perkins.

	schema:reviewBody "You would think that a movie with this pedigree  Anthony Perkins Orson Welles Michel Piccoli in the cast Claude Chabrol as director filmed in English on French locations  would be if not an arthouse success then at least a cult item. And yet Ten Days Wonder has been mostly forgotten today. It's not a great movie but it's worth seeing. Chabrol gets quite a few chances to demonstrate his virtuosity with the camera as he lets it glide and follow the characters sometimes switching from present to past. Perkins and Welles are perfectly cast and Marlne Jobert is sexy but Piccoli seems slightly uncomfortable with the English language. However the biggest problem of Ten Days Wonder is the sluggish pacing which makes the 105minute running time feel even longer for example was the scene with Welles' old mother really necessary?. Given the limited number of characters some of the twists the blackmailer.... can be guessed beforehand but others can still shock you. The final 20 minutes mark this as a very dark and bleak movie. 12 out of 4.".

Perkins and Welles are perfectly cast and Marlne Jobert is sexy but Piccoli seems slightly uncomfortable with the English language. However the biggest problem of Ten Days Wonder is the sluggish pacing which makes the 105minute running time feel even longer for example was the scene with Welles' old mother really necessary?. Given the limited number of characters some of the twists the blackmailer.... can be guessed beforehand but others can still shock you. The final 20 minutes mark this as a very dark and bleak movie. 12 out of 4.";

It is based on an Edgar Wallace novel The Feathered Serpent and is another interesting adaptation of his work see the 1938 The Terror and Dark Eyes of London. This curio has some nice horror overtones such as the statue of a feathered serpent and mummy cases that make up a creepy museum room in the house in which the action takes place.  There is also a lead character disfigured and reappearing after plastic surgery and the climax of the action takes place on Halloween night during a party in which even the band is heavily costumed.  It may be the only horror movie of the thirties to boast a real JackoLantern also. As for plot it starts with the hero of the film receiving plastic surgery and going back to his home to clear his name in the murder of his father and to bring justice to those who committed the crime.  He returns as a stranger and the action ensues and everyone is suspected. The cast is very good including a young Bette Davis and veterans like H.B. Warner and Halliwell Hobbes always on hand in this type of film.  Walter Byron is good as the disguised hero.  Allinall a fun little film with some nice atmospheric touches and a steady pace.  Recommended to those who like this sort of thriller.".

Which is where I feel the script originated from life lessons. The script of the movie is all relatable in one aspect or other.

Although the writing could have been sharper better presented and wittier it was decent enough for one to be indulged in the plot.Paul Rudd I thought was a fantastic casting. Again writing could of been better for a few of his lines where comedy was intended and some of his reactions.. but still I found him to be excellent and I enjoyed watching him.Nice to see Jack Nicholson again huge fan of One flew over the cuckoo's nest! his part was suitable if not a little long winded. I felt again wittier writing would have improved his character and performance hugely however he delivered his part.And Luke Wilson.. okay so we all know what kind of movie's he's known for now and fair enough he was a good casting for the part.

And her scene in the hospital alone was worth the price of admission to me. The ending was also well handled. This is the best Paul Rudd performance I have seen since The Shape of Things after many bad ones inbetween. Witherspoon was fine even though she didn't seem to have sizzling chemistry with Rudd  she was wonderful with Wilson. The cameo by Shalhoub as a psychiatrist was hilarious. And MarkLinn Baker was appropriately cowering as the corporate lawyer. Nicholson was fine  he felt the part even though he could have played it in his sleep. Not one of his best but more than adequate.So is this an original and groundbreaking film? No. Is it a highly enjoyable romantic comedy with good supporting performances and funny scenes? Yes!".

I liked that everything wasn't black and white in the film. There are many unanswered questions. The characters' intentions and feelings weren't absolutely clear. That's what I loved about it. It's sad that so many people disliked this film but I think it's very courageous of James l.

On the other hand the new guy Paul Rudd is depressed has no job or money and is facing prison time. And at the beginning the girl he's chasing considers him weird. His slimeballbusinessman father Jack Nicholson I think just adds likability to Rudds character. Also what I like is there is no perfect ending.

No how can you take a movie with Reese Witherspoon Paul Rudd Owen Wilson and Jack Nicholson and basically throw away their talent by wrapping it around insanely boring and random dialog? The first few times the characters think they are saying something witty that makes no sense to where the movie isn't going it is irritating.

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't walked out of a movie since the abomination that was 'The Next Best Thing' ten years ago. That was the first and only time a movie has been so appalling that I've had no other option than to flee. Tonight I came as close as I have ever been to walk out No. 2.I'll give any movie a chance. Even if it's been mauled to death by the press I like to make up my own mind. It is this openminded attitude that has caused me to spend the last 2 hours watching 'How Do You Know.' A brief plot summary Lisa Reese Witherspoon is in a bit of an emotional state after being dropped from the national women's softball team. She's having a bit of nostrings fun with Matty Owen Wilson a major league baseball star and allround playboy. Lisa is also set up on a blind date with George Paul Rudd a businessman who is being investigated by the FBI over some kind of fraud. George's father and boss Charles Jack Nicholson is tied into the same investigation and coincidentally lives in the same building as Matty. The inevitable love triangle follows. There's also a subplot involving George's pregnant assistant Annie Kathryn Hahn.I have nothing but admiration for the four main actors in this film. Reese Witherspoon is one of my favourite actresses and before today I hadn't seen her in a bad movie. Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson have both proved to be fantastic comedic actors over the past few years and Jack Nicholson is well a legend. So where did it all go wrong? There is no doubting the acting credentials of the cast so in my opinion the blame has to rest with the shockingly bad script. Though saying that the writerdirector of this mess James L. Brooks has more than proved his worth in both film and television over the years. Perhaps he was just having an off day? The problem lies in the implausibility of pretty much everything that happens in this movie. The way the characters relate to each other the way they talk  it's all so fake and completely unbelievable. I felt embarrassed for the four Alist stars who clearly struggled with the Zlist script.In the first half of the movie Lisa becomes very good friends with George. They first meet on a blind date which does not go very well. They next have a chance encounter in the elevator of the building Manny shares with George's father. Next thing you know they're best mates. For the rest of the movie Manny goes from playboy sports star to emotional softie and Lisa spends her time running between him and George suitcase in tow fretting about what to do with her life. George ends up deciding to declare his love for Lisa a woman he has met on approximately three separate occasions but it comes at a price If she loves him back his Dad will have to go to prison for 25 years and if she doesn't George will get 3 years himself no really that actually is the plot. There's a baby and a marriage proposal involving the supporting character of Annie which should be applauded for doing nothing other than distracting from the abysmal main plot.I'll remain a fan of Witherspoon Rudd Wilson and Nicholson  they're amongst the finest talent in Hollywood but should all have strong words with their agents after this travesty. As for Brooks let's hope his next work is more reminiscent of his 1997 masterpiece 'As Good As It Gets' than this garbage.I've absolutely nothing positive to say about this movie but am going to give it 1 out of 10 purely because I find Reese Witherspoon pleasing to the eye.".

It is as if everyone was working alone and never talked to each other much worse Brooks seems to have no control over them or generating something that has any coherence. Each of the parts here is very good with Witherspoon and Rudd doing some fine work and Nicholson trying to salvage whatever part he has been given but overall the results are very disappointing.What could have a sweet and intelligent story of second chances and lucky breaks turns out to be a long verbose and not very entertaining film as each of the main actors struggle to keep the narrative going. The problem is not the complexity of the material but the unnecessary amount of dialog that Brooks has come up with to explain some rather simple dilemma. The best moments in the film and there aren't many involve the limited verbal exchanges between two secondary characters when their baby is born but watching Rudd and Witherspoon handle their strained conversation is at times painful and challenging for both them and us.The problem with the dialog is that it doesn't ring true. People struggle with relationships and initial meetings but eventually the rhythm changes and a more natural flow occurs. Here everyone's pattern is the same. We can't tell one person from the other and in the end the film suffers.One last thought It could have been much better.".

	schema:headline " A warm enjoyable story";
	schema:reviewBody "Tonight it was a rainsoaked bonechilling blustery night and I wanted to find a warm comforting place to spend some enjoyable time. So I took myself to the local theater. Of the week's new offerings I chose this film to see I'll admit based almost solely on my past experiences seeing films with the principal actors we see here. As it turned out the film warmed me far more than the stingy heat in the theater. It was a very comforting presentation to enjoy on a holiday season night.One can't say a great deal about the staging of a contemporary film. After all it's not much of a challenge to capture the mundane surroundings we see every day. The film then needs something a lot more interesting injected into it to make it successful and this one succeeds marvelously. The plot concerning a downonhisluck businessman falling headoverheels for a femjock who's just received the biggest disappointment in her life is just different enough to not be boring and interesting and fun enough to hold our attention. The director James L. Brooks who also scripted and coproduced has an incredible track record for excellence as writer producer and director so it creates high expectations in a movie goer. He really delivers here with just the right nuance of sentimental warmth and comedy. Of course he didn't do it alone having some tremendous acting talent to lend a most competent hand.Being me I couldn't help but first notice the very talented captivatingly beautiful Reese Witherspoon as Lisa the athlete. Yes I can even buy her as an athlete something not every actress could carry off. She most ably and with seeming ease injected not only an unmistakable air of beautiful professional competence but a degree of class physical grace and presence that is riveting to watch. It's hard to take your eyes off of her while she's on screen and she doesn't disappoint for a single moment. Whether she's wearing a baseball uniform or elegant evening wear she's convincing as whoever she attempts. You just naturally want to like her to root for her to succeed and find that most elusive of dreams happiness. Of course as completely captivating as she is she's not on screen alone but surrounded by a lot of other great talents.Everyone seems to like Paul Rudd here as George. He's a likable everyman in the same sort of mold as Jimmy Stewart and his presence improves whatever he touches. He creates a character here that just makes you want to like him and hope he succeeds. Here he's the downonhisluck businessman who is set up for a blind date with the effervescent Ms. Witherspoon. I love them as a couple. On screen they're what a lot of people hope to be good people who find a way through life with someone else. Of course as films always do there are stumbling blocks.The first stumble is that Ms. Reese is first hooked up with a real character played by the wonderfully talented Owen Wilson as Matty the professional baseball player. He is a happy and likable guy with a simple mind and simpler morals who just can't grasp how to treat a lady  or that he really has an incredible lady right there in front of him to lose. Fun ensues and these three Witherspoon Rudd and Wilson really do have fun on screen and carry us along for the ride. NOTE One can't help but notice the quite accurate depiction of the immense difference in the way the world treats highly successful athletes of both genders. While the males are showered with obscene amounts of cash and attention the equally great or even perhaps better female athletes have to settle for little more than faint praise and a pat on the back. I was also highly entertained by a wonderful supporting cast led by none other than the legendary Jack Nicholson as Charlie Rudd's father and playing as fine a slimeball as ever graced the silver screen. Thank you Jack for giving me a villain worthy of disliking.Now add to this already fine mix the talent of Kathryn Hahn as Annie Rudd's very pregnant assistant. She adds a real element of class to what otherwise may have been a mundane role. She really hits her stride in a scene with the great character actor Lenny Venito as Al her baby's coproducer. This pair have one of those screen moments that is so terrific it comes very close to overshadowing the main plot.Other memorable performances came from Molly Price as Coach Sally even though her part was small she shone and a humorous John Tormey as the doorman and lastbutnotleast the always great Tony Shalhoub as a psychiatrist Ms. Reese almost visits. The short exchange between them is very fun to watch.Allinall it's a great film to take someone you love to during this holiday season.By Bruce L. Jones httpwebpages.charter.netbruce.jones1".

The pointless story is illogical and uninteresting with Paul Rudd performing a naive executive with the behavior of an intern or student Reese Witherspoon performing a softball player with an erratic behavior that does not justify the profile of her character and Owen Wilson completely lost in a dull character. The worst there is no chemistry among these characters. The talented Jack Nicholson performs maybe the most ridiculous role of his successful career.

Please save your time and money and rent this movie if you must see it. Otherwise don't see it at all. I have to reach a minimum of 10 lines...I don't know how this is possible. This movie was so dull and poorly written and directed that I am at a loss for words in complaining about it. We go to the movies every week almost and this movie ruined movie night.

And they worked well together on the screen. Also Owen Wilson playing Matty was well cast for that particular role. Most impressively was seeing Jack Nicholson playing Charles in this movie he truly is a diverse actor.The story in How Do You Know is basically right out of the romantic comedy cookbook two people meet and eventually get to find love and of course need to get through the obstacles along the way. Pretty textbook material there so don't expect any major newthinking in the movie. But still the story was enjoyable though at times very slow moving.There are other romantic comedies that have more meat on it so to speak. But for fans of Reese Witherspoon Paul Rudd or Owen Wilson then this movie is a good addition. I didn't mention Jack Nicholson here because he is better in other types of movies.I was entertained throughout the movie despite the long patches of endless dragging on. However I can't say that I will be putting the movie on a second time. For me it just doesn't have that much appeal.".

Based upon the 'Nurse Matilda' books by Christianna Brand the film revolves around seven motherless children who have frightened off seventeen nannies much to their overwrought father's dismay. The children are unruly and their father has his own stresses of desperately searching for a wife before his meanspirited great aunt cuts off his allowance and everything is falling apart at the seams...until Nanny McPhee enters the house to sort things out. Think of 'Mary Poppins' if Roald Dahl had written the character and you have an idea of what happens next!The best thing about this film is that while it will appeal to children it doesn't dumb down or indulge in cavityinducing sweetness that you tend to see in films produced by Hollywood. There is much humour and fun to be had but there is also a darker tone what with children being threatened with the Work House and their father speaking to corpses!The actors are all excellent. Colin Firth was perfect as this dithering man who may be meek but will do anything for his children and Emma Thompson is totally unrecognisable as the lead character of Nanny McPhee she also deserves much recognition her skills in scriptwriting this film. But it's Angela Lansbury as snooty Great Aunt Adelaide who steals the show with the way she spends much of the film with such a sour face that could curdle the milk! The children also deserve much praise especially when you consider most of them are not only very young but had never acted before. I certainly hope to see more of young Raphael Coleman who played the middle son Eric in future films as he totally threw himself into his character and was the most engaging of the children.I'd highly recommend this to people who enjoyed 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' both old and new versions and 'Matilda'. I doubt many will be disappointed with this film!".

As guessed at on another thread Nanny McPhee does teach the children  that manners matter you should be responsible for your actions and that actions have consequences. It isn't dumbed down there's certainly no 'dopey dialogue'  and there's also no annoying Americanisms as beset Charlie  the Chocolate Factory.At first glance you could imagine Emma Thompson giving a very over the top performance given the warts oversized nose and tooth. Instead she gives a careful and considered performance  everything in the right measure.Enjoy Nanny McPhee for what it is  a large dose of magical escapism with plenty of laughs for good measure. A few rude words and food fights to keep the kids and parents happy oh and a dancing donkey but overall a film that is lots of fun. Can't wait for the DVD.".

The character portrayed by Emma Thompson was simply wonderful. Even though she used her magic to get desired results from the children all one had to do was look into her eyes and see the genuine compassion she felt for the children. The whole scenario with the fairy tale books and logic behind WHY the children misbehaved to much made them not nearly as bratty as one would have expected from such behavior and actually made me feel a bit sorry for them so they became almost likable in their attitudes. They weren't just brats for the sake of being brats they had a genuine fear of losing their father which ultimately would have happened had he married that harpie Mrs. Quimby.My children absolutely loved the whole barnyard animal scene especially the dancing donkey. Second to that was the food fight at the wedding. I found this movie to be appropriate for children of ALL ages and simply enjoyable for myself as well. I highly recommend this movie!!!".

Colin Firth is such a lost soul trying to avoid everything and everyone around him. Angela Landsbury is so over the top but very funny. Together they make such an interesting trio. The love the comedy the magic and the unbelievable happy ending make it more than just a fairy tale they make it a story that makes you wish that it was all happening to you. For children it sets their minds imaginations into overdrive. It sends them to a place that lets their minds run free to believe in everything on the big screen in front of them. For just an adult I would say it would be less special as apposed to an adult who has children to watch get engaged with this magical movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a pleasant surprise much better than I anticipated. I figured Emma Thompson would be good in the title role because you can usually count on her to be entertaining in form or another cerebrally emotionally or comically. What I didn't figure on was the fun extremely colorful story overall. This was like a banana split for your senses  all kinds of wild treats for the eyes and ears.....to taste so to speak.This film features outrageous color schemes from the word go from the interior of the Brown's house to everyone's apparel to the scenery outside. It almost reminded me The Cat In The Hat with its crazy colors. All the characters are as exaggerated as the colors too. The kids may be brats but they aren't bad once they get some needed discipline and love from Nanny McPhee. They are still fun to watch and all are quite different in appearance and mannerisms. Thompson is a howl as Mary Poppinslike McPhee and so are the supporting characters. There were no sappy songs either. This is not a musical.The only character annoying to me was the kids' dad played by Colin Firth. The actor was fine but his character was so wishywashy so wussy he was barely tolerable for much of the film. By the way you might not recognize the famous Angela Lansbury in here. Everyone including her must have had a great time filming this movie. Only the final wedding segment got carried away with juvenile silliness the rest was fun for adults and well as the kids who must have loved this all the way through.This is simply good entertainment and highly recommended.".

But thankfully as Nanny McPhee progresses it twists and turns in such a pleasant fashion that by the end you'll be wondering 'Mary who?' Adapted for the screen by Thompson herself this is a fun and inventive kids film that is guaranteed to make you smile. Firth does his usually stuttering British man shtick but given he has little to do makes the most of it. Imedla Staunton Angela Lansbury and Celia Imrie ham it up shamelessly and are loads of fun. But most of the attention should be directed towards Thompson an ugly but constantly entertaining lead.The art direction visual effects and Patrick Doyle's fabulous score all soar in a confident overthetop direction as is the tone of the film. The score bythebooks though it may be is perfect and bodes well for Doyle's work on the new Harry Potter movie.Rather than basing its entirety on the naughty kids storyline McPhee jumps from plot point to plot point stuffing a whole lotta characters and twists into it's 97 minute running time. Thanks to this Thompson's endearing loveliness and a cute array of kids lead by Thomas Sangster the kid from Love Actually Nanny McPhee emerges triumphant as one of the better kids movies in recent memory mostly because the adults will love it too. And anyone who isn't enchanted by the magical ending has to have a stone for a heart.".

A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.There are seven rather naughty children who have creatively and gleefully drove away seventeen nannies who tried to tame them. But they have met their match with the hideous looking Nanny McPhee played by Emma Thompson. Thompson wrote the screenplay and with great makeup plays Nanny McPhee. Thompson is a consummate artist and is the only person ever to have won an Oscar for writing Sense and Sensibility and also to have won an Oscar for acting Howard's End. Thompson brings class to this Victorianera dark fractured fairy tale.This is a laugh out loud farce. And young people and old can share in the humor. While the film is designed for kids the adult accompanying the child will enjoy it almost as much.There are positive messages for parent and child throughout the film. The seven children are taught to listen and to be courteous and to be responsible and to think through things for themselves and you watch their behavior evolve. In the beginning goodness looks ugly to the children. But as they learn what goodness truly is it takes on a beautiful appearance.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

There is a slight resemblance to 'Mary Poppins' but 'Nanny McPhee' is very much its own film. Emma Thompson is a talented writer and she shows great understanding of children's imagination. 'Loved how the spectacular world was created. It's colourful extravagant magical and funny. The lavish sets and designs are incredibly hypnotic.Then there are actors like Emma Thompson superb Colin Firth great and Imelda Staunton hilarious who hardly ever let down. It was great to see the one and only Angela Lansbury after a very long time this time in a slightly villainous role. These actors make their characters unique. The child actors are good in their parts and Kelly MacDonald has a nice screen presence. What makes 'Nanny Mcphee' different is its sense of humour that gives it its own charm and appeal and the colourful world that it presents. I also liked the symbolic representation of Nanny McPhee's physical transformation as she successfully managed to get the children to learn the lessons. Emma Thompson wonderfully writes the screenplay as there is not one moment where I felt that the film dragged. Of course we have seen similar stories in films before but it's the presentation and treatment that makes the difference and 'Nanny Mcphee' is nothing short of a delightfully amusing family film.".

One of the most poetic understatements in any kid film occurs with the first shot an empty chair once occupied by a loving mother.Nanny McPhee arrives to teach the unruly children but the grownups have the most to learn about loss honesty and true love.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am 56 years old. I normally do not care for children's movies. Even as a child I did not care for children's movies. My movie heroes were adults.However this movie is one the rare exceptions to my stated preference.Nanny McPhee is a wonderful movie. Though it is a children's movie the script is written so that it can be enjoyed on an adult level. It reminds me somewhat of a cross between Miracle on 34th Street The Wizard of Oz and The Parent Trapthe one with Hayley Mills. It is funny poignant mysterious supernatural and fanciful.Here are some other things I enjoyed about this film 1. It treats its audience with respect. Unlike most of today's films which assume movie goers are idiots it presents a story with a logical beginning middle and ending so that if you accept the world it creates that world can be followed to its satisfying conclusion.2. The children act likechildren! No miniadults here who are filled with all Macully Caulkin knowledge and wisdom so that if onlyif onlythe adults would just simply listen to themwhy then the world would be a perfect place where everyone would just get along so well together. No these children need direction love understanding and discipline and those themes are ones this movie explores.3. It is literate. The script writer actress Emma Thompson uses language in a manner designed to communicate rather than to just make a bunch of noise while pretending to say something while saying nothing. In conclusion I earlier stated that I do not care for most children's movies. Oh there are exceptionsA Christmas Story comes to mind. So if I say it's good believe me it is good.I have purposely not revealed much of the plot. Go see the movie and allow the plot to reveal itself to you. You'll be glad if you do and you will have participated in a truly satisfying movie going experience. I promise. Cross my heart and hope to die.".

Also good to see a movie set in England with all English actors. The movie has the same feel as Mary Poppins but with cinematography that matches todays standards.

	schema:reviewBody "'Nanny McPhee' is a good movie in its own right not merely as a kid's movie or an art movie. Emma Thompson keeps on amazing us all with her screen writing she is an Oscar winner for that after all! and her acting ditto on the awards. Nanny McPhee is weird to be sure but not just weird for weird's sake such as a Tim Burton movie. Rather the weirdness seems to take real life issues and issues relating to parenting and turn them around artistically into genuine entertainment.The cast is stupendous. Colin Firth great as always. The very pleasant surprise for me was Angela Lansbury. She must be 111 by now she was already a big Hollywood star back in 1941 after all. But here she played a classic old eccentric English character SORT OF in the Margaret Rutherford vein but unique fresh and amazing in its own right. It took me half an hour to place Lansbury her character was so spoton and so wonderful. Her presence in the movie is a treat in and of itself.Children's movies have their own criteria for judgement of course. But sadly often kid movies are judged favorably if they posses a certain type of 'fairytaleness' even if the movie is otherwise a load of crap. Like the some Tim Burton movies in my humble opinion or to some extent even the recent Willy Wonka effort 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. That movie was 'ok' but was substantially dark and creepy as is most of Roald Dahl's work. But he smacks of Kid Movie Heaven so critics and parents seem to praise his stuff irrespective of its true quality. Anyway that's my view.'Nanny McPhee' is light airy and very positive. As well as being a cracker of a movie. I would take my kids to it. I think the message for kids is overall positive and something parents could be comfortable with exposing their children to.".

I can only think the current rating says more for the competition at the moment and possibly the US's penchant for British movies in general.I didn't feel that the cast really believed in it. Colin Firth and Emma T I thought were misscast. Emma T seemed terribly static. Her teeth encouraged her to hold the same pose expression all the time  something that I found unnerving after a while from such a usually fantastic actress. Suspect job of directing caused her to skimp on her own character. Colin Firth seemed totally lost as an undertaker?!! and I couldn't help thinking Hugh Laurie might have been a better choice.Overall I thought the film was uneven. The look was inconsistent and seemed to fall somewhere between Victorian period drama and Charlie and the chocolate factory. The acting was also lumpy  with some being terribly OTT such as Landsbury and Celia Imrie  and others more natural  such as Firth and the servant girl. For a film that much more successfully melds visual and acting styles see 'Lemony Snickerts Unfortunate Events'.The story itself seemed to be terribly predictable  with no surprises. And the last unforgivable crime for a film with so much UK talent  it's not very funny.".

	schema:headline " A very strong women's movie  defending strong feminist principles of the 70'ties  used as decor for the portrait of a touching lesbian love story based on actual events!";
	schema:reviewBody "The 70's was a very special period in time  in Europe as well as in the US  the flowerpower generation when young people contested everything and were confident they would realize a better world from peaceintheworld and flowersinsteadofmoneyorguns to improving working conditions and social structures up to individual lifestyles feminism gay and lesbian awareness and overall people's mentality.Clearly filmmaking was also a popular way of expressing these views and some great movies like EASY RIDER ZABRISKI POINT KRAMER VS KRAMER A CLOCKWORK ORANGE BLOW UP  were made in those days reflecting the overall spirit of that era.This dutch movie is also a very good example of a 70's movie  on a smaller scale of course and it is definitely a woman's movie reflecting strong feminists points of view.SPOILER ALERT Eve lives with her husband Ad and two children somewhere in Amsterdam. Eve seems reasonably happy although she sometimes has the feeling that there's something missing in her life. Her husband  thinking Eve is depressed  sends her on a holiday to France with her girlfriend Sonja. In the south of France on the beach Eve meets Liliane a young feminist and communedweller. Eve feels strangely drawn to Liliane. Eve and Sonja pay a visit to the rural commune in with Liliane lives and works Sonja doesn't think much of it but Eve keeps returning and seeing Liliane. When returned home Eve tries to stay in touch with Liliane by mail and she even takes up French courses. At a later point in time Liliane comes to Amsterdam for a big feminist convention and the two women meet again and spend time together. It is only then that Eve realizes that she is in love with Liliane. It is not without difficulties that Eve comes to terms with her feelings for Liliane. She decides to go for it and the two women get sexually involved. Ad finds out and he is furious.! This is a film by the dutch female film director Nouchka Van Brakel who wrote the script together with Judith Herzberg. The story was based on actual events in those days a woman lost the custody of her children to her exhusband merely because she left him to go live with another woman.The lesbian relationship is told in a very positive and understanding way. Van Brakel tells a good story and gives a fairly accurate portrait of dutch society in the 70's. But being a radical feminist herself she maybe wants to put too much in 90 minutes and as a result the film sometimes gets a little messy. On the whole the movie is still very worth watching as an image of an area  the flowerpot years  and also for the true and tender lesbian love story. But it is definitely a women's movie! Especially lesbians will love this true 70's story! The actress portraying Eve dutch Monique van de Ven gives an excellent performance she even came to the US in the 80's with her husband at that time Jan De Bondt also of dutch origin but Monique unlike Jan didn't like living in the US! The couple divorced and Monique returned to The Netherlands where up 'till now she is still very active in films and on TV. De Bondt stayed in the US and became famous SPEED TWISTER.".

The plot line is similar in both movies a married woman leaves her home for pursuing a relationship with a woman. But the broad difference is that in Lianna there was no conflict placed between her role as a mother and her own sexual identity but it is this conflict which is addressed in the present film. The woman Eve faces a custody battle when it is revealed that she has an affair with a woman and is about to leave her husband. She emphatically states that her sexual identity has not hampered her maternal competency and it is perhaps her argument that as a mother she continues to be primarily responsible for her kids irrespective of whether she is heterosexual or lesbian that she attains temporary custody. However all her efforts to convince the court for permanent entitlement to her children ultimately fails when the husband announces a second marriage. Undoubtedly it appears to the court that the children would have a 'healthy' and a 'normal' upbringing in a heterosexual environment. Overall 'A Woman Like Eve' was a progressive movie for its time and even today continues to hold relevance as a commentary on a homophobic society and the difficult choices for women who choose to love differently especially on lesbian mothers.".

He is unusual insofar as these gialli are concerned because he's unsure of himself not certain if he should stay with his job and makes many mistakes. Then again his adversary here is a bit unusual too a killer who paralyzes his victims with an acupuncturist's needle in the back of the neck before ever so slowly and excruciatingly...for this viewer anyway slicing their abdomens open. For the life of me I could not figure out where this picture was headed or what it had on its mind forget about figuring out the identity of the killer! Thus I just sat back and enjoyed the ride and was pleased when everything did congeal plotwise at the end. And there ARE many things to enjoy here. Tellini is played by Giancarlo Giannini a year before he would commence a string of some half dozen hits with director Lina Wertmuller that would catapult him to international stardom. He is as fine an actor as has ever appeared in a giallo film and he is here surrounded by some truly gorgeous women including no less than three formerfuture Bond girls Barbara Bouchet whose exposed superperky buttocks automatically earn this film 5 stars! Claudine Domino Auger and Barbara Bach here looking younger than I've ever seen her. Other things to enjoy a creepy arrhythmic discordant score by the great Ennio Morricone flashy direction by Paolo Cavara some good action scenes I love that threeway rooftop chase and like I mentioned a meaty story to sink your mental teeth into. Not to mention those grisly murders! Don't believe the Maltin book which gives a paltry 1 12 stars to the cut 88minute version of this film. Check out this finelooking uncut DVD from Blue Underground with excellent subtitles and extras for a unique and exciting giallo experience.".

Other things to enjoy a creepy arrhythmic discordant score by the great Ennio Morricone flashy direction by Paolo Cavara some good action scenes I love that threeway rooftop chase and like I mentioned a meaty story to sink your mental teeth into. Not to mention those grisly murders! Don't believe the Maltin book which gives a paltry 1 12 stars to the cut 88minute version of this film. Check out this finelooking uncut DVD from Blue Underground with excellent subtitles and extras for a unique and exciting giallo experience.";

While there is such a gimmick used here it nearly isn't as interesting as it sounded. The gimmick of course is the killer using acupuncture needles to paralyze the victims like this special wasp does to the black tarantula. And that is it. The title sounds more intriguing than it is. The movie contains enough moments to maintain a certain tension. But without red herrings it is actually pretty easy to pick out the killer. In good Giallos they often give hints and clues in making you think who the suspect is and then hit you with this amazing twist that turns everything upside down and still make sense. Black Belly... lacks serious suspects so basically everyone could be the killer. Very sloppy or lazy and no fun whatsoever. This movie doesn't even try to make sense of the killer's actions which usually should be the key element in unfolding the killer's identity. Apart from the beautiful women this movie isn't special. Is it a waste of time then? Nonot really. But one familiar with the genre does expect more creativity. The main character also starred as Matis in the last two Bond movies which sort of gives this movie more glamour. Overall this movie just lacks the punch I expect to be in a giallo movie.".

There's very little build up to any of the crimes therefore there's no suspense. The acting is fine particularly by Giannini as a world weary police inspector.

	schema:reviewBody "My God! The opening scene alone is worth the price of admission! Barbara Bouchet being given a nude body massage while Ennio Morricone's score hightened by Edda Del Orso's seductive vocals explores our aural senses is nearly the best opening I've ever seen... period! Paolo Cavara's brilliant Giallo The Black Belly Of The Tarantula is definately special. The film contains a beautiful Euro Babe cast that would please James Bond afficianados everywhere. It contains three Bond Girls in one film! The wonderful Claudine Auger Thunderball Barbara Bouchet Casino Royale and Barbara Bach The Spy Who Loved Me all lending shady perversity to the proceedings. The title refers to the sadistic means in which a killer is performing on his prey. An acupuncture needle is inflamed with a paralysing poison that the killer inserts into the neck of his victim realistically this would probably kill someone but hey... this is an Italian B Movie!! thus insuring that the victim is paralysed yet concience while the killer tears open their belly with a knife eehhh...hella creepy!. The story primarily surrounds the investigation by Inspector Tellini well acted by Giancarlo Giannini of the murder of Maria Zani Barbara Bouchet who was being blackmailed before her death. Other murders follow as the Inspector's trail leads to a Fashion Boutique a Science Laboratory and then a Health Spa which are all linked to drug traffiking and sexual deviant politics. Like What Are Those Strange Drops Of Blood Doing On Jennifer's Body this film as well could be a kind of prototype Giallo film. If you are familiar with the genre you can only laugh at the way the victim always says to the Inspector I can't talk right now... but I think I know who the killer is. Come back later or tomorrow and I'll tell you. another equally laughable sentence is I just want to check something out but I'll meet you later! This line is usually a recipe to get yourself gutted and tortured in the most painful of ways. Also like What Are Those... this film again has the theme of moral avenger quite often this theme is linked with something resembling impotence... c'mon you got to laugh at that! that strikes out on the poor girls with viciousness. I'm still trying to sort out if this is somehow linked to the cynicism surrounding Catholicism in Italy? But the killer's use of fetishistic surgical gloves only insures that this is pure EuroTrash at it's best.Giancarlo Giannini's Inspector Tellini is a slightly different breed of cop. The film interestingly delves further then most Gialli into the relationship of him and his wife Anna played by the beautiful Stefania Sandrelli and the moodiness surrounding his job. He neurotically says I just don't think I can do this anymore. I want to quit. echoing my own displays of verbal discontent in the work world as my girlfriend pointed out And in the end when Inspector Tellini loses his cool as the killer gets closer to getting to his wife!This is a great little Giallo which unfortunately is a tad hard to find in America. But I nevertheless highly recommend it to those who love weird and twisted little masterpieces that come from a country of machisimo mentality. And the music score is to die for!!!!".

He loves his wife but is dedicated to his police work above anything else and is away from home a lot so this leaves his wife a little unhappy at times. Pressure on their marriage is rising but when the killer targets him and his wife his blas attitude towards life won't do the trick anymore.This is a fine Giallo with great cinematography and style to burn. And I'm very forgiving when a film opens with a bucknaked Barbara Bouchet parading around in the first five minutes. Definitely one the better gialli made beautifully filmed gorgeous sets a sumptuous score by Ennio Morricone and on top of it three Bondgirls Barbara Bouchet CASINO ROYALE Claudine Auger THUNDERBALL and Barbara Bach THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.The film boasts some superb and highly stylized cinematography with evocative use of locations by Marcello Gatti who lensed THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS five years previous and would later work on Polanski's WHAT. The film has a rather unusual setting with many scenes filmed in Rome around modernist housing blocks. It's a shame so few of Paolo Cavara's other films are available on DVD. Perhaps Black Belly is not covering any new ground but as far as perfection in Giallo mysteries goes this comes very close.Giannini looks a bit bored throughout the whole film. Perhaps he is contemplating about his appearance in yet another Italian Bmovie. Speaking of Giannini what's the deal with that little mustache he's cultivating? He looks almost exactly like Alain Delon in LE CERCLE ROUGE made just a year earlier.Camera Obscura  810".

	schema:reviewBody "Inspector Tellini Giancarlo Giannini must investigate the bizarre murder of two seemingly unconnected women paralysed by their killer so that they may be horrifically violated while conscious.It has often been said that Italian cinema is all style and no plot but here is a definite example to the contrary. 'The Black Belly of the Tarantula' is indeed a stylish Italian offering laced with some truly exquisite photography and novel camera trickery but it also consists of a strong plot that surprises and captivates while maintaining a profound aura of trepidation. It is however perhaps the most apparent downfall in the film that the plot becomes the central focal point as several aspects to the story are left unexplored subsequently leaving no acceptable closure of the respective plot aspect. Unfortunately because of this the prevalent incoherency of Italian cinema is once again revisited and due to the nature of the film it is perhaps more difficult than usual to ignore. With this in mind one should realise that the central storyline is stark enough to arouse and preserve viewer interest while only the subplots weaken the overall presentation of the film.Despite the mainly superficial criticisms one can direct at the film 'The Black Belly of the Tarantula' still takes a firm position as one of the finer examples of this particular brand of Italian filmmaking. Unquestionably the opening thirty minutes are immensely powerful offering some of the most intimidating murder sequences ever confined to the cinematic medium. The use of gloomy visuals pointofview shots intentionally disorientating photography a wonderful musical score blending both prominence and subtlety and a lavish use of dark colours and shadows creates an almost unsurpassed eerie and brutal ambiance to accompany the violent actions depicted on screen and the shrill short terrifying shrieks of the killer's victims seek only to underline the artistic craftsmanship of the picture. The brusque transition to silence that immediately follows the first attack of the murderer in each individual case is so overwhelmingly haunting that the following actions are immeasurably disturbing in their tranquillity. Undoubtedly these sequences are the pinnacle of creativity from Paolo Carvara in this picture sublime in their splendour and disconcerting in their substance.The most apt way to summarise 'The Black Belly of the Tarantula' would be to simply describe it as flawed genius. Arguably too plotheavy and with an unmistakably clichd outcome the superlative qualities fortunately shine through and leave the film as impressive not disappointing. Perhaps those more highly versed in the Italian Giallo will appreciate the effort and artistry slightly more than others but in any case 'The Black Belly of the Tarantula' is worthy viewing for all fans of cinema. 710".

After that get ready for a huge disappointment.";

	schema:headline " Sadistic and brutal  just like Giallo should be!";
	schema:reviewBody "Black Belly of the Tarantula is both a great thriller in its own right and surely one of the best entries in the Giallo cycle. The film is reminiscent of several like it but this one is the most cerebral and most sadistic Giallo I've seen. The modus operandi of the killer at the centre of the story involves jabbing his victim with a poison laced needle which induces paralysis. He then proceeds to gut them while they're still alive and unable to do anything about it! Director Paolo Cavara seems to realise just how malicious this plot is and so the film is not gratuitous. The reliance on the idea behind the murders is far more shocking than any amount of gore so it doesn't matter that there isn't a lot of the red stuff. Typically the film works from an extremely convoluted plot which sees a woman who is also a member of a private health club become the victim of blackmail. Around the same time dead bodies start piling up and our hero an insecure police detective by the name of Tellini learns that the murders are done in the style of the black wasp killing a tarantula...As ever with Giallo the film isn't particularly easy to follow as there's so much going on that it's easy to miss one or two key plot elements. This is however far better than having too little going on and unlike many Giallo's at least this one mostly resolves everything by the conclusion. There's a very potent stream of sleaze running throughout the film also as if the killer's methods weren't enough on their own. The film features plenty of sex and it will please some to learn that many of the murders are depicted with the female victim in the nude. The murder scenes themselves are well orchestrated and director Paolo Cavara delights in showing us the gentle way that the paralysis needle slips into the victims' necks before having their stomachs ripped open with a hunting knife. The cinematography is superb and it's safe to say that Black Belly of the Tarantula is one of the better looking Giallo films out there. The locations bode well with the film's style and scenes that take place on a rooftop and in a luxury swimming pool provide visual treats. Overall I don't hesitate to name Black Belly of the Tarantula as one of the best Giallo's that I've seen and it comes highly recommended!".

And if you know a little something about Italian horror cinema you'll agree that there are far worse titles out there to get compared with than these two! This is a masterfully staged and creatively scripted murder mystery with bloodyyettense massacres and likable characters for once. A gloved psychopath is killing models of fashion house by paralyzing their nerve systems before slicing them open with a knife. This ingenious modus operandi he borrowed from the killing rituals of a wasp species that hunts tarantula spiders. The young police inspector Tellini investigates the crimes but his own life and that of his beloved wife are soon endangered by the culprit as well. This Italian horror gem features one of Ennio Morricone's finest musical scores and director Paolo Cavara professionally stuffs his film with typical giallointrigues like drugs sexual deceit and blackmail. The girls are beautiful and showing lots of ravishing naked flesh the suspense is omnipresent and class actor Giancarlo Giannini makes a perfectly credible police hero. Black Belly of the Tarantula contains a handful of powerful sequences that fans of horror genre will consider pure craftsmanship like the rooftop chase and the superviolent climax. It's not easy to come across a decent copy but try your best as this is essential viewing for all giallobuffs!".

And I didn't know YouTube would exist either. We were all young and nave back then. If there was a generic starters pack for giallo newbies I'd definitely include this one. It's a straightforward giallo plot as in it has one maskedglovedhatted killer plenty of suspects a couple of red herrings a clue at the start of the film quirky characters nudity and a bit of gore. It doesn't deviate from the formula but it's a good film anyway thanks to Ennio Morricone's music the lovely cinematography and some good moustache action from Giacarlo Giannini.It all starts off with Barbara Bouchet a Bond girl getting a nude massage from a blind guy and then getting into a fight with her husband because someone's sent him a nude picture of her with a mystery man.

It doesn't help that he's the laughing stock of the force when the killer plants some evidence that turns out to be a covertly made film of the policeman and his wife in bed. There's a neat rooftop chase in this one too and although it's a case of one killer all the way through it makes for a good journey all the way through thanks to appearances by Claudine Auger a Bond girl and Barbara Bach a Bond girl and Giancarlo Prete not a Bond girl. There's also the requisite scene in a fashion store amongst mannequins that these films seem to require by law.".

The trailer seemed a tad murky but I'm generally easy to please...so I gave it a shot.Big mistake. Black Belly of the Tarantula is one of those films whose synopsis sounds so good...but the film is a mess. It is unbelievably tedious and uninvolving with a disjointed plot that makes you wonder if the script wasn't tossed into a blender before being filmed.Only the leading man detective role is defined.

I can tell you that between agonizing passages of boy meets girl babble there is the occasional throwaway perfunctory murder.These murder scenes are described as wildly diabolical and violent in all the reviewswhy? They are very brief and consist of one quick injection with an acupuncture needle followed by one slow cut by a halfknife. So what? There's no suspense and you don't know or care about anyone whose dying.For me the only interesting aspect was the inclusion of actor Montgomery Glenn who appeared in several '60s Italian thrillers with Barbara Steele and here plays a small supporting role. They give him very little to do.The Big Finale was a huge pile of nothing...quite underwhelming. No spoilers here but suffice it to say it will leave you saying huh? just like the rest of this snoreinducing epic.Right up there with the equally indifferent yawner Case of the Yellow Scorpion.".

The trailer seemed a tad murky but I'm generally easy to please...so I gave it a shot.Big mistake. Black Belly of the Tarantula is one of those films whose synopsis sounds so good...but the film is a mess. It is unbelievably tedious and uninvolving with a disjointed plot that makes you wonder if the script wasn't tossed into a blender before being filmed.Only the leading man detective role is defined.

The ending as with many gialli also falls somewhat flat  but then this does tend to be a typically style over substance genre.Bad bits aside what is good? There is plenty to love about this film the brilliant cinematography the menacing scene with a spider dangled over the detective the horribly perverse gloves and menacing acupuncture needle of the killer. The music score is also one of Ennio Morricone's finest and it certainly adds a decidedly chilling air to the film.Oddly or not so I was reminded of Aldo Lado's Short Night of the Glass Dolls also from 1971 also featuring Barbara Bach...and also with a strong theme of paralysis and murder. I'd say Lado's film carries the theme off with more aplomb  with it's truly horrific ending so I'd advised all who've seen this to give that a go.".

These murders are linked to a blackmailing scam regarding a stud under the employ of the boss of a health spa who convinces clientle to sleep with him while another takes photographs. When the husband of his murdered nympho wife goes after her adulterous lover Tellini will have to find both of them before it gets really out of hand. Who is the murderer of the female clientle photographed and certain women who are involved heavily in the blackmailing scam? If that wasn't enough to burden Tellini he finds that the killer had videotaped him making love to his wife in the bedroom of their apartment..which insures the detective that his wife's life could be in danger.Well paced excitingly photographed giallo entry has an interesting enough premise especially in how the killer murders his victims with them well aware of what is happening to them and who it is doing them in. The plot unfolds nicely even if the end result is strictly soso. Giannini is quite good as the wornout cop beaten down by the case he's working on. Some lovely ladies in the cast including Barbara Bouchetas the nymphofirst victim Barbara Bachas an employee at the spa kneedeep in trouble for her involvement in the blackmailing scam Stefania Sandrellias the detective's beautiful and loyal wife Claudine Augeras the main culprit of the blackmailing scam and boss who runs the health spa.The film's main problem is the twist regarding the identity isn't too difficult to figure out once certain suspects are eliminated earlier on. The murders in this case are quite potent and shocking especially in how the killer likes to plunge his knife into the torsos of the victims after they are paralyzed. The title refers to the method a wasp commits when it paralyzes and disembowels a tarantula as it relates to the psycho's killing style.".

The Black Belly of the Tarantula is one of the better known examples so long as you pretend Dario Argento and Mario Bava don't exist for a moment. Because gialli not helmed by Argento or Bava strove for killer offings rather than smartly nourished whodunit charades and unfortunately for this film which often seems to rank high on those blood soaked best giallo lists does nothing more than pale in comparison to all those damned Argento and Bava pictures. Stylish to a fault but also shoddily dubbed acted written and directed it intrigues for bits and pieces those bits and pieces being the murders themselves and then leaves us in the cold with Giancarlo Gianni who despite his later Oscar fame turns charisma into emotionless leaden material with just the bat of an eyelash.As in all decent giallo films The Black Belly of the Tarantula details a series of murders all involving attractive women and cringey circumstances. The killer maniacal and sex obsessed a shock practices a particularly cruel method of slaughter  in addition to his butcher knife he brings along a needle dipped in black wasp venom causing paralysis for anyone who gets the stuff in their bloodstream. That way his victims are forced to remain defenseless as they watch and feel their insides get ripped open. What a joy! Vomits.Young woman after young woman is stalked and slashed each murder is edited with such impressive precision crosscutting is as wellexecuted as an excruciating longshot that we can't help but want to applaud Paolo Cavara for taking a route authentically suspenseful rather than hackish. But I digress. As the madman sneakily wanders around eyeing potential victims the killings themselves are being investigated by Inspector Tellini Gianni a young policeman not so sure he can stomach such a high amount of atrocities for much longer.While The Black Belly of the Tarantula keeps us interested with its frenzied mystery meetsgore approach nonexistent are the normally intoxicating images presented by most gialli. Aside for cleancut edits and assertively framed shots mostly found within the scope of a murder the film is mostly dry thrilling only when action is present. In better giallo pictures such as Suspiria and The Bird with the Crystal Plumage both directed by Argento terror is always part of the atmosphere  distinctively nightmarish imagery after all is what makes giallo so much finer than your average slasher. The Black Belly of the Tarantula oft threatens to be your average slasher  so thank goodness so much attention is put into how the killings are shot. Otherwise we'd have a bad case of sexanddeath 101 nobody wants. But aside from a grouping of inventive offings the second victim's demise photographed in a clothing store cleverly inserts dolllike mannequins to mirror the soontobe dead woman's paralyzed helplessness The Black Belly of the Tarantula is nothing more than a subpar giallo. Considering it was made as a cashin ready to imitate the success of The Bird with the Crystal Plumage at the time it's only fitting that it hardly compares to the best of Dario Argento and Mario Bava. Dammit!  there are those names again.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film depicts Oslo as a rather rundown city which as far as I can remember it is not and as for the Norwegian Postal Service ...well that seems to be struggling along if we can judge by the unreliable antics of Roy Robert Skjaerstad one of the young postmen. He not only opens and reads private mail but also lets himself into an apartment when he finds a key left in a mailbox. His exploration of the rooms leaves little time for delivering letters so he dumps the contents of his bag in a railway tunnel. The irony of the situation is that he is awarded a gold watch for bravery in attendance to his duties after being badly beaten up in the streets. The originality of the story is completely charming as it blends romance suspense and comedy in which Roy seems to get involved at every turn. One scene I particularly like is the one in which a locomotive almost runs him down in the tunnel and scatters his letters high and wide like a flurry of snowflakes. It's just one of many quaint scenes. In another scene he is on the point of being gunned down in his own grungey apartment when nearby jackhammers reverberate throughout the whole building giving him the opportunity to make his getaway. There is a suspenseful moment when he slips an iron bar through the doorhandles of a public toilet imprisoning a frantic gunman.  Unfortunately for Roy always a loser it seems his inscribed wrist watch falls off in his struggle and so the gunman is eventually able to trace his whereabouts. The film is short and sweet well worth watching. It has a lot of originality in the script and the acting is first class.  The film suggests we should look under our beds before retiring .  One never knows who may be hiding there...particularly in Oslo.".

	schema:reviewBody "A postman is like a taxidriver a medium of connecting people and places. Like the taxi driver the postman lives a vicarious life he sees others living theirs but has no part in it himself.  Any inherent bias towards solitude thus becomes intensified.  Unlike other people who generally stay in their allotted social position  in work home and play  the postman and taxi driver are mobile and fluid they are urban creatures who can unite people classes places that normally would remain apart.If there is one genre that depends on connection crossclass and space mobility it is the detective genre.  A detective needs to be able to connect disparate clues and suspects into the single narrative of a crime. 'Junk mail' begins with a crime filmed with some urgency as a couple mug a security guard and steal a large amount of money.  This is to the audience a random inexplicable act  we don't know who any of these characters are and why they are in this situation.The next sequence introduces the film's protagonist the postman.  Not only does he have the advantages outlined above but he has that third most vital prerequisite for a detective he is a voyeur.  He spies on people in shops.  He opens their mail.  He breaks into their houses and examines their things.  By mixing his job and his personal perversions he is able to explain that opening sequence find the clues and piece them together.Normally the detective is a moral force  he restores social order after the violation of a crime.  But Roy is himself a criminal and it is Line's shoplifting that attracts him to her.  One way a detective solves a crime is by imagining himself as the criminal e.g. Sherlock Holmes in disguise.  Roy is the least appealing 'hero' of modern cinema filthy in personal habits antisocial the kind of cynical cowardly brute who violates those who through their own sins have no legal redress.But he is also a nonentity a comic scene of humiliation at work reveals him to have no talent whatsoever.  Not even his nominal despised girlfriend can think of one positive attribute.  When we first see him he is being bullied by a superior.  His illegalities are all about invading others' lives or entering identities because he has none of his own.  When he breaks into Line's apartment he tries to imagine what it is like to be her to the point where he unwittingly falls asleep on her bed.  He even steals her tastes for his own when they first consciously meet.  He is Chesterton's invisible man also a postman  unnoticed because he's always there.Like many recent alienated urban heroes 'Chopper' 'Bleeder' etc. Roy is a child of Travis Bickle and the look of the film has the lurid sickly colour of 'Taxi Driver' the city as vomit with Roy hurtling towards his own warped redemptive rescue.  But there is a vision of Oslo as a dank rundown bureaucracy similar to the Czech comedies of the 1960s or more obviously Orwell or 'Brazil' that bespeaks a more social purpose  this is not the film the Norwegian tourist board will be distributing.  The glum scene where Roy is awarded a watch for bravery having been attacked by thugs his strap got caught in his panicked hurry to oblige is comically reminiscent of Kaurismaki.".

	onyx:emotionText "A postman is like a taxidriver a medium of connecting people and places. Like the taxi driver the postman lives a vicarious life he sees others living theirs but has no part in it himself.  Any inherent bias towards solitude thus becomes intensified.  Unlike other people who generally stay in their allotted social position  in work home and play  the postman and taxi driver are mobile and fluid they are urban creatures who can unite people classes places that normally would remain apart.If there is one genre that depends on connection crossclass and space mobility it is the detective genre.  A detective needs to be able to connect disparate clues and suspects into the single narrative of a crime. 'Junk mail' begins with a crime filmed with some urgency as a couple mug a security guard and steal a large amount of money.

However City Hunter will only take the job if Emily promises him some 'nookie' inbetween much to Kaori's dismay. It seems like an easy situation take the easy job get the easy money then take it easy. But when Falcon informs Kaori during a trip to the grocery store that someone from Los Angeles has arrived to kill City Hunter she and Ryo begin to suspect that Emily is not all she really appears to be. What is her real agenda? Is she really a coldblooded assassin who has something personal against Ryo? Why is the C.I.A. taking an interest in City Hunter's client?

Knowing how long Sophia longed for a child one felt great sympathy for her as she diapered her many children in order to stay out of jail.  Italy had a law similar to the English' of 'pleading her belly' to which Sophia and Marcello conform through the births of seven children. The tale of the young priest the prostitute and the increasingly frustrated 'client' is very well acted and you can feel the mounting passion of poor Mastroanni as every act gets interrupted at the worst moment.Of course I love looking at the towns of Naples Milan and Rome with all the old streets 'unspoiled' by the modernization of today.  Check this one out for some excellent acting in widely divergent roles for both Loren and Mastroanni.

The direction of De Sica is superb the acting of Mastroianni and Loren is unique and in the second and third stories we recognize the subtle and superior hand of their author the great Zavattini. The first story takes place in a very typical popular neighbourhood of Naples where a cigarette pedlar and smuggler Sofia Loren discovers that the way of not going to jail for failing to pay a fine is to get pregnant over and over and giving birth to one child after another with the problems this brings to her exhausted husband Mastroianni. The second story shows us an aristocratic Milanese rich lady who to escape her boring life gets herself a lover on a social stratum lower to hers and finishes by valuing her Rolls Royce car more than her lover. This is perhaps the not so good of the three stories because it lacks some strength in terms of plot. Finally the third story maybe the best of the three is sometimes delirious and hallucinating in its very funny rhythm Loren's acting is fabulous here and tells us about a luxury prostitute living near the Piazza Navona in Rome who nevertheless has a soft heart and with whom a neighbour young seminarist falls in love while she plays a game of pull and let go with one of her clients who is anxious to take her to bed most unsuccessfully. This story has a surprising end and a fascinating scene of striptease incomplete of course. You'll have a very amusing time watching this movie.".

All three of the stories showcase one of Loren's great talents  her aweinspiring beauty.I was lucky to have seen this in Italian with subtitles. The Italian language is so beautiful. I loved hearing it spoken and to see the Italian scenery along with it.The first story is about a woman who keeps getting pregnant to avoid going to prison for not paying for furniture she purchased. She ends with 7 kids and a husband so worn out he can barely walk. Meanwhile with each birth she becomes more beautiful. It's either the longest story or it went on the longest  it's not the most interesting of the three.The second story involves a rich woman with no regard for anyone but herself and her money even though she talks a different game entirely to her new boyfriend as they're driving. She keeps bumping into people with her car. When she lets the boyfriend drive he crashes the car rather than a hit a child and she has a fit. A real nasty piece of work.The third story is really the best  Loren is a highclass prostitute who befriends a young man studying for the priesthood. He's staying with his vicious grandmother in the apartment across from hers. The grandmother flings insults at Loren. Meanwhile one of Loren's steadies Mastroianni can't get to first base with her because she's so distracted. This vignette is famous for Loren's hot striptease which she repeats for Mastroianni again in 1994's Pret a Porter. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren are excellent in all of their roles set against the beauty of the Italian locales. Loren is gorgeous in fact beyond gorgeous particularly in the last sequence. Even today she manages to dazzle. There's something about her that no American actress can even approximate.This film may have been a little overrated in its day but it is certainly well worth seeing.".

Lauren is the principal breadwinner for her family selling black market cigarettes and committing other illegal acts to make ends meet.  To avoid jail she merely need remain pregnant which her semiemployed husband Carmine Mastroianni is expected to chip in with.

Chastised by his wife for his weakness Mastroianni despairs while Adelina  almost produces number nine with Carmine's best friend luckily nothing happens. Lauren's luck and the appeal processes are eventually exhausted Adelina does go to a jail that better frankly  than the average Motel 6.  Carmine in the mean time contacts the press and the Pope really everyone and finally Sophia is sprung.  During her internment Mastroianni apparently recovers his strength and the movie ends with the certainties that he got his thang back' and that at least to 1963 eyes things in Naples would never change. At the time the movie was lauded for its unsubtle criticism of the Catholic Church's birth control policies policies which it was reasoned contributed to high birth rates poverty apathy and  laziness of Naples. Arguably the best segment of the movie and by far the longest. Anna Of Milan The weakest of the three segments though not without charm.  This segment basically has no plot whatsoever.  Sophia Lauren is Anna a rich bored woman who has married an industrialist and has time and amore to spare especially as her rich husband travels.  A lot. Mastroianni plays Renzo a writer with a curious haircut and a raincoat a man appalled by Lauren's focus on money yet still a man!  Come on we're talking Sophia Lauren.. One fine Sunday the pair travel to the country in her new Rolls this episode is almost a commercial for that particular brand Renzo passing the time chiding Anna for her materialism in between bouts of desire.  Lauren insists that she wants to go somewhere anywhere to get away from all this.' Really she insists she could give up money at any time  and as a token of her good faith on this point  allows Mastroianni to drive. Eventually overwhelmed by so much woman and horsepower Renzo crashes almost killing a child selling flowers on the roadside.  The Rolls' in flames Anna flips out her only concern the car she even insists that use HIS clothes to douse the flames! Returned to her senses by the crash Anna shows through her anger that her true love is the Lira especially when she rides off into the Milanese sunset with another swinger  a short guy  in a Lancia.  The Rolls abandoned for repairs on the roadside Renzo buys some flowers from the almost runover little flower peddler who asks if it's really a Rolls?' The day's stock results are announced on the Roll's radio as Mastroianni walks bemusedly out of camera very effective shot discarding the flowers on the roadside.  While too obvious  money is the poison of today' the curious scenery and some fine acting make this episode enjoyable if lightweight. Mara Of Rome This famous episode stars Lauren as Mara an upscale hooker and is frankly hilarious and a treat for the eyes.    What incredibly beautiful cinematography this episode employs! There are two themes in this episode Mastroianni's Rusconi' son of a wealthy industrialist from Bologna is wild about Mara   and the camera by the way is wild about Mastroianni who is murderously handsome. Unfortunately something always arises to interrupt his love  especially the second theme namely The crush on Mara of her shy young neighbor a gorgeous young man being sent to a seminary by his tiny little grandparents who seem to want him there for his own good and just maybe their own finances. One comic turn after another arises to prevent Rusconi's union with Mara on one occasion hounded on the phone by his Father in Bologna Rusconi insists that he is not an idiot' and then reminds his Dad that you have to bribe the minister first.  That's why it is called a bribe.'  Showing great capacity as a comic actor on a level with his dramatic turns Mastroianni really puts the 'S' in star power and is hilariously funny. Tired of the what next?' Mastroianni swears off Mara and says he is leaving forever.  In the meantime the selfrighteous Grandma next door accuses Mara of being a common whore and homewrecker who is ruining her young man and promises to evict her.  In reality it was the shy young man who made a Roman roof top approach asking Lauren if she would go to the beach with him she is noncommittal. Enraged by the Grandma Lauren fires back How can anyone judge HER  after all she is very choosy about the men she sleeps with. Mastroianni returns  duh! stating that  he kept thinking about Mara. Finally the young man's affairs are sorted  poor Rusconi forced into action as peacekeeper and neighborly relations restored.  As a reward Lauren performs a very famous  and rather tame in fact strip tease for Rusconi whose bynow ruined nervous system leads to a series of hilarious faces.  About to dish out the REAL reward however Lauren recalls she has made a vow of chastity for just two weeks'. This segment while perhaps overtly addressing hypocrisy the grandparent's is in my opinion really about nothing but fine acting gorgeous faces and glorious Rome.  A great moment in Cinema and by far my favorite segment.".

However it is very funny in parts and is pointedly critical of Italian society in the boom years of the 1960s. Also Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni are absolutely stunning to watch.For people interested in Italy it is a fascinating commentary on the country that can border on stereotype. Naples De Sica's hometown is warm and happy and filled with clever types ready to outwit the system and find their own way to happiness. Milan is cold rich and callous. Rome is dominated by the Catholic church and the State with plenty of hypocrisy and corruption. But De Sica finds some humor in all of this.I found it a little too sentimental but well worth watching. I wish a better undubbed print were available. De Sica's career was given a boost by the success of the movie and he would continue to make more great films like The Garden of the FinziContini's and the underrated A Brief Vacation that focus on the injustices of the State and the hardships faced by working people.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is made up of three separate vignettes starring Sophia Loren and Morcello Mastrianni playing three different couples. Each segment differs greatly as far as their length and quality.The first is the longest and for me the least interesting. It's about a woman who continues to have baby after baby after baby in order to stay out of prison for a petty crime. Considering she ultimately had 7 kids in the process the story seems to drag on and on. She could have done it once or twice or even three times but the skit went on and on with not nearly enough payoff.The second is by far the shortest and is about a selfish spoiled rich brat. It's mildly interesting but that's about all.The final skit makes the movie. If it weren't for this one the movie might have been scored a 4 or 5. It's about a prostitute who has turned the head of a young man in training to be a priest. At the same time Mastriani is a customer who is again and again and again thwarted in his goal of bedding Loren. It may not sound funny based on the description but it's very entertaining and her striptease is very sexy to say the least! My overall impression of the movie is only fair. I think that's because I am a BIG fan of the earlier NeoRealistic films directed by DeSica. They are almost totally different from this moviehaving none of the expensive production values or polished actors. However they were simply better movies. If you compare UMBERTO D. MIRACLE IN MILAN or any of his other NeoRealistic films of the 40s they show the director at the top of his form. Ieri oggi domani just looks contrived and ordinary in comparison.".

	schema:reviewBody "YESTERDAY TODAY AND TOMORROW. Three short films about sex starring the two top Italian stars of the day Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni and directed by Vittorio De Sica. In the first part Sophia plays a pregnant woman who may have to go to prison for selling contraband on the street. However after speaking to a friend who is a lawyer she and her husband find that the government cannot send a pregnant woman to prison. So Marcello has his work cut out for him as soon as the new baby is born. Very soon she is pregnant again then again and againseven times in all and keeping her out of jail the whole time  that is until Marcello runs out of gas. Very charming and funny episode. In the second episode Marcello is having an affair with married Sophia playing a completely self serving rich snob. Almost the entire film takes place in her Rolls Royce as they head for another sexual escape while the rich husband is away. That is until they have a car accident. The third episode the most famous is the story of a high priced call girl Loren who is trying to arrange time for her best john Mastroianni who also is in love with her. In the house next door however is a young man who is studying to be a bishop and is questioning his path in life particularly after he watches Loren in a skimpy lacy outfit watering her plants on the outside deck. The boy and his mother a very selfrighteous woman who abhors Loren's character keep getting in the way of Marcello's time with Sophia. When things are finally worked out with the boy and his mom Sophia does her famous strip for Marcello who is sitting on her bed bouncing up and down in delight in response to Sophia's every move. It's a very funny scene and the episode isn't bad but of the three the first one the pregnant woman story is the most entertaining. All three stories had something interesting to say about sex in Italy of that time in particularly the second story about the rich woman having the affair but it was the least entertaining of the three. The thing that was good about all of them was how different the six characters created by Sophia and Marcello were. Vittorio De Sica's direction was superb. The music and cinematography added a lot to the wonderful atmosphere particularly in the first episode. If you're unfamiliar with Loren's or Mastroianni's Italian output this is a good one to take out for a first spin especially if you've never seen Sophia in anything other than her Hollywood films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Italian anthology comedy starring Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. It's often cited as one of the best films of both stars. There are three stories involving different couples each played by Loren and Mastroianni. The first has Sophia as a wife who keeps getting pregnant to avoid a jail sentence. It's an amusing story although it goes on a little long. The second story is about a rich married woman taking a drive with her lover. The segment is pretty dull as it builds up to its punchline. But I suppose that was the point to make you thing this was an inane soap opera story about whether this woman will choose fortune or love. The question is answered humorously enough but this is still the weakest story in the film. The third story and the one for which the movie is probably most famous has Sophia playing a prostitute. Her neighbor's grandson about to become a priest falls for Sophia and she must try to set him back on the right path. But in doing so she makes a vow that frustrates lustful client Marcello. Sophia's never looked sexier than here and her striptease is legendary.Of the three stories the last is the most entertaining but none are bad. Sophia is beautiful and enchanting. She and Marcello are both fun in every segment. It's an enjoyable film though probably much more so if you are a big fan of Italian cinema to begin with.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps they should have just expanded the third segment into a feature because the first two really do suck";
	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion Vittorio De Sica really lost most of his talent when he met up with Sophia Loren. His films with her always feel like mush compared to his earlier masterpieces even the much lauded Two Women. Yesterday Today and Tomorrow is comprised of three short stories all starring Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. This might be De Sica's worst film if it weren't for the third segment. The first two are really poor. The first Adelina all three are named after Loren's character is about a married woman who sells illegal cigarettes on the street. The cops try to arrest her but cannot since she's pregnant. No pregnant woman can go to jail and they get six months after the birth while nursing before they can be sent too. The solution? Obviously keep getting pregnant so they can never send her to jail. Soon with seven kids Mastroianni is too tired to keep fathering children. This story is just plain stupid. The second story is so negligible it barely exists. It's called Anna and Loren is a rich woman cheating on her husband with Mastroianni. The two of them drive around in a car for a while. Who cares? It's all too bad too because Mara the third story is excellent. Not as good as De Sica's masterpieces but wonderful all the same. Loren is a high class prostitute who gets into an argument with her elderly neighbor after she flirts with her grandson who is in the seminary. After the argument the kid decides to quit and the old woman and Loren join forces to convince him to go back. Mastroianni is hilarious as an eager john getting more and more irked that his time with Loren is getting compromised. The whole film is worth sitting through for this but I'd almost suggest just fastforwarding to this third part. It also features Loren's infamous striptease. The movie won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1965.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is such a delightful playfulness to this trio of tales about relationships between men and women in Italy. Sophia Loren is in three different roles  a poor mother in Naples who keeps getting pregnant and having children to postpone being jailed for failing to pay debts on her furniture a rich woman in Naples who has had a onenight stand while her husband is away at a conference and has picked him up the following day in her RollsRoyce and a highclass courtesan who does business out of her apartment overlooking Piazza Navone in Rome attracting the attention of a young man studying to be a priest. I wouldn't say Loren has exceptional range but she does turn in a solid performance and plays feisty haughty seductive angry and bemused pretty well all while being quite entertaining. Marcello Mastroianni is her counterpart in each tale one of the clients in the last not the young man and is similarly engaging. It was nice to see him so light on his feet as he moved around in that last tale his expressions were overthetop in a good way and it was funny to see him ask Loren to dress up as a schoolgirl and then watch her reaction.The movie feels quintessentially Italian as the characters are animated and highly expressive. There is also a feeling of genuine humanity and community. There is an honesty here as each of the stories quite openly acknowledges sexual urges in both men and women as being natural and a positive thing which is quite refreshing. At the same time it remains decent and acknowledges a sense of higher morality. In the first tale Loren's character is tempted but does not sleep with her brotherinlaw when her husband can't get her pregnant again accepts going to jail and talks to the prisoners there without an ounce of judgment about why they're there. In the second Mastroianni's character realizes how shallow Loren's is when she's more concerned about damage to her car after they nearly run over a child. In the third Loren's character realizes that despite an antagonistic relationship with the young man's grandmother played fantastically by Tina Pica she has common ground with her and must persuade the boy to stay on his path. How nice it is that director Vittorio De Sica shows us that these things  lust and morality  can exist side by side perfectly well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday Today and Tomorrow was just the kind of crowdpleasing feelgood foreign film that appealed to American audiences and the Academy in 1964. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film the second De Sica film to win in that category after Bicycle Thieves. Of course this isn't in the same class as that neorealist masterpiece.

	schema:headline " Two Heavyweights Of Italian Cinema At Their Best !!!";
	schema:reviewBody " Fandor.com has this film available for online viewing in a version tat has none of the technical problems cited in other reviews here about this film. Vittorio Di Sica's Yesterday Today And Tomorrow 1963 starring Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren is a very entertaining and artistic film. This is a three segment film with each segment telling a story about a completely different romantically involved couple and with very different circumstances in each story. The romantic couple in each story each segment is portrayed by Mastroianni and Loren.The acting performances by Mastroianni and Loren in this film as a whole are outstanding. Each segment of this film being such a different type story from the others required them to veritably assume a different personality in each segment. Both Mastroianni and Loren did so very convincingly. This film and its three divergent story lines required a real chemistry between these two heavyweights of Italian cinema which they apparently have. It is really amazing to watch these two fine actors in this film act in unison in each segment acting as though the persona of the character in each individual segment was conceived and written just for them.There is no deep meaning or esoteric symbolism in this film. It is just great storytelling at its best. Just spinning a good yarn times three. Yet Di sico's excellent direction and the excellent performances by both Mastroianni and Loren brings some difficult to comprehend type of cohesion to these three divergent stories as if each segment was just a part of a comprehensive whole story. I would suppose that this comprehensive whole story might just be called the story of life. Each divergent story segment is a little slice of life somehow fitting into the larger slice of life that is the whole film.This film has great artistic merit in that it convincingly portrays and even celebrates in a way the very stuff of life of everyday life of your life and mine. This is an artistic film inasmuch it successfully portrays the relentless and indomitable spirit of life of mundane and ordinary everyday life.".

For point of reference he is 14 years old and is going to be in 9th grade after Summer.So I asked what he liked about the movie He liked the storyline and the ending. The main characters were really good actors. It was just a good movie overall. He warns JUST DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER. It made the movie look bad.Now me his uncle this is what I think If you're an empathetic person and can live vicariously through the characters and understand their situation you will be moved by many scenes in the movie. I myself was forming some tears in a few scenes.It is a family drama and is realistic. Being Asian I can empathize with the cultural dynamics.Some fun facts direct from the director.  If my notes and hearing are correctThe movie was shot in 4 and 12 months. Wow that's fast! BUT the movie is very professionally made done with love and attention. The scenes are beautiful visually. The locations wow!From preproduction work to shooting to editing and post was a total of 6 years. That's a LOT of work.It was filmed in China in 13 cities 13 provinces and on 46 sets.The film has been to 14 festivals and has won 19 awards.200 tons of red earth had to be carried manually by people up the hillmountainside to disguise an asphalt road for a scene. SPOILER Don't quote me on this but the street scene where one lady wife? was kidnapped had 600? maybe it wasn't the scene but total in costume department? Sorry I can't remember. costumes in it! Talk about a major wardrobecostuming department. SPOILER end Christina Yao the director is such a nice lady. D Thank you for sharing your time stories and answering all our questions. It was a terrific interesting and informative experience for my nephew and me. Your 3 hours with our small group of 12 was over and above expectations. Thank you! Take care Huy".

The character of Arabella is certainly a villain at her heart but the character of Sue Bridehead is a mirror of our tragic hero Jude.  Through their interactions we see not only a stunning performance by Kate Winslet but also a relationship of equals in misery.

Seems like you are never prepared enough for this movie. Sadness and tragedy are in the air right from beginning you can feel them all the time even when things start getting better for the two protagonists you know it can't last...because they are doomed losers not meant to be happy together. And yet the love they share is the purest and most devoting love I have ever seen on screen it stunned me how true Jude was to Sue and how brave Sue was accepting Jude jr. as one of her own no questions asked. Many people might find the scene of Sue giving birth and being watched by Jude jr. disturbing yet it is essential to understand his later deeds at least partly. The climax of the tragedy is so emotional and so immensely cruel it rips your heart out. I felt the theatre was falling into pieces and so were we watching this emotional tornado weeping like possessed. The experience of this movie will make you ponder life love and death it will make you understand how important it is to teach your children well and never make them feel undesired. It will make you realize how important it is to always think twice before commiting yourself even in the modern world flooded with divorces. It will show you what it means to really love completely and uncompromisingly. I highly recommend this masterpiece a tale of two beautiful unfortunate heros ahead their time doomed by cruelest fate imaginable. 1010".

Yes it is quiet the most painful story but all lives worth living have pain and heartbreak love and laughter.  This is no sugarcoated romance but a dark dirty tragedy. What affects me so is the timelessness of this story. Michael Winterbottom truly made a wonderful film  he did not write the story folks.Christopher Eccleston is a master actor he brings such a fullblown sense of the man Jude. He really knew this character strongly and I feel that he has a level of intelligence and feeling that is rarely used in modern male actors. Kate Winslet is a stunning actress. Hard to believe that she carried the level of passion and maturity in Jude as Sue Bridehead at the ripe age of 20. She is truly oneofakind and deserves all accolades placed upon her shoulders. I had no problem with the love scenes and nudity in this movie  although that could be because Chris Eccleston is so incredibly attractive. Isn't lovemaking crucial and appropriate for two people in love? I don't understand how some people commented poorly on that. It seems quite acceptable for me.  Don't look for mushy weepy romance in Jude. You will find power grief passion love and bravery. Jude and Sue possess more bravery than most people living today the tragedy is that they risked everything for their love  which destroyed them and the lives of their children.Masterpiece film making and acting.

No twohour adaptation could do complete justice to Hardy's final work and many of the themes of religion education and society are pared down in favour of the tragic central relationship between the eponymous Jude and his cousin Sue.Eccleston and the then upandcoming Winslet are superb as the onoff couple lifting the film despite some patchy directing. The passage of time and emotion is dealt with heavyhandedly albeit faithfully by Winterbottom but this is in contrast to some beautiful and touching setpieces. This is where the film excels especially in the bold decision to cut the final stage of their relationship in favour of a powerfully bleak ending in which the audience along with Jude is left with little closure.No happy endings here then and those of fragile stock should be warned that despite being visually underplayed the pivotal scene is played with a brutal tragedy which makes it no less shocking.Finally I feel the score should be given special mention this was Adrian Johnston's first major work but it succeeds as an evocation of tenderness piety and sorrow especially in the final two scenes of the film.".

Firstly he creates a picture of a livable past not some shallow collage of country houses and Dickensian squalor but a world in which a normality of sorts might reign.  Secondly he sets out to explore that normality instead of simply judging the past by present values. Finally he is working with a script that is neither archaic and stiff nor laced with modern anachronisms.  Add to this strong direction and casting Christopher Ecclestone is excellent in the title role and a young Kate Winslett fetchingly appealing as Sue and the result is a good film but it lacks something of a dramatic punch.I haven't read the book but one senses from the film that it may represent a fierce attack on thencontemporary values particularly those involving marriage values which drive the characters to their ultimate misfortune. One senses this but in the movie this theme is played down so the story seems merely to tell of the ups and downs of Jude's life presented as fairly accidental happenings.  A terrible tragedy eventually occurs and because of what has happened in the past a second avoidable tragedy then follows.  The problem dramatically speaking is that the second tragedy appears smaller than the first thus the end of the film serves as an anticlimax.

	schema:headline " Don't let the kids see this";
	schema:reviewBody "This pessimistic and rather brutal cinematic production is based on the nineteenth century novel Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy. A bowdlerized and altered version of that novel first appeared in Harper's New Monthly Magazine as a serial beginning in December 1894. Its original title was 'The Simpletons' a title modern viewers of this movie might find appropriate considering how Jude and Sue round out their lives.It need hardly be said that any motion picture and certainly not one running only about two hours can hope to do justice to Hardy's novel his last incidentally which is about 180000 words long about 400 pages of dense text. An earlier TV mini series version made by the BBC that I have not seen Jude the Obscure 1971 ran for almost four and a half hours in six episodes. But this is a pretty good movie anyway highlighted by an enthralling performance by Kate Winslet.The movie starts rather slowly if picturesquely until Kate appears and then the movie comes to life. I have seen Winslet in several films including her first feature film when she was18yearsold Heavenly Creatures 1994 an interesting film made in New Zealand based on a sensational matricide from the 1950s. She was very good in that film her budding talent immediately obvious as the spinning laughing crazy teen who went off the deep end emotionally. In Jude Winslet's sharp confident and commanding style is given greater range and she comes across with a performance that is full of life effervescent delightful witty sly clever and very expressive and she looks beautiful doing it.The story itself a naturalistic tragedy that in some respects anticipates Theodore Dreiser et al. was considered immoral in its time. 'The Bishop of Wakefield disgusted with the novel's insolence and indecency threw it in the fire' according to Terry Eagleton who wrote the Introduction for the New Wessex Edition of the book. Modern film goers will hardly notice the implied critique of marriage that offended Victorian readers but they might find the scene where Arabella throws the pig's 'part' at Jude indelicate. Victorian readers found that scene most offensive. As a public service I want to warn any modern viewer who might be offended at seeing Kate Winslet naked to avoid this film. Just Joking Kate is quite fetching in the Rubenesque shot. To be honest though this really is a tragedy that still has the power to offend some sensibilities. Certainly you don't want the kids to see it.Christopher Eccleston plays Jude and does a good job and Rachel Griffiths in a modest part plays Jude's first wife Arabella. Director Michael Winterbottom stayed spiritually true to Hardy's dark vision while tailoring the tale for modern audiences. There's a nice period piece feel and some charming cinematography. The denouement is well set up and so realistically done that we don't know whether to be horrified or outraged. I think I was both.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

The thing is that Hardy does reflect the soul of his characters against the backdrop of darker truths in a society which seems clear in a veneer of pastoral vision.When I saw that the runtime of this movie 123 min I was surprised unfortunately I was right because after 20 minutes we see Jude grownup man who travels to Christminster. We have never seen anything about his souldreamsideals until then. We do not understand after then either. We just see him studying Latin at his desk. This is barely Jude's way of living and studying!Before the viewers understanding what is going on he meets Arabella beside some river! Jude meets her when he is returning from his workmasonry but we do not see anything about masonry until that minute either! At some point we see Sue's frigid reaction Dont touch me like that. I am not read then after a minute we see her giving birth a kid! How the heck did they do it! We do not see much into their marriage either! Nothing about the souls and psychology about characters fast sets of events not exact dialogs etc.. etc.. I am totally disappointed!".

The thing is that Hardy does reflect the soul of his characters against the backdrop of darker truths in a society which seems clear in a veneer of pastoral vision.When I saw that the runtime of this movie 123 min I was surprised unfortunately I was right because after 20 minutes we see Jude grownup man who travels to Christminster. We have never seen anything about his souldreamsideals until then. We do not understand after then either. We just see him studying Latin at his desk. This is barely Jude's way of living and studying!Before the viewers understanding what is going on he meets Arabella beside some river! Jude meets her when he is returning from his workmasonry but we do not see anything about masonry until that minute either! At some point we see Sue's frigid reaction Dont touch me like that. I am not read then after a minute we see her giving birth a kid! How the heck did they do it! We do not see much into their marriage either! Nothing about the souls and psychology about characters fast sets of events not exact dialogs etc.. etc.. I am totally disappointed!";

This movie based on a Thomas Hardy novel is one of the most melancholy films I've ever seen. But sadness flows so beautifully in this film thanks to excellent vision by the director Winterbottom and surprisingly mature script. The movie catches the 19th century mentality nicely but without delivering any clich in perspective. Winterbottom was aided by brilliant performances by both Eccleston and a 20yearold Kate Winslet. Some complain about the inclusion of nudity in the film. But this is art.I never read the novel. But with a film such beautiful it doesn't really matter whether it follows the novel truthfully or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure is a very complicated and ambitious book and while heavyreading it is a fine piece of literature. This 1996 film adaptation is a rocksolid adaptation that is ambitious and realistic. I will admit some parts like the killing of the pig is anything but tender but none of the scenes are oversensationalised.As an adaptation of the book it works very well. If I had a quibble the secondary characters could have been developed more than they were depicted. The screenplay is well crafted the writers and the director have at least some idea how Hardy's work should work on film and stay relatively true to the book. The music both haunting and beautiful at the same time was absolutely outstanding.The direction is very fine never sluggish and never overdone. It was about right. The cinematography is superb dark fluid and sensitive. And the period detail was just as good. It was this element alone that contributed to the mood of the adaptation. The love story here which is dirty and tragic was beautifully realised and very rarely struck a false note.The performances were just brilliant no overplaying or underplaying as far as I could see. Special mention must go to the two lead performances. Christopher Ecceleston is a very talented and I think underappreciated actor and in the title role he was perfectly cast and showed real versatility. As Sue Brideshead the beautiful Kate Winslet is positively luminous and is true to her character. Out of the supporting performances the best is Rachel Griffiths as Arabella a very modest performance I must say.Overall has its minor flaws but a very well done adaptation of a complicated book. Always realistic and never overlysentimental as I feared. Though the ending is heartrending. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Winterbottom keeps the temperature of the searing original novel in his faithful brilliantly realised film adaptation. Hardy was sick when writing Jude out of sorts and the bleak tale has in some quarters been credited more to bile than his muse. Jude's fate is certainly more damning than other Hardy heroes such as Tess and the final third of this tale requires a strong heart to get through.Jude Fawley is a selfeducated stonemason looking to enter the hallowed halls of a thinlydisguised Oxford. Class and snobbery combine to crush that dream but he fights and wins his other dream to secure the love of his cousin Sue. Headstrong and independent a prototype Suffragette she will face her own stern test and be found wanting.Christopher Eccleston inhabits the character fully. The scene in the pub where he recites the Lord's Creed in Latin then challenges the undergrads to judge if he got it right is painful and poignant. Winslet is stunning as the admirable but infuriating Sue Brideshead whose choices in life are oblique but alltooreal. A cold draft of air oozes from her expression every time she shuns Jude. There isn't a missed beat in Winslet's portrayal of a woman who goes from supremely confident to utterly lost.Winterbottom would go on to tinker and experiment unsuccessfully with Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge in The Claim. Here he keeps it strictly BBC evoking the early industrial age magnificently in his cobbled streets and fogshrouded spires. An array of British acting talent fill out the supporting roles superbly most notably Liam Cunningham as the putupon Phillotson and Rachel Griffiths as pighugging Arabella whose rising fortune sways in counterpoint to Jude's slow inexorable decline. In one scene where she encounters her estranged son at a fairground the interaction between woman and child is both naturalistic and magical. The expression on the face of Little Jude's sister is priceless. Perhaps a happy accident perhaps genius from the director but all the more tragic for what follows.One of the most illfated couples in British literature are vividly brought to life in this film designed to satisfy fans of the novel. Hardy one feels would approve.".

	schema:reviewBody "How to summarise Jude? They say that in the late Victorian era there was a school of thought that almost glorified the state of childhood believing it to be a perfect time in a person's life when innocence reigned but I don't believe Thomas Hardy followed this line of thinking. No matter how young both Jude the father and Jude the son seem weighed down by doom and misery in this film.I think this film fell under the category of independent film which is just as well. Following the Thomas Hardy convention whereby nothing can end happily Jude ultimately ends with a miserable mood but in a sense this is perfect. Although it's not the sort of film anyone would want to watch on a down day I'm sure that  had this film been given the Hollywood treatment the storyline would have been mercilessly rearranged to have a loving happy ending. The problem is if that happened it wouldn't be Hardy.There is something stark about the opening of the film  the scratchy music the loneliness of the solitary young Jude the clattering noise of the birdscarer and yet combined with the blackandwhite filming it evokes the appropriate mood for the film so easily and so early on. In amongst the winter scenes and the aerial shots that show only a tiny bit of movement in an otherwise still landscape Jude and Arabella's wedding is possibly the busiest most colourful scene in the whole film. Of course there are also many interesting social and sometimes political issues raised partly because of the time in which the film is set. Had the story been moved forward a hundred years there would be nothing remarkable about Sue attending lectures smoking cigarettes drinking beer in the pub visiting Jude without a chaperone. There would be nothing surprising about being educated when you had a job  like Jude's  that didn't require it. But Jude and Sue are tragic in a way  both impulsive people in a world and a time when a commitment like marriage was not to be taken lightly.There are many bad omens in the film  Aunt Drusilla remarking that The Fawleys were not meant for marrying  and the particular tragedy of Jude's character is the way he rushes into things only to regret them later. Though Jude is tragic his cousin and partner Sue is equally blighted  to watch her change during the film from an irreverent sparky impertinent independent single woman into a tortured guilty in her own eyes shadow of her former self is heartbreaking. Although in some ways women's lives and opportunities were limited in various ways in the nineteenth century as a female with a job no husband and no parents or other family she did have quite a lot of freedom. Oddly Jude's wife Arabella is not so different from Sue  she is as forward and daring physically as Sue is intellectually. During their marriage she and Jude almost reverse roles  she goes out to kill a pig singlehandedly when he is too sensitive to do so. There is an interesting contrast between Jude's sex scenes with Arabella and the one he has with Sue. The wedding night with Arabella is warmly lit and cosy whereas the scene with Sue is stark almost grey with a cold feeling and yet in some ways Sue and Jude are more necessary to each other than Arabella and Jude ever were. On the costume side I note that  as with the more recent Kate Winslet film Finding Neverland  the costumes don't look like fashion plates they look like real clothes occasionally none too clean but when you take into account how timeconsuming and labourintensive it must have been to wash them it's hardly surprising. It seems strange now that Kate must only have been twenty or twentyone when this film was made  in her first scene she looks mature whereas in others she seems very very young.This isn't the easiest film to watch  there are a few sections I almost always fastforward  but that is not to say it's not good. Every time I watch it a bit of me wants things to end happily but  as I said before  that just wouldn't be Hardy.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this day and age hollywood cranks out hundreds of films made for one purpose.  The almighty dollar.  The first thing that caught my attention while watching this film is its lack of any entertainment value from the very beginning.  No gimmicks no effects to draw your money.  This is possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  In fact it is more than a film it is an experience.  Jude progresses so that its closing moments strike so much agony into your heart you are changed.  It is the type of film you can only experience once.  Any added viewings would only be analyzing it. Jude is the epitome of what true high fine art should accomplish.  A feeling you can never recreate.  If you enjoy art you will love this film and if you look for entertainment you will be so shocked by it you will never look at films the same way.  Since seeing Jude all other films seem bland and heartless.  The final punch is so powerful it will make even endings like those in The Rear Window and The Sixth Sense seem mediocre and even predictable.  Anyone with 3 dollars or a library card should do themselves the favor and experience a piece of life only found in this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "In this day and age hollywood cranks out hundreds of films made for one purpose.  The almighty dollar.  The first thing that caught my attention while watching this film is its lack of any entertainment value from the very beginning.  No gimmicks no effects to draw your money.  This is possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  In fact it is more than a film it is an experience.  Jude progresses so that its closing moments strike so much agony into your heart you are changed.  It is the type of film you can only experience once.  Any added viewings would only be analyzing it. Jude is the epitome of what true high fine art should accomplish.  A feeling you can never recreate.  If you enjoy art you will love this film and if you look for entertainment you will be so shocked by it you will never look at films the same way.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a short in Paul Terry's Aesop's Fables series produced by Van Beuren studio. There will be spoilers aheadThis short is interesting because it was a sound cartoon with sound on film and it was actually released ahead of Steamboat Willie. Given that Steamboat Willie is a much better cartoon which blows this out of the water is an indication that technology carries one only so far.The short itself apart from the sound synchronization is not markedly different from the earlier silent shorts Paul Terry did. It begins with a bird waking up and going out with a nice gag showing the bird reaching the ground from his birdhouse in a novel fashion.There follows a few largely disconnected gags showing various animals trying to catch a meal. The bird tries to catch a worm a cat tries to catch the bird there's a nine lives scene that's moderately good a dog digging up bones which turns into a three dog gag and a dog with a bone looking at his reflection but with a twist to the old fable it's modeled after.This finally takes us to the main story where Al Falfa is a butcher beset by problems with incredibly tough meat and persistent dogs. One dog steals a side of beef Al chases him and dogs converge on the unattended shop. Al then calls the pound and a dogcatcher comes over.The dogcatcher corrals the dogs and loads them in his wagon but Al gets knocked out by a large bearlike dog seen earlier in the short the dogs are freed and Al is placed in the wagon. Al gets into a fight with the dogcatcher takes him out and then starts chasing the dogs who have hit on a novel plan to take Al for everything he has.This short can be found here and there and is worth a look.".

As noted by Beck and Kausler Walt didn't like this cartoon thinking it was just a noise of sound effects and music. He had a point and I must add the synchronization of voices aren't perfect either as they don't match the lipmovements at all! Also the gags are scattershot with almost no point at all. There was one amusing gag when a dog sees his reflection in a river with the bone in his mouth as he drops that one to search for the one in the water. Ironic thing is he actually does find another one there! Otherwise it's just chases between other lookalike dogs Farmer Al Falfa and a dogcatcher that mostly seems pointless. I just remembered another sequence with a cat and his nine lives that was also pretty amusing. So on that note I guess for animation buffs who's interested in watching an important first Paul Terry's Dinner Time may be worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Van Beuren cartoons are extremely variable especially in the number of gags and whether the absurdist humour shines through enough sometimes it does other times it doesn't but are strangely interesting. Although they are often poorly animated with barely existent stories and less than compelling lead characters they are also often outstandingly scored there can be some fun support characters and some are welltimed and amusing.'Dinner Time' is notable for being the first Aesop's Fables cartoon succeeding Paul Terry's Aesop's Film Fables series Terry's first synchronised sound cartoon and for being one of the earliest synchronised sound cartoons overall. So it is of historical interest. The problem is that 'Dinner Time' to me was also not particularly good there is certainly worse in the Aesop's Fables series but also far better.There are good things. Its best asset as is the case for pretty much all of Van Beuren cartoons is the music score. It is typically peppy and great fun to listen to. It is so beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and full of lively energy doing so well with enhancing the action.A couple of gags are amusing and some of the synchronisation and sound are reasonably neat.However am also in agreement with Walt Disney about 'Dinner Time' being basically a noise of music and sound. They are done well even if it was toned down a little and used a little less. It just all comes at the expense at having any decent gags and a succinct story. As said a couple of gags work but the others are just too disconnected and disorganised with nothing to them. The story is too hectic pacewise is often indistinguishable and doesn't make any sense. There is nothing memorable or engaging about the characters who are immediately forgettable as soon as the cartoon is over. Other parts of the synchronisation is sloppy and an illmatch with everything else a sign of the technique not being refined yet. 'Steamboat Willie' which came out later than this did it much better.In conclusion interesting historically but the quality is lacking. 410 Bethany Cox".

Years later she's a successful woman with a good job. When she goes home for her brother's wedding she discovers that her brother is marrying Joana. And he doesn't know what she did to Marni. When they meet she wants Joana to apologize for the way she treated her but Joana feigns ignorance. When Marni tells her mother Gail about her and Joana Gail tells her to try and put it behind her. But when Gail meets Joana's aunt Mona it turns that she's her old friend Ramona who was her friend in high school whom she had falling out with with years ago and Gail is unaware what caused it. Gail feels like Mona is trying to thumb her success in her face. When Marni learns that Joana does remember her she sets to expose her to her brother.";

I was especially impressed with Kristen Bell because this is the first comedychickflick I've personally seen her in and she was really cute and funny! She had a lot of charm great comedic timing and I kept thinking in my head how gorgeous she is all throughout the movie. She's a really versatile actress.

	schema:headline " Four Allegedly Mature Women In A PenisMeasuring Contest";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a guy I always wonder with these slapstick comedies that revolve around women with a wedding as a backdrop do grown women over the age of 25 really become THIS immature? In Bride Wars you see two very attractive women pulling childish pranks on one another in preparation for their respective weddings and somehow some women went to see that movie in droves. You Again received a spanking from major critics most of whom were male but actually turned in a profit at the box office.I'm still really curious to know what women think when they see two women in their 20's pulling mean callow tricks on each other then seeing two other women in their 50's who are attractive for their age I might add trying to oneup each other while taking dance lessons in preparation for a wedding. Can real life women actually relate to these women on screen? Do they think their antics are funny?Speaking as a man whether or not that's important is up to you the reader I found these shenanigans ranging from cat fights to forced slapstick comedy neither amusing nor believable. If I saw my Mom acting the way either Jamie Lee Curtis or Sigourney Weaver do on screen I would get angry and quick.But I digress. This movie starts out on a good note showing Marni Olsen Kristen Bell in high school with glasses braces and a bad case of acne. Although the nerd stereotype is a bit overdone here somehow Bell succeeds in being unglamorous to the point where we the audience feel for her.Her main tormentor is popular cheerleader J.J. Odette Yustman who is smoking hot but effectively easy to dislike. However the first mean prank you see pulled on Marni is her being crowdsurfed out of school by a group of jocks including that mean cheerleader. Marni seems to be angry at J.J. and only J.J. somehow forgetting that she wasn't the only one in the crowd.Fast forward less than a decade later and Marni has lost the braces and glasses is a successful P.R. executive and looks as hot as she did in Forgetting Sarah Marshall 2008. Her posthigh school transformation is one many people would envy but none of that matters when she finds out that her older brother is about to marry J.J. who is now known as Joanne.Marni's mother Gail Jamie Lee Curtis tries to convince Marni to put the past behind her. That is of course until it's revealed that Joanne's aunt is Ramona Sigourney Weaver a woman who used to be best friends with Gail in high school. However you know that unresolved animosity brews underneath the facade of these two women when a flashback reveals Ramona pushing Gail into a pool. Why she did this the movie never really explains.The rest of the movie remains laughless as Kristen Bell seems to trip over herself and bang her head into several different people and objects almost as if she's Curly from The Three Stooges. One scene shows her falling off a running path into a nest of red ants. Her love interest tries to help her but their heads bump into one another. Nuk nuk nuk!Of course when Marni and Joanne trade blows there is the inevitable catfight with dialogue so vapid and uninspired. When Joanne throws a dish at Marni she replies Ooh kitty likes to scratch! I don't know what other movie I've heard that phrase in but it's probably because it has been in at least six other films.With such hackneyed verbal taunts comes a fight that fails to intrigue. Dishes get broken Marni smashes a vase Joanne got as a gift that she claims is so expensive yet looks like one you could get for 2 at Goodwill and Joanne dumps some sort of soup over Marni's head. Are you laughing yet? You wonder what is wrong with these people and why such hot women have maturity levels that make Zach Galifianakis look like Don Draper. Even worse once the pratfalls come to a close the movie tries to sugarcoat itself with messages of peace love and reconciliation and the rest of the movie is boring.I thought Betty White would be the breath of fresh air in this movie. After all she was hilarious as a Saturday Night Live host last year. Unfortunately she has no really funny lines and a really dumb gag involving false teeth. Kristen Chenowith is also equally wasted as a flamboyant Southern belle wedding planner who seems to be in the wrong movie. There are also a handful of subplots that go nowhere and scenes completely irrelevant to the story that go on forever. The cheerleader's dance to Kris Kross's Jump is energetic but belongs in another Bring It On sequel.You Again is a great looking movie with likable actors in it. Unfortunately the lead actresses are forced to act childishly then mend their ways through fluffy speeches about family values aided by background music borrowed from past episodes of Full House. It could have been a memorable film but somehow chose not to be and went the My Best Friend's Wedding route.".

	schema:reviewBody "If nothing else you have to like this for the highpowered cast that was put together. With well known stars such as Jamie Lee Curtis Sigourney Weaver Victor Garber and even Betty White you know there will be quality performances. The lead actress is the lesser known Kristen Bell recently seen in Couples Retreat and there are a number of cameos from the likes of Patrick Duffy and one who pops up for only a moment at the end who I guess I won't name since the cameo is uncredited and should probably come as a surprise. With those names this couldn't be a disaster and it wasn't.The story has its moments. At times it's actually very funny. Bell plays a former high school geek whose brother is suddenly getting married to the girl who made her teenage years a complete misery and whose wedding she decides she wants to break up. Meanwhile her mom Curtis discovers that the bride's aunt Weaver was someone she had a falling out with in high school. The unnamed cameo at the end is a continuation on the theme with the mystery cameo being someone Betty White's character had a falling out with in high school so these families have a 3 generation long feud to overcome to make this marriage work. To me I thought most of the laughs occurred in two settings  when Curtis visits Weaver at her hotel and then at the rehearsal dinner. There are a lot of laughs in those scenes.Unfortunately although there are some good laughs in this there aren't enough laughs in this. In fact sometimes the movie gets downright heavy and far too serious at times the characters seem to be truly hurtful to each other in a less than fun way and the movie seems to forget that it's a comedy. It does have its moments. It just needed to have more.".

Marni discovers that his bride Joanna Odette Yustman is her former arch nemesis in high school who made her life a living hell. Joanna is now an angel in her brother's eyes absolutely not the memories that Marni has of her tormentor.

Marni must protect her brother by showing him Joanna's true colors before he makes the biggest mistake in his life. The claws are about to come out.My Comment The movie itself is not that appealing as a romantic comedy but it had a great female cast. The storyline is based on a small premise that what happens in high school lives with you forever which is absurd. Kristen Bell's performance as the pathetic pimply face girl with low self esteem pressed into getting revenge was right on target and Odette Yustman as her rival was also good. I think the writers wasted the great talents of Sigourney Weaver and Jamie Lee Curtis. However Betty White steals every scene she is in. Patrick Duffy and someone else I won't say make a cameo appearance. After about 45 minutes the story was a little boring but it picked up by the end.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me get this out I adore both Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver when I saw the trailer to You Again I wanted to love this movie so badly. Just because it has these two great actresses in it. Well I caught it on the movie channel and now I can see why it was voted one of the worst movies of the year. I can forgive Jamie and Sigourney as they are older and have made some great career choices they are allowed a mistake or two. However what is Kristen Bell and Odette Yustman's excuses? They both had promising careers with Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Cloverfield and are now messing it up with their latest choices like When in Rome and The Unborn. The plot is actually really good but the way they sugar coated it it turned into a total disaster of a film and completely wasted my time.Marni an acneriddled high school senior with glasses and braces reveals how she is tormented and bullied by other girls specifically Joanna who made Marni's high school life miserable. Years later in 2010 however she is a successful public relations executive recently promoted to a job in New York. When she flies home to her older brother's wedding she discovers her brother Will is about to marry Joanna. Marni is also upset to see that Joanna fits in very well with the family. The plot thickens when her mother Gail meets up with Joanna's aunt Ramona Gail's former best friend who pushed her into a pool at their senior prom. Ramona is now a successful wealthy woman who owns several hotels and a private plane. Now they must all get along for her brother's sake but it's a matter of letting the past go.One of the major things that annoyed me is Betty White. Since she was so adorable in The Proposal they figured they needed a hip granny for this movie too it was rather pathetic and she looks like she's just about to give up on life. Then with the plot it's like it had bipolar disorder it just didn't know what it wanted. First Joanna is evil then she's good then she's evil then she's good then she's evil again then she's good again? It didn't work why not just make her evil all the way? Then our hero Marni is just as evil as Joanna. She can't let go of the past and just makes a total fool of herself during the movie. How is her character likable? She says she loves her brother so much yet she can't let high school go? People change and she never gave Joanna a chance to see if she had grown up or not. For someone who is so successful now you'd think she would put that as her revenge.Then to top it all off they end the movie with throwing a random guy who has 5 minutes of screen time as Marni's love interest. God forbid they have a girl remain single in a film it's just so sad to leave her alone. The only thing I found redeeming about this movie was Jamie and Sigourney they had great chemistry and honestly I would have rather had the movie be about them. They were spot on with their comedy and were great to see on screen bouncing off each other with their lines. But this was just a horrible movie pathetically put together and I would say just stay away from this movie. I can forgive Jamie and Sigourney but I pity the other fools who took some zangy drugs to say yes to this script.110".

I can forgive Jamie and Sigourney as they are older and have made some great career choices they are allowed a mistake or two. However what is Kristen Bell and Odette Yustman's excuses? They both had promising careers with Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Cloverfield and are now messing it up with their latest choices like When in Rome and The Unborn. The plot is actually really good but the way they sugar coated it it turned into a total disaster of a film and completely wasted my time.Marni an acneriddled high school senior with glasses and braces reveals how she is tormented and bullied by other girls specifically Joanna who made Marni's high school life miserable. Years later in 2010 however she is a successful public relations executive recently promoted to a job in New York. When she flies home to her older brother's wedding she discovers her brother Will is about to marry Joanna. Marni is also upset to see that Joanna fits in very well with the family. The plot thickens when her mother Gail meets up with Joanna's aunt Ramona Gail's former best friend who pushed her into a pool at their senior prom. Ramona is now a successful wealthy woman who owns several hotels and a private plane. Now they must all get along for her brother's sake but it's a matter of letting the past go.One of the major things that annoyed me is Betty White. Since she was so adorable in The Proposal they figured they needed a hip granny for this movie too it was rather pathetic and she looks like she's just about to give up on life. Then with the plot it's like it had bipolar disorder it just didn't know what it wanted. First Joanna is evil then she's good then she's evil then she's good then she's evil again then she's good again? It didn't work why not just make her evil all the way? Then our hero Marni is just as evil as Joanna. She can't let go of the past and just makes a total fool of herself during the movie. How is her character likable? She says she loves her brother so much yet she can't let high school go? People change and she never gave Joanna a chance to see if she had grown up or not. For someone who is so successful now you'd think she would put that as her revenge.Then to top it all off they end the movie with throwing a random guy who has 5 minutes of screen time as Marni's love interest. God forbid they have a girl remain single in a film it's just so sad to leave her alone. The only thing I found redeeming about this movie was Jamie and Sigourney they had great chemistry and honestly I would have rather had the movie be about them. They were spot on with their comedy and were great to see on screen bouncing off each other with their lines. But this was just a horrible movie pathetically put together and I would say just stay away from this movie. I can forgive Jamie and Sigourney but I pity the other fools who took some zangy drugs to say yes to this script.110";

Odette Yustman does better as Joanna a character who is allowed to show high school nastiness and an apparently reformed side  there is much more shading here.But the two older women have the meatier roles and both relish the opportunity to play fairly broad comedy although Jamie Lee Curtis does frequently slip over the edge into gurning caricature. There are also some entertaining supporting characters with Kyle Bornheimer's Tim delivering a particularly funny speech at the wedding rehearsal.The humour is a pleasing mix of situational character wordplay and slapstick with only the unfunny and unnecessary bathroom sequence falling flat.And the film resolves nicely  notwithstanding the nastiness which drives most of the film things end well.I enjoyed this.".

I also felt that the character development showed little to none so when all the outbursts happened I didn't completely understand why. Why was the groom so affected? I didn't sympathize with him at all. Why did Joanna back out of her engagement with Tim? And who in the world WAS Tim?! He didn't even make any important changes to the plot other than that stupid dinner! Also I disliked Joanna. Even until the ending. She just seemed like such a bitch! Such a phony! Ugh. So many useless characters plus below average acting. It made the film even worse than it already was. SPOILERSWhen a young woman realizes her brother is about to marry the girl who bullied her in high school she sets out to expose the fiance's true colors. It sounds like a good story line don't you think? It makes us think that many crazy revenge plots would happen and make us laugh. Sad to say that just wasn't the case with this movie. This movie just wasn't entertaining. But I'll give it props for having a couple of funny scenes that gave me a few giggles.I did not give this a 310 for the slapstick humor though. I gave it a 3 for the moral. As of now I'm hating high school and it makes me think. What will happen in 8 years? Will I be the same person that I am now? It just made me wonder. For making my brain churn this movie gets a 3 rating. And that is pretty generous.Don't bother watching this. Waste of time. Your 105 minutes would be better used by rewatching Bride Wars instead. Bad movie. I just can't wrap my head around it. I was expecting something good to let the night fly by but this just wasted my time.".

Among her chief tormentors was JJ Odette Yustman the captain of the cheerleading squad and all around snob. But Marni bucks up and uses the bullying she experienced as a goad toward achievement after graduation. Whatever her motivations Marni's achievements can't be questioned She's named a vice president of her public relations firm just before she heads home for her older brother's wedding.Marni and her brother Will Jimmy Wolk have always been close and she's both devastated and furious when she discovers the bridetobe is none other than her high school nemesis who now answers to the name Joanna. Marni's mother Jamie Lee Curtis is sympathetic but tells Marni that high school is in the past and she needs to move on. That advice comes easily to Gail until she discovers Joanna's Aunt Ramona Sigourney Weaver is her own high school nemesis.Despite the happy occasion that has gathered the family together Marni is less than thrilled. After all JJ wasn't the best of persons in high school and Marni can't imagine she's changed much! After an awkward reunion and family dinner Marni and her younger brother Ben decide to do what they can to derail the nuptials.Kristen Bell is a very pretty girl and it couldn't have been easy to transform her into the unattractive high school geek that Marni was supposed to have been. Yet makeup artists and Bell's adoption of some less than pretty tics make you believe in the earlier version of Marni. Odette Yustman also does a good job as the pretty popular girl whose mission in life is to make Marni miserable. Some of the movie's best moments come though as the result of the past and present rivalry between Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver. I'd be very surprised if the two of them had less than a ball doing their scenes together because it certainly shows on screen that way.The story itself is relatively predictable and the direction while competent is nothing special. The script is marred by moments of melodrama that undermine the otherwise marginal believability of the story and though the actors handle their lines well even genuine talent isn't enough to overcome some of the things they must say and do. In particular poor Kristen Chenoweth in a role as the wedding planneran actress I consider a truly brilliant talentis stuck in a role where the caricature overwhelms even her formidable abilities. While Betty White who portrays Marni's Grandma Bunny is also silly she at least gets away with it.BOTTOM LINE You Again is often diverting and has enough elements of realism in it to make you recall your own high school days for good or for ill but it doesn't overcome the limitations imposed on it by its script or a story that we've all frankly heard before. I was moderately entertained and mildly amused in the theatre but when the movie was played out I was less than fulfilled. ADDENDUM Stay for the credits. Trust me.POLITICAL NOTES None.FAMILY SUITABILITY You Again is rated PG for brief mild language and rude behavior. Produced by Touchstone a Disneyowned company the largely familyfriendly fare is no real surprise. While I wouldn't recommend You Again for really young children it's not going to hold their interest nor will they understand some of the complications that ensue from various and sundry misunderstandings or manipulations most parents should have no problem with their tweens or teens buying a ticket.".

My wife points out that the rest of the casting and acting was none too shabby either. Bell will conjure up images of similar high school disasters from your own high school days. Ditto Yustman who nails the pretty but nasty shebully to the point that I wonder if she drew it from real life. These two are worth the price of admission and though the movie falters a bit when it isn't about them it's well within the realm of a well done light comedy so why all the low appraisals I really don't know. Go see this and be ready for an enjoyable ride.".

To make matters worse Joanna's aunt Romona Sigourney Weaver was rivals with Marni's mom Gail Jamie Lee Curtis back in high school. WHAT A COINCIDENCE! So what follows is a series of unfunny pratfalls and other crappy slapstick. James Wolk is a pretty bland actor. Odette Yustman was awful. Kristen Bell was soso. We also have Betty White and Victor Garber but they aren't given much to do. The best performances are from Weaver and Curtis but they're still not that great.I get it. It's a romantic comedy. It's gonna be predictable. blah blah blah. But it's neither romantic nor funny. It's boring as hell. It'd dull as hell. It's stupid. It's irritating. All the characters are unlikable except Will and the actor playing him couldn't act.Then we get one of the stupidest endings that I've ever seen. I hated this movie. 2nd worst movie of 2010. Worst movie Kristen Bell has done. Worst movie any of these cast members have done. It's not funny. It's not charming. It's not cute. It's not engaging. It's just stupid. Skip You Again.".

Having her mom deal with a high school rivalry of her own and to top it off her grandmother having the same at the end just adds more layers to the story while staying focused on Marni and her core issue with the woman about to become her sisterinlaw.Marni's arc when she learns how much her brother Will really loves Joanna is the perfect lesson for a comedy to deliver. Having to put aside her own pain in order to help her brother find happiness is something most people would struggle to do especially when it involves making the former bully happy.Kudos to the entire crew for delivering a comedy I will remember for a very long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Andy Fickman's 'You Again' touches on the poignant theme of bullying and how its longterm effect on the victim. Many men and women can relate to the Marny character and the resentment and anger she feels when after years one is 'forced' to meet their bully after years. However 'You Again' is a comedy and although the movie does not go in depth in exploring the theme it's entertaining nonetheless. It has a brilliant female cast. The slapstick is a bit overdone but the Odette vs Kristen and more so the Jamie Lee vs Sigourney banters are a delight to watch. All four actors are good with comedy. I would have liked to see more of Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver. I especially liked their subtle depiction of the resentment they held against one another over a generation. Kristin Chenoweth provides some funny moments too. However the showstopper is Betty White who is just laugh out loud funny and makes the ending of 'You Again' memorable. The male cast is easily overshadowed by the female but Kyle Bornheimer fairs best as he gets you to at least chuckle. Although the main theme of bullying and its effect remains more interesting then the film itself Andy Fickman has made a movie that provides light entertainment not to be taken too seriously.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marni Kristen Bell is a successful PR representative who moved out to Los Angeles as a way to start fresh and forget her past. You Again opens with Marni telling a group of young PR interns the tale of her life as a nerd in high school. Like many of us Marni didn't have a great time in high school because she was picked on and bullied especially by the lead cheerleader Joanna Odette Yustman. After Marni is done with her big speech at the PR firm she boards a plane to head home to attend her brother Will's James Wolk wedding. Once home Marni finds out that Will is marrying Joanna the woman who made her life in high school a living hell. This is when Marni sets out to prove that Joanna is not this innocent good girl that she is pretending to be. To top all this off Joanna's Aunt Romona Sigourney Weaver arrives that same evening only to find out that Marni's mother Gail Jamie Lee Curtis has a history with her as well. A funny silly but ultimately clever film ensues...Many reviewers are labeling You Again as 2010's Bride Wars and while I see a few similarities between the two films You Again is a far superior film. I was actually perplexed by the amount of negative press this film received. While it is a far cry from an Oscar worthy it was still a feel good film with a really funny story and interesting premise. You Again is a movie about a nerdy high school chick who is bullied by the head cheerleader only to find out years later that her brother is engaged to the woman who ruined four years of her life. A plot like that is ripe for comedy. Furthermore the movie addresses the theme of confronting and overcoming high school rivalries a topic I feel very few movies address.One may argue that the film is too silly for it's own good. I would have to say that it's true especially towards the end but in all honesty its a Hollywood comedy. I would rather it be a bit too silly than a film loaded with sex gags as a filler. There are some really funny scenes in this movie too. I loved the whole car ride scene when Joanna plays We are the Champions and of course the dance studio scene. I think sometimes watching actors act like teenagers are funny especially if you can understand where they are coming from. The reaction that Kristen Bell's character has when she sees Joanna again is priceless. Try to put yourself in these shoes...you are tortured in high school and get out hoping to never see that person again but find out they are marrying a family member. That's like a nightmare of epic portions. The thing I thought was even more humorous about the film was the fact they showed it happens to all generations not just the younger. I think Jamie Lee Curtis's reaction to Weaver's entrance was equally priceless.Kristen Bell is the highlight of the film. I always enjoyed her in these types of roles. I find her to be cute and lovable. She plays a good nerd in the beginning and I found it believable because it fits her as a person. Bell doesn't seem to have that mass appeal that say Reese Witherspoon has but I do enjoy her films and hope she continues to do films. I would say her character Marni is a bit similar to her character in When in Rome however here the character has more depth. It's a better written character with more of a background story.As for the other actors I felt Odette Yustman was just great and like Bell really fit her character. You can tell that she wasn't this innocent girl she pretended to be. She plays one hell of a mean girl that's for sure. I think she had great chemistry with Bell as enemies. As for Curtis she's good in comedies and I loved her in this film. While she plays the mom role here watching her competing with Sigourney Weaver is a blast. I think everyone involved did a good job with their roles and did what the script requested of them. I should mention Bette White who absolutely steals the scenes and has a hilarious scene at the films conclusion.I really don't know what all the reviewers were complaining about with You Again. I thought the premise was fairly unique and the overall film was fun and full of fluff. The movie was really funny at times even though it used the typical clichs that comedies nowadays tend to use. This is a movie where you just sit back and enjoy a few good laughs. I know as a male I didn't mind watching this film and felt that it wasn't like the typical chick flick. The ending was rather typical and overly clichd but than again that's not surprising coming out of Hollywood.All in allYou Again is an enjoyable comedy that I wouldn't mind having to watch again. Everyone involved did a great job especially Bell who steals the show and wins the audience over within the first 10 minutes of the film. Just remember people this is a silly comedy and not a comedic masterpiece. No one should be expecting an Oscar worthy film and if you can get past that you should be able to enjoy to this. I personally think a lot of people have enjoyed this film despite what the critics say because can relate to one of the characters in one way or another. It's an cute and enjoyable flick and I recommend those looking for a wholesome laugh to check it out.MovieManMenzel's final rating for You Again is a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine your worst enemy who had tormented you for at least four years on the verge of becoming an inlaw family member through a marriage. You Again is a comedy that explores just that where Kristin Bell's Marni who had spent her entire high school life under the bullying radar of Joanna Odette Yustman last seen here in films like Unborn and Cloverfield realizes her one time nemesis is poised to become her sisterinlaw. So the question now is do you intervene at this juncture to throw the wedding off by telling everyone what a mean person she is or do you adopt the forgive and forget approach?As humans the latter is always a challenge and the former opportunity just too great to pass up now being in the position to memorably derail someone else's marriage plans even if it means having to unintentionally hurt one's family member Marni's brother Will played by James Wolk as a collateral. It's revenge of the nerd bitchy catfight style made worse when one doesn't acknowledge the past in the hopes of starting a relationship afresh which is not what the other party would desire setting up a series of sequences that are played out for laughs even though they are as predictable as they come in making life miserable for others.But it's the idea and the thought behind the film that seems a little bit more interesting as it's really quite relatable since in life we do step on the toes of others as do others on ours as well. It's what you do with being emotionally terrorized that matters and the best effect is to turn that into positive energy to transform oneself for the better rather than to keep on regretting and wanting to right the wrongs but not sure how to go about doing so. The advice of course is to champion oneself to be better rather than to focus on destroying the other party and before you know it you become what and who you despise.The highlight of the show turned out to be the veterans who demonstrate that age is no factor when it comes to having fun. The likes of Betty White Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver lend gravitas to the young adult leads of Bell and Yustman and I wonder if the careers of the latter will be as promising to live up to that of the former few. Of note is the pairing and rivalry of Jamie Lee Curtis' Gail Marni's mum and Sigourney Weaver's Ramona Joanna's aunt that states the interfamily rivalry goes beyond one generation and in true Romeo and Juliet fashion the coming together of two families bring on some complications which provide an avenue for comedy as each pair want to go one up against the other.Director Andy Fickman who has helmed a series of family friendly films for Disney such as The Game Plan and Race to Witch Mountain continues his services here for Disney and I suppose his being chummy with Dwayne The Rock Johnson meant the one time wrestler has got to appear somewhere in the film even as a cameo and cranks up a surprise appearance of a singing duo toward the end which by Hollywood standards is what's expected of a romantic comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wait For DVD Critical Perspective D Personal Perspective D 20100You Again is a movie that reveals how insignificant high school is when looking at the big picture and how important it is to let the past be the past. This film tells the story of the struggles of high schooler Marni Kristen Bell and her arch nemesis Joanna Odette Yustman when they are thrown into each other's lives one again when Mari discovers that Joanna is about to marry her older brother Will James Wolk. As their rivalry resurfaces Marni's mother Gail Jamie Lee Curtis and Joanna's Aunt Ramona Sigourney Weaver realize that they both went to high school together as well and ended their friendship on bad terms. Betty White is also in the film playing the character of Marni's Grandma BunnyThe Good The cast contains a lot of big Hollywood names and is the best part of the film. Kristen Bell is a very likable actress and is very good at what she does in all of her films. Her portrayal of Marni is very good and is a role that she really hasn't played before. Usually she is portrayed as the stuck up chick opposed to the nerdy chick in this film. The performances of both Sigourney Weaver and Jamie Lee Curtis are very funny and prove that they are good on screen together. Lastly the comical genius of Betty White owns the screen when she is present. As usual all of her jokes can be broken down into a series of very funny oneliners. There are also various celebrity cameos in the film that may surprise you. The best scene in the film is about one hour into the film and takes place in a dance studio where all of these talented actors just relax and have fun. If the rest of the film followed suite this would have been a very funny movie.The Bad The film is very excruciating to watch for the first hour and shows slight improvement after the scene mentioned above. The movie fails to go anywhere and has a lot of unnecessary scenes including the ending segment of the film. The film takes itself way too seriously by including numerous vary dramatic scenes that take away from the fun that the film could have had. Movies like The Proposal knew their place in their genre and ran with it to succeed while this film does not know its identity. Lastly the incorporation of Kristen Chenoweth's role as the wedding planer was pointless and takes a lot away from the film. She is a very annoying character and a very poor actress and is one of the reasons why the film is excruciating to watch.Final Thought If the You Again was have based off of the last thirty seconds of the film this would have been a very entertaining movie. Despite the cast and some surprise cameos there is not enough Betty White Antics to make film this worth seeing in theatres therefore save some money and wait for DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of the controversial cinematographer Jess Franco so my point of view is not going to be shared by many readers which is OK with me this is a free world! As a matter of fact I must confess that I watch every Franco's movie I can get my hands on and honestly I find always something intriguing and interesting in his work. Yesterday I watched El Mirn y la Exhibicionista. I expected some kind of erotichorrific romp instead I discovered after a few minutes watching that this is definitely pure hard core. Yes folks people really making love to each other or to themselves and you get to see it all. So if you are offended by the graphic depiction of sexual acts stay away watch something else since this is not...your piece of cake. The usual hard core stuff available nowadays in carload quantities in the market doesn't strike me too much. Generally after a few minutes I'll find it boring and this is probably due to the lack of fantasy and intelligence of the makers. A good Porno is very difficult to make. So why comment a Porno? First of all because nobody else did on this one and second because this is made with a certain style and intelligence. I think in this one Jess delivers to his audience big time! The plot is very simple in what appears to be a resorthotel room a goodlooking woman Lina Romay still gorgeous and with a great skin in spite of a few pounds too many and a funny red wig is reading magazines and listening to music from a tapedeck. She is obviously bored but after a while she realizes what an eye... that a man is watching her from the window of a conveniently placed building in front of her room. It appears that he has binoculars which qualifies him immediately as a skilled PeepingTom. She doesn't let the opportunity skip by and starts staging a quite titillating and very arousing show in total benefit of this uninvited but evidently quite welcome guest. I skip describing all the sexual variations including girl to girl and boy to girl we are presented with during the 60 minutes duration of this movie. I couldn't possibly do it anyway without risking to be thrown out of IMDb...and I very much like it here. I can only say that the images and the situations in spite of being as explicit as they can be are well done and far less vulgar then one could expect. But this is not the point. The point is the ability of the director and the leading lady which I think is a far better actress then she was given credit for to create and show the compelling and escalating atmosphere of tension and complicity which is building up as time goes by between watcher and watched. Lina gets busy with her body and soul and you can tell she likes what she does but her eyes constantly run at the window looking to be assured that He is still there and that he likes what he sees. Believe it or not her facial language is particularly under these peculiar circumstances quite expressive and convincing. There is a mounting tension between the two which in spite of being at least a couple of hundred yards away from each other and linked only by sight and some other person body which is the occasionaltransfer have never been so close and this till the...inevitable conclusion. The dialogue is basically non existent. However at one point Lina says in Spanish to her occasional and cooperating transferpartner ...you may think I'm a maniac but...I love this game! It says it all! Great Lina Romay! Que Viva la Lina! By the way I'm also a Lina Romay's fan... Only a true voyeur and exhibitionist can be capable to recreate this kind of atmosphere and I think that both Jess and his long time companion and muse Lina are all that. Otherwise how could they be so good at it! On the other hand I have to admit that probably it takes also a real voyeur and an exhibitionist to really appreciate this little movie.....Hmmmm!....which makes me think.......Hmmmm!.....but who doesn't have a little bit of this somewhere in the deepest part of his soul...? Strong direction skilled and sharp cinematography excellent acting gorgeous colors pleasant jazzy big band music in the background babes who haven't discovered yet the use of a razor... This is not the usual boring porn flick. I rate it 8 out of 10 but of course I'm a Jess Franco and Lina Romay fan.".

This is not the usual boring porn flick. I rate it 8 out of 10 but of course I'm a Jess Franco and Lina Romay fan.";

A woman Romay notices a man spying on her from a hotel room across from hers so she gives him something to look at. This is basically three short films ala three sex acts put together with a short running time of 54minutes. You can tell this is one of Franco's quickies that he filmed in a day or two but it features a nice score from Pablo Villa as well as being somewhat erotic. Making this erotic might be Franco's greatest directing work considering Romay certainly wasn't in top form here. She's packing quite a bit a weight which is rather strange because I've seen other flicks from Franco in 1986 and her look is quite different. Oh well the crazy world of Franco.".

I like Lina Romay very much first because she looks like my girlfriend but here we find she not in good form years which pass I think even if in Macumba sexual four years before she seems another person.

And speaking of maniacs whose idea was it to include a guy in a gorilla suit?! The idea of a wild gorilla running about the Swiss mountains just doesn't make any senseeven in a comedy.Most of the movies in the latter portion of Laurel and Hardy's careers were rather poor and stale. Of the movies made from the late 1930s on perhaps the best are Blockheads and A Chump at Oxford. While not as bad as the 20th Century Fox Laurel and Hardy pictures or Atoll K this movie just isn't up the quality of their earlier pictures. Simply put the duo are looking rather old and ragged and the jokes that worked well the first few times look a bit stale here.

Having seen other features I knew they COULD do it if they were given the chance  sadly here they weren't given that chance. Instead they are given surprisingly little screen time and not allowed to work their magic for very long with an offputting amount of time devoted to the martial problems I have previously alluded to.I don't know who made the decision that Laurel and Hardy were unable to carry a feature and required a structure to base their routines around   they should always be within the structure!  The mistake shines through though in several funny scenes where Laurel and Hardy are given the good material  the gorilla in Switzerland! on a bridge may not make much sense but it is funny although my highlight was Laurel trying to coax brandy out of a St Bernard's!  Sadly the chances for them to produce are limited by the tradition and overdone song and dance numbers where we also have the usual Laurel does funny voice' stuff and the romantic subplot.Hardy is good as is Laurel but Laurel's character is much stronger than in the shorts  he still bears the brunt of stuff but he is more forceful than before not to mention a lot chubbier!  I personally didn't take to this as well as I'd hoped I would  for whatever reason the changes were made they off balanced the relationship that I love between the two.  The support cast are roundly OK but it is hard to get interested in them simply because while they are on Laurel and Hardy aren't.Overall this is a very weak feature from the usually reliable pair.  The majority of the running time is taken up by the songs and the romantic subplot with the duo only given a few chances to shine which happily they take.  In the 70 minutes it took to watch this I could have watched three of their shorts  each of which would have been better than this!".

While on screen they never fail to amuse and entertain. Watch Laurel try to steal brandy from a sturdy St. Bernard  and Hardy sing Let Me Call You Sweetheart' accompanied by Stan on a tuba. The trouble arises from the long stretches when they are missing while the romantic subplot threatens to swamp the boat. Why couldn't Mr. Roach understand that the Boys' fans wanted to see the Boys not a pair of vacuous lovers work out their marital difficulties? Walter Woolf King  Della Lind are in good voice as the composer  his wife and their songs are pleasant if unremarkable. But we care not a whit for them and regret every moment they filch from L  H. Even the usually humorous Eric Blore as the composer's manager has to deliver lines that are rather forced  flat.But the Boys come through hilariously with what time they are allotted. Whether trying to sell mousetraps to suspicious Swiss or attempting to move a heavy piano across a most vertiginous swinging bridge while being hampered by a gorilla they are never anything less than magnificent  the sweetly innocent visitors from a zany parallel universe all their own.".

While on screen they never fail to amuse and entertain. Watch Laurel try to steal brandy from a sturdy St. Bernard  and Hardy sing Let Me Call You Sweetheart' accompanied by Stan on a tuba. The trouble arises from the long stretches when they are missing while the romantic subplot threatens to swamp the boat. Why couldn't Mr. Roach understand that the Boys' fans wanted to see the Boys not a pair of vacuous lovers work out their marital difficulties? Walter Woolf King  Della Lind are in good voice as the composer  his wife and their songs are pleasant if unremarkable. But we care not a whit for them and regret every moment they filch from L  H. Even the usually humorous Eric Blore as the composer's manager has to deliver lines that are rather forced  flat.But the Boys come through hilariously with what time they are allotted. Whether trying to sell mousetraps to suspicious Swiss or attempting to move a heavy piano across a most vertiginous swinging bridge while being hampered by a gorilla they are never anything less than magnificent  the sweetly innocent visitors from a zany parallel universe all their own.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's not a total washout among their feature films. It has some very fine moments  among my favorite Ollie serenading Grete Natzler with Let me call you Sweetheart which Stan is playing on a tuba! There is also Stan and the St. Bernard he fools into giving him a bit of his medicinal brandy. There is also the gorilla and the boys and the piano on the swaying bridge. But the film is a washout when compared with SONS OF THE DESERT WAY OUR WEST or BLOCKHEADS.It should have been better  it was their last attempt at an operetta format. In fact the plot deals with a composer Walter Woolf King  Lasparri in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA struggling to compose the score of his next operetta for him and his wife Ms Natzler. Set in Switzerland like THE BOHEMIAN GIRL the boys get into fun costumes. They are in the alps because they are mouse trap salesmen in Switzerland because of it's cheese. They are swindled and owe a huge hotel tab. Ollie has insulted the hotel cook Adia Kuznetzoff who is determined to make them pay by forcing them to slave for him as busboy waiters until their bill is paid off. When they try to cheat he forces them to break more plates to replace the figures they wiped out.All this is more than promising but structurally it is not good. This seems to be the fault of the studio owner Hal Roach.Roach was aware that Laurel and Hardy were his biggest star attractions and he knew that the revenue they generated might give him the chance to expand his production company. Roach did get somewhere in the late 1930s with bigger films. He produced the Topper films the first with Cary Grant and Constance Bennett as well as Roland Young and also ONE MILLION B.C. with Carole Landis. But Roach's conservative instincts interfered with his plans here. For one thing he could not bring himself to treat Stan and Ollie as a unified bargaining unit. He had their contracts end at different dates in an irritating attempt to keep them in check. Stan in particular had to be kept under control. So in the late 1930s Roach suggested a Hardy Family series with Ollie and Patsy Kelly as husband and wife and Spanky MacFarlane as their son. It sounds interesting but it got nowhere one wonders if it was planned to go anywhere. He also made the feature ZENOBIA in 1939 with Laurel replaced by Harry Langdon Langdon was working for Roach as a gag writer at the time. The boys retaliated by doing THE FLYING DEUCES with producer Boris Morros  a hint to Roach that he was equally replaceable. It was a message that Roach quickly noted but probably resented.Secondly there was the issue of being penny wise and pound foolish. Roach kept close watch on film budgets. When Stan and Ollie made the film OUR RELATIONS Stan was active producer on that film and he spent money quite freely on it especially in the sequences set in a nightclub. Compare the really realistic nightclub there with the more spartan ones shown in some of the shorts Roach controlled like BLOTTO. Roach did not care for this at all. So he looked at the script of SWISS MISS and tampered with it.In the original script apparently Natzler is having a marital dispute with King which involves their rival egos and his refusal to let her help him with his operetta work. She is ordered to leave. She disguises herself and becomes a maid at the hotel that Stan and Ollie are stuck working their bill off at. Ollie falls for the new maid. But so does the boys' adversary Kuznetzoff who is furious watching Ollie trying to ingratiate himself with her. He also notes that King is trying to ingratiate himself with the maid King recognizes Natzler but is pretending he is in love with the maid to make Natzler furious and jealous. So Kuznetzoff tries to get rid of all three of them by putting a bomb in the piano that they have to carry across a swaying rope bridge to King's chalet. This part of the famous sequence was cut out by Roach trying to cut costs and time. There is a still photo showing Stan arguing about the cut sequence and it shows him as really angry. He was right to be angry  the sequence is still very funny with that gorilla but it had moments of Stan and Ollie crashing into the keyboard that were meant to make the audience expect a premature explosion.For a musical it lacks any memorable tunes  unlike WAY OUT WEST with In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and We're Going to Dixie or with THE SONS OF THE DESERT with Honalulu Baby or THE BOHEMIAN GIRL with I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls or even unlike the later THE BIG NOISE with Maizy Doats!. Instead King cooks up a little ditty called The Cricket Song which has the opening line Crick crick crick goes the cricket...singing merrily all day long! Like the ridiculous conclusion of the Don Ameche biopic on Stephen Foster wherein everyone hearing the music  supposedly  of Old Folks At Home for the first time sing it standing as the film ends here the entire village is singing this ditty. At least Foster's tune was a great one. I assure you The Cricket Song is not!!Little else positive to add except for those few good bits I mentioned  and the brief appearances of the always welcomed Eric Blore as King's butler. It barely rises above the bulk of the films of the 1940s for MGM and 20TH Century Fox but enjoy it's best moments without any second thoughts.".

It has some very fine moments  among my favorite Ollie serenading Grete Natzler with Let me call you Sweetheart which Stan is playing on a tuba! There is also Stan and the St. Bernard he fools into giving him a bit of his medicinal brandy. There is also the gorilla and the boys and the piano on the swaying bridge. But the film is a washout when compared with SONS OF THE DESERT WAY OUR WEST or BLOCKHEADS.It should have been better  it was their last attempt at an operetta format. In fact the plot deals with a composer Walter Woolf King  Lasparri in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA struggling to compose the score of his next operetta for him and his wife Ms Natzler. Set in Switzerland like THE BOHEMIAN GIRL the boys get into fun costumes. They are in the alps because they are mouse trap salesmen in Switzerland because of it's cheese. They are swindled and owe a huge hotel tab. Ollie has insulted the hotel cook Adia Kuznetzoff who is determined to make them pay by forcing them to slave for him as busboy waiters until their bill is paid off. When they try to cheat he forces them to break more plates to replace the figures they wiped out.All this is more than promising but structurally it is not good. This seems to be the fault of the studio owner Hal Roach.Roach was aware that Laurel and Hardy were his biggest star attractions and he knew that the revenue they generated might give him the chance to expand his production company. Roach did get somewhere in the late 1930s with bigger films. He produced the Topper films the first with Cary Grant and Constance Bennett as well as Roland Young and also ONE MILLION B.C. with Carole Landis. But Roach's conservative instincts interfered with his plans here. For one thing he could not bring himself to treat Stan and Ollie as a unified bargaining unit. He had their contracts end at different dates in an irritating attempt to keep them in check. Stan in particular had to be kept under control. So in the late 1930s Roach suggested a Hardy Family series with Ollie and Patsy Kelly as husband and wife and Spanky MacFarlane as their son. It sounds interesting but it got nowhere one wonders if it was planned to go anywhere. He also made the feature ZENOBIA in 1939 with Laurel replaced by Harry Langdon Langdon was working for Roach as a gag writer at the time. The boys retaliated by doing THE FLYING DEUCES with producer Boris Morros  a hint to Roach that he was equally replaceable. It was a message that Roach quickly noted but probably resented.Secondly there was the issue of being penny wise and pound foolish. Roach kept close watch on film budgets. When Stan and Ollie made the film OUR RELATIONS Stan was active producer on that film and he spent money quite freely on it especially in the sequences set in a nightclub. Compare the really realistic nightclub there with the more spartan ones shown in some of the shorts Roach controlled like BLOTTO. Roach did not care for this at all. So he looked at the script of SWISS MISS and tampered with it.In the original script apparently Natzler is having a marital dispute with King which involves their rival egos and his refusal to let her help him with his operetta work. She is ordered to leave. She disguises herself and becomes a maid at the hotel that Stan and Ollie are stuck working their bill off at. Ollie falls for the new maid. But so does the boys' adversary Kuznetzoff who is furious watching Ollie trying to ingratiate himself with her. He also notes that King is trying to ingratiate himself with the maid King recognizes Natzler but is pretending he is in love with the maid to make Natzler furious and jealous. So Kuznetzoff tries to get rid of all three of them by putting a bomb in the piano that they have to carry across a swaying rope bridge to King's chalet. This part of the famous sequence was cut out by Roach trying to cut costs and time. There is a still photo showing Stan arguing about the cut sequence and it shows him as really angry. He was right to be angry  the sequence is still very funny with that gorilla but it had moments of Stan and Ollie crashing into the keyboard that were meant to make the audience expect a premature explosion.For a musical it lacks any memorable tunes  unlike WAY OUT WEST with In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia and We're Going to Dixie or with THE SONS OF THE DESERT with Honalulu Baby or THE BOHEMIAN GIRL with I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls or even unlike the later THE BIG NOISE with Maizy Doats!. Instead King cooks up a little ditty called The Cricket Song which has the opening line Crick crick crick goes the cricket...singing merrily all day long! Like the ridiculous conclusion of the Don Ameche biopic on Stephen Foster wherein everyone hearing the music  supposedly  of Old Folks At Home for the first time sing it standing as the film ends here the entire village is singing this ditty. At least Foster's tune was a great one. I assure you The Cricket Song is not!!Little else positive to add except for those few good bits I mentioned  and the brief appearances of the always welcomed Eric Blore as King's butler. It barely rises above the bulk of the films of the 1940s for MGM and 20TH Century Fox but enjoy it's best moments without any second thoughts.";

This particular one it seems was made to give audiences yet another opportunity to see these two funny men in funny situations. Much like the Martin and Lewis movies that came a bit later. The story and other characters are not important.Stan Laurel plays Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy plays Oliver Hardy. This adventure has them going to the Swiss Alps to sell mousetraps. I suppose it has to do with the legend that mice like cheese and there is lots of Swiss cheese there.The movie has many of the usual clichs of the time. We see the inside of a shop and there is a large wedge of Swiss cheese prominently displayed. There is the St Bernard dog with the small cask of brandy hanging from its neck. More puzzling is the gorilla.This movie contains the famous scene of Laurel and Hardy hired to move a piano. It involves crossing a very droopy and seemingly unsafe suspension bridge across a mountain ravine thousands of feet deep. The gorilla shows up to make the crossing more perilous.Nothing but a fluff of a story but a good reminder of what 1930s cinema was all about. The run time is listed as 72 minutes but on the TCM channel today it was closer to 64 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laurel and Hardyfans are easily spoiled. Having made such masterpieces of mirthmaking like HELPMATES and WAY OUT WEST it is easy to dismiss SWISS MISS as a rather minor work. Perhaps that is the case but only I think when seen in relation to the very best of the Boys' output in the 1930s. Boss Hal Roach tended to have a different view on public taste than Stan Laurel arguing that audiences preferred not to be fed with gags and slapstick for an entire hour on end Roach reportedly ordered several of his comedies to include socalled subplots romances involving other characters than the feature's main comedians. This was clearly a decision inspired by the output of comedians from larger studios the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields were also cast in such films much to their frustration. Whether or not Roach's view was accurate for its time these subplotcomedies have generally aged much less vigorously than features in which our favorite comedians are allowed to do their act throughout all the reels. In SWISS MISS the subplot involves a handsome opera singer named Victor Albert Walter Woolf King whose desire to work in his hotel suite is constantly put to task by his annoying wife Anna Grete Natzler. As Mr. Albert's profession suggests we are treated with several musical numbers. While this subplot is not necessarily less interesting than other subplots from comedies of the same era that really isn't saying much one longs for Laurel and Hardy to turn up while they are absent. Stan Laurel is reported to have complained about the singing acts himself during production. The combination of comedy and operetta is less effective here than in say the earlier film THE DEVIL'S BROTHER.However while one may find the subplot rather unnecessary or even annoying at times Laurel and Hardy themselves are no less delightful here than usual when given screen time. Here they try their luck or defy their obvious lack of luck in Switzerland selling rat traps a simple plot with plenty of potential for comic invention which is utilized in several hilarious sequences. There is the rather famous scene having the Boys doing a noble attempt to deliver a piano over a suspension bridge when a gorilla turns up the projectionwork may not be very convincing even by 1938standards but this is hardly of much significance as it is the performances of Stan and Ollie which grab our attention. Also particularly memorable is the part with Stan coaxing brandy from a St. Bernard the similarity between Laurel and former silent comedy great Harry Langdon has hardly ever been more evident than here especially as this scene is nearly a solo performance from Stan omitting the presence of the dog. The bit with the snow had me howling with laughter. All in all SWISS MISS is certainly worth the time of any Laurel and Hardyfan spoiled though we may be but newcomers should check out certain other titles first.".

Many people have issues with this movie but there basically is very little wrong with the movie itself. Therefor this movie is perhaps a bit too underappreciated by most.It's not the funniest Laurel  Hardy movie but at least its story is enjoyable enough and has plenty of entertainment value in it. Of course Laurel  Hardy were already over their top in 1938 but there were some moments in this movie which reminded me of their glory days from back in the late '20's till the mid'30's. I'm talking about the moments when the boys are drilling holes in the floor when they have to do the dishes and when they have to push a piano across a canyon. The movie is filled with moments which reminded me of their best years that were unfortunately already behind them when they made this movie. The movie has some memorable moments in it and the movie is consistent enough to consider this movie a watchable as well as a very enjoyable one that unfortunately can not conceal that the two boys already had their best years behind them though.I never really understood why long Laurel  Hardy movies always also had a serious subplotline it which always involved serious characters played by actors why play their roles in a noncomical way. The entire love story of the movie with the more serious characters certainly does no good to the movie its entertainment value or pace. Surely the movie would had been better if more characters and subplots were erased from the script. I mean when you already have 2 characters such as Laurel and Hardy you just don't need no other characters who play a just as prominent role in the movie as the two boys. It only works distracting since we never really get to care about any of those characters and are only interested in the faith antics and silly situations the two boys get themselves into.A not entirely successful but still a very enjoyable late Laurel  Hardy picture that deserves some more credit.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

You watch Wild Zero and your blood will pump your adrenaline will ransack your brain your tenderI have said too much.After all this is rock 'n' roll jet movie.  Guitar Wolf the group prove themselves to be inhuman in their sheer ability to be cool.  With trash and chaosssssss!!!! the last twenty minutes will blow your mind.  This is the feel good movie of eternity.  There is thrill speed and stupid zombies. There are exploding heads random alien encounters and even more sudden and inexplicable gaining of superpowers.There is no adrenaline rush that is more rush than this film once it kicks into motion.  But don't think it is all brutality of screen as the movie has poignant moments and an important message on love and growing up.  Of course you could also sit back and be terrified by the Captain's drawstring shorts pejoratively nicknamed the junk trunk by my group of friends.Watch this movie with friends or watch it alone.  It's just more fun when you can see your friends' minds be blown.  But if you see a Guitar Wolf movie this yearnay if you see a movie in this lifetime see Wild Zero!

	schema:reviewBody "I've noticed noticed a lot of negative commentary about this movie by people who obviously are totally lacking in rocknroll spirit and their effete reviews should not stop people from going out and watching this movie for themselves.This movie is for everyone and anyone who has an interest in Bmovies has an interest in garage rockpunkrockabillyrocknroll enjoys drinking and laughing.Wild Zero is equal parts RockNRoll High School Plan 9 from Outer Space and Night of the Living Dead. It boasts an amazing soundtrack equal parts Japanese and American bands a cast that is long on cool and short on Oscar potential just like a Bmovie should be and an excellent mix of camp and schlock horror.Featuring the band Guitar Wolf a real band by the way who lack a certain level of musicianship but more than make up for it with rocknroll attitude and Ace Masashi Endo who does have acting talent the movie takes us on a ride through an Ed WoodGeorge Romero wasteland that features a hell bent for leather biker attitude. The plot is no thinner than any other Bmovie and actually carries a rather broad minded message about acceptance and values.If Wild Zero has one flaw it is the editing and not the acting as some people have commented. I speak Japanese and live in Japan. The acting is no worse than that presented on typical Japanese television dramas and indeed Masashi Endo and Makoto Inamiya have certain comedic and manic talents that will perhaps be expanded upon in the future. The movie also features Morishita Yoshiyuki who looks like the Steve Buscemi of Japan. The editing is a bit slack at best and the movie contains about 10 minutes of dead footage.Apart from that Wild Zero is exactly what you need for an fantastic evening with friends beer and perhaps pizza or takeout sushi. The Wild Zero drinking game do a search comes highly recommended.Don't expect to see Citizen Kane and don't expect to see the Citizen Kane of Bmovies but do expect to see a Bmovie that deserves an enshrined spot in the pantheon of cinema for it's unique combination of flavours horror camp rocknroll japan and boundless love.If you've watched it and didn't get it watch it again but this time turn the volume UP! and drink more beer! This movie is not suitable for fans of Kenny G Right Wing Republicans and people who avidly follow the advice of Martha Stewart.RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKNNNNRRRRRRRRRRRRROLLLLLLLLLLL!!".

	onyx:emotionText "I've noticed noticed a lot of negative commentary about this movie by people who obviously are totally lacking in rocknroll spirit and their effete reviews should not stop people from going out and watching this movie for themselves.This movie is for everyone and anyone who has an interest in Bmovies has an interest in garage rockpunkrockabillyrocknroll enjoys drinking and laughing.Wild Zero is equal parts RockNRoll High School Plan 9 from Outer Space and Night of the Living Dead. It boasts an amazing soundtrack equal parts Japanese and American bands a cast that is long on cool and short on Oscar potential just like a Bmovie should be and an excellent mix of camp and schlock horror.Featuring the band Guitar Wolf a real band by the way who lack a certain level of musicianship but more than make up for it with rocknroll attitude and Ace Masashi Endo who does have acting talent the movie takes us on a ride through an Ed WoodGeorge Romero wasteland that features a hell bent for leather biker attitude.

There is no other way to describe the awesomeness that is 'Wild Zero'.'Wild Zero' is a documentary starring Japanese rock band Guitar Wolf. I wouldn't have thought it to do be a documentary but Guitar Wolf said it was so and who am I to doubt them? They saved us from zombies and an alien invasion. All hail Guitar Wolf! 'Wild Zero' starts with Guitar Wolf the guitarist not the band enraging a nightclub owner and in the middle of a standoff Guitar Wolf the band are saved by a wannabe rocker named Ace. Guitar Wolf the guitarist pledges to be a rock n' roll bloodbrother with Ace handing him a whistle only to be used when Ace needs the help of Guitar Wolf. On his way to a gig in Asahi Ace and other random characters are attacked by zombies. Now only Guitar Wolf can save the world from zombies and aliens. Awesome.I noticed other users referring to this as the 'ultimate Bmovie' and whatever. I disagree. This is the ultimate awesome movie. Well it would be if it wasn't a documentary. Either way 'Wild Zero' has everything that all aspiring awesome movies need rock n' roll zombies many exploding heads guitarswords and the best reference to 'Psycho' ever. Ignore all comments about acting Guitar Wolf are just being themselves with alcohol and swearing toned down so I've read. Awesome.1010  some people might disagree with my comments. 'Wild Zero' may not be a wellmade 'movie' but it is so incredibly awesome and in the end awesomeness is what really matters.Ok I found that from a website reviewing 'Wild Zero'. I read through a few interviews with Guitar Wolf and they didn't specifically say that although they did similar things. In fact everything they had to say was awesome.".

Apparently he enjoys wearing short shorts BAD THOUGHT ... unclean... unclean. He and those that he represents don't care about rock 'n roll they only care about money and power.One might think this is a typical rock 'n roll movie but it isn't. After our initial showdown between the squares and the Wolf Trio the movie takes an unexpected twist. This movie then turns into a survival horror movie. It seems that aliens are involved and they are bringing back the dead. So we end up with the Captain versus the Wolf Trio in the backdrop of a zombie plaguealien invasion. The supporting cast consists of yakuza henchmen bungling thieves one of which is a Japanese Steve Buscemi impersonator and another who is a Japanese Margaret Cho impersonator a female arms dealer our hero who's trying to be like Guitar Wolf Ace Ace's female love interest Tobio and layer upon layer of various gray zombies.This movie is a lot of fun and a twist on the zombie movie genre. The music is great. It has a rock n' roll inyourface feel. I think Guitar Wolf provided the entire soundtrack. Some of the great scenes where the music is blasting and zombies are dropping left and right you just want to scream and kick down some doors. A funny innovation in this movie is the pee cam like Miike's turd cam. The finale is quite over the top. Remember watch this movie kick ass and chew bubble gum. If you need to drink milk put some cocaine in it first.RIP Billy.Celluloid Rehab".

	schema:reviewBody "The action revolves around the Japanese garage punk band Guitar Wolf. A trio of coiffed leatherbound super cool rockers. Ace our main character is a wannabe rocker and number one fan of Guitar Wolf. One fateful night he finds himself in the middle of a gunfight between Guitar Wolf and an evil hot pant wearing wigged club owner. Guitar Wolf recognizes the lad as having a heart dedicated to the true spirit of rock and roll and makes him a blood brother and furnishes him with a wolf whistle to blow if he is ever in trouble. Trouble comes quickly in the form of UFO's and the living dead. Along the way we meet an adorable transsexual desperate for love and a bad ass female weapons dealer. Featuring guitar picks used like ninja throwing stars a naked woman blasting zombies in the shower slicing a UFO in half with a Samurai sword more exploding zombie heads then you can shake a stick at and of course plenty of rock and roll guitar punk sensibility. To enjoy Wild Zero you really have to throw out any misconceptions you might have that a film that suffers from bad editing bad continuity and a lack of coherent story could possibly be anything but awful. Wild Zero proves that a film can suffer these slings and arrows and still shine brilliantly. It's all about the Rock and Roll! The music in this film kicks some serious ass! It's just a whole bunch of awesomeness. For some additional fun the DVD includes a drinking game you can play while watching the film. A drinking symbol appears sporadically throughout the film like each time a character drinks says Rock 'n Roll or a head explodes. I can only imagine that the addition of alcohol would enhance the experience.".

	schema:headline " Wild Zero almost a big nothing";
	schema:reviewBody "Wild Zero is the kind of film that has received limited but generally ecstatic reviews from those obviously in sympathy with the makers The best film I have ever seen... I really can't say enough good things about Wild Zero. It's the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.  Teleport City sic. It represents everything I love about film and about life. It is beyond perfection. It has transcended into a realm of unbelievable excellence.  IMDb. One suspects however that none of the admirers of Takeuchi's lunatic rock and roll zombie flick see it as more than a trash exercise par excellence a raucous hybrid in which nothing is taken seriously and lapses of taste and judgement are understandingly forgiven. Like most junk products it is fun while around quickly consumed bad in excess and soon forgotten.    At the centre of the film is the iconic figure of Guitar Wolf ably supported by his band members Drum Wolf and Bass Wolf. Guitar hails from the world of Japanese punk and rockabilly and comes complete with sunglasses subElvis pompadour black leather jacket and unutterably cool attitude. This is his second big screen appearance since McCarthy's Sore Losers of a few years back which was by all accounts a similar sort of project tagline They wanted meat so they ate the flower children!. How you enjoy the present film depends on appreciating Guitar's somewhat handme down camp persona and your enjoyment of the cheap zombie genre. Romero's trilogy hangs heavily over things and at one point the characters even discuss who has seen Night Of The Living Dead 1968  ironically few here have. There are other influences too Burton's Mars Attacks! 1996 during the initial flying saucer scenes or the John Woolike stand off in the manager's office. The meteorled incursion recalls such 1950s' invasion titles as Arnold's It Came From Outer Space 1953. That aliens would want to bring the dead back to life as part of their plans can be seen in Wood's legendary Plan 9 From Outer Space 1959 though the charm of that film is missing here.    The action takes place in the nowhereplace of AsahiCho the scene of a meteor shower and shortly we discover to be the focus of an alien invasion. Ace is the desperatetobecool character also in black leather glasses and rockabilly pompadour who plans to see his hero Guitar Wolf at the local dive where he duly performs using microphones which shoot fire. After the show there's a falling out between Guitar and the club owner who despite having grown up with the singer claims Rock and Roll is dead! Given the heavy investment in the style by all concerned it's clearly a mistaken announcement. It duly provokes a shoot out between Guitar and the owner in which Ace plays a crucial part in helping his hero. The owner loses two fingers for his pains and vows revenge. Meanwhile Guitar makes Ace his rock and roll blood brother and gives him a whistle to be blown when he is danger. Given that the town is due to be overrun by murderous zombies this is no small blessing as one can imagine.    Meanwhile other strange characters are introduced a female arms dealer most comfortable in what looks like a plaid leotard a bickering trio in a car one of which Masao goes odd and tries a blundering gas station robbery the girl Tobio dumped by the road after being called a 'pervert' by an unknown driver. She then strikes up a close friendship with Ace. All of these characters act strangely and it is clear that the meteorite storm is affecting them just as it unaccountably brings the dead back to life to roam the streets and eat people. Soon Ace discovers a grisly roadside dismemberment and has to prove his courage. Tobio who has a remarkable secret of her own is under threat from the zombies and the plaid babe has to break into a stock of weapons to defend herself. All this while Guitar Wolf needs to first help Ace fight off the angry club owner then save the world...    Such trivial plotting and mediocre acting provide window dressing to the film's main elements Guitar Wolf's rockabilly insouciance in the face of danger and Ace's own rite of passage the stumbling flesheaters appearing with predictable regularity and the drugcrazed club owner now dressed in hot pants hunting the singer. The result is frankly an entirely inconsequential mishmash although such a criticism is irrelevant to those who would savour the throwaway lunacy of it all. Takeuchi's first time direction is mundane at best exemplified in the couple of times he clumsily attempts cross cutting such as between Ace battling the zombies and Tobio's calm walkabout in her trainers which seem misplaced and unnecessary. Cross cutting to increase suspense or to effectively showcase parallel action is beyond a director whose visual reticence indeed often works against Guitar's screen impact. More unforgivably while the bargain basement flying saucer effects and gory visuals of disembowelment are well done there is no feeling of real horror in the picture merely some vaguely tense scenes as Ace and others are surrounded. The gathering claustrophobia and social comment found in Romero's originals are entirely absent. The flourish and demonstration of a butterflyknife at one point a scene which would have undoubtedly been cut a few years back by the squeamish BBFC promises some tough street fighting which never materialises  a shame as it would have promised more immediacy and danger than we ever see here. One or two moments are effective the sad zombie that Toschi becomes for instance played by a peculiarly Buscemilike Japanese actor wondering the streets before being reunited with his zombie girlfriend. Or Guitar's leap from an exploding room in a threestorey building to land unscathed and then casually retune his instrument. Such wit is hard to find in a film playing like an off the wall drivein movie and for those not attuned can drag terribly.   At the end of the film Guitar dispatches an alien mothership with his sword drawn from his guitar  a striking action that in a single move encapsulates both the strengths and weakness of a crazy film. Standing on the roof blade erect to slice open the metal belly Guitar is cool without being quite convincing the plot's climax barmy without being brilliant. If we can accept Guitar's keen edge hacking through a low flying spacecraft without laughing the wrong way then no doubt we will accept and forgive much else seen too. Unfortunately this viewer had his doubts. In Ace's words At the end of the road you've gotta be grateful and I had reason to agree with him.".

Of course I realize that is the point the movie is trash and it knows it is but it isn't trash in a good way it's just ridiculous. Many stupid elements are thrown in and the only reason for that seems to be to make the film more ridiculous. The central character Ace isn't a likable guy not even in an Ashfromtheevildead sort of way he's just irritating. The movie is basically just a meandering mess in which many silly and gory sequences are strung together with little or no cohesion at all. When going into a film like this a selfproclaimed piece of trash you can't expect a great screenplay and a logical plot but even from bad films I've come to expect better. Wild Zero is directed by a music video director and this is blatantly obvious throughout the movie. It basically is just one long music video with things popping up here and there simply to try and entertain the viewer and that's another thing  the movie isn't very entertaining. Usually for a film like this despite low production values one can say at least it was entertaining but for a lot of it's 98 minute running time Wild Zero is boring and at times even painful to watch. The scene in which two zombies 'fall in love' springs to mind immediately for the painful part of the film  it's not big it's not clever just stupid. And then there's a thing with a girl that turns out to be a guy. The movie professes that love has no boundaries nationalities or gender. This message completely lost in a trash film such as this and it comes across as just being there to make the film more stupid. In a film like The Crying Game a message like this can and does work but come on not in a silly zombie film  please! Another bad thing about is this movie is the band Guitar Wolf. If you're going to make a trash movie with a rock band at least make it a cool one. Guitar Wolf comes across as being a boring bunch of idiots in this film.That's not to say that Wild Zero is completely devoid of positive aspects. There is a hilarious short conversation about who has seen the classic Night of the Living Dead and some of the zombie attack sequences are good mostly due to the heavy gore which is always nice to see. The movie also features an impressive arsenal of weapons from rocket launchers to shotguns to broomsticks. However none of these things are enough to save this mess. It isn't destined to be a cult classic because it simply isn't that good. It's maybe worth watching if you're a diehard fan of ridiculous movies or if you really love the better side of Asian horror as opposed to the boring ghost story side but otherwise I recommend leaving this alone and seeing the superior Asian zombie flick BioZombie instead which is silly in all the right places.".

If Robert Rodriguez was dead he'd be rolling in his grave right now. The simple fact that people just looooooves this film and hates Rodriguez's El mariachi is because Rodriguez is American and this film is Japanese therefore... Well you know.

	schema:reviewBody "In the tradition of 'Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park' and other lousy band films we have 'Wild Zero'  a selfproclaimed hyperactive rock n' roll zombie adventure from Japanese punk band Guitar Wolf. If I were to describe to you the things that unfold in the film naked women zombies UFOs ect you would be jazzed as hell to see this film. I was.But man... it looks like people are just too easy to please because aside from a few inspired moments this film is EMPTY! 'Wild Zero' was made by a music video director who publicly claimed that movies don't interest him in the slightest. Believe me...IT SHOWS! I'm not a snob who overanalyzes film structure but I do know that a fun cult movie needs to do more than randomly strung together wacky and hyperactive scenes. There may be a lot going on here but as a whole this movie is a whole lotta nothing!  Skip this overrated hackjob and go watch 'Versus' again.".

It is further handicapped by some pretty iffy digital effects including several very crap CGI head explosions and some of the most laughable zombie makeup in film history.In fact the whole affair feels very much like a calculated ploy to attract a cult following and I suspect that many of those who sing its praises feel obliged to do so lest they should be deemed 'uncool'. Personally I prefer my cult films to have a less manufactured vibe.Still it's not ALL bad news I suppose the film has loads of energy the soundtrack is pretty good and Burberry babe flashes her norks.3.5 out of 10 generously rounded up to 4 for IMDb.".

This crazed offering sees a group of godlike rock 'n' rollers played by Guitar Wolf who are playing themselves if you see what I mean fighting off tons of Romeroinspired zombies all with a coolness which is impossible to believe.The other plot elements and characters are thrown into the plot somewhat haphazardly there's an alien invasion of UFOs thanks to some startlingly good CGI effects there's a tender romance story between a wouldbe rocker and a pretty girl with a dark secret there is a fair amount of headexploding zombie bloodshed for those who enjoy that kind of thing lots of sweary annoying characters who end up getting eaten a gay bad guy with a bad dresscode and much much more. Things culminate in a truly explosive finale involving rocket launchers grenade launchers. and a zombie who can shoot electric killer rays out of his eyeballs. It's incredible. The film has both highs and lows and is a little unfulfilling if you're looking for linear narrative but so much inventiveness and energy has been thrown into the action that as I said earlier in this review it's actually impossible to dislike I tried and failed.".

	schema:headline " San Francisco's Experiment With Vigilantes 1851  1856";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1848 the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican  American War with the secession of territory from Mexico to the U.S. of most of the current southwestern U.S. California Arizona New Mexico any claims to Texas  as well as parts of Colorado Utah and Nevada. This was a war of conquest by the U.S. but to assuage American consciences fifteen million dollars was paid to Mexico for this territory. Only a subsequent bit of southern Arizona and New Mexico known as the Gadsden Purchase was made as an addition in 1853 by the Pierce Administration giving us the current southwestern border.While the territory of Northern California as opposed to the territory of Baja or Southern California  still part of Mexico had always been a bit too far from Mexico City for proper control over local government the change to Washington D.C.  more than twice the distance and across a continent  further seemed to weaken national control of the territory. Moreover the population being mostly Latino was hostile to the nonLatino U.S. Government. It is in the next few years that California's socalled answer to Robin Hood Joachin Murrieta is continuing the Mexican War by his guerrillabandit attacks. Under normal circumstances it would have taken a generation for the U.S. to be really bothered by this. But in 1849 gold was discovered in California and the world rushed in. Suddenly the territory had nearly one million population within a year and demanded statehood. This would lead to the controversy about admitting California to the Union as an free state and unbalancing the balance of the U.S. Senate. This in turn led to the Compromise of 1850 which enabled California to enter the Union as a free state but guaranteed a fugitive slave act as a sop to the South. It put off the Civil War or ignited the path to the Civil War ten years later.But for a big state with wealth and population and size California had a bad reputation. The towns of San Francisco and Los Angeles boomed in population  in particular San Francisco with it's immense harbor. But their governments were pitifully unable to maintain public order. Fires arson caused were frequent. So were killings usually tied to robberies of the prospectors with more gold than sense. Judges and police were frequently paid off by gamblers and crime gang leaders. Finally in 1851 the better elements of San Francisco put their foot down and formed a vigilante committee. They arrested several dubious characters held streamlined trials where many legal niceties were ditched and if the parties were found guilty which usually happened they were hanged in public. It sort of calmed things down but then the continued prosperity of the state caused the same problems to reappear. In 1856 two incidents reignited the Vigilante Committee. First a local outspoken newspaper editor James King of William was shot and killed by a corrupt local political alderman named James Carey. Then a gambler named Charles Cora shot and killed a police official. Both men were arrested given the drumhead trial convicted and hanged. The Vigilantes retained control of San Francisco for the rest of the next year before disbanding. They never had to make a third appearance.Were they real heroes or a lynch mob? It still is debated. James King of William was right about the corruption and crime but he was a Nativist and his attacks were also against Catholics such as Carey an Irish American and Cora an Italian American. Many of his fellows were also Protestants and some may have had pecuniary interests in attacking the businesses controlled by the Catholics. So the real situation is not black and white like this film suggests.Edward G. Robinson's Luis Chamalis was based on Charles Cora although the triangle with Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrae is from whole cloth. Col. Marcus Cobb Frank Craven is based on James King of William although King of William was never reduced to such stunning superficiality as Cobb is for nearly a year. Robinson's grip on the whole of San Francisco is fictitious Cora never had that much power. The leadership of the Vigilantes Harry Carey reflect the moral center of the Vigilantes movement that was unquestioned in American History books of the 1935. It is a good film with fine performances by Robinson Hopkins Craven Brian Donleavy who's physical appearance makes him look like the corrupt contemporary Mayor of New York City Fernando Wood and Brennan. McCrae is sturdy and acts well but his role seems terribly naive. It is fun trying to locate David Niven as a drunken cockney sailor tossed out of Robinson's saloon he recalled it fondly in THE MOON'S A BALLOON. Robinson's recollections of the film were downers in ALL MY YESTERDAYS he had political disputes about the oncoming World War II with isolationists Hopkins Carey Craven Brennan McCrae and director Hawks. Hopkins kept trying to upstage him and the others until he let her have it before the cast and crew who applauded him for it. He also felt the end was a let down. Quietly told by Carey and his associates it is time to accompany them to his neck stretching party he quietly joins them as though they have come to take him to deliver a political speech! Still the film merits an 8 out of 10.".

The list is almost endless except for musicals because his career spanned seven! decades. I'll watch Robinson in anything.Tall 6'3 blond and blueeyed born in Southern California Joel McRea is as gorgeous a man as ever faced a camerabut he had very little range. He could affect a few things steely determination boyish charm and thoughtful confusion were comfort zones but his face almost never changed except to smile a bit from time to time.

Brian Donlevy also makes a notable impression in a classic blackhat role as Louis' coolheaded enforcer and Joel McCrea in a change from later laconic Western roles is a whimsical young poet who proves a surprisingly 'good loser'.And where the film scores for me is in these unexpected touches characters almost never do either what social convention or more subtly cinematic conventions would lead us to expect. Marriage? That must have been somebody else... The final scenes  in which the villain defies all plot expectations by sparing the hero's life winning the heroine's hand and then throwing it all back in her face with a raised hat and a roughness that spares her his knowledge that he is walking to a certain ugly death  are nerveshaking in their intensity. And far from being a plot copout this is the final fruition of depths to the character that have been developed throughout Louis Chamalis over whom only his 'Swan' has any influence at all yet who cannot be content with the bargain that yields him her body and not her heart dominates as the antihero of the whole picture.The script is good and Walter Brennan whose role was vastly expanded during shooting from what was originally a threeday bitpart in particular makes the most of it. Miriam Hopkins is perhaps more effective and probably more enjoyable as Louis' cynically pragmatic equal than she is as the redeemed 'fallen woman' McCrea is unexpectedly engaging as the naive but philosophical youngster who somewhat late in the day crosses her path. Much play is made of the San Francisco fog while I Dream of Jeannie with the LightBrown Hair is to my taste somewhat overused in the soundtrack.I found the film a good one and much more rewarding than biographer Todd McCarthy's dismissal of it as nominally entertaining in a bland way 'Howard Hawks The Grey Fox of Hollywood' would suggest.".

Edward G. Robinson is at his snarling best as a nineteenth century version of Little Caesar on San Francisco's Barbary Coast during the gold rush days.Basically Miriam Hopkins has come to San Francisco to marry a newly minted millionaire whom she barely knows but finds he's dead and fortune gone on her arrival. Since there was no real love involved she doesn't have a problem teaming up with the man who probably had her fianc robbed and killed that being Edward G. Robinson.It's a pretty lawless place San Francisco. It's been newly acquired by the USA in the Mexican War and it being one of the great natural harbors of the world a perfect arrival point for people traveling by sea to the gold fields. And such law that's operating is pretty much operating for the town bosses. There is a scene where after Brian Donlevy who's Robinson's chief henchman kills a man a trial is held right in Robinson's gambling palace. It's an impromptu affair with a crooked judge who naturally finds Donlevy not guilty.It's no wonder that certain citizens form a vigilante committee to restore some kind of justice to San Francisco. All part of the colorful history of that place. And that part of the film is well done.Where Barbary Coast fails is in the romance department. Miriam Hopkins though a woman of conscience has a practical side to her. The weakness of the film is in Joel McCrea's performance. He's a prospector who having made his fortune wants to return home. He has a chance encounter with Hopkins and she takes a shine to him and McCrea doesn't know she's Robinson's main squeeze.Now I'm a big fan of Joel McCrea the most virtuous of heroes Hollywood ever produced. But in this one he's not really virtuous as much as he's an idiot. Let's just say that I cannot understand why Hopkins wants anything to do with him. A much stronger character might have believably taken her from Robinson but not McCrea in this film.Barbary Coast was responsible for the first real notices of two prominent character actors. Walter Brennan had been knocking around for years but he received his first real attention as a player as waterfront character Old Atrocity. And with minimal dialog Brian Donlevy made his first real impression on film audiences as Robinson's strong arm killer.It's entertaining but I'd mute the sound when Barbary Coast turns away from the action.".

Miriam Hopkins plays a poor girl from New York who travels to San Francisco to marry a man she's never met but once she arrives she learns that he has been murdered. Since she didn't love him she decides to team up with the man responsible for his death a ruthless casino owner Edward G. Robinson who wants to keep the town under his rule. Soon the woman begins to have second thoughts after meeting young man Joel McCrea from her old hometown. Hawks has a big following today and many consider him one of the greatest director's of all time but I'm really not sure I'd join such high praise. I did find it rather strange that when people mention his work this title is often left out which is too bad because I found this to be one of the most entertaining of his career even though he did take the picture over from William Wyler. Some have called this LITTLE CAESAR set during the gold rush and that might be a fair saying but you could also mix in another Robinson picture THE HATCHET MAN. This film here is pulp entertainment from start to finish as we have three legends really giving it their all in a pretty good story that contains romance action drama comedy and one masterfully directed sequence. This sequence takes place as a vigilante group is holding a trial while walking through some mud. The sound effects used here and the constant editing down towards the mud is priceless and will certainly remain in the viewers mind long after the film ends. Robinson dives head first into his role and really delivers one of the finest performances of his career. His scenes where the character goes mad or better yet love struck are priceless and really pack a nice little punch as he goes off the deep end. The evilness Robinson brings to the role was not only creepy but it added to the entertainment value just because it will also put a smile on your face. Hopkins is also terrific and manages to deliver a full performance full of all sorts of emotions. Her character goes through various stages and the actress captures all of them perfectly. Her and Robinson have wonderful chemistry and I was shocked to learn after the movie that the two hated working with one another on this film. McCrea is also terrific and plays the naive and softspoken character wonderfully. The supporting cast features the wonderful Walter Brennan Frank Craven Brian Donlevy Harry Carey and Donald Meek. The film's biggest problem is the ending which really felt added on but I haven't been able to find anywhere that it was forced by the studio. Why this film isn't better known is beyond me but there's enough packed in here for two movies so hopefully more people will check it out.".

The biggest difference was that BARBARY COAST starred Edward G. Robinson and was made by Goldwyn International Pictures whereas THE FRISCO KID starred Jimmy Cagney and was made by Warner.

Both feature the lead owning the biggest gambling house on the Barbary Coast. Both men are pretty corrupt and the excesses in their lawbreaking and control of the government resulted in the formation of a Vigilante Committee to take the law into their hands. Both featured a lady that both men are in love with but just can't seem to win. Both feature the lead having a major change of heart at the end of the film. One is ultimately hung and the other narrowly avoids a hanging. Both feature a crusading newspaper editor or owner being killed for speaking the truth.Both make San Francisco look like Hell on Earth.So in essence we have one movie not really two.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Howard Hawks rarely made misfires even Land Of The Pharaohs qualified as interesting but this hybrid Edward G. Robinson law and order saga about the wild and wooly California coast during the gold rush era of the 1850s is curiously lackluster. The movie belongs to Hopkins who shows up at the outset but Robinson doesn't stroll in until a good quarter hour has passed. The naive heroJoel McCreadoesn't arrive for about a halfhour later and he makes a rather passive hero. Basically Barbary Coast concerns a love trianble among ruthless underworld boss the mailorder bride that goes to work for him and the innocent drifter that she falls in love with much to the chagrin of the crime boss.As greedy Luis Chamalis Robinson wears an ear ring frilly shirts and owns the biggest casino in San Francisco called the Bella Donna. He dispenses the law and order but primarily it is disorder that he creates in the amoral town. Miriam Hopkins is Mary Rutledge and she has come on a squarerigged ship from New York to marry Dan Morgan but she learns on her arrival that her fianclost all his gold as well as his life at the Belle Donna gambling tables. Dan was a poor shot and poor shots do not live long in San Francisco. She refuses to leave town and winds up working the roulette wheel for Chamalis the very same roulette wheel that brought about the death of her fianc. Luis nicknames her Swan because she is as soft and desirable as a swan. Eventually Chamalis demands love and attention from Mary but she denies him these affections.One day Mary takes a horse and rides in the country but she is caught in a soaking downpour and takes refuge in a cabin. As it turns out the man in the cabin has just settled in is a Jim Carmichael Joel McCrea and he is just passing through too. This young prospector has dug sacks of gold out of the earth and is heading into town. No sooner does Jim see Mary than he falls desperately in love with her. He stumbles into the Bella Donna and loses all his gold on the roulette wheel. Mary feels guilty because she has cheated Jim just as her fianc was cheated. At the same time Luiswho rules the townwith the help of a coldblooded killer Knuckles Brian Donley suppresses the local newspaper editor Col. Marcus Aurelius Cobb Frank Craven from publishing derogatory stories about him.Things take a turn for the worst for Luis when Knuckles murders a miner Sawbuck McTavish Donald Meek and eye witnesses see him. Earlier Luis got Knuckles out of a tight spot by calling in a favor from a drunken judge but Knuckles is not so lucky this time around. Not only does he kill Sawbuck but he also kills Cobb. The newly formed vigilante committee led by Jed Slocum Harry Carey Sr of ANGEL AND THE BADMAN and his followers hang Knuckles on the spot and go after Luis. Meanwhile Mary and Jim try to escape from the jealous Luis. Just as it appears that the hero and heroine are going to bite the dust the vigilantes show up and prove the standard moral that crime does not pay and haul off Luis.There is nothing particularly outstanding about this Hawks movie. The dialogue by two Hawks collaboraters Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur is nothing special and neither is this movie. Hopkins makes an unsympathetic heroine until she falls from fellow New Yorker Jim. Walter Brennan steals the show as Old Atrocity a sneaker grifter who is never up to anything good. The characters are not that compelling and neither is their predicaments. Robinson makes a strong villain but he isn't strong enough to force Hopkins into loving him. Nothing about this wellphotographed yarn is memorable and it ends up being a minor potboiler.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Howard Hawks rarely made misfires even Land Of The Pharaohs qualified as interesting but this hybrid Edward G. Robinson law and order saga about the wild and wooly California coast during the gold rush era of the 1850s is curiously lackluster. The movie belongs to Hopkins who shows up at the outset but Robinson doesn't stroll in until a good quarter hour has passed. The naive heroJoel McCreadoesn't arrive for about a halfhour later and he makes a rather passive hero. Basically Barbary Coast concerns a love trianble among ruthless underworld boss the mailorder bride that goes to work for him and the innocent drifter that she falls in love with much to the chagrin of the crime boss.As greedy Luis Chamalis Robinson wears an ear ring frilly shirts and owns the biggest casino in San Francisco called the Bella Donna. He dispenses the law and order but primarily it is disorder that he creates in the amoral town.

	schema:reviewBody "A mediocre Hawks entertainment on his usual theme of tough displaced men and women falling in love with a very strong cast but a rather trite and badlypaced storyline. Miriam Hopkins is the selfconsciously tough broad who pitches up in Gold Rushera San Francisco and allies herself to casino owner Edward G. Robinson  who has a really funny everpresent curl trespassing onto the right hand side of his face  only to fall for soppy poet Joel McCrea. To get an idea of just how sanitised the movie is it's worth noting that Joseph Breen the head of the Hays Office thought the original script was the filthiest thing he'd ever read but regarded the film as absolutely charming. There's some wonderfully poetic Ben HechtCharles MacArthur dialogue in the opening exchanges However soiled his hands the journalist goes staggering through life with a beacon raised  just beautiful but it dries up alarmingly quickly while the story degenerates into tiresome bickering before reinventing itself as a gruesome love letter to vigilantism. Breen seemed to espouse a strict prodeathpenalty anti doublebed viewpoint that's difficult to get on board with nowadays. I'm also not sure what the form is on everybody celebrating the arrival of a white woman  seems a bit racist.There are a few atmospheric shots in fogshrouded San Francisco  though conveying the sweep of the burgeoning town is never even attempted  but the real selling point is the performances. Hopkins gives one of those faintly wooden subStanwyck but nonetheless intriguing performances combining genuine even enrapturing emotional attractiveness with the ability to be a bit irritating while both Walter Brennan and Robinson make the most of familiar roles Brennan a hoarse crook with an eyepatch and a quietlyemerging conscience Robinson a menacinglymewling tough guy who doesn't really understand how love works. McCrea is cast in one of those parts that can come off as unbearably smug I'm thinking of Leslie Howard's horrendous role in The Petrified Forest while the script asks him to swallow some rather questionable plot developments but he's not bad playing more fey and sensitive than was usually required. There's also a very funny bit part for J.M Kerrigan who shines as a drunk judge in an incongruous inappropriate but riotous comic interlude. Barbary Coast never really manages to clamber over its main obstacle  a disjointed at times slightly tedious story  but some very nice acting and the odd good line or arty shot make it worth a look especially for fans of the director.".

	schema:headline " A Lesser Hawks Film...But Still An Entertaining Ride";
	schema:reviewBody "I miss films like 1935's Barbary Coast. These are the kind of oldfashioned melodramas that have been driven to extinction. I am not entirely sure that this movie would have been the best kind of oldfashioned film but it has all the elements that I come to expect from these type of films. For the most part the film was very entertaining. There is a romanticized and somewhat crass love triangle that lays at the heart of the film. I like this unconventional for its time love triangle because it plays to the dark side. The cinematography really plays well to the tone and the atmosphere. There is an abundance of fog and that really gives a sense of mystery to the city of San Francisco which was known as Barbary Coast to its citizens during the time period the film is set in. This film was directed by Howard Hawks who is known as one of cinema's greatest auteurs. It is not his greatest film and I would even call this film a major Bproduction which means it still is good but not great. This marks Hawk's first production with famed producer Samuel Goldwyn. For this movie Goldwyn came up with the title and tasked two of Hollywood's best writers Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur to create a story under that title. In addition to the love story they created themes you could pull out of a Western. They created a tale about how you can survive in the lawless West. There is this gold digger named Mary Rutledge Miriam Hopkins who arrives by boat to the shores of San Francisco to meet up with her mailorder husband. She comes to find out that he mysteriously died after falling in debt to a gangster named Louis Chamalis Edward G. Robinson. Louis also happened to be the owner of the nightclub where Mary's husband owed debt to. Mary decides to get work as a roulette operator in the saloon of Chamalis. He admits to her that he has fallen in love with her but she does not return his love. During one walk in a rainstorm she falls in love after meeting gold prospector Jim Carmichael Joel McCrea. Jim is on his way home with several bags full of gold he found. Chamalis is going to do all he can to grab that gold and make Mary love him the way he loved her. The movie has several great performances to work with. Miriam Hopkins is a great actress although stories have been told how hard it was to work with her. Maybe her personality worked well with the type of unsympathetic character she was portraying because I could not stand her character for a long part of the movie and that is how it was meant to be. Edward G. Robinson gave a great villainous performance. He looked every part of the villain type even with that uglylooking earring on his one ear. The rest of the cast including the likes of Walter Brennan and David Niven in a very early cameo role do a great job. The one thing that stood out to me the most was how women was portrayed. Hopkins portrays a character who is strongwilled and performs tasks that guys would do remember this film came out in 1935. This was a rarity for its time. Barbary Coast is a lesser Howard Hawks film but this is a legend we are talking about. The movie was still a very entertaining ride from start to finish. This film might even have the only rowboat chase scene in any movie ever released so that is another reason why you might want to give this oldie a watch. My Grade B".

The love scenes belong to Hopkins who puts them over while McCrea is along for the ride. He always lacked acting range and this film is no exception. The action scenes are very effective and of a different sort but this movie relies on its screenplay which is very absorbing. I thought Barbary Coast was better than I expected and a cut above many actioners of the 30's.";

The story captures a little glimpse of history on how it was at the beginning of our startup years ago. The tale is similar to the Wild West in that there was much opportunity but little or no law. This is portrayed very well here emphasizing that money buys right and might but only so far. Take note that there was gold to be mined and some of it took time and minors get bored and restless about dreaming and want to start spending thus the gambling halls and saloons. They serve as a break from the daily trenches but with a catch many did not see coming. Honest and tired as well as drunk and bored miners can be cheated and cheating was more profitable quicker and easier too. That is exactly what summons the need for law and order. In the early Western years Marshalls and deputies were ruthlessly murdered anyway you could kill them with no one to stop the perpetrators until an equal force was brought to bear. We this in this movie when vigilante groups are formed and fight fire with fire. Enjoy this quickmoving and engaging movie with a nice sandwich and a tasty drink with a favorite snack to follow. There were many ways to make a living this be one of them. Enjoy".

	schema:reviewBody "Especially in the early decades of talkies the rowdy Barbary coast of San Francisco was a popular story locale for Hollywood films. These often featured a selfmade kingpin as the lead male and a young naive woman from the East who becomes the star attraction of the kingpin's main business establishment as the lead female. Some examples include Frisco Kid released the same year as this film San Francisco released the next year and the later Fox musical Hello Frisco Hello. As kingpins go Eddie Robinson's pugnacious powerdriven character the colorful Luis Chamalis is portrayed as an extreme version claiming to own about everything and everybody worth owning in SFno doubt a gross exaggeration.I'm very surprised that no one has noted the striking parallels between the plot and characters of this film with the later The Sea Wolf which again has Eddie Robinson hamming it up as a supertyrant who knows his time as such is limited but would rather go down with his ship than relinquish his all powerful position. In The Sea Wolf Ida Lupino serves as the equivalent of Miriam Hopkinsas Mary Rutledge in the present film. Literary Alexander Knox and drifter John Garfield serve as a combo of the characters portrayed by Joel McCrea Frank Craven and Harry Carry in the present film who provide the most effective male resistance against the bully. Also fog is a frequent feature of the outdoor scenes in both these BW films.Eddie and Mariam together carry this film both skilled in imparting great melodramatic intensity to their characters. In the first half of the film Mariam's Mary'Swan' to Chamalis appears to be the female equivalent of Chamalis's amoral hustler character. On the other hand she appears to be the only person who can influence Chamalis to tone down his cruel and murderous deeds to maintain his status as the de facto boss of SF. Whereas Chamalis appears to be irredeemably evil until the very end when he knows his game is up Mariam's character is eventually revealed as more complex. She can no longer stomach her role in cheating prospectors out of all their gold and as the moll of a man as cruel and murderous as Chamalis. Thus she eventually succumbs to the initially repulsed overtures of handsome laconic literary native NYC prospector Jim CarmichaelJoel McCrea who agrees to do menial jobs for Chamalis to earn a ticket back to NYC after losing all his gold to Chamalis's fixed gambling wheel hosted by Mary. Somehow Jim detects a moral Mary underneath her facade as a cheating hustler. Whereas Mary initially mocks Jim's easy going poetic persona she eventually accepts his offer to take her back to their native NYC. Naturally Chamalis is opposed to this development.As is true in some other films McCrea's character who serves as the romantic lead is not the lead malea villain in this case nor the main dramatic hero. True he offers to provide Mary with an acceptable avenue of escape from Chamalis's world but it's Jed SlocumHarry Cary as the leader of the vigilante committee and Colonel CobbFrank Craven as the newspaper ownereditor who are the main heroes of the movement to destroy Chamalis's evil empire.Although Brian Donlevy as Chamalis's chief bouncer and hatchet man'Knuckles' doesn't have a great deal to say this role catapulted his film career. A few years later he would be McCrea's chief adversary in Cecil de Mille's epic western Union Pacific. Charismatic Walter Brennan as Old Atrocity is a significant player in Chamalis's operations if he receives no respect. Besides charging outrageous sums to ferry new arrivals from ships to shore he talks up Chamalis's establishment to prospectors.Apparently he has a lifelong history of criminal doings all over the US...Near the end of the film 'Old Atrocity' Mary and even Chamalis perform acts relating to Jim that offer a small measure of redemption for their evil doings. Knucles doesn't get a chance for redemption. The vigilante committee took care of him first in a crackdown on Chamalis's empire.The background and very limited stage music is almost exclusively Stephen Foster standards especially Jeanne with the Light Brown Hair. Foster composed most of his well known songs from 184854. Only Oh Suzanna was composed just in time for the '49ers. If this story takes place in 1850 The Camptown Races featured in one scene would have been a current hit. Jeanne wasn't composed until 1854.".

I even recall the yawning plague from the horror he penned in the Gunslinger which was only saved by fiery red maned Beverly Garland.The Undead although not pertaining to zombies or ghouls but the unholy one has a certain je ne sais quoi...a campy strange feel. Sure it was shot on some studio set and it looks like the entire village consists of less than 10 people. However the effort put into this actually makes it a trip to watch. I don't know what the whole prostitute angle is or the question of whether or not a streetwalker is valued higher than a damsel accused of heresy but it is a first! The eccentric yet most recalled character Smolkin steals any scene he's in so much so that the Hey diddle diddle the cat in the fiddle... tune was stuck in my mind that even the homeless guys asking for change gave me odd glances when I was singing that walking near Fulton St. Witch Livia played by bombshell Allison Hayes she can hex me anytime! plays the sultry seducing spellcaster to a point! No wonder Pendragon couldn't resist poor dope. Cast a plus for Meg the gnarled crone who really makes you wonder if she collects toadstools and brimstone in her spare time. Nice chin too! Add in creature transformations the impishly diabolical Billy Barty laughing from the underworld and this is one strange mamma jamma. Also they actually took time to write scenes in ye olde English which just throws you for seven loops. This also may require several viewings to figure out what exactly is going on. Oh last but not least don't forget cameo by Bruno VeSota who heads our cast to his quaint inn.What's really over the top? Our fey prince of darkness laughs with such levity that cannot be Shatnerized. You have your typical scrupulous doctor who can't even pronounce correctly. It's NEPAL not nippal! I really liked the bureaucractic feel of the Witch's Sabbath too. So be sure to STAY and see one of Corman's more entertaining yarns. Also watch this one MSTified and you'll appreciate it even more.

	schema:reviewBody "For sheer entertainment value it's hard to beat this little 1957 B movie from cult director Roger Corman and screen writer Charles Griffith. The complicated storyline is taken from the then current fad of belief in previous lives revealed under hypnosis. An obnoxious scientist enlists the reluctant aid of a former professor to send a prostitute named Diana Love back in time.SPOILERS AHEAD The unexpected result is that she actually goes back physically as well as mentally to the middle ages. The arrogant scientist then follows her to take part in the strange and unpredictable results of his experiment.There are many clever ideas and colorful performances crammed into a movie that runs barely over an hour. A few marvelous bits include Bruno VeSota as the innkeeper Scroop bragging to the sexy witch Livia  Allison Hayes that he can keep any witches from his door by the use of garlic. The sultry sorceress pretends to be impressed and proceeds to eat the clove of garlic as her imp  Billy Barty snickers under the table. Richard Devon is clearly having a great time playing a sneering egotistical Satan laughing at the foolishness of mortals. Dorothy Neumann as the good witch Meg Maud is the ultimate cackling old hag with a kind heart and a sardonic sense of humor. One marvelous bit has her laughing at her rival Livia trapped in mouse form beneath a drinking vessel  Ah Livia I see thou art in thy cups!  The other great character is the rhyming grave digger Smolkin played by Mel Welles as a muttering commentator on the strange events making up morbid limericks as he works. This film will never be mistaken for great cinematic art but it is an outrageously entertaining movie that should be seen by all Roger Corman cultists and lovers of Fifties horror movies. Not to be missed!".

I must say that this is the only movie I've seen on MST3K that did not fully deserve it's treatment. Granted there are a lot of problems with the film. The perfomers for the most part were mediocre. But not so bad as to make the film unwatchable.The production values had the distinct odor of cheese to them but what can you expect from circa 1957?The plotline is interesting. A mad scientist hires a street hooker to be a guinea pig on his experiments on past life regession. He transports the woman to 16th century Europe where in this incarnation she is a witch. The woman has to make a choice of whether or not to allow her past incarnation to die so her future lives can come into beingor stay in the past to live with her lover. Of course this guy is such a twit death might be preferable to a lifetime with him. So maybe she really had no choice after all.What makes this so interesting is that the whole thing had a anachronistic newagey quasifeminist tone that is about ten years ahead of it's time. I actually found myself ignoring Mike and the 'bots and trying to concentrate on what was going on in the film. It's the first time that had ever happened. When I saw the nonMSTie version I actually grew to like it. Check it out. You might be surprised.".

But even a broken clock can be right twice a day and one of those moments was with The Undead.I don't know where he got the script but it is a solid piece of science fiction. Don't let the witches and knights fool you this is no fantasy filmthe primary theme is one of time travel and its ramifications as well as the hubris of man to toy with such powers. The climax is masterfully written and the cast is competent enough to pull it off so long as you're not distracted by the wonderful Allison Hayes'...ah...considerable acting talent. Two talents as the case may be. Nevertheless she performs her role admirably as does most of the cast and by the time the climax roles around the tension has been built with a practiced hand finally able to use tools worthy of the job. The joy at being able to do so is plainly evident in the last half hour of the film. I would give it a higher rating were it not for the poor production value and the fact that it was evidently just another movieoftheweek for Corman who should have realized it was worth just a little bit more effort. Regardless he managed to pull together a solid film with a heartbreaking and moving theme with actors capable of handling the busy dialouge. This film gets a short shrift but it deserves much more recognition. Allison Hayes steals the show up to the brilliant climax. There's a reason Leonard Maltin gave The Undead three out of four stars and you'll see it if you're willing to look past the production value and the MST3K crew's skewering.".

	schema:headline " THE UNDEAD Roger Corman 1957 12";
	schema:reviewBody "I had long wanted to purchase the Region 2 DVD it's still M.I.A. in the U.S. of this one but somehow I kept postponing it  I remember there was some discussion whether the Fullscreen presentation here was the correct Aspect Ratio  and it eventually went outofprint. Luckily I stumbled upon a single copy at the Oxford Street branch of Virgin Megastores while in London last month and quickly lapped it up. Distressingly as has been happening with some of the stuff I brought over from the U.K. the picture froze as soon as the film started on my Pioneer model  so I switched it onto the cheaper DivX player I acquired some months back and it proceeded to play all the way through without a glitch! Anyway to get back to the film I have to admit that I was somewhat underwhelmed by it on this initial viewing  even if I readily concede that it's one of Corman's most ambitious and interesting efforts from this era with a plot clearly inspired by the true case history dealt with in THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY MURPHY 1956 the only other three of Corman's early horror titles that I've watched are A BUCKET OF BLOOD 1959 THE WASP WOMAN 1959 and THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS 1960. I know that with the budgets usually allowed Corman at this time not much could be expected with respect to the film's look  but its partial period setting perhaps hampers it more than most in later years the blackandwhite TOWER OF London 1962 suffers a comparable fate visvis the more visually lavish Poe adaptations.The inadequate leads notwithstanding the cast responds enthusiastically to the inherent campiness of the piece with Allison Hayes as a wicked yet voluptuous sorceress Mel Welles as a Shakespearean gravedigger and Richard Devon as an equally theatrical Satan coming off best  though the usually reliable Billy Barty makes for a rather obnoxious imp. Still while the climactic Witches' Sabbath with its clever twist ending and a brief appearance by the ubiquitous Dick Miller is an undeniable highlight the blank verse and 'Olde English' pronunciation utilized throughout the reenactment of the heroine's past life gets tiresome pretty quickly that said this illadvised attempt at respectability the barren sets and general lack of period sense would have fooled no one even back then!  for the record the film suffered the ignominy of being spoofed on Mystery Science Theater 3000  does look forward to the somewhat similar yet rather more successful INCUBUS 1965 which was filmed for no discernible reason in Esperanto! Among the DVD supplements are 9 theatrical trailers of titles in the Arkoff Film Library  though curiously not one for THE UNDEAD itself I'd be interested to watch DAY THE WORLD ENDED 1955 THE SHECREATURE 1956 BLOOD OF Dracula 1957 EARTH VS.

	onyx:emotionText "I had long wanted to purchase the Region 2 DVD it's still M.I.A. in the U.S. of this one but somehow I kept postponing it  I remember there was some discussion whether the Fullscreen presentation here was the correct Aspect Ratio  and it eventually went outofprint. Luckily I stumbled upon a single copy at the Oxford Street branch of Virgin Megastores while in London last month and quickly lapped it up. Distressingly as has been happening with some of the stuff I brought over from the U.K. the picture froze as soon as the film started on my Pioneer model  so I switched it onto the cheaper DivX player I acquired some months back and it proceeded to play all the way through without a glitch! Anyway to get back to the film I have to admit that I was somewhat underwhelmed by it on this initial viewing  even if I readily concede that it's one of Corman's most ambitious and interesting efforts from this era with a plot clearly inspired by the true case history dealt with in THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY MURPHY 1956 the only other three of Corman's early horror titles that I've watched are A BUCKET OF BLOOD 1959 THE WASP WOMAN 1959 and THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS 1960. I know that with the budgets usually allowed Corman at this time not much could be expected with respect to the film's look  but its partial period setting perhaps hampers it more than most in later years the blackandwhite TOWER OF London 1962 suffers a comparable fate visvis the more visually lavish Poe adaptations.The inadequate leads notwithstanding the cast responds enthusiastically to the inherent campiness of the piece with Allison Hayes as a wicked yet voluptuous sorceress Mel Welles as a Shakespearean gravedigger and Richard Devon as an equally theatrical Satan coming off best  though the usually reliable Billy Barty makes for a rather obnoxious imp. Still while the climactic Witches' Sabbath with its clever twist ending and a brief appearance by the ubiquitous Dick Miller is an undeniable highlight the blank verse and 'Olde English' pronunciation utilized throughout the reenactment of the heroine's past life gets tiresome pretty quickly that said this illadvised attempt at respectability the barren sets and general lack of period sense would have fooled no one even back then!  for the record the film suffered the ignominy of being spoofed on Mystery Science Theater 3000  does look forward to the somewhat similar yet rather more successful INCUBUS 1965 which was filmed for no discernible reason in Esperanto! Among the DVD supplements are 9 theatrical trailers of titles in the Arkoff Film Library  though curiously not one for THE UNDEAD itself I'd be interested to watch DAY THE WORLD ENDED 1955 THE SHECREATURE 1956 BLOOD OF Dracula 1957 EARTH VS.

Clearly this was NOT meant to be taken completely seriously as we have a rhyming grave digger named Smolkinone of the best and most entertaining characters in the film witches imps black cats and the devil himself all running around in the back woods...but this film sure is fun to watch and has a story that ties together in a very unpredictable fashion at the very end. The writing is filled with dark comedic undertonessomething not at all unusual for Corman. The costumes and settings are well achieved for a film which likely had very little money behind it. Also on hand are low budget film goddess Allison Hayes one of the most stunningly beautiful women to ever grace the screen and Pamela Duncanwho is certainly quite lovely too in the dual role of Elaine and Diana Love. There's rarely been a greater conflict for a character to deal one than the one that faces Elaine here...I was stunned by the ending.The scenes in Professor Olinger's office are less effective throughout the film and hamper from the more unusual and entertaining past setting but it all comes off very well in the end. The low budgets means you also see the strings on the bats in the film but all in all I didn't careI had a great time watching this low budget classic and I heartily recommend it to those who can appreciate it. If you enjoyed THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN A BUCKET OF BLOOD and LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS be sure to check this one out too.".

The premise is pretty daring for 1957 and like the earlier film I Married a Witch this movie forces males in the audience and probably a few of the women to feel physical attraction to and thereby sympathy for a witch. The actress is really very extraordinary to see. Sympathy in the 1950s audience is also created for a prostitute another bad person not only by emphasizing her looks but by making her or rather her French incarnation the most noble character on the screen. The people who sell their souls to Satan and celebrate a forbidden mass also come across as basically sympathetic figures because of their miserable fortunes in a difficult repressive society. And The Undead is almost aggressively feminist even with the bad witch appearing as a much stronger figure than Satan and the male doctor who manipulates the poor prostitute ultimately looking quite awful. Apart from all this antisocial artistry the atmosphere is evoked well and the evocation of lawlessness and lifebeyondrespectability is very effective.I admire The Undead and encourage people to see the film without robots in the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Undead has all the trademarks of a Corman film. It's got sensational themes cheap sets highly stylized and overripe Elizabethan dialog a plot with severe Attention Deficit Disorder and B to Z level actors trying hard to maintain their dignity in a thankless situation. If you were to tune into this by accident 30 minutes in without a glance at a program guide or knowing anything about the plot or the actors you'd be able to say Corman within 30 seconds. Speaking of the actors the performances here are what the movie seems to call for. The major exception is the weird angry burst of energy from the time traveler near the end of the movie when he tells the heroine to STAY!!!!!. It's like watching an outbreak of dramatic Tourette's syndrome.I don't have a problem with complicated plots and esoteric concepts like time travel past life regression romantic triangles and witchcraft. But Corman can't even come close to pulling this ambitious story off in a setting of a kingdom with maybe 12 people in it and a scope of action smaller than most British bedroom farces. Especially when the plot substitutes sheer movement and scenery change for intrigue and story arc which makes the movie an exercise in padding. Once the hero Sir Gullible found his wronged romantic love for the first time all he had to do was to put her on his horse with him and ride out of the 10acre kingdom for 24 hours...and the middle 23rds of the movie would have been completely unnecessary. I'm pretty sure that Corman and the screenwriter were hoping the viewer didn't think of that. Of course then the movie would have been 30 minutes long and had a simple happy ending. This kind of plotting is emblematic of the reason that Corman would never be more than a Z level director  good basic plot ideas but no commitment to getting the details right or making them urgent and convincing. The movie also apparently thinks we are all morons. The big dramatic choice at the climax is obvious once it is stated  and it's a nice chewy one where the heroine has to choose between living out her life and having her future selves never come into being or else meeting her destined fate of an early death and sending her soul onto to its future incarnations. The implications of her dilemma and her eventual decision should have been in the actress' eyes and bearing. Meryl Streep could have pulled it off no problem and this actress does seem to have a few chops herself for a Corman cast member. BUT instead the screenplay bludgeons us over the head with the dilemma for at least five minutes with all the cast members telling her what she should do. And then the time traveler bursts in with his weird and inappropriate STAY!!!!! comment and completely distracts the viewer from the drama of the choice that the heroine must make. In the movie's defense the twist at the end is a bit eerie and unsettling and the Devil's final words to the time traveler have a nice FaustianMarlowe ring to them. That adds at least one star to the rating.Also in its favor the two babes do look smashing in their costumes even if most of the men look completely ridiculous and uncomfortable in their leotards and armor and whatnot.Billy Barty is in this. He plays an imp. Barty gives the most generic imp performance I've ever seen in my life. It's as if he was reading from the Big Golden Book of Acting under the chapter titled SmirkingGesturing And Being Short Your Best Tools for Impdom. MSTs coverage of this was some of their best work but a viewer can find plenty to poke fun at in this movie without their help if that's what suits them. Ambitous enough but definitely one of Corman's lesser efforts.".

It's got sensational themes cheap sets highly stylized and overripe Elizabethan dialog a plot with severe Attention Deficit Disorder and B to Z level actors trying hard to maintain their dignity in a thankless situation.

And later in the film this same silly spirit remainedwith witches appearing and disappearing changing form into animals and doing all kinds of incantations! And an adorable pointedeared Billy Barty was also on hand as an imp!! You really can't take this film very seriouslyand I liked that.The film begins at the present day. Two psychic researchers are trying a strange experiment using a prostitute  no not THAT sort of experimentyou sicko. They use hypnosis to take her to past lives to prove that reincarnation is possible. By the way this is actually the plot of an Ed Wood BRIDE AND THE BEAST that was made just a year earlierthough the lady was not a prostitute AND it turned out in a past life she was a gorilla!!. Unlike the Wood film most of the film is spent in the pastseeing her past life acted out for the audience. And late in the film one of the researchers himself goes to the past to rescue her when she is in peril! When they use regression it seems that the prostitute was a French woman who was accused of witchcraft centuries ago. It turned out that real witches framed her in order to get her out of the way. A female witch wanted the lady's boyfriend and framing her of consorting with the forces of darkness was a convenient way to get rid of her. And because the psychic researchers somehow interfered with time they must go back and correct any changes their study has madeand battle the Devil himself along the way! Explaining the plot any further would probably confuse youit is pretty weird and incomprehensible.The film's strengths are it unusual plot very odd ending and selfdeprecating humor. Minuses are the cheesy special effects at times such as the bats with very obvious wires supporting them as well as the confusing explanations as to how time will be affected by the woman's life or death. Overall it's a cheesy movie that actually works pretty well and is very watchablemuch more so than most of Corman's films of this era.".

This movie is a about two researchers and their attempt to send a prostitute back into one of her former lives.

It gets even more jumbled by the end with one of the researchers going back to that time to...he really doesn't need to but I guess he just wanted to check it out.  Billy Barty appears in this one as an imp and you will meet the most annoying grave digger ever.  Also watch for the good looking evil witch who can change into muliple things. Not much to recommend here unless you watch the MST 3000 version of this flick.  One thing I did learn is that you can't take your clothes with you to the past but you can take your watch apparently.".

	schema:headline " Cagney's First Screen Award Performance";
	schema:reviewBody "The rise and fall of Rocky Sullivan tough guy gangster but square fellow was the subject of this excellent film by Warner Brothers in 1938. It has several things going for it that maintains it's high ratings among gangster films and Cagney movies.For one thing Cagney's brilliant performance as Rocky won him his first major film award  the 1938 New York Film Critics Award for best actor. It is frequently forgotten that Cagney won this award four years before his Oscar winner in Yankee Doodle Dandy but in actuality the performance was the high point of the work he did up to that time as a gangster his performances in White Heat and Love Me Or Leave Me were way in the future. It drives home how much of a struggle it was for Cagney to get out of the gangster mode and why his George M. Cohan was such a striking change for his fans.Secondly it was the sequel the first sequel of the Bowery Boy feature films after their introduction in Dead End. Oddly enough in that film Humphrey Bogart was the out and out gangster Baby Face Martin who was the villain in the film. Baby Face enjoyed his following with the gang of boys in that film. Here though Bogart was playing a weaselly lawyer named Jim Frazier who is cowardly  quite a different type from Baby Face who is angry at the state of his world and how ugly it has become. But Baby Face at least had guts.The Bowery Boys are again a gang of street kids who Father Jerry Connelly Pat O'Brien is trying to keep on the straight and narrow. Here however they worship Rocky the local punk who did rise in the underworld and made a name for himself. But Rocky is Jerry's oldest friend and he is also willing to help the priest with the boys.The story deals with how Bogart and his new boss Mac Keefer the unjustly forgotten George Bancroft have gotten control of over 100000 dollars 1930 style dollars  about twenty million in buying power today that belongs to Cagney. Cagney wants it back and when Bogart and Bancroft keep putting him off he uses strong arm methods to force them into line. Eventually things blow up and Cagney ends up in a gun battle that leaves a dead cop. He is tried and found guilty for this murder and goes to the death house. This leads to one of the most frightening moments in Cagney's film career  when we see his final moments when being taken to the electric chair to be strapped in. I guarantee once seen you will never forget it.There are one or two interesting points of a historical nature about Cagney's performance as Rocky. First that massive gun battle that is shown where he kills the cop and battles the police department from a building. It actually happened! In about 1931 there was an incident in Manhattan when a young hood Two Gun Crowley held off police after a homicide in a battle that lasted nearly an entire afternoon. Crowley like Rocky was defeated by tear gas. Like Rocky he too died in the electric chair.It has been pointed out that Cagney based some of Rocky's mannerisms on a drug addict character he knew in his old Hell's GateYorkville area when he was a kid. Cagney mentions this in his memoir CAGNEY. But there is a curious second source. In his youth Jimmy Cagney came from a family that struggled but managed to have food on the table and clothes on their back. But some of his playmates were not so lucky. One was a fellow nicknamed Bootah because of the oversize boots he was forced to wear whose real name was Peter Heslin. Cagney always was friendly with Peter but their lives drifted apart. On April 5 1926 Heslin was engaged in an armed robbery when an offduty police officer Charles H. Reilly tried to stop him and was shot and killed. But Heslin who was also wounded in the encounter was captured shortly afterward. He was tried and convicted and finally executed on July 21 1927. That same night a star was born on Broadway where Jimmy Cagney made a name for himself as a singer and dancer in the show Broadway. Cagney was aware of the tragedy playing out with his friend at Sing Sing that night. He mentions Bootah's execution in his memoirs. Newspaper accounts of Heslin's electrocution do not mention anything unusual but one wonders if when Cagney was doing the scene he thought of his unfortunate friend and added a bit more power to those last moments of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Curtiz has made some great films yet the only one that tends to be well received among film fans is his contender for the best movie ever made  obviously Casablanca and Robin Hood to a lesser extent. However the man has a wealth of other influential classics under his belt that don't tend to get the recognition that they deserve and Angels With Dirty Faces is one of those films. To sum the film up easily one would say that it is a crime drama. However like the best crime dramas this one has multiple themes that elevate it from being merely a film about crime to being a character study a portrait of what it is that makes a hero and a condemnation of criminals on the whole. The story follows Rocky Sullivan and Jerry Connolly two young New York thugs the former of which is caught by the police and sent to a reform school where ironically he learns to be a criminal. The latter escapes punishment and goes on to become a priest. The story follows these two men as they meet up as adults and have an effect on the lives of the kids of their old neighbourhood.The focus of the film is always centred on the neighbourhood. This allows Curtiz to show us the effects that Rocky's criminal endeavours have on the kids of the neighbourhood more effectively. This sort of narrative would be employed in later films such as the critically acclaimed 'City of God' and works well here too. The way the film shows how impressionable young kids can be influenced by adults works brilliantly and Curtiz is able to continue this theme up until the powerful ending. James Cagney would later go on to achieve major fame in the incredible 'White Heat' but here he shows us what the quintessential New York gangster would be like. His performance in short is incredible and easily ranks among the best gangster roles of all time. The rest of the cast do well in their roles with distinct New York accents helping to firmly place the audience in the city that the film is taking place in. Furthermore the film is economic in the way it's plotted and it's also very exciting and therefore guaranteed to delight it's audience.Angels With Dirty Faces is an absolute cinema classic and quite why it isn't more famous is anyone's guess. Although not quite as good as Casablanca this is a major notch in Michael Curtiz's filmography and I wouldn't have any qualms with recommending this to film fans at all.".

Up to now they had been successfully teamed by Warner Brothers in a whole series of buddy films. In fact it is my contention that they popularized that particular genre. Here they are childhood friends but as adults adversaries due to the course in life they took.Cagney came off suspension from Warner Brothers and agreed to do this film as his comeback of sorts. At first glance it seems just like another gangster flick just what Cagney had been trying to get away from. But by force of personality and a superior script Cagney turned the role of Rocky Sullivan into a classic and got his first Academy Award nomination.As for O'Brien this was his first clerical role. Usually O'Brien is the fast talking manager press agentetc. When playing a priest Pat O'Brien slows the pace of the dialog down to a crawl and it works. He greatly expanded his range here and there were many other classic clerical roles to come.Cagney's a notorious gangster who's just been let out of prison after a three year stretch taking a fall for his crooked attorney Humphrey Bogart. Bogart was supposed to guard his 100000.00 Cagney had squirreled away from illegal activities in the Twenties. Bogart's got a new partner now in George Bancroft and neither of them wants to cut Cagney in on anything.Let's just say that Cagney in the usual Cagney fashion makes both of them wish they'd played it on the square.Father O'Brien's concern is that notorious criminal Cagney is becoming a hero to some of the neighborhood kids in his parish. But he also can't forget that the two of them had been boyhood pals and that Cagney's first brush with the law was over a petty crime that O'Brien was equally guilty of. This is shown in a small prologue with three players portraying Cagney O'Brien and neighborhood girl Ann Sheridan as kids.Young Frankie Burke is astounding in his portrayal of the young Cagney. He has him down perfectly he becomes Cagney. Angels With Dirty Faces is worth watching for him alone.Those other juvenile actors with Warner Brothers at the time The Dead End Kids play the kids from the parish who come to idolize and idealize Cagney. O'Brien has one tough time trying to make them see that Cagney's life is not the way to go in life.Angels With Dirty Faces still has a powerful message for today and film aficionados should see it because of that and because it was a key turning point in the careers of James Cagney and Pat O'Brien.".

Bogart was the bad guy in most films until he became a big star a couple years after this film. The Dead End Kids are a pretty tough bunch. Seeing them play basketball is quite a sight  more like rugby. It must be one of the highlights of this entertaining film because I remember it so well....it was so different from any other basketball game I've ever seen!The shootoutandchase scene near the end was welldone with some great filmnoir photography and the ending of the movie is quite memorable.

During that time he appeared in two films for the poverty row studio Grand National. With a few concessions to The Production Code introduced in 1934 it is nonetheless one of the great all time gangster films. The touch of legendary director Michael Curtiz is evident throughout.The story begins in the 1920s with two boyhood pals Rocky Sullivan Frankie Burke and Jerry Connelly William Tracy in the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood of New York. Rocky gets arrested by the police and is sent to the reformatory after a botched break in while Jerry escapes. While in prison Rocky learns the evils of gangsterism from within and forges a life of crime and growing up to be James Cagney.

Fr. Jerry prevails upon Rocky to help him straighten the boys out before its too late. Rocky also meets up with a girl from his childhood Laury Ferguson Ann Sheridan.Meanwhile we learn that Rocky has served three years in jail to protect his former partner and lawyer Jim Frazier Humphrey Bogart. He has also entrusted Frazier with 100000 from an earlier caper. Rocky goes to Frazier to demand his money and learns that Frazier is now involved with crime boss Mac Keefer George Bancroft and that they plan to cheat him out of his money.

The Dead End Kids  Billy Halop Bobby Jordan Leo Gorcey Huntz Hall Gabriel Dell Bernard Punsley would move to a B series without Hallop after their Warner contract expired in 1939. The performances of Frankie Burke in particular and William Tracy as the young Rocky and Jerry are excellent.Angels With Dirty Faces is probably best remembered for its ending. don't miss it.".

Previously with such early30s films as Little Caesar and Public Enemy gangster films at their best were engrossing actioners with charismatic but undeniably evil central figures. Angels With Dirty Faces released in 1938 presents a more nuanced view of what makes the modern bad man tick. Is it a bad heart? Or is society to blame?Cagney is undeniably great in the role that made him a legend. His practiced patter never wears thin and his screen presence is electric throughout. Especially at the end and I don't mean that as a pun. But the screenwriters never let us forget the good in the man. We see him come up against more ruthless elements of the underworld people like Bogart a real baddie here who have no compunction about killing a man if it means avoiding payment of a heavy debt. We see him interact with a group of starryeyed juveniles The Dead End Kids whose nickelanddime antics fill him with a poignant but heartilyamusing nostalgia. And we see him try to do right by his former partner in crime now a priest played by Hugh O'Brien.But Cagney is trapped by the circumstances of his life. He can't walk away from a life of crime which has made him what he is and gives him the only life satisfaction he knows. He's correctly on guard for doublecrossers at every turn. When cornered his cheery face becomes bugeyed and menacing. We know he's bad but we like him and that puts us in the company of the audiencesurrougate figure Father Connolly.Director Curtiz was an auteur before his time filling his canvas with images of downtrodden street life. This isn't for mere effect but to show us why Rocky is what he is and how come he finds little hope for his redemption. There are souls to be saved in this picture but for Father Connolly they are Laurie and the boys. He must take on his childhood chum the same kid who saved Connolly from the perils of the Mean Streets and allowed him to become what he was.It is a choice between God and friendship and while Connolly has little doubt which way to go the audience may not be with him all the way. The ending points up this spiritual conflict in some of the most harrowing terms ever brought to screen at that time. When you really think about what's going on behind Connolly's face in that final scene it's a real tearinducer.Was Rocky's last scene a putup job? I guess it can be argued back and forth but the real question of value is whether if it was faked was it enough to perform a miracle even the good Father Connolly wouldn't have quite believed in the salvation of Rocky. The last image of the boys desolately accepting the news of their hero's fall is at once triumphant and bittersweet. Nothing comes easy in this world of ours.Angels With Dirty Faces may strike a falsely optimistic note to some but it is optimism wellearned by the honesty of vision expressed. Add to that clever dialogue great pacing and one of cinema's keystone performances by Cagney and you have a real keeper here.P.S. It also features one of the finest Cagney impersonations ever by William Tracey as the young Rocky. Funny stuff.".

This 1938 release is one of the prime examples.

Cagney has not learned his lesson that crime doesn't pay and so he returns to his old neighborhood to set up his criminal hideout. Meanwhile his old friend O'Brien has given up being a street hood and has since become a respected priest who naturally doesn't think highly of the life that his friend has chosen for himself. To make matters worse six young boys portrayed by the Dead End Kids whom O'Brien is trying to lead down the right paths begin to idolize Cagney. Humphrey Bogart also appears in a pre big box office star part as a lawyer and screen veteran George Bancroft also costars as a dishonest crime boss. Michael Curtiz' direction and Max Steiner's musical score are also highlights. This film is one of the all time great ones of the 1930's and an excellent showcase for its legendary cast and crew.".

The film is well made the plot is solid the image quality is 5 stars without the scratches typical of most movies from that generation and the cast is brilliant. We have for example the fabulous Dead End Kids and the great Humphrey Bogart but it's James Cagney who really shines as Rocky Sullivan. Rocky is a very intense character and even though he is a gangster somehow he is likable. James Cagney shines in an absolutely peerless performance. His face was very memorable too as were his facial expressions and his fiery voice. Unmistakenly one of the alltime great actors with a talent and charisma comparable to Peter Lorre and Vincent Price for example.This movie has many surprises as well. One of them is the fact that the actor who played Rocky as a boy looks exactly like James Cagney. When Rocky grew up I thought it was the same actor playing him from the start because adult Rocky looked exactly the same as himself as a kid. By the way the kids who play Rocky and Jerry as kids have terrific performances either.My absolute favorite part of this gr8 gangstermovie is the sequence in which Rocky is stuck in a building surrounded by the police and attempting to resist the toxic gases which are asphyxiating him and how despite his pride and efforts to resist he realizes he won't get away so easy this time. The funniest scene whoever is when Ann Sheridan finally gets even with Rocky after 15 years by yanking his hat down over his ears and slapping him and then he sits down on that old bed and it collapses! So hilarious!The ending is unexpected because the penalty for Rocky is to get cooked in the Old Sparky. Whether his cries are genuine or only to fulfill Father Jerry's final wish is unspecific although I'd believe that they are genuine. I do feel bad for Rocky though. That penalty was too terrible for him and over the top for his crimes. What made me discover this movie was 'Home Alone' because of the movie that Kevin watches 'Angels with filthy souls'. Until very little time ago I thought that the movie he was watching was real but I found out that it was fictional and that those scenes were only made for 'Home Alone'. What a pity I always wanted to see that movie. But I also found out that it was a parody to a real movie called 'Angels with dirty faces'. That was what took me to this great movie. But much to my disappointment there aren't such lines as Keep the change ya filthy animal!. I was expecting some line like that in the whole movie and I was very disappointed that there isn't any. Having that said I don't like the movie any less for that.Title in Portugal 'Anjos de cara negra'.".

Whether his cries are genuine or only to fulfill Father Jerry's final wish is unspecific although I'd believe that they are genuine. I do feel bad for Rocky though. That penalty was too terrible for him and over the top for his crimes. What made me discover this movie was 'Home Alone' because of the movie that Kevin watches 'Angels with filthy souls'. Until very little time ago I thought that the movie he was watching was real but I found out that it was fictional and that those scenes were only made for 'Home Alone'. What a pity I always wanted to see that movie. But I also found out that it was a parody to a real movie called 'Angels with dirty faces'. That was what took me to this great movie. But much to my disappointment there aren't such lines as Keep the change ya filthy animal!. I was expecting some line like that in the whole movie and I was very disappointed that there isn't any. Having that said I don't like the movie any less for that.Title in Portugal 'Anjos de cara negra'.";

	schema:reviewBody "Angels with dirty face is a 1930's Warner Bros gangster film that stars James Cagney as Rocky Sullivan and Pat O'Brien as Jerry Connelly. As the film's opens young teenager Rocky and Jerry are trouble makersit wasn't until young Rocky is catch by the police that we see the two characters change. Rocky is sent to reform school. In a montage of images Rocky graduates to prison as he pursues a life of crime including bootlegging manslaughter gambling and violent gang rivalry. Mobster Rocky is sent to prison to serve another three years for a crime he has committed with crooked attorney James Frazier Humphrey Bogart. He is promised by Frazier that when he is discharged after taking the rap he will be paid 100000 from the crooked heist the two had pulled. As adults Rocky embraces a life of crime whereas Jerry who had witnessed Rocky's fate becomes a priest assigned to his old home parish. When discharged Rocky returns to his former neighborhood and visits the church where Father Jerry serves as parish priest and where they had been altar boys together twenty years earlier. Jerry faces the challenges of teaching and working with tough gutterbred neighborhood boys call the Dead End kids trying to make them decent citizens. Dead End Kids are based and a continue sage of the 1935 play and the film Dead End 1937. It's become hard for Jerry because of his criminal exploits the boys idolize him and regard him with almost fanatical hero worship when he shares his criminal exploits and experiences. The priest is unsuccessful in retrieving the neighborhood kids from emulating their gangster hero. Jerry wants Rocky to behave in a way so that the neighborhood kids will not admire him and revere him as a role model or martyr following in his misguided footsteps. Jerry asks that Rocky make a really heroic action and show a special kind of courage. George Bancroft Mac Keefer also comes in the story playing an influential politician and rackets boss that Rocky works under his new job. In the course of the movie we are left to ask if Rocky is willing to reform or continue with his criminal past life this come in light with his relationship with the kids. Jerry and an old flame play by Ann Sheridan. In one of the most tautly directed unforgettable harrowing sequences of any film in the 1930s Rocky is force to make a choice. The scene is bathed in dark suggestive oppressive shadows and the musical score by Max Steiner resembles a plodding relentless march to what his life really means. It is unclear whether or not his true nature or motives are revealed  is he pretending or not. It's up to you as the viewer to decision. Cagney is great as the swaggering pugnacious career criminal Rocky. Cagney is brilliant. The facial expression of James Cagney. His face is intense and penetrating! Pat O'Brien plays best as a mildmannered forceful sincere and compassionate priest. This is perfect in every way very finely executed. What a classic film this is!".

The odd second layer here sometimes threatens to tilt to moralizing even with the roughness of the church kids as the priest weighs in on certain scenes. But the two elementsgood and evil basicallynot only contrast but they overlap and the confusion of who is doing the most good and why is part of the bigger ethical fiber of the plot.Maybe it's because of these moments where Cagney's gangster role is softened by interacting with the priest that we see less direct raw acting the scary thing that he can pull of so well. But he's still utterly convincing and the ending is chilling no matter how you read it. If you like me like a film to go beyond a simple do crime and get caught kind of scenario this is a great one. The great Sol Polito is cinematographer and it shows in every single scene whether the fascinating street shots packed with activity or the shadowing alley and basement shots composed for drama and depth.

	schema:reviewBody "A memorable amazing gangster film with a social message featuring a blistering performance by the one and only James Cagney. JC plays notorious gangster Rocky Sullivan who comes back to his old neighborhood and a reunion with his old pal Jerry Connelly. Time has a strange way of changing things you see Sullivan and Connelly were boyhood pals from the wrong side of the tracks. Sullivan spent time in a reformatory only to emerge the hardened criminal that he is. Connelly spared time in the reformatory because he could run faster then Rocky and got away is now a priest trying to keep the youth from his neighborhood out of trouble. Father Connelly is working hard on a group of youngsters the Dead End Kids who are already headed in the wrong direction. Things become complicated when Rocky arrives as the youngsters idolize the gangster and begin to really show signs of an impending criminal life. Rocky's own problems mount including being ripped off by his lawyer James Frazier played by Humphrey Bogart. Rocky tries to remedy his situation but his cohorts are planning to rub out Father Connelly who's one man crusade to wipe out the criminal element is going too far. Rocky will have no part of it and resorts to murder to prevent his friend from being killed. Unfortunately Rocky is caught and is sentenced to die in the electric chair setting up one of the most memorable conclusions in film history.This is a completely absorbing emotional film with standout performances from everyone. Besides Cagney Pat O'Brien as Father Connelly gives what is perhaps his finest performance. The support from Bogart the Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan are all top notch. Many unforgettable scenes abound namely Cagney's unorthodox refereeing at a basketball game and the aforementioned conclusion which still haunts me to this day. Director Michael Curtiz does an amazing job. His camera is almost in constant movement with fluid passes and turns and his brilliant use of light darkness and shadow is amazing to watch. I just can't say enough about this film one of the finest gangster epics to ever grace the big screen. It's very easy to see why Cagney was nominated for an Academy Award in this one.".

However it was the performance of Mr. James Cagney  of whom I'd often heard but never seen on screen  that truly inspired my admiration delivering surely one of the most memorable displays of acting I'd ever seen. I know that it's an old clich in film criticism but this wasn't simply an actor playing a role Cagney completed inhabited the character of Rocky Sullivan slipping so painlessly into the role that you'd think Sullivan was a real criminal merely playing himself. Cagney's defiantlyupright posture drylyamused facial expressions his quirky mannerisms including his character's trademark greeting of Whaddya hear? Whaddya say? project a lifetime of power corruption and frustration Sullivan's wily toughness has been chiseled by years of crime and incarceration of his constant exposure to men just as dangerous as himself. He is truly a formidable figure and Cagney flawlessly captures the many layers of his fascinating character in a role for which he earned the first of his three Oscar nominations.'Angels with Dirty Faces' was directed by Michael Curtiz most famous nowadays for 'Casablanca 1942' but his list of great films is extensive as I'm now beginning to discover. The film is a thicklylayered crime film slick and actionpacked with a hint of social commentary. It deals with a popular theme of 1930s crime films of two childhood friends who in later life ended up on opposite sides of the law. Rocky Sullivan Frankie Burke as a youth James Cagney as an adult and Jerry Connolly William Tracy as a youth Pat O'Brien as an adult were the best of friends passing their adolescent years through dabbling in minor theft. After they are discovered raiding a railway car Jerry manages to flee the policemen's grasp but Rocky is apprehended this seemingly trivial event Rocky being unable to run quite as fast as Jerry is the crucial moment when the two boys' paths violently diverged and their lives would never be the same again. After spending years in a rehabilitation centre for juvenile delinquents Rocky becomes immersed in a life of crime while his old friend heads towards the Church from which he tries to prevent the next generation from going astray.As I mentioned earlier Cagney leads a dynamite cast of intriguing characters. Humphrey Bogart excels as James Frazier a weaselly lawyer who decides to have Rocky whacked rather than pay him the 100000 in misbegotten money that he owes him George Bancroft plays his associate in crime. The Dead End Kids from William Wylers 'Dead End 1937' headed by Soapy Billy Halop are a gang of youths who idolise Rocky's life of crime so reverentially that they are almost certain to follow in his pitiful footsteps. Pretty Laury Ferguson Ann Sheridan a girl from Rocky's childhood isn't given particularly much to do in the film but is rather the perfect embodiment of innocence a stark contrast with our main character's dirty criminal past. Pat O'Brien who starred in countless films alongside Cagney throughout the decade is adequate as the goodwilled anticrime crusader but his priest character just isn't really all that interesting somewhat bland alongside a hotheated dynamo like Rocky Sullivan. Praise must also go to young Frankie Burke who plays Rocky as a child and who imitated Cagney's tone and mannerisms so perfectly that I wondered for a second if that was Cagney himself somehow playing a teenager.".

	schema:headline " Cagney vs. The Dead End Kids!";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest films of Cagney's film career and the film that unfortunately or fortunately depending on your gag reflexes introduced us to the Dead End Kids! James Cagney is a career criminal who immediately after getting out of the clink meets up with his former partner in crime Pat O'Brien! who of course is a priest now and loathes the life Cagney leads. Cagney is also preoccupied with a bunch of nogood kids who of course idolize him. Seeing this O'Brien thinks Cagney should lead the kids to good. But Cagney is too busy getting even with his old business cronies Humphrey Bogart!.This film is a lot fun most especially watching Bogey and Cagney on the screen together. For those rather uninitiated with the career of Bogart eg just seen Casablanca and the Sam Spade movies this film may come as a revelation to you as he plays a cretinous heel here. And Cagney?

	onyx:emotionText "One of the greatest films of Cagney's film career and the film that unfortunately or fortunately depending on your gag reflexes introduced us to the Dead End Kids! James Cagney is a career criminal who immediately after getting out of the clink meets up with his former partner in crime Pat O'Brien! who of course is a priest now and loathes the life Cagney leads. Cagney is also preoccupied with a bunch of nogood kids who of course idolize him. Seeing this O'Brien thinks Cagney should lead the kids to good. But Cagney is too busy getting even with his old business cronies Humphrey Bogart!.This film is a lot fun most especially watching Bogey and Cagney on the screen together. For those rather uninitiated with the career of Bogart eg just seen Casablanca and the Sam Spade movies this film may come as a revelation to you as he plays a cretinous heel here. And Cagney? Ahhh what's not to like? He's flawless here well except his curious gun usage. As for the Dead End Kids I liked them here rather interesting that Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall almost are in the background here with their leadership of the group not yet realized.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you ever take a film class about gangster films you'll soon learn that it's a genre  Catholic  in outlook in much the same way as the western is  Protestant  . Once you analysis the gangster genre you'll find that there's almost a formulaic lay out of themes of a fatherless outsider trying to become part of the American dream via illegal means . ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES is slightly different in that the characters are Amercan born and it's the street gang of juvenile delinquents who are in need of the father figure and the film rests on whether Father Jerry Connolly or Rocky Sullivan becomes that father figure I'm feeling slightly ashamed of myself for saying this but I liked this movie a lot  and the reasons I liked it is down to the reasons that I shouldn't . There's hardly a single scene that rings of any type of realism . Cagney was a Hollywood star but he was never an actor . There is something compelling about his performances however and he dominates every scene he is in . I can certainly understand why some people don't like his acting style but it's a style that suits the film perfectly that lacks any type of verisimilitude . None of it rings true but there's something that keeps you watching even though there's a voice inside your head saying  What a load of melodramatic Hollywood tosh Your opinion of the film lies with what you thought about the golden age of Hollywood . This was a period of American film making where producers were under heavy censure via The Hays Code where any type of immorality must be seen to be punished on screen and this suits a film like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES wonderfully . Rocky is a bad man but a hero to the teenage street gang  he must not be allowed to be a hero to criminal youth and so must face death as a coward . On paper this appears to be the cheesiest ending ever seen in a movie but as it plays out on screen it's one the most beautiful and memorable endings Hollywood has ever produced . Michael Curtiz directs this scene via suggestion and is all the better for it If you're a fan of Old Hollywood then you'll enjoy this . Even a self confessed cynic like myself found this movie compelling . You have to be slightly forgiving for some of the more melodramatic aspects but in some ways that's part of the movie's appeal".

	schema:reviewBody "The gangster movie is one of my favorite genres from Hollywood's Golden Age and no one could do them like Warner Bros. They made many classics but none quite as good as Angels with Dirty Faces in my opinion. Directed by Michael Curtiz it stars James Cagney and Pat O'Brien as childhood friends whose lives take different paths  O'Brien becomes a priest and Cagney becomes a criminal. When Cagney returns to the old neighborhood and proves to be a bad influence on the street kids who idolize him O'Brien fights to save the kids and if possible his friend.A wonderful movie in every way with humor and action and lots of heart. Cagney does a fantastic job deserving of his Oscar nomination. His final scene is among the best of his career. O'Brien has a less flashy part but he's really the anchor to the film and delivers a great turn himself. His real life friendship with Cagney no doubt helped in selling the affection these two men have for one another. Ann Sheridan is good in a somewhat unnecessary part. She makes the most of her screen time and has nice chemistry with Cagney but her character adds little to the story. Humphrey Bogart at this point still playing villains is very good as a weasel you can't wait to see rubbed out. The Dead End Kids play the gang of yutes that's at the heart of it all. As always they're an acquired taste but I tend to enjoy them a lot. They're especially good here with Cagney who's like a big Dead End Kid himself. The basketball scene is a hoot. Special mention to Frankie Burke who plays Cagney's character as a teen in the beginning of the movie. Ideal casting both in looks and performance Burke is terrific.It's one of my alltime favorite films. I love WB gangster movies and they don't get any better than this one. Often imitated and mocked over the years it might not hold the same punch for modern audiences that it once did. I was lucky to see it when I was young before I was too cynical to enjoy it. I credit it with being one of the films that turned me into a classic Hollywood fan for life.".

	schema:headline " A Revelation";
	schema:reviewBody "Interesting movie. Very interesting though the title is inexcuseably misleading. Nicholas Ray directs and not surprisingly makes novel use of shadows bold colors and wild camera angles. There is a bravura montage of an explosion of mob violence which is sudden and startling. Ray best known as the director of Rebel Without a Cause takes a smart tough script and unlike many crime movies which contain similar ingredients but fail to resonate gives the movie a soul. There's something about its tone and feel some simmering menace and creeping regret that reminds one of another mob movie which would be released 15 years later The Godfather.

	onyx:emotionText "Interesting movie. Very interesting though the title is inexcuseably misleading. Nicholas Ray directs and not surprisingly makes novel use of shadows bold colors and wild camera angles. There is a bravura montage of an explosion of mob violence which is sudden and startling. Ray best known as the director of Rebel Without a Cause takes a smart tough script and unlike many crime movies which contain similar ingredients but fail to resonate gives the movie a soul. There's something about its tone and feel some simmering menace and creeping regret that reminds one of another mob movie which would be released 15 years later The Godfather.

	schema:reviewBody "''Party Girl'' Ray's final film for a major Hollywood studioafter this he worked with independent producers is a highly baroque work. Screechingly mannerist in places occasional headfirst dives into camp but also remarkable instances of poetry and subtlety and a highly charged social portrait. It is a very discordant work which is to say that it deliberately skewers audiences expectations of a genre film by working as a genre film but stylized in a manner that the clichs and conventions look highly abstract not unlike a film by Douglas Sirk.''Party Girl'' is shot in CinemaScope and Metrocolor is produced by Joe Pasternak who was in charge of the secondtier MGM unit. The Leonine studio had by the mid50's devolved into an organization of pennypinchers and according to Ray the only reason this film got made was because it's backers wanted to get rid of it's two stars...Cyd Charisse and Robert Taylor so as to exhaust their run of contracted films as quickly as possible. This explains the fact that more than ''Johnny Guitar''with it's superlative cast of actors ''Party Girl'' is the closest Ray came to make a BFilm. The storyline is a standardissue crime drama and it is by a safe distance the most generic of Ray's major films.That it's still a major film is for me little doubt. Though lacking the strength of his early crime films and his 50's melodramas ''Party Girl'' is still a deeply compelling film about the universality of compromises in society. The title ''Party Girl'' is essentially a slang for prostitute or for being under someone else's thumb. It refers to Cyd Charisse's character Vicki Gaye a showgirl who works parttime as escort to various underworld types alongside other gals who work at the ''Rooster Folliers''no joke. But it also includes mob lawyer Tommy FarrelRobert Taylor and applies to everyone else.Ray's distaste for plot apparent in all his films is full in abundance here as the generic outline of this story of crooked lawyer turned straight through the power of love takes on several asides. Like the onescene appearance of a fellow showgirl who's waiting for her man and whose depression Vicki stifles as a result of habit and accord over the years. The scene where she walks into her roommate's bathroom and finds her swimming literally in a pool of her own blood in a bathtub is one of Ray's most embedded images even ifin accord with then censorship the image lasts only a few microseconds before a quick fadeaway. Much of the secondary section of the film centers on Tommy's relationship with Rico AngeloLee J. Cobb in a towering performance and there's very little plot driving their very powerful scenes. Tension arises from flaming egos by a mob underling played by John Ireland over Tommy's relationship with Vicki.The film's sense of decor and colour is what we'd call now Fassbinderesque. It's pictorially fascinating and the colours are very eyecatching but the underlying design behind it is a sense of decadence of vulgarity. This reflects perhaps that the underlying subtext of this film is less about gangsters than about Hollywood. With Lee J. Cobb's mix of charismalike Vito Corleone in ''The Godfather'' and crass vulgaritylike Joe Pesci in his films with Scorsese standin for many studio heads of that period and the two musical interludesnumbers is the wrong word for it by Cyd Charisse while visually striking is poorly choreographed and seems like a parody of the dying MGM Musicals.''Party Girl'' is a reflection ultimately of what are the results when a great artist and a few good actors are working with conventional plots can achieve. It's a work that's of it's own kind. Not a gangster film entirely mostly a Film Noir though in colours visually creative but mostly functional. The decor of the film makes it's genre trappings apparent and obvious revealing and critiquing it's functions yet the scenes between Taylor and Charisse are very much played straight conveying genuine compassion between two characters who have long lost their innocence and are merely doing their best to survive and find a semblance of happiness a happiness that's threatened not only by the mob but also by the cops who want to use them to catch the bad guyswhich has much benefits for their own political careers.What may put off most fans of Nicholas Ray is the graphic violence of the film which is quite unexpected and strong for a film of the 50's. Plenty of bloodletting is on display on this film...of course Ray would say that's not blood...that's red.".

The actor is perfect in the role.Cyd Charisse playing a dramatic role is a surprise. In fact she was always seen in musical roles because of her talent as a dancer.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie makes more sense if you watch the documentary MGM When the Lion Roars about the history of MGM. According to the documentary 19361946 was MGM's Golden Era. However after the war tastes in film changed but MGM refused to change with the times or the tastes of postwar America. By the 1950's MGM was a Lion in Winter. Thus this rather split personality film begins to make sense from the context of its manufacturer. It can't decide what kind of film it wants to be going back and forth between the big musical spectacles that MGM was famous for since the dawn of sound to hardhitting gangster characters and antics in the Warner Brothers tradition to social commentary on the plight of the disabled in modern times and a beauty and the beast romance. If you know the chaos into which MGM is plunged by 1958 this enables you just to sit back and enjoy the film which does have a great deal to offer.The movie is badly mislabeled since it really is not that centered on party girls at all. Instead it is basically a prohibition era romance between a beautiful showgirl played by Cyd Charisse and a lame mob lawyer played by Robert Taylor. Already dumped by one glamor girl who just wanted his money but was repulsed by his misshaped body Taylor's character is understandably reluctant to get involved again. However soon the pair are in love and Taylor's character gains the confidence to want to stop being the mob's mouthpiece. However leaving the mob is not such a quick and clean business whether you are an attorney or just a muscle man.Taylor gives a very good performance in this one and Lee J. Cobb's performance as a mobster looks like it was the inspiration for Robert De Niro's portrayal of Al Capone in 1987's The Untouchables in at least one scene anyways. This one is definitely worth your time if it comes your way.".

It's also a very misleading title in that it doesn't scream out this is a crime picture.

Supporting the three principal actors are John Ireland  Kent Smith. Robert J.

If we really are going to cement this in the film noir genre? Then it's more down to the director than anything in the story. Yes there's themes such as alienation vulnerability and the core essence potential for tragiloveborn out of two characters stuck in differing forms of prostitution. But the script is so weak it needed Ray to put an almost surreal sheen over it. There's exotic dancing featuring prominently some what a given with the weak Charisse starring in fairness to her it's one hell of a clich riddled role but again Ray crafts in such a way it doesn't let the film feel too sprightly. Something that this lush production is in danger of being at times. Yet line those dance numbers alongside scenes such as a portrait of Jean Harlow being shot to pieces or of Charisse being questioned by a policeman's Silhouette and you get an oddity. But a very enjoyable one.This was Taylor's last contract film for MGM and fittingly it's one of his very best performances. Again one tends to think this is probably down to Ray's coaxing but regardless Taylor plays Farrell with vulnerable elegance and a steely eyed determination that carries Charisse along with him. Thus the romance is believable and yes engaging. Cobb does another in his long line of larger than life characters. Chewing the scenery as much as his Rico character chews on his cigars. While Ireland is a by the numbers thug for hire and Kent Smith a talking prop. There's a fleeting performance from Corey Allen as baby faced psychopath Cookie La Motte a character that the film could have definitely done with more of. Here's the main problem with Party Girl it's just not edgy or dangerous enough. Which in a film involving gangsters murders and crooked court cases is an issue is it not?

	schema:reviewBody "This is a late 50's gangsters movie in the line of the classical film noires of the 40's. The remarkable aspect here is that Party Girl is perhaps one of the most colorful movies ever made in the genre and perhaps out of it too. Right from the start and as a background for the titles there's an all color dancing sequence and from them on color is all around including bright red dresses Cyd Charisse wears throughout the entire film.But beautiful color aside Nicholas Ray King of Kings 55 Days in Peking delivers an interesting and entertaining gangsters movie about a crippled Mafia lawyer Robert Taylor a sort of predecessor of The Godfather's Tom Hagen gets involved with a cabaret dancer Cyd Charisse and they try to start a new life together far from the man's dangerous clients but the big man Lee J. Cobb is not willing to set Taylor free because he is a genius in his work that can keep him away from the electric chair and also because the lawyer knows too much.There's a fine performance by Taylor as the bittered attorney and also by beautiful and classy Charisse who also has the chance of exhibiting her undeniable dancing skills and her famous legs too. Cobb is perfect in a role with no secrets for him pretty much like the one he played before in the classic On the Waterfront and a year later in The Trap. John Ireland and Kent Smith complete the main cast.Though not perhaps a great film not much action sequences for the genre Party Girl stands as a good one in its line worth watching no doubt.".

	schema:reviewBody "Party Girl is a superior Nicholas Ray movie. I know I know sounds a bit extreme but I maintain.Boy meet Girl they fall in Love and the world turns nasty. It's them against the World actually. Will Love win in the end?The plot is surely thin but who cares? It does not need to be elaborate or even simply complicated as it is about Love et c'est si simple l'Amour.Cyd and Robert play two lonely souls who simply forgot they once had a heart. The set is Chicago in the early Thirties and all the action occurs indoor or by night as in Alias Nick Beal except for a very brief moment of pure happiness in Europe where else?. It is love at first sight they just do not know it. But this is not that easy of course. Robert is a virtuoso solicitor who works for the local mafia Cyd is a more or less washed up dancer who survives by partying with the mafiosi. The first encounters are not particularly successful as he seems made of Kevlar and covered with Teflon and she is ashamed of what she became. Soon however Robert sees himself through her eyes like in a mirror and shame strikes him as well. Love of course washes everything. But the Mafia and the Law like modern Greek gods look at the poor lovers and decide to use them as pawns in their chess game.I would not dare to say that Douglas Sirk could have filmed Party Girl but this is neither a real thriller nor a pure Film Noir it is a melodrama. This is why the plot you know... What is interesting is the fact that if the gangsters are evil the cops or more precisely the district attorney office are not angels at all. The Law as the outlaw plays its little dirty game using dirty tricks. As we all know the end justifies the means. But in this case what is the actual target of the district attorney to clean the street of Chicago of vice and crime or to get a senator's chair? Caught between the hammer and the anvil Robert and Cyd are trapped the name of the movie in French. In the end there is only one way to find redemption and it is uncompromising love. Nicholas Ray manages to be flamboyant in a minor mode like chamber music. What is absolutely mesmerizing is his use of color. JeanLuc Godard an absolute fan of Ray Ray is Cinema said something about the colours in movies looking more real than the colours in real life. This is definitely the case in Party Girl. The very claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie is reinforced by the dark shades which are dominating the scenes. And then a flash of bright red or yellow or green or blue literally pierces and tears up the screen. The incredible beauty of the colour range used by Nicholas Ray and the contrast he creates with it makes you shiver. A good example is the two dance numbers when you have Cyd Charisse in your movie it is a sin not to have a dance number. Of course the choreography is not of the level of Band Wagon or Silk Stockings but we need to remember that Cyd is a dancer in a club owned by gangster not at the Ballet de l'Opera de Paris. And even if the choreography would be from your average truck driver it is still Cyd Charisse dancing...The three main actors are doing a very fine job. Cyd Charisse is neither Eleanor Parker or Joanne Woodward but she is playing her part with real talent. A pity her character is reduced to passivity in the second part of the movie she is still incredibly beautiful. Robert Taylor is excellent in a more developed character. At the beginning he is the cynical and sad solicitor who wears a mask to hide the emptiness of his soul. Then gradually timidly he goes back to life the scene where he pleads with passion for the life of Cyd Charisse at the end can be put on perspective with his professional and cold pleadings at the beginning of the movie. Lee J. Cobb is also brilliant playing Rico one of the numerous variations on the Capone's theme Hollywood gave us over the years. His acting is a perfect mix of ComedianteTragediante. His Rico plays at being on surface the vulgar over the top gangster who laughs a lot and looks a bit dumb. But then when things go wrong Rico takes off his mask and the coldblooded killer shows his real face. The manipulative and cruel Rico is deeply chilling.A very short scene needs to be mentioned it is actually a single shot a young dancer committed suicide in her bathroom. In classic Hollywood the girl would be shown lying in the water her head resting on one side of the bathtub in a very sanitized fashion. Nicholas Ray shows us very briefly thanks Hays Code a bathtub full of dark red blood. The girl is kneeling with just her wrists in the water her face is hidden by her hair. It is sinister it looks more like an execution than a peaceful departure. The reality of death.Nicholas Ray est le Cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't surprised to read that director Nicholas Ray was allowed little creative control of Party Girl. His sensibilities peek through here and there but it's more of an MGM film than Nicholas Ray's. The movie is set in the 1930s but it looks like the 1950s. It's been called a film noir but it looks like a musicala musical with no music though leading lady Cyd Charisse the titular party girl Vicki gets a couple dance numbers. A large portion of the movie bogs down on Charisse's relationship with a reluctant mob lawyer Robert Taylor at which point Party Girl turns into a romantic melodrama. Then in the final act it once again becomes a crime film.Party Girl is fairly gripping when it focuses on its seedier elements  some of the violence is startlingly bloody for its day  but it's hampered by the tonal shifts. The script as other reviewers have pointed out has more than a few ludicrous moments like a miracle surgery and some unrealistic beliefs about how the justice system operates. The acting is fairly solid especially by Taylor and Lee J. Cobb as mob boss Rico Angelo. John Ireland and Corey Allen also make strong impressions in their roles as sleazy hottempered hoods. For me the weakest performance is from Charisse. She's beautiful and she's got the legs but I found her performance a little stilted according to a review by critic Glenn Erickson Charisse resisted being directed by Ray. I kept thinking if you dropped the dancing Ida Lupino or Ray's ex Gloria Grahame would've been more interesting choices for the role of Vicki though understandably there are reasons why Grahame would never be hired. All and all Party Girl is notable for some effective scenes and performances but it's one of Nicholas Ray's lesser films.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting that Robert Taylor's last film under his long MGM contract ended so well with this tough little movie. While Party Girl is filmed in color and lacks the gritty dark look and unusual film angles of film noir it is a nice nearnoir film. Taylor plays an attorney with no soul. He has spent his career working for the mob and doesn't mind working for scumas it pays very well! However when Taylor meets a dancing girl who turns out to be quite decent Cyd Charisse his amoral attitude is shaken and he wants to leave his lucrative practice and do something decent with his life. What makes this film is the excellent supporting cast working with Taylor who by the way is quite good here. Lee J. Cobb is wonderful as the Al Caponelike mob boss and his henchmen John Ireland David Opatashu and Corey Allen are all exceptional actors. Together combined with a wonderful script and exceptional direction it makes for a very good film indeed. Tough cynical and a quality production throughout this is a great swansong to his MGM career. The only deficits are the dancing numbers by Charisse and a mistake in the final scene where acid pours on Cobb's face but he's not the least bit burned. The dancing just wasn't necessary and tended to disrupt the dark tone of the film. By the way if you like this film try also watching John Garfield in Force of Evil. Its plot is very similar and is also an exceptional film.".

Charisse is even more luminous than usual thanks in part to the mesmerizing lighting and camera work utilized by Ray in two major dance numbers obviously included to showcase MGM's most talented dancer. However Ray was also able to elicit a rather touching albeit somewhat unrealistic performance from Charisse in playing a lonely showgirl drawn to Taylor's disfigured lawyer trapped in the world of defending known criminals.Such a story had been done before many different ways yet under Ray's direction the film achieves a certain sense of nobility and appreciation. It is not flashy but not boring either. It is as much of Ray's work was at the time workmanlike and beautifully crafted.

	schema:reviewBody "Untypically for a gangster movie the main focus of attention in Party Girl is on the unlikely love affair that develops between two very different people who work for a notorious gangster in 1930s Chicago. Both lovers are cynical and bruised by their pasts but together find the courage and determination they need to try to extricate themselves from the firm grip that the gangster holds on them.Tommy Farrell Robert Taylor is the brilliant lawyer who works for gangster boss Rico Angelo Lee J Cobb and regularly displays his talents in court by getting Rico's thugs free of the charges brought against them. Vicki Gaye Cyd Charisse is a showgirl who works at Rico's nightclub and makes some extra money by being paid 100 for each of Rico's parties that she attends. At the end of one of these parties Tommy takes her home where she discovers that her pregnant roommate has committed suicide because her married boyfriend has deserted her. Tommy helps Vicki through the difficult time she has being interviewed by the police following her friend's autopsy and they then start to see each other regularly.The experiences of being crippled in a childhood accident and then suffering the breakdown of his marriage to a woman who became repulsed by his disability made Tommy very bitter and his growing contempt for his employer had only made his disposition worse. A bad experience when she was a 15yearold had left Vicki with a jaundiced view of men and led to her keeping them at arm's length ever since. The happiness they find together brings some unexpected warmth into their lives and Vicki's loyal to Tommy during the extended period that he takes off to have surgery on his crippled leg. After Tommy makes a successful recovery the couple reunite.When he returns to work in Chicago Rico wants Tommy to represent an associate of his called Cookie La Motte Corey Allen but Tommy initially refuses because his potential client is known to be an extremely violent psychopath. Rico then leaves Tommy with no choice in the matter when he threatens to disfigure Vicki with acid unless Tommy does what he wants. A little later La Motte jumps bail and Tommy and Vicki get arrested when the state prosecutor takes action against everyone associated with Rico. Pressure is then put on Tommy to disclose everything he knows about Rico's organisation and the decisions he subsequently takes put his and Vicki's lives in danger before the action that follows eventually leads to the movie's violent conclusion.Robert Taylor and Cyd Charisse are both very convincing in their roles and skilfully make the changes that their characters go through seem perfectly natural. Lee J Cobb is also very powerful in his largerthanlife portrayal of Rico Angelo.In Party Girl it's not only the focus of the story that's unusual for a gangster movie as it also features a couple of impressive dance numbers and certain passages in which the whole style of presentation is far more typical of the legendary musicals for which MGM is so well known. Fortunately these seemingly incongruous elements don't ultimately detract from what is essentially  a very compelling crime drama.".

	schema:headline " for the specialist or the veteran? a good but flawed noir with a unique pairing of its top stars";
	schema:reviewBody "Party Girl is one of those films that can satisfy either the veteran filmgoer who may remember it or its era or the specialist who watches a film with a critical eye towards its particular qualities. Fans of director Nicholas Ray or of stars Robert Taylor or Cyd Charisse in one of her few dramatic roles she acquits herself well will enjoy the fine wellcrafted performances and the superb finish to the pacing of scenes and the cinematography. The film also has a certain heft due to the presence of Lee J Cobb as Rico the gangster 'heavy' although Taylor's skill in portraying the heavy's 'consigliaro' Tommy Farrell should be noted as well avoiding as it does both clich and bathos. It is a fine performance indeed in a film marked by good if not outstanding performances all around. There is as well a compelling understatement to Ray's directing that highlights both the strengths and unfortunately the weaknesses of a fairly lessthanoriginal script  the most glaring weakness being the way shyster lawyer Taylor readily submits to arrest and threat of imprisonment for having been associated with one of Cobb's henchmen as though lawyerclient privilege were unknown to the state's attorney a bit preposterous considering that Cobb's character Rico is wanted for the murder of the henchman anyway. The script thus plays to a perceived need to provide conflict outside that which already exists between Rico and Farrell missing the opportunity to give some dimension to Rico's onesided gangster. Some may find the surgery Taylor's character undergoes to restore a shattered hip a bit hard to believe but in fact the description given the surgery and the length of time required for the hip to heal are in line with hip restoration surgery of the film's era set in the 1930's. And Taylor's character does not return from his stay in Europe miraculously healed he still leans on his cane but is less dependent on it. In fact Taylor does a very good job of being more married to the cane than to his onscreen wife who makes only one thankless appearance and of losing the cane gradually and regaining the strength to walk without it as he gains momentum against Rico and towards Cyd Charisse's character dancer vs. near cripple dancer drops dancing career and goes with near cripple who gradually regains the strength to walk  a nice metaphor for the growth of a relationship filmed without melodrama. The socalled 'happy' ending is certainly less than storybook but probably will not satisfy a generation raised reduced? on Kill Bill Vols. 1 and 2 and three rather sickening 'Godfather' films. In fact it is rather gratifying to see middleaged Taylor and near middleaged Charisse successfully build their relationship out of mutual trust. Both still have their looks but both are mature enough not to be selfconscious about them  a refreshing change from a youthobsessed post 911 culture.".

Angelo however is not a man to take no for an answer and Farrell quickly realises that by leaving the racket he could be placing both Vicki and himself in danger.That sounds like the plot of a standard film noir. Party Girl however does not really fit into that category. For a start it was filmed in colour which makes it unusual among fifties crime dramas and rules it out from being considered as film noir. The use of lowkey blackandwhite photography is generally regarded as an essential noir characteristic and director Nicholas Ray had earlier made a number of successful films of this type most notably In a Lonely Place but in the later part of his career he became known for his skillful use of colour in films like Johnny Guitar. Vicki's profession is used as an excuse to introduce extended dance sequences of a type not normally associated with serious crime drama and more reminiscent of scenes from musicals such as Singin' in the Rain or Silk Stockings both of which also starred Cyd Charisse. Even the title Party Girl seems more suited to a comedy than to a serious drama.As a crime drama the film is nothing out of the ordinary certainly not in the same class as In a Lonely Place or Ray's great melodrama Rebel without a Cause. Lee J. Cobb as Angelo makes an effective villain as he normally did but Robert Taylor is rather staid as Farrell. As for Charisse although she was one of the most beautiful actresses in the Hollywood of the 1950s few people would have regarded her as one of the most talented and she doesn't do a lot here to contradict that opinion. Except of course in dance sequences where she gets the chance to show yet again that although her acting skills may have been limited there were few leading ladies of the period who could dance so well or who could look so sexy while doing so.It is in fact these scenes which make Party Girl still watchable today they were not only those superbly choreographed but also superbly photographed allowing Ray to make good use of his gift for colour.

Now that you can tape something and scan through it is easier to evaluate before you waste your time. Going through I noticed Robert Taylor coming across better than I've ever seen him. He was the main deterrent before. I've never thought him good enough looking to put up with especially when the main lead. But seeing Lee J. Cobb in it and really liking the deep color I became interested. Also have always liked Cyd Charisse's dramatic persona  generally smooth no overstatement. Her musical numbers were rather enlarged for the type of film but guess they couldn't resist. And MGM could really come up with some odd titles.Taylor proved to be convincing and capable throughout. Enjoyed him and Charisse together and definitely the visual. Cobb seems to have been used a lot for the more gregarious type like the crime boss here. I initially saw him in roles as the no nonsense good guy and I think I prefer him as that. He played that very effectively in The Virginian television series. He was the strong guiding hand somewhat a father figure who could bring up the volume when needed and take care of any foolishness with dispatch. His screen time as such was my favorite part of that interesting series.Hey it's a Hollywood movie which is going to have some form of the Hollywood treatment both good and bad. If you can anticipate and accept any given film's set of excesses and idiosyncrasies it's easier to enjoy what is enjoyable to you. This one is liberally laced with improbables for one thing. Again expect that and other unrealities from old Hollywood. It's the nature of the genre. I certainly prefer it to where they've gone now. For this one I could ignore the improbables and move along with things. The relationship of Taylor and Charisse and the quality of the visual captured this movie out from the ranks of ones I would usually pass over.".

	schema:headline " Classy intelligent film about crime and friendship";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was made at a time when the classic studio system was in collapse and journeyman genius Nicholas Ray  who had previously made masterpieces like In a Lonely Place for Bogart's Santana Productions Johnny Guitar for Republic Pictures and a whole slew of top notch film noirs for RKO  found himself highly employable but somewhat unable to get his own productions off the ground. As such I think it's fair to describe the film less as a labor of love than a labor of discovering love and you can almost see the process of Ray finding the secret of various scenes with his actors. It's a better film than any of his subsequent epic efforts that I've seen and perhaps you could even say that in its rather simple story of a disabled mafia lawyer Robert Taylor who meets the love of his life Cyd Charisse at a tacky mob party the director found an opportunity to comment on the dissolute state of his life and career.The story follow's Taylor's character's attempts to extricate himself from his deep involvement with mafia kingpin Rico Angelo Lee J. Cobb who relies on his legal skills to keep him and his buddies  including the opportunistic Louis John Ireland and sadistic unstable Cookie La Motte Corey Allen  out of prison. One of the things about the film that really interested me was that the DA Kent Smith is perhaps more unscrupulous and ambitious than any of the mafia figures. In one of the film's best dialog sequences and one that is most charged with Ray's signature style we see the DA Stewart trying to convince Tommy Taylor to become a fink. It's as if the two are back in the courtroom where we first saw Stewart but with only the audience as judge. Tommy acquits himself well in his own defense my expertise is in defending the guilty man and you've made it your business to make the innocent man seem guilty. Stewart remonstrates him when are you going to get smart and play along? Tommy has an answer for that too when are they going to start making you a Senator? Stewart As soon as you start talking. What's fascinating about this scene and also the scenes between Cobb's character and Taylor's is the awareness of how a conversation can be like a battle and in all cases between equal and respectful opponents.Tommy plays on his sincerity even to the audience while holding forth with the most insincere of ruses like his continual appeals to the sentiment associated with his father's watch which he actually orders in bulk to use as a courtroom prop. It kind of reminded me of Chris Nolan's Dark Knight in the way that each time he tells the story of the watch he gives a different version specific to whatever situation he's in at that point but always involving his father and this idea of a hardscrabble upbringing in Chicago. There's a strong thread of nostalgia running through the film which is itself set in the 1930s Chicago of director Ray's childhood. One of the most remarkable scenes in the film is when Tommy tells Vicki Charisse about the injury that made him lame all while they stand next to the very bridge where it occurred.The film features exceptional performances by Taylor Cobb and Ireland and the very best performance I've seen by Cyd Charisse. I was able to see it at the Castro Theater in SF as a commemoration of the passing of Ms. Charisse a few months ago on a double bill with Minnelli's The Band Wagon. Unfortunately a direct comparison such as that makes her musical sequences in Party Girl seem pretty halfbaked. The songs and dances are not very imaginative and are not integrated into the film in any interesting way. Nick Ray seems to be able to get more kinetic power and more of a musical sort of excitement out of the violent montage of mob killings that plays like a color operatic version of the meltdown in Hawks' Scar Face. Party Girl deserves a better fate than its had so far  it should be released on video so that movie fans can assess its unique contributions to the gangster genre that place it firmly between Scar Face and The Godfather and yet infused with the noir atmosphere that was Ray's expertise. For the director Ray this was perhaps the last film in which he was able to tell a story based around small and intimate moments as opposed to the huge European productions he would soon become just a small part of himself.".

Taylor plays an attorney whose hip was damaged in a boyhood accident. He's become a powerful mob mouthpiece when he falls in love with a showgirl Charisse. When he wants out of the mob life he finds that the mobster Cobb is unwilling to let him go.Directed by Nicholas Ray the film flirts more with film noir than B status and has some excellent performances particularly by Taylor and Lee J. Cobb. Cobb is quite terrifying as a violent thug who doesn't telegraph his violence making him all the more frightening  you just never know what he's going to do. And the violence doesn't leave much to the imagination.Taylor does a terrific job as an attorney who all his life has believed he's nothing but a cripple an outsider and has given up on having any kind of a personal life. He tells Charisse the story of how his hip came to be damaged in his youth and talks about it being a mark of bravery  until he was older and the other guys were getting the dates. I really can't see any woman looking at Robert Taylor being deterred by a limp  or anything else  but perhaps this is more a statement about the power of a negative self image and how it allowed him to be ridiculed by his wife.Charisse is very good and has two great dance numbers that show off her great talent gorgeous figure and those todiefor legs.The script has some huge problems. The story is preposterous the Swedish surgery being one aspect that defies reality. The other is the DA expecting a lawyer to breach attorneyclient privilege. Also the film is set in the '30s but some of it has a '50s aura to it  I blame the color more than anything else.Party Girl is still worth seeing. It's a Nicholas Ray film it's Taylor's last MGM film as a contract player and he turns in a wonderful performance.".

What sets this crimefilm 'noireromance apart from others is the first class performances of the four main characters. The gorgeous gams of professional dancer Cyd Charisse are on full display in her role as Vicki Gaye and she is the love interest of the smartest criminal defence attorney Thomas Farrell played to perfection by Robert Taylor who unfortunately died in the prime of his life and in his career as a first rate Hollywood star.Thomas Farrel is the lead counsel for mob boss Rico Angelo played by Academy Award best actor nominee Lee J. Cobb who rules his crime empire and the streets below him by fear of death or serious injury to anyone who would even consider double crossing him. Now lawyer Thomas Farrell does have a close working relationship with the mob boss Rico Angelo who pays him top dollar for keeping him and his cronies out of jail even when they are up on murder charges. Such is the case with Louis Canetto played by John Ireland who is charged with murder but gets off due to the masterful defence strategy used by his lawyer Thomas Farrel. Louis Canetto has his eyes set on the pretty party girl Vicki Gaye but so does defence lead counsel Thomas Farrel. It does not take the gorgeous Cyd Charisse who plays Vicki Gaye long to assess that she will have a much more loving relationship with lawyer Thomas Farrel than she would with the mob underling Louis Canetto.So you can see that this film 'noire has the typical seedy criminal element who require a smart lawyer to continuously defend them and it has the party girl turned love interest of the brilliant lawyer who is used by the mob boss to get what he wants out of his top notch lawyer Thomas Farrell. Where I see this film excels and where other similar pictures of the era falter is with the high caliber acting of these four main characters such that the film has ended when the audience wants to see more.I give the film a pretty good 7 out of 10 rating.".

Some think Taylor was too much of a pretty boy but I thought he always was good as a tough guy i.e. Bataan Johnny Eager etc.. Besides he was past 45 years of age when he made this.The story loses its edge when Tommy Ferrell Taylor falls for dancer Vicki Gaye Cyd Charisse and the film turns into a love story. It tries to recapture its spark with a few gangsteraction scenes later but it is too little0too late and the story really never recovered. Having Cyd dance a few numbers is one example of why this film lost its gangster feel. I have no complaints looking at this woman and her great legs but something is not right here. I hate to say this but the story needed more action scenes and less of our girl Cyd less melodrama. Speaking of looks this movie was shot in 2.351 widescreen and is still available in that format. I saw it on the formattedtoTV style of the VHS and I am sure this would be much more watchable in its original ratio. With the cinematography and wideangle shots this is crying out for a DVD release even if the story is disappointing. I blame that on the overly melodramatic script not the performances of Charisse or Taylor or Lee J. Cobb who plays his normal thug role and does it well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nicolos Ray uses color in this movie like some directors use dialoge. It is spectacular to look at with reds and blacks predominate all through the film. It is oldfashioned in it's appeal to the film noir lover. This is the last film Robert Taylor did for MGM and it is a great performance. The character of Tommy Farrel is if you excuse the pun tailor made for Taylor. Again he is the man with a secret past as he has been in other film noir classics such as the High Wall and Rogue Cop two of his better roles. He is a mob attorney who is drawn to the fastest way which in this case is working for Rico Angelo Lee J Cobb. Cobb is always wonderful to watch and his role here is one of overstated ignorance and brutal power. Tommy walks with a limp due to a childhood accident and hates women because of his exwife's repulsion of his crookedness. She destroyed his masculinity by denying him access to both her bed and her love. He meets Vicki played well by Cyd Charisse at a party given by Angelo takes her home to find her room mate dead in a bloody tub scene. He is drawn to her but chases her away telling her a girl deserves what she can get after Vicki wants him to return money given to her by John Ireland at the party. She follows him to court and watches as he uses his limp to get sympathy from the jury freeing murderer Ireland. His unique approach also includes the use of an old simple watch that he tells the jury was given to him by his father while he was in the hospital as a boy. It is the secret to his success with the jury. She tells him if that is what he wants pity then he has hers. He snarls at her telling her to get out. Afterwards he goes to the club where she is a dancer every night finally taking her home and telling her about his past with the wife. They fall in love and that is the beginning of the end for Farrel. She wants him to quit he can't. He does go to Europe to have his hip fixed and they vacation until Rico summons him back to Chicago. There is finds that Rico has a job for him defending a young gangster who Farrel refers to as a dog with the rabbies. He tries to leave only to find that Rico will disfigure Vickie if he doesn't go along. Reluctantly he agrees and in the pursuit there is a massive machine gunning down of the young gangster and his associates. Farrel escapes unharmed and goes to Vicki telling her they must run. She refuses and the cops take them both to jail. In the end he rats on Rico to save Vicki he thinks until he is taken to a broken down meeting hall where Rico presents Vicki to him wrapped in bandages. They unveil her still perfect face but also a bottle of acid which Rico tells Tommy he will use if he doesn't take back the testimony. The cops were tipped where to find Rico and they attack the hall with a hail of bullets causing Rico to tip the acid on his own face falling to his death through a plate glass window. Vicki and Farrel leave meeting the District Attorney on the way with Farrel giving his watch to Kent Smith as a remembrance. The wonderful thing about this performance by Taylor is that his looks only add to the sadness of the character his blue eyes showing the conflict within this man. Still magnificent to look at we feel for his plight with the crooked body not be able to love again until Charisse loves him as is. Taylor is just great here a mature restrained Tommy Farrel in love at last but conflicted about his job and how he gets his money. A must see film noir.".

Taylor plays an interesting part his attire is first class and so is the mask he wears mustache and all planted on his beautiful self by the makeup department. And there the feat ends. He's stiff as usual and proud of it. Cyd Charisse doesn't even try to act. She dances well and that's all. As for tough guy Lee J. Cobb  usually a very good actor  he's plain bad. He bellows gesticulates Italianstyle laughs out loudly screams most of the time and shows signs of acute boredom. After all he has to play someone named Rico Angelo  which to me sounds like a travesty of an Italianmobster's name! The plot is no better. Bad guys' lawyer is finally testifying against former employers who both die in the most ludicrous final scene in the history of gangster movies both choose to stand by the wide window panes while police is firing from below the street. John Ireland gets hit Lee J. Cobb holds the vial with the hydrochloric acid he's threatened to empty on Cyd Chariss' face a bullet hits it and it burns his face. WOW! No I am a great fan of Nicholas Ray's work  I really worship this director but this must be about the worse thing he's done for the screen. A happy end seems very inappropriate for the gloomy atmosphere in the script but nowhere in the cinematography alas! and 1958 was not so remote a year even from black and white noirs like the Asphalt Jungle  to name just one.

	schema:reviewBody "HOUSE OF STRANGERS is another classic from the Noir vaults of 20th Century Fox and is one of their very best. Under the guiding hand of the brilliant director Joseph L. Mankiewicz the film emerged in 1949 and remains to this day a remarkable piece of cinema! All credit must go to the excellent screenplay by Philip Yordan the masterful low key black  white cinematography of Milton Krasner and the atmospheric score by the Russian composer Daniele Amfitheatrof.The stellar cast is headed by the great Edward G. Robinson. Fresh from his wonderful Johnny Rocco in Houston's Key Largo Robinson plays Gino Monetti the Italian immigrant who runs the bank he founded in New York's lower east side.

	onyx:emotionText "HOUSE OF STRANGERS is another classic from the Noir vaults of 20th Century Fox and is one of their very best. Under the guiding hand of the brilliant director Joseph L. Mankiewicz the film emerged in 1949 and remains to this day a remarkable piece of cinema! All credit must go to the excellent screenplay by Philip Yordan the masterful low key black  white cinematography of Milton Krasner and the atmospheric score by the Russian composer Daniele Amfitheatrof.The stellar cast is headed by the great Edward G. Robinson. Fresh from his wonderful Johnny Rocco in Houston's Key Largo Robinson plays Gino Monetti the Italian immigrant who runs the bank he founded in New York's lower east side. He runs it with an iron fist as he does his family of four sons who work for him. Three of whom are resentful of him because of the poor wages he pays them and the domineering way he treats them. Robinson's Gino Monetti is a deftly crafted and skillful piece of acting and with just the right Italian accent the actor once again demonstrates that he was one of the finest players in American cinema.

Richard Conte gives a sterling performance as the well meaning faithful son Max Monetti. He takes a prison rap for embezzlement for his aging father.

Realizing that his father Gino was the real source of hatred and evil in the family he decides to peacefully leave town with his girlfriend but is soon confronted by his evil brothers. Amazingly this 1949 film was remade in 1954 as a Western of all things! The title of the remake was Broken Lance. Same story different setting. Spencer Tracy Controlling Rancher Father plays the Robinson Controlling Banker father part Robert Wagner plays the Conte part Faithful son Richard Widmark plays the Adler part Ambitious older brother Hugh O'Brien plays the Zimbalist part and Earl Holliman plays the Valentine part strong arm brother.

	schema:reviewBody "An ItalianAmerican family is the subject of House of Strangers a 1949 film starring Edward G. Robinson Richard Conte Susan Hayward Luther Adler Debra Paget Hope Emerson and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Being of Italian extraction myself I actually thought this film was written by an Italian and was surprised to see it wasn't. It was dead on.Edward G. Robinson is Gino Monetti who owns a bank in the '30s. He runs it like he's selling items out of his garage with lousy bookkeeping some people being charged interest up front on loans and some getting more money than they asked for. He has four sons three of whom he treats like secondclass citizens Pietro is a guard at the bank by day and an amateur boxer by night Joe is a teller and Tony is a clerk. When Joe who married a woman from a good Philadelphia family asks for a raise he was promised he gets a lecture from Gino about how the family lived in the back of a barber shop when Gino made 15 a week. When Pietro loses a boxing match Gino takes the jacket off of his shoulders that says Monetti Bank. Gino runs his home with more rigidity than he does his bank His wife doesn't say much and he has mandatory Wednesday night spaghetti dinners during which he plays opera recordings such as Il Barbiere di Siviglia starring Lawrence Tibbett.Gino has a favored child and that's Max his lawyer son. When the Feds start investigating Gino Max comes up with a solution. If all the brothers will take responsibility for the sloppiness at the bank the Feds won't be able to pin anything on anybody. But the sons refuse to lift a finger to help their father ultimately forcing him out and starting their own bank. Max goes to prison for attempting to bribe a juror and when he gets out he's bent on revenge against his brothers.The acting is this film is nothing short of fantastic. Robinson is perfect as the dictatorial ruthless Gino. Conte is totally believable as the favorite son  efficient and slightly to the right of slimy. Luther Adler gives a brilliant performance as the henpecked Tony. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent. Susan Hayward plays Max's love interest a woman who gives as good as she gets. She looks sensational and does a terrific job in her role. Stardom is right around the corner for her and it's no surprise.With a great pace kept by Joseph Mankiewicz this is a film that I'm surprised we don't hear more about. It just goes to show that there were so many great films made in Hollywood in the past that even some marvelous ones are overlooked. House of Strangers is definitely one to see and remember.".

But he played many Italian  Americans mostly involved in criminal activities. Best known is his Rico Bandello in LITTLE CAESAR but he also did Remy Marko in A SLIGHT CASE OF MURDER. And there is the more respectable but still illegal gentleman in this film Gino Monetti. Living in the middle of Little Italy in a mansion Monetti started out as a barber living in a single room with his wife Theresa Esther Minciotti and his four sons. They grow up to be Joe Luther Adler Max Richard Conte Tony Efrem Zimberlist Jr. and Pietro Paul Valentine.Monetti's views of his Italian heritage and his adopted land's culture are mixed. He loves the music of his homeland  he's frequently playing opera Rossini's THE BARBER OF SEVILLE sung by Lawrence Tibbett is heard at one point on his record player. He does have a sense of tradition every Wednesday Theresa cooks a big dinner for the family and everyone has to come including Max's fianc Maria Domenico  Debra Paget  and her mother Helena Domenico  Hope Emerson  and Joe's wife Elena  Diana Douglas. Gino will talk about how different life in America is where a man does not have to forever be in the same job as his father or where cities grow upward due to skyscrapers. But he treats three of his sons as servants. Joe who is his oldest is asked to scrub Gino's back in the bathtub or has to chauffeur his father around and is only a clerk in the bank although called first Vice President. Pietro is referred to as dumbhead because he likes to work on a boxing career rather than an office job. Tony is a lady's man always quiet and well dressed and dismissed by his father as a weakling. Only Max has gained the old man's respect  he became an attorney and a pretty good one.The bank itself is a mixed concern. When Frank Puglia asks for a 150.00 loan to buy a horse he only gets 120.00 as 30.00 is taken off the top as interest on the new loan later the loan has escalated to being 280.00. A poor woman needing money however gets the money without any interest being given. It later develops that Gino is lousy with bookkeeping and resents government interest in his bank but he is an intelligent banker on the whole a decent guy but he occasionally turns into a usurer.Max although engaged to Maria meets a socialite named Irene Bennett Susan Hayward who initially hires him to help an exboyfriend who robbed her. They gradually get into an affair which threatens the engagement to Maria. Hayward's jealousy eventually leads to a break in it. At just that time government actions close the bank and lead to a trial for Gino on serious fraud charges. Max tries to defend him but he finds Gino too hottempered on the witness stand. He talks about the case with Joe who is not too interested in whether the old man goes to jail or not and says that possibly if they bribe a juror they can save Gino. Joe refuses to help. Max tries to bribe the juror but finds himself arrested instead. It results in his disbarment and seven years in prison. Gino is not sent to prison but finds the bank reorganized by Joe Tony and Pietro and he is put out to pasture. Still Gino encourages hatred in Max to his brothers pointing out that Joe probably tipped off the police about the bribery attempt.So Max leaves prison to confront his three siblings and to see if he can resume life with Irene. And Joe Tony who has married Maria and Pietro wonder if Max is going to be a troublemaker.The film captured an aspect of life on the lower East side rarely shown in films  how did banks work in those immigrant enclaves? This was before major banks had branches around the cities and small local banks like Monetti's were common. And were run in the same haphazard manner until the Depression made the government take a closer look. The film directed by Joseph Mankiewicz crackles with good dialog and steamy lines too  particularly between Conte and Hayward. Robinson's Gino is memorable  not a really bad man but one who forgot certain simple family rules regarding his sons. Even minor characters have good moments Hope Emerson's fury at Conte's flaunting his affair with Hayward leads to a confrontation scene and the dinner at the Monetti's reveals how Diana Douglas Kirk's wife is a nonItalian mainliner that Luther Adler married who barely likes her inlaws she can't stand spaghetti dinners and wants him to have a promised raise so she can entertain HER friends. It is a rewarding movie about social mobility and it's pitfalls in the urban immigrant circles.".

	schema:headline " A TRIUMVIRATE OF SUPERB ACTING";
	schema:reviewBody "House of Strangers features three of my alltime favorite actorsEdward G. Robinson Susan Hayward and Richard Conteall at the very top of their form as well as moody almost noirish direction by the great Joseph L. Mankiewicz in moody black and white. Those ingredients alone should indicate that a fine work is in store for the viewer and such happily is the case here. The tale is told mainly in flashback in which we learn how the four sons of Lower East Side banker Edward G. became enemies after their Pop got into some legal trouble. Susan Hayward never more beautiful plays a highclass dame who becomes involved with lawyer Conte despite Conte's engagement to a proper Italian girl from the old country. The relationship between Hayward and Conte is very adult for the restrictive late '40s. By the film's end we really come to care about these two and hope that they can survive as a couple. As usual Edward G. gives a bravura performance this time as the domineering patriarch of his Italian clan. I believe his performance received a welldeserved award at Cannes that year. Conte and Hayward both of whose careers are ripe for reevaluation and rediscovery match him every step of the way. Luther Adler is fine also in his role as Conte's elder brother who feels he never got the respect he deserved. Deborah Paget in one of her earliest parts looks fine in a decorative role. For me though the main lure of this picture is the triumvirate of superb acting by the three leads. What a pleasure it is to watch these three great talents do justice to the wellwritten script here. I just love this movie and suspect that a real treat is in store for the firsttime viewer. Check it out by all means!".

The screenplay is terrific subtle thoughtful and at the same time razor sharp. Some of the exchanges between Conte and Hayward in particular are electrifying. Talk about two 'tough cookies' that ignite when they get together. And you really begin to care deeply about what happens to them. All of the acting is top notch across the board. And then there is the direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The movie is so beautifully crafted and feels as if it could have been made yesterday it's gritty and urban and fresh. The composition in the movie has deep meaning in just about every shot and is gorgeous to behold besides. Watch this movie.".

	schema:headline " Dysfunctional Family.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pretty interesting story and adult too. Robinson is Pa Minetti an Italian immigrant formerly a penurious barber now the prosperous president of his own bank. He has three older sons  Luther Adler Valentine and Zimbalist. And he favors his youngest son Max Richard Conte who is a lawyer and has his office in Pa's bank.All kind of cozy like the warm Italian family in The Godfather. But there's a problem. Robinson has brought his oldworld ways to the new world. He's not only the president of the bank but president of the family too and nobody elected him. Someone calls him Il Duce. Kids that was the title of Benito Mussolini the Italian dictator in the 1930s and the early 1940s when his subjects hung him out to dry. But Pa has in fact absorbed some of the ways of the new world only it's the wrong philosophy. The philosophy can be summarily described as Dog Eat Dog. Boy does Pa browbeat his three older sons both at work and at home. He has Luther Adler his first born working in a teller's cage. Efram Zimbalist Jr. has some menial position too. And the biggest and strongest Paul Valentine as Pietro wears a guard's uniform. He's constantly ordering them to get back to work. And he refers to Valentine as dumbhead repeatedly. Even at the weekly family dinners when the sons bring their families over for Ma's spaghetti dinners he plays opera on the phonograph  and LOUD so nobody can hear anybody else. And Pa makes everyone wait at the table until Conte arrives. Nobody's eat untilla Max gets ahere. The three elder sons don't care much for the kind of humiliation that Pa is dishing out though he's rarely mean about it. He just takes it for granted that they know they'll inherit the bank one day when he's gone and meantime they'll have some notion of what he himself went through as they crawl on their bellies like dogs and can't afford decent apartments for their wives and kids.How does Conte treat all this? With aplomb. He speaks up for his brothers when they ask him to but he doesn't take it all too seriously. I mean what the hell he's a lawyer and Pa's favorite son.A run on the bank this is 1932 exposes a few weaknesses in Pa's book keeping. He doesn't know the meaning of the word collateral. He lends money based on his reckoning of whether he'll get it back accompanied by usurious interest. He keeps money stashed in a cigar box and writes his records on napkins things like that. So he's brought to trial and is about to be convicted. The older brothers don't care. Pa's just getting what he deserves. But Conte is representing him in court and seeing the guillotine blade about to fall interferes with a juror and is sent to prison for seven years. The cops were tipped off by the other brothers which annoys Conte no end.So when Conte is finally released from jail he intends to take care of them but due to the seasonal interposition of an adventitious girl friend Susan Hayward he decides not to because that would have represented the worst of Pa's desires. A free man he leaves with Hayward for San Francisco and the brothers get the bank. So long Pa.Joseph L. Mankievicz directed it efficiently and the script is occasionally very keen. An example of what I mean. Susan Hayward calls Conte and tells him to come to her place it's a legal emergency. Well it isn't. She just wants to have some fun with him. He turns her offer down but she says Let's go to dinner. I'll get my wrap. Conte walks to the door and opens it then looks back at her. She drops the wrap on the couch and they stand there silently. Fade out. There's a marvelous scene in a seedy bar. Mankievicz's camera glides along from booth to booth passing one in which a fat older man with a cigar is sitting next to a frozen young lady. Neither says a word. A few minutes later Conte and Hayward look up from their drinks when they hear a slight sob and there is a cut to the other couple.

	onyx:emotionText "Pretty interesting story and adult too. Robinson is Pa Minetti an Italian immigrant formerly a penurious barber now the prosperous president of his own bank. He has three older sons  Luther Adler Valentine and Zimbalist. And he favors his youngest son Max Richard Conte who is a lawyer and has his office in Pa's bank.All kind of cozy like the warm Italian family in The Godfather. But there's a problem. Robinson has brought his oldworld ways to the new world. He's not only the president of the bank but president of the family too and nobody elected him. Someone calls him Il Duce. Kids that was the title of Benito Mussolini the Italian dictator in the 1930s and the early 1940s when his subjects hung him out to dry. But Pa has in fact absorbed some of the ways of the new world only it's the wrong philosophy. The philosophy can be summarily described as Dog Eat Dog. Boy does Pa browbeat his three older sons both at work and at home. He has Luther Adler his first born working in a teller's cage. Efram Zimbalist Jr. has some menial position too. And the biggest and strongest Paul Valentine as Pietro wears a guard's uniform. He's constantly ordering them to get back to work. And he refers to Valentine as dumbhead repeatedly. Even at the weekly family dinners when the sons bring their families over for Ma's spaghetti dinners he plays opera on the phonograph  and LOUD so nobody can hear anybody else. And Pa makes everyone wait at the table until Conte arrives. Nobody's eat untilla Max gets ahere. The three elder sons don't care much for the kind of humiliation that Pa is dishing out though he's rarely mean about it. He just takes it for granted that they know they'll inherit the bank one day when he's gone and meantime they'll have some notion of what he himself went through as they crawl on their bellies like dogs and can't afford decent apartments for their wives and kids.How does Conte treat all this? With aplomb. He speaks up for his brothers when they ask him to but he doesn't take it all too seriously. I mean what the hell he's a lawyer and Pa's favorite son.A run on the bank this is 1932 exposes a few weaknesses in Pa's book keeping. He doesn't know the meaning of the word collateral. He lends money based on his reckoning of whether he'll get it back accompanied by usurious interest. He keeps money stashed in a cigar box and writes his records on napkins things like that. So he's brought to trial and is about to be convicted. The older brothers don't care. Pa's just getting what he deserves. But Conte is representing him in court and seeing the guillotine blade about to fall interferes with a juror and is sent to prison for seven years. The cops were tipped off by the other brothers which annoys Conte no end.So when Conte is finally released from jail he intends to take care of them but due to the seasonal interposition of an adventitious girl friend Susan Hayward he decides not to because that would have represented the worst of Pa's desires. A free man he leaves with Hayward for San Francisco and the brothers get the bank. So long Pa.Joseph L. Mankievicz directed it efficiently and the script is occasionally very keen. An example of what I mean. Susan Hayward calls Conte and tells him to come to her place it's a legal emergency. Well it isn't. She just wants to have some fun with him. He turns her offer down but she says Let's go to dinner. I'll get my wrap. Conte walks to the door and opens it then looks back at her. She drops the wrap on the couch and they stand there silently. Fade out. There's a marvelous scene in a seedy bar. Mankievicz's camera glides along from booth to booth passing one in which a fat older man with a cigar is sitting next to a frozen young lady. Neither says a word. A few minutes later Conte and Hayward look up from their drinks when they hear a slight sob and there is a cut to the other couple. The girl has covered her face with her hands and the fat man is looking around self consciously. A vignette whose character we can fill in with our imaginations.I said it was an adult movie but that hint of premarital intercourse isn't why.

It begins in the present goes back to the start of the various problems between them then returns to the present. It's complicated in a way and yet it ends up cohering well. The story holds water the actors are superb more on that and the overall direction and construction photography and editing are spot on.So we end up with a very impressive movie and one that uses worn ideas and makes them fresh enough to last. Robinson is not in the end the main character but one of the sons is Max played by Richard Conte. Now Conte is not to everyone's taste. There's something conceited about him even when he's playing a regular guy. But he's just right for this part of the good brother who is also a lawyer and who gets drawn into major mischief by his father's bullheadedness. And Conte is the key to an important other thread to the story and in some ways the best part his falling in love with a young and independent Irene Bennett played by Susan Hayward. She isn't just a love interest but she represents an alternative to his family bound very ItalianAmerican world.Of the other brothers the eldest played by Luther Adler is the most caustic and believable giving a stunning performance in just a few scenes throughout the movie. The other brothers are simpler types and they work too. In fact it's only when you drift to the farther reaches of the cast like the fiance and her mother do you find caricatures that strain. In all the dynamic of a group of men adjusting or not to the ways of the new worlds is fascinating. Throw in a physically imposing and sharp tongued leading man in Robinson and you can see how much this has going for it.The director is Joseph L. Mankiewicz has a handful of very sensitively made films among the mere twenty in his career including All about Eve and this is one of his best. He keeps the plot coherent and yet lets it breath. The characters have enough individuality to distinguish themselves without getting us distracted with peripheral stuff. And the camerawork by Milton Krasner is flawless and subtle. This again comes at the slick and yet artful high point in American black and white cinematography the 1940s.".

Once before filmed in 1956 also as Mighty Joe Young' this story of a gorilla with a defect in his genes which causes him to grow out of proportions into a 2000 lbs primate is a great one.The story begins with little Jill Young and her mother as they are in the jungle observing a group of gorilla's. Little Jill instantly bonds with Little Joe a baby gorilla. At night the group of gorilla's is attacked by poachers and Jill and her mother go out there to the jungle to protect them. To no avail because in the end both Jill's and Joe's mother are killed. Twelve years later Jill Theron is still with Joe and Joe has grown into this enormous gorilla weighing over 2000 lbs. Paxton comes to the jungle to investigate a myth of a giant primate protecting the area of the mountain where Joe lives. Joe and Paxton meet poachers come to hunt him down and Paxton and Jill decide to take Joe to a preserve in California so he can have a more quiet life. But danger is not gone even in California old enemies come to hunt him down and Joe ultimately has to undertake a very brave action...This is the outline of a very well crafted piece of cinema family entertainment at its best. The script is very well written the characters are likable and convincing. You have the hero and the heroine the villain and luckily the moronic sidekicks have been left at home this time. Joe is a lovely character although a lot of him has been done with CGI he is still very convincing. A lot of work has gone into creating the right facial expressions to give him a human touch. The story unfolds at rollercoaster speed never lets off steam and constantly plunges the audiences into new surprises and endearing situations.Ron Underwood did a great job at recreating this story on screen. The performances are way above average even Theron is good for once. Paxton is his Paxton self. The art direction is fine as well. The sets are well designed if somewhat Disney at times. The special effects were awesome and stateoftheart. Although some of the scenes could be recognized as being CGI this was not very bothersome there have been worse attempts at this genre.A lovely picture for the family if maybe not for the smallest of the family some of the scenes can be quite frightening for some. One must be a very big cynical grownup not be moved by the final scenes at the fairground.910".

Also it was very fitting to have Terry Moore the original star and Ray Harryhausen the man who made the special effects in the first one to have a cameo.   A lot of critics did not like this movie but my 3 grandchildren did.   Why not have movie critics the same age as the targeted audience such as having kid critics and women critics and senior citizen critics to give a real reaction of what they like and don't like.".

Zoologist Gregg O'Hara stumbles upon the two on a wildlife visit to the jungle and convinces Jill to bring Joe to a sanctuary in California.  However despite the safety the threat to Joe has not vanished.I ignored this on video and at the cinema but on TV I gave it a go for the same of the kids.  The first thing that strikes you is how much of a ripoff of every monster movie you've ever seen  from King Kong onwards.  All the clichs are there and the characters are little more than cardboard cut outs at times.  However it is still good fun and all delivered with energy that will keep the kids happy.  The film may not go anywhere that you don't expect but it has funny moments and also moments that are quite tense and exciting.Of the cast Joe stands out.  His facial expression depth of understanding and emotional range may be a little unlikely but he looks good.  The effects may occasionally show the joins where Joe interacts with physical objects but for the vast majority he is impressive  for the most part I forgot it was effects and totally bought into him being real that's a sign of good effects.  Paxton maybe takes it all a bit seriously but does well Theron is a bit too street smart for a girl who grew up with a gorilla but she passes. Support like King and Paymer are underused and simply become more examples of good Americans'.  If you're being cynical you could say that the two leads are WASP heroes and that King black and Paymer Jewish were there to cover bases!  This view is a little supported however by the hackneyed casting of white South African and Eastern European types as the bad guys  their roles are caricatures at best and the actors look embarrassed at times.Overall it's enjoyable.  It's not great  the plot is flawed the acting is soso it borrows from every big ape movie that has gone before and it'll never be remembered years from now as a great film.  But it's good for kids without boring adults.  The effects are good and though you'll forget it quickly it's fun while it's on.".

When I did decide to give it a chance again I am glad I did. I wasn't expecting a perfect family movie and while this movie is very dark it also manages to be quite sweet too. I will admit that the beginning is very dark and intense even for a family movie. I will also admit that the plot is very formulaic and that the villains are rather cartoony.What made this movie though for me was Joe. He was designed superbly and acted very convincingly. Even for an ape I found him quite adorable after seeing films like Congo where they scared me so much. Other pluses are the superb special effects and the splendid scenery. Not to mention the lovely music score. The acting was a mixed bag Charlize Theron was gorgeous as Jill and Bill Paxton was very good as Gregg. The supporting actors ranged from good to soso. The relationship between Joe and Jill was very very convincing and sweet well to me it was. And I know the ending was more King Kong with a happy ending but I will confess I cried. Maybe it was because I loved Joe so much I have a habit of empathising with characters that I grow to love.Overall it is a decent family movie. It mayn't appeal to you first time but if given the chance as it did with me it may grow on you. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I can recall though not very clearly seeing the original 1949 version of Mighty Joe Young in the theater when I was a boy.  The 1998 remake to me is better in every way. The special effects which place the giant gorilla among people or chasing trucks is very realistic as is the sound track.The story starts in the jungle where gorilla hunter Strasser shoots and kills the baby gorilla's mom and Jill Young's Carlize Theron mom is also killed. Jill and the young gorilla become friends and they grow up in virtual anonymity. In a stroke of good casting for a very small part Linda Purl who plays the mother looks a lot like Theron.Many years later when Paxton's character shows up hunting wild species for blood samples the capture of a big cat enrages Joe and he jumps out of the trees.  That is a remarkable point in the film because with a good sound system with subwoofer the room literally shakes. And it continues as they case Joe in trucks.Jill is persuaded that Joe will be safer when transported to Los Angeles with his own habitat and she agrees. The evil Strasser shows up enrages Joe who breaks out and runs. In the sweet climax he climbs a tall ferris wheel to rescue a small child survives and eventually is put in a proper place for his safety.Most of the charm of this film is during the first half in the jungle with Joe and Jill growing up then the discovery of the adult Joe. In a small part as the hunting organizer Paxton hires Nuveen Andrews is just terrific his delivery his body language. And of course Charlize Theron who reminds me so much of my daughter Karen is just perfect as Joe's caretaker and friend.I rate this version of Mighty Joe Young a solid 8 of 10.".

The bad guys get whats owed to them. Oh did I mention some romance in there too? The song Jill sings to Joe that Jill's mom sang to her when she was little is a great song. Its such a relaxing song which I prefer her rendition over the one played at the end of the movie during the credits!!

	schema:reviewBody "My Take Fine special effects and decent performances make for a passable remake. A toneddown remake of the 1949 monster movie not that the original was violent or so by Disney MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is enjoyably pleasant nonetheless. There's a lot of enjoyable moments here to entice kids and adults alike. It's fun without being too loud too lumbering and too overproduced unlike other summer affair of the time. It could use more but enough just seems to be enough. There's a good dosage of fine adventure movie elements. There's action adventure humor and even romance.The romance is created between two of the lead characters. Bill Paxton as an explorer named Gregg O'Hara and a Charlize Theron as Jill Young a daughter of a late famous Jane Goodallinspired scientist. There's chemistry between those two even if it's not entirely developed. It's also a simple boylikesthegirl chemistry but it works well and I bought it. Ask for the adventure there are numerous action scenes which takes place both in the jungle in even in the city which shows a scenes directly derived but not entirely similarly to the scene from KING KONG. The special effects by Rick Baker who actually started doing apes in a somewhat cheesy outcome during the 70's remake of KING KONG are fine here in the film. There's a convincing use of blue screen and the typical maninasuit technique that actually is less evident here.Director Ron Underwood TREMORS brings a lot of excitement in this familiar territory. The film cannot escape the multitudes of clichs that marred this old genre to the ground. Some things about MIGHTY JOE YOUNG are familiar as a toneddown kids flick. I've learned the lesson before there's no one that harshly gets hurt in this film except the bad guys who must get their just desserts in the end. But the film is lively and enjoyable enough for me to recommend. This is decent family entertainment.Rating  out of 5.".

I've learned the lesson before there's no one that harshly gets hurt in this film except the bad guys who must get their just desserts in the end. But the film is lively and enjoyable enough for me to recommend. This is decent family entertainment.Rating  out of 5.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mighty Joe Young starts in Africa where conservationist Professor Gregory O'Hara Bill Paxton discovers the existence of Joe Young a huge 2000 pound giant Ape that has been looked after  cared for by Jill Young Charlize Theron ever since their mother's were killed on the same night by poachers twelve years ago. O'Hara is amazed by both Joe  Jill  when poachers return to try  kill Joe he arranges for him to be taken to California where he can be properly protected from poachers in a zoo. At first Joe seems happy enough but once again he comes under threat from poachers  when he runs amok at a dinner party he is considered a threat to the public it's up to Jill  O'Hara to save Joe before he is either killed by poachers or the authorities...Directed by Ron Underwood this big budget Disney production was a remake of the same titled Mighty Joe Young 1949 while not terrible I suppose this remake is nowhere near as good as the original  at times I found it a bit of an overly sentimental bore with far too many annoying Disneyesquire touches. The script here sticks to the general storyline of the original but changes a lot of the setpieces to lacklustre effects like the capturing of Joe is changed from Cowboys lassoing him to blokes in jeeps  the fantastic climax set in a nightclub where Joe fights Lions  then saves children in a burning orphanage is replaced with a walk around Hollywood  saving a kid on a burning ferris wheel. While the CGI effects are excellent there's a certain coldness to the action  adventure scenes while the character's are terrible with some annoying comic relief  a really sickening romance between the two leads  lots of moralising about the evils of poaching  the perils of locking animals up in cages rather than letting run free  the parallels that has with our own lives as we too are locked up in cages  it's just that we call them houses. At almost two hours Mighty Joe Young is a bit too long there's too much mushy Hollywood sentiment including a cringe worthy ending in which random members of the public all decide to give money to rehouse Joe  this remake doesn't have the magical fantastical quality of the original  if I am honest feels lie a poor man's King Kong 1933 with it's slightly weird central relationship between a giant Ape  a pretty blonde woman. Having said that it's watchable I suppose  the effects are good.As already mentioned the CGI effects are very good as are the practical effects created by Rick Baker who was along with his team nominated for an Oscar but lost out to What Dreams May Come 1998. This being a squeaky clean Disney family film there's no violence  even the main villain doesn't get much of a sendoff. Charlize Theron's attempt to portray a character who has never been to civilisation  spent her entire life in the jungles of Africa is hopeless  she comes across as some ball American blonde anyway.With a supposed budget of about 90000000 this had a lot of money spent on it  it show's with great effects  ambitious setpieces although the finished product doesn't come across as exciting on screen due to the awful music  lack of imagination that isn't the fault of the effects work which is impressive. The acting is bland  I usually quite like Bill Paxton but not in a family film such as this.Mighty Joe Young is a remake that isn't as good as the original  comes across as a second rate King Kong hell even the ridiculous King Kong Lives 1986 is better than this. Basically a King Kong wannabe that doesn't cut the mustard  isn't as good as the original Mighty Joe Young either but is still watchable on a corny level.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have never saw the original but I might need to give that a look since I watched this one when I was young back then. Mighty Joe Young tells the story about a woman name Jill Young who is looking after Joe and protecting him by poachers since they were once young as they both lost their mothers. Now as the two are all grown up Gregg O'Hara arrives to Africa and convinces Jill to bring Joe to Los Angeles California so he could be away from the poachers so that no one will hunt him down. I don't think this movie deserves such a low rating and I don't think it deserves to be ignored either. I know everyone remembers the original but I think they need to give this movie a chance and have the respect that it really deserves. Heck even Disney needs to give this a proper DVD and Blu Ray release with actual special features like a documentary with interviews for the cast and crew Bill Paxton Charlize Theron Ron Underwood Rick Baker James Horner etc. as they take a look back on how the movie went as there were problems working on the special effects when it first came out to mixed reviews and maybe why the movie will always be a great movie as it has fans that remembers it. Like me. Also a commentary track for the cast and crew along with deleted scenes trailers and TV spots etc. To me I think it is a wonderful movie for kids and adults to enjoy it. Of course this is Disney's own King Kong but that doesn't make it a bad thing. I do love the original 1933 and the 2005 remake of King Kong while the 1976 remake with Jeff Bridges not so much. I thought the special effects in this movie are impressive for its combination of practical and CGI. I may have notice one bad effect but that is just a minor nitpick. The design of Joe is very well crafted by Rick Baker. Ron Underwood does a fantastic job on directing the movie as what he did with his other great movie Tremors. The story itself is beautifully well told and I was deeply moved by it. The cast in this movie all did great but I give most props to Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton as they both a great chemistry together. I do love James Horner's music and I do admit that there are some parts of it where it make me think of another music that Horner did which is Titanic. The set pieces in LA are very well done as well as the Ferris wheel part. The movie does have its sad moments like both Joe and Jill loosing their mothers and most of all the ending the ending really did make me cry as Joe risks his life to save a boy as the Ferris wheel was coming down. Of course Joe doesn't die because everyone love Joe and deserves to live as he is the hero in this movie. So that is what I thought of this movie and why it deserves a chance and give it the respect it deserves. I do hope that the movie doesn't make its official debut on Blu Ray and releasing it on DVD again in the UK or anywhere else because it deserves to be release in the United States and around the globe. What I mean is that if it was release only in the UK then it would be unfair because everyone may want a copy of this movie in the US. I understand that some people may have a region free DVDBlu Ray player so they can order it from the UK or anywhere else but I rather much prefer to be release in the US and around the globe. I don't know if a petition can be done to change Disney's mind so they can release it again on DVD and have an official release on Blu Ray but if it can then it is possible. I hope they don't use DNR like what Fox did to Predator which is one of the worst transfers that I have ever seen in my entire life. The movie should be remastered in 4K or something like that as long as they remain true on how the movie was filmed. Also we should show Disney on why it needs to be release again on DVD and have an official Blu Ray release as we show them that we are fans of this movie. This isn't about the money or anything like that. It is how much we appreciate this movie and why we will always be a fan of it. All other movies must have that. Not just the money so that studios can be so greedy about. With that said Mighty Joe Young is a very moving and powerful film by Disney and I give this a 10 out of 10.".

The computer effects and animatronics are believable but the facial expressions and primate mannerisms are what make him so absolutely convincing.spoilersWhile the giantgorillaonthelooseinthebigcity scenes don't compare to their truly outrageous counterparts in the original MJY real live African lions being catapulted about the Coconut Grove! they're entertaining enough for audiences of all ages.The remake also felt some politicallycorrect need to add bad guys that weren't necessary in the original but by introducing poachers that leave the girl and Joe orphaned they also seem to offer an ironic apology for what almost certainly happened in acquiring the baby gorilla for the original movie.".

The computer effects and animatronics are believable but the facial expressions and primate mannerisms are what make him so absolutely convincing.spoilersWhile the giantgorillaonthelooseinthebigcity scenes don't compare to their truly outrageous counterparts in the original MJY real live African lions being catapulted about the Coconut Grove! they're entertaining enough for audiences of all ages.The remake also felt some politicallycorrect need to add bad guys that weren't necessary in the original but by introducing poachers that leave the girl and Joe orphaned they also seem to offer an ironic apology for what almost certainly happened in acquiring the baby gorilla for the original movie.";

	schema:headline " Great try falls short especially after the new Kong";
	schema:reviewBody "A few years back I would have rated this film higher easily a 9 perhaps a 10 but after viewing the new King Kong it drops a notch or two. Okay I admit it. When I was a kid back in the late '50s or early '60s sometime around the Christmas season I shed a few tears at the end of my first viewing of the original Mighty Joe Young and as a middle aged adult back in '98 I shed a few tears again. It was a good heart wrenching story in the '40s as well as in the '90s. The new Joe Young looks and feels and sounds real and Charlize Theron is a great replacement for Terry Moore though Terry was endearingly naive. But where I think some filmmakers go wrong when making a remake is in updating the story in an attempt to appeal to a modern audience. If the new King Kong teaches anything it shows that telling the same great story in the same time period with greater detail and better effects will bring an audience in and pay homage to an old classic. Charlize is great to look at but she's too hip and savvy for a gal living back in the jungle. In the original Terry Moore and cowboy Ben Johnson were as out of their element in the big city as Joe Young was and it was no accident that all three joined together to escape civilization and attempt to return to the jungle. As remakes go this one is better than most and worth watching again it just falls short of what it might have been for being a bit too modern.".

It was like Zorro in just being an entertaining fun movie for everyone.They've done a great job of creating Joe he seems very real and interacts very well with the environments. They have also succeeded in giving him a very vividly drawn personality you really root for him and it's almost hard to believe that he's just a special effect and not a living being. Kids will fall in LOVE with him and the charming notion presented in the movie of being best friends with a 15foot Gorilla.The first trailers I saw for this made it look like an action movie but the current trailers make it look like a heartwarming Free WillyType of film. It really does both but without being too sweet. Many people in my audience cried and cheered at the end. I hope this film does well and I would love to see a sequel.

She is awesome in this role. If you like prison films and triumph of the underdog seemingly against all odds run and rent this film. It is for you. As the Shawshank Redemption remains the second toprated movie of all time here it would follow that BANDITS should be a comparable success in the foreign film department. Additionally it has all that female bonding which men who usually make up over 52 of the audience and I believe most emancipated women love to watch. See it now. You never know when these European films suddenly go out of print. In Germany it will always be available and is already a classic as the previous comment indicates and represents the majority opinion here. But no one can pinpoint why German movies are just being totally ignored since the 80s when in fact they have experienced a rebirth and have become so much more accessible so much more American as has been the trend in almost everything in post World War II Germany. RUN LOLA RUN to many is not really a movie but a series of music videos according to many and so can not really be called an exception. But BANDITS is a real movie not particularly German AT ALL.

The become the most popular band in the country.It's a really funny movie yes the Germans can be funny.

Hmm It could be a Bonny and Clyde type of material. But the director shows no interest in examining human nature. The characters don't care much about freedom.  In no way their behaviour could possible derive any success let alone human triumph. The director is only obsessed with showcasing rock music what a band they don't even play much original German rock song? making it look like those cheap MTV.Ladies in the movie seems still in their teen days. Besides music they only seems to interest in making love. I have no sympathy for the two hollywoodized young band member who had bitter affair with the same irresponsible cute boy on the street. They got only themselves to blame. This movie about the girl band is definitely not for girls. The plot is lame enough to adding the beatup story of the midclass drummer and the story of midage mother for her dead son. Both stories are so stereotyped that I eventually get bored.It had great potential. Like the story of the suicidal midage mother though not much rock spirit. This kind of self destruction could be generated by years of the prison experience . Shawhank's redemption examined and expressed similar facet. But this director choose just put spread her hormone and left the mess around. It is easy to admire the life on the edge. It is easier to get what is brought out superficially especially in the fast changing edays.It has its fun moment. The movie try to switch between reality and surreal. Those rock until you have nowhere to run scene. The fate of Inevitable failure. Pretty impressive. Due to lack of vision the director didn't explore all the potential of the movie.Maybe I shouldn't take this movie too seriously. But after terrific German movies like Run lola Run similar scene of girl on the run and Comedian Harmonists similar for a story about a musical group this is really a let down!".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I did see the movie in both versions original German as recommended by a viewer and English none would convince me to call it a good movie although it has some nice music that goes into the ear. What bothers most is that it seems to hobble over a number of gaps where elements just do not fit together and reason for this may be that Ms Garnier took so long in making it that by half way through she had so many more ideas she desperately wanted to see included although they were not worked out at all or she had really that many influential advisers that the outcome is a weird mixed salad with no clear direction. However it is somewhat wonderfully easy to digest thanks to some refreshing dance and music interludes but that makes it also feel like watching a serious yet boring movie and keeping the channel on because of frequent interruptions by some excellently done commercials that advertise any mundane product through creating an association with cool lifestyle. Indeed the ohsoyummy! supporting actor is actually a HUGO BOSS perfume model and all he is able to say although with a cute accent is Du hast wunderschoene Augen! Guys even if you don't know what that means record it and learn it by heart  and swap it for the notorious Isch liebe Disch! as shown on screen this phrase will get you any girl into bed! How fun to get to do a sexscene a'la MTV video with something like that no wonder that both of the girls in sexually active age or as much as the audience wants to imagine get to have a go. And the great sideeffect of that is the movie shows all the interested guys and also ladies who feel like it in the audience how it would be to have sex with the only? two types of hip ladies that exist out there cutesy innocent manmurderer Angel!!! that even during flight from highsecurity prison chooses to wear sexkitten outfit inclusive highheels andor the ever so grumpy equals irresistibly cool dark mysterious Luna who all of a sudden with no clothes on covered in mud and giggling over the just experienced primal fun has lost all her darkness and turns a silly highschoolchick that cheated with the man of her best friend just to have something to do all that guitar playing gets boring after some time doesn't it? until that one returns. Upon sight of her she remembers her sins and is back to being oh so dark once again. There are the two elder inmates but why bother getting to know them a bit more because they are not what a young paying audience wants to associate with. So their personal drama is limited to mini explanations. The one misses the longsincedead man who will be met only at his grave and reunited with just by leaving her body when things turn too rough out there was she really THAT old oh my God!?. The other was driven to murder after her partner through beating her up caused the stillbirth of their baby. Luna gives the only comment Tut mir leid! I'm sorry that's enough said. The dialogs in this movie are sparse which does not make them any better and somehow the musiclyrics seem to have more body. Once again as it seems fashion in contemporary German cinema why do parts of the movie especially where prison and policescenes are portrayed seem way too aggressive and more out of an US action movie? Are Germans ashamed that their authority systems are yet not as brutal as the BIG BROTHER's? Do you want it like that and is that a kind of lack of crueltycomplex? Ms Riemann who learned drumming just for the role of percussionist Emma shows another unexpected talent applause for this although she somehow carries an atmosphere of Doris Doerriecomedies and does not convince as a killer nor do the other three ladies for that part. Although according to story each had her reasons it feels rather we are looking at four very nice ladies that were confronted during a very average life with unlucky situations that happened to ask for murder as the only reaction if not solution or was it anyways all just an accident? compare Tom Waits and John Lurie in Down By Law! and if law was not law these sweet ladies would be just going back to their normal lives. Coincidentally united as a musicband they might have called also it We had to instead of Bandits. Which is leaving out those people that did kill with different more complex motives and backgrounds and a movie about them might be more interesting as a story but possibly less sexy. The shown end is unrealistic and oversentimental but considering the other option making it onto the ship waving byebye to fans and police and forming a nice oceancruise entertainment band in red glitterdresses I agree death had to be the only way out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bandits is a German 110minute movie from 1997 so this one has its 20th anniversary this year. Katja von Garnier is the director here and also one of the writers and this is not the only occasion she worked with actress Katja Riemann. But probably the worst at least I hope so. Yes I just wrote writers which means that actually several people worked on this movie and they still did not see all the flaws that are wrong with it. And even if I am generally a bit biased when it comes to Riemann I still can only shake my head at her winning a German Film Award for this film. The entire plot has nothing to do with realism. This refers to the biggest crucial parts and events as well as the details. This is the story of a group of musicians who manage to break out while they are supposed to give a concert. Okay so the police are huge idiots here and they really screwed up but what happens next is even more embarrassing. While on the run the gang turns into successful musicians and they are cheered at by audiences. Why? Why? Why? There are criminals on the run. Oh yes lets buy their records won't we? And the police still can't catch them despite all this. Embarrassing stuff. Needless to say that the music in this film is extremely mediocre from start to finish sometimes weak and this still makes it better than all the rest I guess. Now if they keep getting away from the police they have to be somewhat criminal masterminds right? Nope not at all. Pretty much all of them act like fools on several occasions. Stupid romance plots include a romance story between a hostage and one of the criminals. Think of OitNB Prison Break Vier Minuten etc. and think of everything that could have gone wrong with these movies but didn't. Then you can basically imagine what to expect here. In order to keep audiences especially horny men I guess from seeing all the flaws with this movie they included a graphic sex scene including the not so unattractive Jasmin Tabatabai. Oh yeah the young Nicolette Krebitz' looks are probably by far the best thing about this movie. I am honestly glad she makes films nowadays that are far superior to what we have here. But performancewise nobody stands out at all even if the script certainly did not help anybody here at all. But it is especially embarrassing in the case of Katja Riemann who I consider a quite untalented actress and who built her success and the fact that she still gets cast in lead roles two decades later on garbage films like this one here. No idea what awards bodies were thinking. Overall this film is certainly a contender for worst film of 1997 and also a contender for being among the worst films of the 1990s from everywhere. I highly recommend to stay far far away. Also it proves that the likes of Jaenicke Sawatzki etc. are people who score through recognition value and charisma and definitely not through great range. The crime plot in the center of it all is as crap as everything else in this movie. Nothing makes sense. And sadly it is also overlong with an embarrassing final sequenceperformance. Nothing feels realistic or authentic. Do. Not. Watch.".

Think of OitNB Prison Break Vier Minuten etc. and think of everything that could have gone wrong with these movies but didn't. Then you can basically imagine what to expect here. In order to keep audiences especially horny men I guess from seeing all the flaws with this movie they included a graphic sex scene including the not so unattractive Jasmin Tabatabai. Oh yeah the young Nicolette Krebitz' looks are probably by far the best thing about this movie. I am honestly glad she makes films nowadays that are far superior to what we have here. But performancewise nobody stands out at all even if the script certainly did not help anybody here at all. But it is especially embarrassing in the case of Katja Riemann who I consider a quite untalented actress and who built her success and the fact that she still gets cast in lead roles two decades later on garbage films like this one here. No idea what awards bodies were thinking. Overall this film is certainly a contender for worst film of 1997 and also a contender for being among the worst films of the 1990s from everywhere. I highly recommend to stay far far away. Also it proves that the likes of Jaenicke Sawatzki etc. are people who score through recognition value and charisma and definitely not through great range. The crime plot in the center of it all is as crap as everything else in this movie. Nothing makes sense. And sadly it is also overlong with an embarrassing final sequenceperformance. Nothing feels realistic or authentic. Do. Not. Watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "If I were given a choice as to whether or not all German cinema would be instantly destroyed or not I would probably have to go for it after seeing this movie. Even though it would mean losing Fritz Lang Werner Herzog Wim Wenders etc. it would be worth it. The only reason I got more than thirty seconds into this movie is that I was assigned to watch it for a class. Otherwise I wouldn't have even made it past the opening credits. I know all of this ranting can seem a bit vague and hyperbolic so I figured I would give some specifics as to why this is such a godawful movie. Let me start by saying that the only virtue of this movie is that it is somewhat well shot although the penultimate scene with its shambolic colorization nearly made me reconsider this. On the whole however the film is pretty well shot and looks fairly cinematic. Everything else about this movie is terrible. The actresses themselves may not be terrible but the writing is. The dialogue is unrealistic and clichd. There are many scenes where it doesn't even really make any sense what is going on. The interrogation scene for example which sort of seems like it is setting up the final act of the movie although it turns out not to sort of doesn't really make any sense. Throughout the entire movie there are scenes that are clichd such as the two characters who initially don't get along and and yet still manage to not make very much sense. Don't even get me started on plot holes. The worst part about the writing however is that the movie simply isn't believable at all. Not only are the criminals farcically bad they spent most of the movie evading police who are even worse. Their are many escapes in the movie none of which are even remotely believable. I take it back that probably isn't even the worst part about the writing. The worst part is probably that the characters aren't endearing at all and don't make any sense. The movie tries to rip off some archetypical sort of characters but can't even do that. They can't even get bland 1dimensional characters. That's right this movie has 0dimensional characters. I couldn't even tell who the main character was until the last halfanhour of the movie to be honest I still don't know. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE ENDING. Let's talk about the music. It sucks. For one in pretty much every single one of the endless music scenes it is obvious that the band is not really playing. There is a scene fairly early on of the band playing that clearly shows someone hammering away on the Hammond B3 and yet the song that is playing contains no organ. I'll let it slide if a movie doesn't have incredible attention to detail but it should have attention to something. It seems like this movie must have been made by total coincidence as if the various pages of the script blew in on the wind after being cut from other movies and then someone accidentally nudged the record button on the camera while some average citizens mulled about in front of the lights that had been left behind from a music video shoot done the day before. Basically this movie is terrible. Do not watch it.".

First of all it's about 12 to 15 yearslate.  198587 were the years to make a chick flick based on amusical band of runaway convicts not 1997.   Secondly there isno balance between art and reality.  You've got to have some sortof realism or good humor if you want the audience to sympathizewith the characters.  This movie lacked both.

	schema:headline " You're Invited to Join in the Celebration!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is a celebration of life steeped in tradition family love and just the joy of living and it invites you to come in and participate in that celebration rather than leaving you on the outside looking in as it were merely as an observer.  A film that seemingly welcomes and passionately embraces all that is good and worthwhile in the world My Big Fat Greek Wedding' directed by Joel Zwick will make you laugh and make you cry but most importantly it will make you feel.'  It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that afterwards makes the sky seem bluer your step a bit lighter and a smile easier to come by and when a film can do all of that you know you've come across a bona fide treasure that you're going to hang onto for a long long time in your memory. Toula Portokalos Nia Vardalos is thirty years old lives with her parents in Chicago and works in the family restaurant Dancing Zorbas.'  Every facet of her life is imbued with all things Greek' and by proclamation long since issued by her father Gus Michael Constantine Toula is bound by all that is holy' read  Greek' to marry a Greek live a Greek life and bear many Greek children.  For her to even think of doing otherwise would be unfathomable unthinkable unimaginable and well...'UNGreek.' So it becomes something of a conundrum for Toula when she meets and becomes interested in a man named Ian Miller John Corbett a guy who is decidedly NOT Greek in any way shape or form.  But he asks her out and one thing leads to another and then another but before Toula will allow things to get seriously out of hand meaning serious' she knows she must run up the flag take a deep breath and tell her father.  And for Toula it just may be the hardest thing she's ever had to do in her life.  Ian meanwhile is about to experience culture shock as he is about to be confronted by a family that includes for example twentyseven first cousins something Ian isn't quite used to after all he has two' of his own and they live in another state. The screenplay was written by star Nia Vardalos adapted from her own onewoman show and it fell into capable hands when she turned it over to director Joel Zwick who picks up the rhythms and the sense' of the story without missing a beat.  Falling into step with his star Zwick crafts and delivers a film that is totally immersed in the zest and zeal of living. Under his astute tutelage the viewer becomes a part of Toula's life sharing that grand heritage of which Gus is so proud.  He brings the story and the characters to life with detail and nuance and in such a way that your senses will kick into full throttle.  The images he creates are so vivid and it's such an engaging presentation that the vitality he generates is almost tangible and you can smell the lamb and all of those Greek delicacies cooking in the kitchen.  And Zwick sets it all in motion by establishing a pace that will sweep you along with the story a carousel ride that will keep you involved and smiling all the way to the end.Nia Vardalos certainly captures the essence of all that is Greek' with her story and with her affecting performance as Toula.  This is a young woman you get attached to very quickly there's something of Benny from Circle of Friends' about her as well as Muriel from Muriel's Wedding.'  It's a character your heart goes out to immediately one to whom you wish all good things will come.  There is an introspection to her portrayal that contrasts effectively with her vigorously outgoing environment and it makes her presence all the more dominating and singular.  And it's actually in the reserve Vardalos exhibits in her character that the viewer finds the way inside to Toula's deepest longings and emotions.  Without question this is a complex individual in whom we find not only the strength necessary to maintain autonomy which she manages to do within the greater structure of her family but vulnerability born of the respect she demonstrates toward her father her family and the traditions they so lovingly serve.  It is this very complexity in fact that elicits the necessary empathy of the audience enabling that vital connection between the viewer and Toula.  And Nia Vardalos IS Toula from the ground up and from the inside out. Moreover one would be hard put to discern any distinction whatsoever between the actor and her character as her performance is entirely natural and genuine. As Toula's mother Maria Lainie Kazan is a delight.  The character she creates is totally credible and she's just a joy to watch.  And the same can be said of Andrea Martin's performance as Aunt Voula.  This is a VERY Greek woman who is boisterous overtly selfassured opinionated and dominant and she will win you over in an instant.  It is Maria and Voula that add some real spice to the film and when you add in Gia Carides who plays Nikki to the mix you've got a Greek feast fit for the gods. Of all the actors in this wonderful cast however the one who absolutely steals My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is Michael Constantine who has the role of his career in Gus and without question makes the most of it.  From his overabundance of Greek pride to his many and varied personal peccadilloes like his everpresent bottle of Windex which he is convinced can cure everything from a minor scrape to the common cold he simply gives the performance of a lifetime and if there is any justice in the whole Greek' world Constantine and this film will be duly remembered at Oscar time. It's the magic of the movies.  1010.".

There are so many similarities to my Fiancs family it's almost creepy. For a crasher course to our wedding I told my whole family to watch this movie before they came. After the wedding was all said and done I had so many people from my side of the family came up to me and tell me your RIGHT! It was just like my Big Fat Greek Wedding!!! Especially since we had almost 700 people at our wedding and all we did all night long is dance in circles!!!

	schema:headline " A simple story about a girl in love.";
	schema:reviewBody "My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a very simple funny romance story that would probably be most appreciated by female audiences. Nia Vardalos the film's writer and star is Toula Portokalos a quiet young woman from a zany Greek family. As she explains in the great flashback introduction all her life she has been brought up to be strictly Greek. But the same upbringing also contains some traditional absuridites that she can't understand although her parent's wish that she would adhere to. Toula's upbringing has only allowed her to look forward to one thing at this point in her life get married to a nice Greek boy and have lots of babies.This is not something Toula wants to here and eventually she gains the courage to break out of her introverted shield and gradually change herself into a bold lovely woman. She stops working at her family's resturaunts and starts taking computer classes at the local college which lead her not only to a better appreciation for herself but leads to a job at her aunt's travel agency where she meets Ian Miller Jon Corbet and that is where our story begins.Toula and Ian are in love really very much so. But this troubles Toula's mother and father with her father Michael Constantine being more strict in traditional Greek upbringing than her mother Lanie Kazan when Ian proposes to Toula. For Toula's father it is bad enough that she quit the family business to go to school and everything. But it is simply out of the question for him that she marry a nonGreek. So Toula is torn between the two. This is a movie very much in the spirit of films like Bend it Like Beckham and somewhat like the Joy Luck Club in addressing roles of tradition in future generations of immigrants and the possibility and reason for preservation of such traditions.Of course the film is a very simple movie a simple love story but a funny one nonetheless. We see the contrast between Toula's Greek upbringing and Ian's very quiet conservative family. Everyone was fantastic in this film especially Lainie Kazan as Toula's mom Michael Constantine as her father and the wonderfully hilarious Andrea Martin as Toula's Aunt Voula.I don't know the reason for so many negative reviews for this movie. I would say it was probably the best movie I saw in 2002 and one that I have seen many times since just because it a lovely little and funny story about a girl in love.".

	schema:headline " Big Fat Success.";
	schema:reviewBody "An extremely good little film that shows that smart ideas good writing solid direction likeable characters and an engrossing story will always win out in the end. Nia Vardalos stars as a Greek woman who just seems a bit outofplace in her not always normal life. She is shy reserved and ashamed of her heritage. Some makeup a few college classes stylish clothes and a travel agency job away from her father's restaurant are just the tickets to help her come out of her shell. Soon high school teacher John Corbett is entranced by her and they start a sweet love affair. Naturally she keeps the secret from her parents Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan and the sparks fly when they eventually find out. They want their daughter to marry a Greek man and have lots of children but Vardalos has other plans for her life. Corbett's love knows no bounds though as he makes it clear that she is the one he really wants. My Big Fat Greek Wedding happened due to good timing and lots of luck. Vardalos was struggling when Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson went to see the small play that the film is based upon. Wilson happened to see an advertisement for the show in the newspaper one day the only day Vardalos could afford to run an ad and the rest as they say is history. The film cost very little to make and usually secondrate director Joel Zwick ended up running the show. Vardalos' screenplay Oscarnominated was the catalyst that put the film on the map and kept it there permanently. Most all the extras are real family members of Vardalos and Ian Gomez who plays Corbett's best friend is actually her husband in real life. Easily one of the most successful films of all time financially speaking based upon the bargain basement cost and the astronomical showing at the box office My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a wholesome film that the whole family can enjoy. It is another one of those rare films that feel like it was made during Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1940s. Not quite excellent but dangerously close. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:headline " A movie much better than anticipated";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen many movies in the past year some have been wonderful and some have been downright terrible. My Big Fat Greek Wedding has to be one of the best written and best acted comedies I think I have seen in a long time. While the concept of making a movie about weddings is not unique I believe that those of us who either have gone through planning a wedding or have experiences with family having too much influence in our lives will relate to this movie better than other wedding movies.This movie is about an ordinary rather plain looking thirty something unmarried woman who comes from a large extended Greek family. All Greek women are expected to go to Greek school find a good Greek man marry him and have lots of Greek babies according to the narrator who is also the main character in the movie. This simple premise is what sets us off in almost two hours of raucous humor centered around planning a wedding where a couple coming from completely different backgrounds has to deal with all the external pressures that happen when two people decide to go down the aisle together.This movie has several very heartwarming and somewhat emotional scenes in it so don't expect it is just a funny movie. Acting in this movie on all characters was very well done and very believable. I thought however that the roles of the Grooms Mother and Father were rather flat and two dimensional. This movie reminded me quite a bit of Father of the Bride starring Steve Martin except in this case the writers for Monty Python obtained the script for final treatment. While the writers for Monty Python did not actually write this movie but was instead written by the leading lady there were some moments where it appeared that the humor was drawn right out of a book of British comedy. All in all I felt that the whole movie had a British feel to it.This movie will delight you and leave you with a smile on your face. While the audience in the theater was more of an adult composition I do not remember any nudity or adult language in the entire picture which means this movie is one that the whole family can see together. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who would like a good laugh.".

It turned out that I needed some of the Windex the father of the bride uses for everything to clear my eyes and enjoy the film.Nia Vardalos has written from the heart this story of a crazy Greek family with all the stereotypes in it for us to savor and enjoy what has come out under the firm direction of Joel Zwick. Not only is Ms. Vardalos talented as an actress but she can write quite a story star in her own tale and bring together this cast of loonies and make us believe we are inside these folks' home. Michael Constantine and Lanie Kazan are the parents of the bride and they preside this crazy household in Chicago. Nia Vardalos is the ugly duckling we see at the beginning of the film and she wins John Corbett's heart and disarms him completely. He got her family in the bargain and he's stuck in it for better of for worse. Andrea Martin is very effective as the pushy aunt.All in all it should be seen for the fun of it. This is a funny film very well paced and acted. Please pass the Windex!!".

Ok there are a few funny moments but the characters are very clich and we all had the feeling that we had seen the movie hundreds of times before. There was only one way how we could review it sorry too American and not Greek enough... To me it looked more like some silly moneymaking blockbuster rather the work of an artist with a view and something to say the moral was so plain and childish I felt offended !. Not sure Greek people will appreciate no I'm not Greek. And not sure I even learnt anything about the Greek culture in this ... God what a waste of time and money ...".

My only guess is that it drove people to the theatre who were excited that it was low on curse words and sex.  Which is fine but I wish that they could have added a bit of humor or drama. There has been a lot of crowing about the crass stereotypes in this film to which I can only respond what stereotypes?  These characters are drawn so flimsily that they don't even reach the level of stereotypes.  Michael Constantine playing the supposedly charming and wacky father is colorless except for an obsession with Greek root words and the healing powers of Windex.  Are you laughing yet?  I hope so because that's all you get. But at least Constantine has a couple of defining character traits.  We learn nothing about the other characters except that they are Greek.  Well Greek and obnoxious.  This movie would have us believe that Greek Americans' life revolves entirely around their ethinicity and yet the only defining thing about being Greek is that you sit around and constantly discuss the fact that you are Greek. For contrast we have Corbett's parents who embody some nightmare thumbnail sketch of Waspish stereotype.  Surreally quiet and psychotically uncomfortable they act as if they've never met a mediterranean before.  The exchange of idiocies when the WASP mother tries to explain to the apparently retarded Greek mother that the cake she brought to dinner is a bundt cake is one of the more cringe inducing comedy moments here. Another reviewer here remarked as if it were a good thing that the observations in this movie could be easily applied to any number of ethnic groups.  I wholeheartedly agree and add that all it would take to turn it into My Big Fat Italian Jewish Mexican Puerto Rican Armenian Spanish etc. Wedding would be a quick findreplace command on the screenwriter's laptop. When a movie's highest moment of tension comes from a wedding morning zit a problem solved minutes later by a stick of cover up  you know you're dealing with a limp excuse for a film. I'm not asking for The Graduate here but frankly I can't find a thing about this movie that is worth your time or money.  But apparently America disagrees so this movie made over 200 million bucks and is not being turned into the sitcom it always more or less resembled.  Go figure.".

This is such unintelligent humor that so forced and overdone and unoriginal. And the characters are so coldhearted and miserable but not in a funny wayin a creepy way. And since we're talking about a movie filled with stereotypes I can say that I'd always thought the Mediterranean people for the most part were a warm and inviting people. Not here. The way they treated Ian was so uncomfortable and senseless and just weird. It was yet another film that made white men look weak and like big defenseless dorks. I'm married to a white dude who if my family would have treated him that way he'd say a few choice words and never return and I wouldn't blame him in fact I'd follow him out the door. And I realize that the whole point of the movie is that her family is so involved in her life because they care and blah blah but enough already! It got old and sickening after a while. OK we get it you're closeknit and you fight and bicker because you love each other and that's your Greek culture etc. etc I wanted to puke already. Even Toula wasn't the friendly sweet character I had in mind. Instead she really lacked personality and warmth. You expect to fall in love with and root for the main character especially in a comedy like this but I was halfway through the movie and didn't care whether she was happy in the end or what happened to her. And no one was sitting on the groom's side of the church why? I guess it's comical that white people tend to have smaller andor unsupportive families and less friends than Greeks ?? Not to me. And the way she looked before her makeover? C'mon! Who looks like that? It's not like she was supposed to have a mental disorder or something. Like I said it's forced and unoriginal. It tries way too hard. I kept wondering when is it going to get good? When is it going to get funny? I can't believe that it's a hit.... Actually I can believe it. Movies that appeal to the masses usually suck. Good humor needs to be smart clever and witty. This film and its storyline are none of the above.".

Even Toula wasn't the friendly sweet character I had in mind. Instead she really lacked personality and warmth. You expect to fall in love with and root for the main character especially in a comedy like this but I was halfway through the movie and didn't care whether she was happy in the end or what happened to her. And no one was sitting on the groom's side of the church why? I guess it's comical that white people tend to have smaller andor unsupportive families and less friends than Greeks ?? Not to me. And the way she looked before her makeover? C'mon! Who looks like that? It's not like she was supposed to have a mental disorder or something. Like I said it's forced and unoriginal. It tries way too hard. I kept wondering when is it going to get good? When is it going to get funny? I can't believe that it's a hit.... Actually I can believe it. Movies that appeal to the masses usually suck. Good humor needs to be smart clever and witty. This film and its storyline are none of the above.";

The acting is actually good for what the actors had to work with but that's not saying much.  The script is bad. If you want some examples of what I'm talking about SPOILERS!! In the school scene where Toula asks Ian if they can elope you can almost feel the tension of I have no idea how to say this line.'  They can't put any real emotion behind these very tender and loving words because they're such empty flat characters that emotion can't be imagined. In the scene where Ian tells his friend he won't be Ian's best man it's as though Vardalos couldn't think of anything for either of them to say so she just left the bits and pieces of various conversations in the script and called it a scene. After the dinner with Ian's parents where they showed some kind of character albeit atrociously stereotyped character they say almost NOTHING AT ALL!   Again through the wedding planning the party with Toula's family all of it it's as though Vardalos just couldn't find something for them to say so she left it out!  Now one could see it as realistic that often people are really like that when they're uncomfortable.  But if it's not interesting or funny what's the point of realism?? I could go on.  I'll stop.  I don't mean to bash Ms. Vardalos' skill.  If you're reading this I'm sorry   But the truth is that this movie just isn't good.  It fails as a romance because of poor i.e. missing character development and it fails as a comedy because of poor i.e. missing dialogue. Rating 410".

Everything about it is perfect it's welldirected wellacted beautifully filmed has great music and the script and story are wonderful.Agneiszka Holland does an outstanding job directing this film. Each character is separate and unique each one has little personality quirks that makes it seem real. Just about every scene in the movie includes children animals or both  which must have been a nightmare to coordinate. Ms. Holland pulls it off without a hitch. Everything melds perfectly and we are transported to a distant place and time and fall in love with real human characters. The primary three characters in this story  Mary Lennox Colin Craven and Dickon  are all children played by actors who are around 10 years old. Ordinarily having one child in a movie is difficult enough but again somehow they pull it off. All three kids  especially Kate Maberly  do a fine job of acting and they are quite credible. Kate is simply divine as Mary Lennox and Heydon Prowse was a good counterpoint to her as Colin.The story is touching and charming and I think you'd have to be almost inhuman not to have a tear in your eye by the end of it. I absolutely fell in love with these children and came to care very much about their characters. The secret garden really does seem to be a magical place and I will say no more about it since otherwise that would spoil things and at the end I found myself wishing I could go and visit it firsthand. The accompanying music is wonderful  I find myself humming it for days and days after watching it.In short everything comes together to make this film a masterpiece. It is easily one of the 10 or 12 best movies ever made perhaps the best movie ever made. I love it so much that I went out and bought the DVD of it even though I'd seen it 8 or 10 times already. If you have not seen it I give it my highest possible recommendation. My score 1010.".

The artful rendering of these literary themes are what many directors apparently find most challenging  I'm looking at you Arthur Pennand generally blissfully ignore them compensating by glib insertions extra action or clumsy sentiment. Not so here.Not only is her focus exemplary but the photography is amazing. The interplay of light and dark the time elapse photos of clouds rolling and flowers emerging all set to beautiful music captivate the viewer. The rainy weather was not shunned but used to fullest effect. I can only imagine the discipline it must have taken to wait for the sun to peep out from the clouds and then roll film hoping that the cast can pull off the shot before the light changed and a second take became a long wait. Fortunately all are up to the task and the film the final scene in particular results in a brilliant piece of motion picture art.The 1993 version of The Secret Garden is a must for every family film collection one the parents and kids can enjoy for its sophistication or simply for the great way in which this timeless classic is retold.".

Maggie Smith one of my personal favorite actressess is wonderful as Mrs. Medlock. Others like John Lynch and Andrew Knott add more magic to the production.Hayden Prowse was wonderful as Colin Craven.

Surprisingly enough this is the only movie he's ever been in. I certainly wish he acted more often for he has good talent.8 out of 10";

This movie is virtually perfect in almost every way and I doubt if it will soon be displaced as the definitive version. One aspect of this film which I loved was Andrew Knott as Dickon who ultimately sublimated his love for Mary to help Colin in the grand tradition of the English Hero  the common man. As in the Lord of the Rings it is not a Jedi Knight or a superman or muscleman or gunslinging cowboy who is the hero it is one of the common folks who rises to the occasion when greatness is demanded by the times and situation. As did Sam Gamgee the Hero of the LOTR so does Dickon stand out as an almost mythical personification of love and sacrifice for the good of others with no thought of recompense. This is what I love about classic English novels how the average guy can change the world if he loves it enough. Wonderful stuff.".

As silly as that sounds the movie really got our imaginations going. Of course you grow up and you forget a little bit about the movies that you used to watch as a kid. But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.The recentlyorphaned Mary Lennox travels from her home in India to her uncle Archibald Craven's hundredroom house Misselthwaite Manor. Mary materially spoiled but emotionally neglected by her late parents is rather unpleasant and unhappy in her new surroundings. Martha a Yorkshire girl working as a maid and her brother Dicken a boy who can talk to animals befriend and help her to heal and grow. She discovers her deceased aunt's secret garden which has been locked for ten years and enlists Dickon to help her bring it to life. Hidden away in the gloomy house is Mary's cousin Colin who has been treated all his life like a fragile sickly invalid. This exaggeration has augmented what smaller problems he did have turning him into a demanding shorttempered helpless boy. Mary defying the orders of Mrs Medlock discovers Colin and is taken aback by his disposition but reaches out to him anyway. Soon Colin Mary and Dickon all spend their time in the secret garden. They perform magic and make the garden live again.The Secret Garden is always going to hold a special place in my heart I absolutely adore this film and it brings back so many wonderful memories from my childhood. The children that they found to play Mary Dicken and Colin were absolutely perfect and were great actors actually I'm surprised they didn't move onto bigger things in their careers but they had great chemistry and really brought the movie to life. The settings are gorgeous the garden that the children created was so lovely and reminds me about all the wonderful things that spring brings life. If you haven't seen The Secret Garden I highly recommend that you do it's a very special film that I'm sure you'll fall in love with as well.810".

And unfortunately too many Hollywood child actors are nowadays forced to lower their personal ethics for inappropriate movie roles in our never ending averagingdown of America.The Secret Garden dismisses the need to add token actors of every type a.k.a. Disney's last unbelievable rendering of Annie  TV 1999 race and sexual dysfunction to it's cast. Movies once were special beautiful places where the best actors were chosen for the part and where viewers could easily lose themselves and for a short time become something in their mind's eye that was wonderful and magical. This is such a film. It's cast is well chosen for the story not for current day hypocrisy. The Secret Garden allows viewers to immerse in a world larger than themselves ease and without having to keep saying...now why is THAT person in the movie...or why does THAT person have to keep making obscene gestures or engage in a constant flow of obscene sexual doubleentendres? This movie is pure of heart. It is one of one of Hollywood's finest creations. Kate Mayberly as Mary Lennox is convincing. Her entry into the film is as a 10 year old girl who is catered hand and foot literally bathed and dressed by Indian nannies then ignored by her parents. She grew to feel pampered unloved and unwanted and without the training to even dress herself. This is a sobering cameo to any parent of how not to 'raise' a child.The Secret Garden has been remade many times in books in the theatre in movies...and several reasons for the sudden death of Mary's parents are provided. The manner of their death is utterly unimportant for it is the rest of the movie in which the magic of love and acceptance blossoms and the viewer's anticipation grows as surely as does Mary's own heart and personal demeanor and as a perfect reflection of the new growth of her formerly abandoned and neglected aunt's garden.Kate Mayberly is beautiful. She is an exceptionally talented young actress.My family has enjoyed shedding a few tears along with her character Mary Lennox during the many times we've viewed The Secret Garden and we have learned a bit more about the value of caring...and about the power of love.To anyone considering purchasing The Secret Garden as a family film do it. There are no downsides here no parts where a parent has to cover his child's eyes or ears. The Secret Garden is the perfect family film.".

And the transition from spoiled brat to humble glowing and excited girl was never really evident.

Mrs. Sowerby is totally overlooked a critical role in the story as a healer and the source of Dickon's and Martha's joy of life and Mrs. Medford is made out to be too much of a villain.  The tribal dance does violence to the original story's quest for supernormal help  in the book they sing the Doxology for goodness' sake!  That wouldn't be politically correct now I suppose.

	schema:headline " A messiah who learned how to cry";
	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADNinety years ago Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote the classic book of childhood The Secret Garden unleashing into the world of literature one of the most remarkable characters ever Mary Lennox. Mary is a plainlooking ten year old child who was raised in India. She was all but completely ignored by her selfabsorbed parents and put under the care of ayahs who indulged her in order to keep her from bothering her parents. She had no friends or playmates of her age so she never experienced the give and take of interacting with other children. Thus she grew to the age of ten generally helpless unable to care for herself demanding and lacking in basic social skills. Contrary to some critical opinions Mary isn't so much nastybratty as haughtyarrogant. But she had a seemingly insatiable thirst for learning and the capacity and wisdom to read and understand the ways of her world. And she had a driving will to achieve her goals. She also was able to recognize and appreciate offers of friendship and love from whatever source. SPOILERSConsidering the depth and power given her character by author Burnett in the first half of the story of The Secret Garden it's ironic that with the introduction of Colin Craven her cousin Mary seems to be elbowed out of the way in favor of a bigger emphasis on Colin's story line. Indeed in the original story and most of its movie incarnations she isn't even given the privilege of sharing in the dramatic ending where Colin and his estranged father are at last united. It's especially ironic in light of the fact that it was through Mary's efforts that the garden and its magic were resurrected Colin grew strong and the reconciliation of Colin and his father was enabled. The Secret Garden is not Mary's story however it's the story Mary made possible. SPOILERDirector Agnieszka Holland a devoted admirer of the original novel understood Mary's importance and brought the story around in a full circle to end in the scene where Lord Craven Colin's father gives Mary her deserved recognition. You brought us back to life Mary he tells her. So this movie starts with an arrogant child throwing her name at you not caring whether you like her or not and it ends with a messiah who learned how to cry.The whole cast was great especially the children Heydon Prowse Colin and Andrew Knott Dickon and especially especially Kate Maberly who played Mary with such power and depth. Also recognition should go to Maggie Smith as the intimidating Mrs. Medlock John Lynch as Colin's somber bereft father Lord Craven and to Laura Crossley for her heartwarming portrayal of the bright sensitive humble Martha.".

When I saw the movie for the first time I was 14 and I was really astonished how she could make me identify with Mary Lennox a 10yearold girl from the beginning at the century in a story line no one would give a damn about in our days. It has been an experience of its own since. Now I'm 18 and probably more cynical so it has lost some of its magic to me but I still like to try to get enchanted and I would urge everyone to ... well ... open his mind. It's a children's movie alright but more important it is just perfectly done!Mrs. Medlock Mary Lennox's adversary if you want so is played by the excellent Maggie Smith. She rules the castle of Mary's tragic uncle where she has to live. As if the castle weren't already a very eerie and uncomfortable place you feel it under her orders it becomes some kind of nuthouse as she's jerking around everybody  giving the movie very funny and very weird moments. It's unfair how she treats Mary and just plain crazy what she does to Colin Mary's cousin. But she's not really evil not a villainess but she'll show us that she has a heart. I appreciate this attitude very much how people are never really evil only a bit sickened.All characters and actors are really fine but I want to lose a few more words about Mary Lennox. It's an extremely wellwritten character for a child and this allows Kate Maberly to carry the movie make us want to accompany her. Originally she actually is egotistic but maybe only thus she can find her way and make things right. You'll find her cheeky you'll like her and you'll understand her.There is much more to say about the picturesque garden music friendships attitudes and so forth... I'll leave it with my above feelings and thoughts. If you know the movie you'd find that I'm ignoring pretty muchBecause I'm cynical it doesn't make the 10 so 9 out of 10 then!".

It's as if the filmmaker thought people couldn't understand the subtleties of the actual story and had to hit us over the head with it. Obnoxious!One example is that instead of the lovely magic that Colin works on his own health by telling himself over and over that he will get well and by believing it and visualizing it the magic is portrayed as a weird voodoo thing in the movie. This is the same problem with the Anne of Green Gables movies. This book was published at the same time and the dreamy delicate sweetness of the book is gone in the movie version. It's as though the way of seeing the world in the early nineteen hundreds is impossible to bring to the screen at least in children's movies. I don't believe it is impossible but the filmmakers seem to have believed that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I simply adore this movie. I can watch it over and over and never grow tired. It's simply stunning. Mary Lennox is an orphan who must stay with her cold and emotionally unattached uncle in his expansive manor. Here she keeps to herself and finds an old garden and brings it back to life with the help of the staff and a young boy named Dicken. She comes to meet her cousin the lil brat Colin and teaches him to walk again despite being told he's unable to. The garden is apparently magical but in a realistic way. There's no fairy dust or other such nonsense. It's just allowing people to believe in themselves and be happy. The music is touching as are the relationships of the characters. Colin wanting to marry her despite their 1st cousin status was a little too much for me but didn't cause a break in the movie. I wished they had shown what she looked like as a grown up instead of avoiding her face but I guess that's to keep her forever young in our minds. The mean maid whose name i forget she was in Sister Act provided a challenge to Mary but nothing she couldn't handle and eventually won her over. Mary was a royal brat at first but only cuz she didn't know how else to be since her parents were selfinvolved. I was glad to see her come out of it. Dicken was such a cool kid I loved him a lot. He was smart without having to go to school for it and was just loveable and helpful. In other versions he and Mary were supposed to get together but he died in some war and she took up with Colin. I really liked him though. Colin was a sicly kid who they constantly fussed over and he was snotty to show for it. He calmed down a little too but could still be a royal pain. He was temperamental and that was annoying but that was his character. The father Lord Craven was only emotionally unattached because his wife died in childbirth and he thought his son wasn't able to be healthy and he would just run away. How English of him lol. The garden was absolutely beautiful and gorgeous. Made you wanna be a kid again and just frolick around in it. All the animals and plants were inviting. It seemed simplistic and a good place to be. Even though Mary was young she could still make a difference to herself and others and that's what makes the movie special and timeless.".

With all great movies there are a few copycatsI won't mention any names....Little Princess! but this movie is very original in its own right. The acting is superb by everyone but especially the boy who plays Colin MaryKate Maberly should also not be overlooked. The change of seasons and the whole feeling driedup flowers swimming in the porcelain sink with twin ivory elephants on an oak dresser gives you is quite indescribable.      This is for sure a great kid's movie but the profoundness of its sheer elegance and eerie beauty can only be truly appreciated by older viewers. When I say older I mean from 13 and up! If you've ever seen the movie Legend the floralbackground scenes create the same look as Secret Garden.      SPOILER  WARNING   SPOILER  WARNING One note the magic scene to me seemed eerie but not necessarily out of context. This was their world a world that had no boundaries. They were children and knew they could create whatever colors they wanted wherever they wanted with beautiful flowers. So the fact that Mary was from exotic India and that Colin has never seen his dad and was desperate the magic scene was a welcomed idea for them...an honest attempt in the story to delve into what would kids do? scenarios....   What I find interesting about this brief but engaging magic insert 1It is a metaphor for international respect. Throughout the whole movie Mary is trying to urge Colin to be openminded but he thinks all her India stories are stupid. The fact that Colin was the one chanting in the end and that the magic actually worked shows a change of heart in him for foreign things and 2 The fact that this garden was so beautiful it hardly looked real was accented by this magic scene. The garden WAS real but perhaps there was some magic involved to make it so enchanting. It just helps you think in more supernatural termsto make it more engaging than just a 19th century story in England about a girl who can plant seeds in a garden.

I was surprised at the rudeness that Mary began with and continued to use in her attitude towards adults in the household. She and Colin were rude to Mrs. Medlock and other adults who served them. And the magic scene in which the children used a circling chanting ceremony to summon Colin's father back had a really sinister tone. There was a definite defiance in the way the children used this magic in which there is nothing of the sort in the original book.When I read the book which is an important and wonderful story I realized my misgivings about this movie version were correct. The book was about children growing up healthy unspoiled wellloved and full of faith. In this movie the lessons of the book The Secret Garden are subtly twisted and manipulated into an angry rebellious message that is a very different sort of story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie to death because it is action action action action in a Rambo  Cobra style. You have explosions shotguns the same models that was used in Terminator 2 Judgment Day and Hard Boiled grenades automatic weapons hand guns you have it all. Billy Judge Reinhold with M72 LAW Rocket Launcher fires and hits the truck fleeing that explodes badas action sequence ever! You have high explosions. Axel Eddie Murphy throws 2 grenades in the back of the truck and explodes. You have a car that explodes badass action sequence. The shootout on Dent's oil field is one of the best action sequences in the movie ever.Everything is in this movie that works. Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold work so good together they are so likable team. They both run together with guns in their hands they were both athletic. John Ashton as John Taggart is also back from the first movie. You have Brigitte Nielsen from Cobra 1986 yes she is in this movie right after Cobra she went to make this movie she played Karla Fry one of the main villains and she really did fine job. Jrgen Prochnow is Maxwell Dent he was memorable villain in this movie. Not much better than Steven Berkoff but really good and decent villain.Eddie Murphy Judge Reinhold and John Ashton worked all there together fine. I love the team work they are great to watch them together. I love the bond and the friendship between those three. In Billy's apartment you see Rambo First Blood Part II poster and in his bed room in which Axel call's his friend Jeffrey Paul Reiser he looks at Cobra 1986 poster. So Billy was a huge Stallone fan like me John Rambo and Marion Cobra Cobretti. Ronny Cox from the first movie RoboCop and Total Recall also returns with his character Andrew Bogomil for this sequel he has a small role but still decent I love him in this movie.Tony Scott R.I.P. directed this movie fine and perfectly Eddie Murphy co wrote the story for his character Axel Foley. You have Hugh Heffner mansions. You have wonderful music score from Harold Faltermeyer who returns for this sequel. You have beautiful soundtracks like Shakedown by Bob Seger Hold On by Corey Hart Better Way by James Ingram and more.The story everyone knows what is about Axel Foley Eddie Murphy returns to Beverly Hills when a friend and fellow cop is shot during a serial crime spree in the city.in my opinion this sequel is an excellent sequel my childhood film and I enjoy I It is my second personal favorite Eddie Murphy action film. I enjoy and love the first movie way much more than the sequel.I wish we could got a proper Bluray a better remastered restoration like we got for the Rambo movies Die Hard and like US did with the first Beverly Hills Cop movie. My Bluray disc and DVD has grain between and I really wish for a better picture quality and better audio the first one is remastered this sequel isn't. You can only buy this film on Bluray in the UK but not in the US.Beverly Hills Cop II 1987 the sequel is entertaining action film mixed with comedy like the first one it has less humor and more action which I appreciate more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beverly Hills Cop II is definitely my all time favorite Action comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop 1984 will always be the best and my all time favorite film that I love to death. That is why I just love the sequel much more and I have always enjoyed this film much better than the original film I did. Here Axel FoleyBilly Rosewood and John Taggart works as a team than they did in the first film. This time Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help Taggart and Rosewood investigate Chief Bogomil's nearfatal shooting and the series of strange robberies alphabet crimes associated with it. Axel Foley comes back which he reunites with Detective Billy Rosewood and Detective Sergeant John Taggart.I love the Action sequences they are all great  humor  suspense  tongue in cheek shoot'em up and is developed in agility and movement and for that reason is amusing. They are all great there isn't any cgi in it. Whole cast did a great job. It is my all time favorite sequel to the first film. I seriously I love this film to death and I always have enjoyed so much. I still don't get it why all the hate for this film? The third film was really the worst in the series but I still like it and I will still watch it. Eddie Murphy did a great job as a Detroit detective Axel Foley he did acted very well. Yes he was shouting one everyone I saw that but there are things in the film that people didn't noticed. After his friend Captain Andrew Bogomil was shot he didn't hesitate to come to Beverly Hills and helping him out. He cared more about his friend than anyone else did. He hustle Maxwell Dent accountant Sidney Bernstein for 200 but he later donated the money for Beverly Hills homeless people. He could spend the money but he donated. After he took Billy's vitamins and he bluff out the secretary in Beverly Hills Gun Club for money and he throw the vitamins away. he gave the money back to Billy for the vitamins he throw away! I thought that was very nice. Judge Reinhold as Detective Billy Rosewood did a wonderful job and a support in the main cast along side Axel Foley. He was crazy with guns which I love it. We see poster from Stallone's Cobra and Rambo First Blood Part II in Billy's apartment. I love how he was driving the car and caring so much guns with him. He had a turtle in his apartment awesome. John Ashton as Detective Sergeant John Taggart did a pretty good job as detective helping and solving a Alphabet crime he was awesome. Brigitte Nielsen as Karla Fry did a wonderful job as villainies and it was one of her best roles I have ever seen. Jrgen Prochnow as Maxwell Dent was fantastic villain much better than Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks in the first movie did. Dean Stockwell as Charles Chip Cain did a fantastic job as Dent henchman. Allen Garfield as Chief Harold Lutz was fantastic he was so load and funny I was keep laughing at his performance. The Last and at least the best small role that had was Ronny Cox I seriously I love him in this film. He doesn't do much but his still a good as Andrew Bogomil we finally found out that he has a daughter Jan and she is very beautiful. There are other faces in this film like are Hugh Hefner who plays himself Chris Rock has a small cameo in it.Gilbert Hill as Inspector G. Douglas Todd and Paul Reiser as Detective Jeffrey Friedman also return from the first film and they also do have a few scenes in the film.In the original movie they were only in the beginning of the film than they were cut off from the rest of the film. I seriously think Tony Scott did a wonderful job filming this decent awesome Action Comedy flick. Beverly Hills Cop II is a 1987 action comedy film starring Eddie Murphy and directed by Tony Scott. It is the sequel to the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop and the second installment in the Beverly Hills Cop series.Although it made less money than the original Beverly Hills Cop and received mixed reviews from critics the film was still a box office success making 153665036 domestically.I love this film to death!!! I love this film to death! it will always stay in my heart! I love the shooting action car chases playboy girls everything in this film. I love Eddie Murphy! I also love the main theme for Axel Foley from Harold Faltermeyer and songs a Better Way  James IngramShakedown  Bob Seger and Hold On by Corey Hart.".

	schema:headline " Decent enough 'fun' flick";
	schema:reviewBody "The original Beverley Hills Cop is one of those films that remains a cult classic because of the fact that it's such a product of the time it was made. This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel made three years later and although part two like many sequels never quite manages that same verve as the original film  it still offers a good time and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment and who didn't? will probably have a good time with this sequel too. All the main players from the original film have been rounded up once again with Eddie Murphy heading a capable ensemble cast lots of wisecracks and some gratuitously over the top action sequences. The plot is as you would expect superfluous to the style of the film and much of the movie is simply tailored around it but anyway it follows maverick copper Axel Foley and his two California police cronies as they are pulled into a case known as the 'alphabet murders' which involves a robbery a tall blonde woman and a gun shop owner.I've got to say that Eddie Murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film. While they were still over the top they were at least sort of believable. Here however Murphy goes massively over the top and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw. Anyway Murphy obviously enjoys himself and if you can get by the complete lack of logic you probably will too. True to style the action is completely over the top too with several ridiculous sequences combining to make the movie the entertaining blockbuster that it is. The film lacks any kind of themes or substance meaning that it will both not please serious film fans and that this reviewer is running out of steam but I will say that this movie does have a point to make and that is simply entertaining it's audience. It may be completely silly illogical fun but some movies need to be there just to entertain and this is one of those. I wouldn't recommend sticking this movie at the top of any must see lists or going into with huge expectations but it's a good time that's for sure.".

All the main players from the original film have been rounded up once again with Eddie Murphy heading a capable ensemble cast lots of wisecracks and some gratuitously over the top action sequences. The plot is as you would expect superfluous to the style of the film and much of the movie is simply tailored around it but anyway it follows maverick copper Axel Foley and his two California police cronies as they are pulled into a case known as the 'alphabet murders' which involves a robbery a tall blonde woman and a gun shop owner.I've got to say that Eddie Murphy's wisecracks were a lot funnier in the first film. While they were still over the top they were at least sort of believable. Here however Murphy goes massively over the top and it's hard to imagine how anyone that obnoxious doesn't end up with a cracked jaw. Anyway Murphy obviously enjoys himself and if you can get by the complete lack of logic you probably will too. True to style the action is completely over the top too with several ridiculous sequences combining to make the movie the entertaining blockbuster that it is. The film lacks any kind of themes or substance meaning that it will both not please serious film fans and that this reviewer is running out of steam but I will say that this movie does have a point to make and that is simply entertaining it's audience. It may be completely silly illogical fun but some movies need to be there just to entertain and this is one of those. I wouldn't recommend sticking this movie at the top of any must see lists or going into with huge expectations but it's a good time that's for sure.";

Things are made worse when you realize that NO ONE could ever get away with the things Murphy does here.  Only in his little world he has created for himself. Nobody does themselves any favors by appearing in this movie.  And the cameos by people with talent Reiser Chris Rock Gilbert Gottfried are so short that you expect Murphy felt himself being upstaged and cut them himself.  Hey it could happen.  And there is SO much misogyny running through this flick that you expect Gloria Steinem could use this whole film as an indictment against Hollywood in general.  And WIN.What a waste.  The only good scene is the obviously improvised scene where Murphy introduces himself as Johnny Wishbone from the Island of St. Croix. And that's about it.

Come I know i must be taking this film just a bit too seriously but there can't be anyone out there who finds awful and insulting one liners like this funny can there? Ultimately between the distractions of the odd breast and an appearance by Hugh Hefner an engaging storyline fails to emerge and the viewer is left with the infamous theme tune stuck in hisher head.";

If you want there is much to be said about the execution of the movie or about the lack of a storyline but surely with a cast like Jurgen Prochnow Adriano was not perfect Brigitte Nielsen depicting the quintessential broadshoulderd eighties woman and the notacareintheworld humor of Eddy Murphy who really needs a truly compelling story? There are lots of other movies way better equipped to fulfill that particular need. BHCII isn't one of them nor does it pretend to be.

To see Danish Brigitte Nielsen in a big budget movie was also some sort of weird attraction to me at the time and I thought that I could at least have some fun seeing some banter between her and Murphy but the expectation was far more attractive than actually seeing it. They do share scenes but there are only lame suggestive remarks from Murphy and Nielsen's character is so devoid of humour that you have a nagging suspicion that she was only cast as some sort of deal with Stallone Nielsen's hubby at the time since he was to star in the first movie. There is a poster of his Cobra character to further heighten the suspicion.The scenes mostly take place in smokefilled rooms and you can hardly see any faces clearly. The main villain played by Jrgen Prochnow is such a anonymous character that you wonder why he even took the role. Was it because being in an Eddie Murphy film was so popular at the time that you just had to do it? The three Beverly Hills cops also reprise their roles here but the Lieutenant now promoted to Captain only has a couple of scenes and it is really totally unbelievable that Murphy's character and the Captain are discussing going on a fishing trip could you even picture Murphy with a fishing rod? So what we have is slambang action scenes with wisecracks that mostly fall flat and I almost forgot the totally annoying cameo by Gilbert Gottfried one of Murphy's fellow SNL players as an accountant named Sidney Bernstein. Take this as a warning Expect extreme agony through most of the running time and please do not wait to go to the bathroom if you are watching at the same time it is not worth the wait.".

	schema:reviewBody "Long ago when Eddie Murphy was the biggest star in Hollywood Beverly Hills Cop 2 was the most anticipated film of 1987. Movies like Trading Places and 48 Hours made Murphy famous. But Axel Foley made him a superstar. Impressed by Top Gun even though it's a truly awful film Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer brought Tony Scott on board to direct. What they forgot to do was polish the script.Foley returns to Beverly Hills to help solve 'The Alphabet Crimes' after his old pal Lt. Bogomil is gunned down in the street. With Taggart and Rosewood in tow now actually doing police work instead of standing by Axel uncovers a seriously convoluted conspiracy.The story should have taken a back seat to allow Murphy to work over the massive holes in the plot with his distracting wisecracks. I won't lie to you there are some utterly horrible contrivances in BHC2 Bogomil's daughter digging up dirt at the insurance company she just happens to work at is honestly the most obnoxious movie coincidence of all time but you'll just have to suffer them.This might have been easy to overlook but Tony Scott still finding his feet as a director and his editors turn a great deal of the film into an incomprehensible mess. Some of the continuity errors are just baffling where did Rosewood get the coffee cup from at the night club crash scene? and it makes the action quite hard to follow.However Tony Scott's highly visual style of filmmaking is far more suiting to this kind of environment. The wealth and decadence of late 80s California is all over this movie and it's the only aspect where it improves on the original. I doubt the latter day Scott would make the movie this way but it's definitely the best looking of the trilogy. It's also the only one to be shot in the 2.351 aspect ratio however it's Super35 instead of the superior anamorphic Panavision format.".

Here we even have sexy blonde bimbos going with a guy just because he has a red sports car and giggling like Marilyn Monroe while giving him the sexy eye constantly.And random shots of girls dancing topless on poleslooking like they'd rather be elsewhere. Here Eddie even called one woman bitch while talking to other males about her not the bitch that implies she was horrible just bitch as in a name some men call the objects that are women in the last movie they were chicks and other things. The pole stripper looked angry too like Eddie's character seems to be through this whole movie but men wouldn't notice since they were looking elsewhere maybe Eddie didn't want to be there either which would explain his acting through this movie. And just for no reason we have the Playboy mansion involved.The rapid scene changes that cut out or abruptly ended dialog got boring too. There is one memorable scene where Eddie's character makes a bet that a cash exchange will be the next place robbed after someone else told him about the place and they had a computer with the location on it  duh and then he didn't even finish the sentence and it was cut to the next scene. Seems they just added bits where Eddie's character would be the one man hero of the piece guessing where crimes would happen next etc and then rushed to show us he was right. Or maybe they just edited bits because with all the tit conversations they went overtime and had to get rid of some parts.All the people shooting in this movie are so bad  the hit man who shoots at the ground as Axel runs away and the police who shoot out car lights. Axel couldn't hit a person in a car that wasn't moving but coincidentally hit all the targets at the shooting place and hit people when it suit the ridiculous plot.The first time Axel laughs the Axel laugh in the movie is like a setup also because there's staged silence and then the horrible laugh that anyone can fake. As if we were being rewarded for waiting by being given the token signature laugh by our hero. Other times when he laughed in the movie he would laugh normally and then go back to that laugh again as if someone else told him he swayed from the path of crazy fake laugh central. I think Eddie Murphy just phoned this one in and his wooden acting inappropriate yelling and inappropriate facial expressions for emotions show it. I guess he got paid either way and that is all that mattered.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Beverly Hills Cop franchise was in some ways like the Smokey and The Bandit series. They both had good original films then each sequel was geometrically worse than the film it followed. Beverly Hills Cop II had potential. Eddie Murphy was at the height of his career. The important costars were mostly back. Simpson and Bruckheimer were on board as producers. Tony Scott was a hot new director... but somehow it just doesn't quite gel. Maybe Scott was a bad choice. Think of how easily the original Beverly Hills Cop movie flowed between action and comedy. Martin Brest understood how to do this. Midnight Run was another fine example. But Scott didn't get this genre right until later on with films like The Last Boy Scout and True Romance. Good screenwriters also helped those efforts. But Cop II?? Overall its just too loud fast and doesn't let either its stars or audience up for air. The villains are poorly cast and end up coming off as pretty generic. Murphy's reason for being out in L.A. is a bit more credible this time but its poorly set up. Get this Murphy is watching TV back in Detroit and on the local news he hears about his police lieutenant buddy Cox getting shot in L.A.. Pretty slow news day in the Motor City I guess. Detroit certainly has enough of its own shootings to cover on the news. Cox was only wounded too! Couldn't they just have had his daughter call Murphy and that would be enough?? Once Murphy gets out to California he meets up with old pals Ashton and Reinhold. The group shares some funny moments between numerous car chases and shootouts. But too often it seems like everyone is in a big damned hurry. Most of Murphy's dialog sounds completely adlibbed and the timing always seems off. He almost seems to be shouting in every scene just to make his character heard over all the set pieces and commotion. The plot involving the alphabet bandit is little more than arbitrary. And Hugh Heffner comes off as being the jerk he is. Not a great picture. But better than part III. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

The head of the Bazinni family is Pop Giancarlo Giannini and Contessa Talia Shire and the heir apparent is Frank Christian Boucher who is a fine pyrotechnician but is unfaithful to his nonItalian wife Val Bridget Fonda. As the story opens Frank is perfecting the 'blue' firework and while working he is distracted by his latest lady conquest who diverts his attention causing the whole Bazinni Fireworks Plant to literally blow up. Though the family is devastated at Frank's death Pop looks for the next head of the company to replace Frank and at the wake the Zito family Lady Zito Anna Maria Alberghetti looking terrific! inserts her son Joey Anthony DeSando into an evilplanned courtship of the newly widowed Val in hopes of overtaking the Bazinni business.Meanwhile in Naples Italy we meet Giovanni Bazinni Stanley Tucci in fine form as a comedian! a cousin to the American Bazinnis and a poor caf musician unlucky in love and life. He repeatedly attempts suicide but each attempt is comically thwarted. His passion is for Maria Jo Champa a gold digger slut who dismisses Giovanni's affections with cold harshness. News of the Bazinni disaster in America arrives and Giovanni is sent to New Jersey to inherit the fireworks business. Once in New Jersey in flounders around the language and the business is attracted to Val and to her son Bobby Alexander Milani and is adored by the Bazinni clan. In time Giovanni's good intentions often backfire ! and the politics between the Bazinnis and the Zitos collide. The resolution of the story proves that honesty and family ties and creative perseverance result in happy endings.The 'Italian gioio' created by this fine cast is infectious and each of the characters adds to the recipe with style. Tucci is in top form as are Giannini Fonda and Alberghetti. They make this rather slight script worth believing never coming across as imitating but as embodying their roles. The frequent use of fireworks is joyous and well done and adds to the sparkle of the film. Not a great movie but certainly a solid one for a tender summer night's entertainment.Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Truly lovely funny and sweet as Bridget Fonda's last film she is great and so so beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "In New Jersey there are two wellestablished fireworks manufacturers. Family Bazzini led by Pops Giancarlo Giannini concocts many innovative designs and has the whole family including his wife Contessa Talia Shire working in their large shop. The other folks the Zitos are helmed by Tough Mama Anna Maria Alberghetti and a bevy of sons. Yet the Zitos are always out to buy or steal recipes from the Bazzinni's because they recognize that Pops is a superior inventor. Also their financial position becomes more precarious when Pops Jr dies in a tragic accident at the shop while having a clandestine affair. His widow Val Bridget Fonda blonde and smart is not Italian like the rest but totally committed to the family. Her only child Bobby refuses to speak after his dad's death. Aha Mama Zito sensing an opportunity sends one of her sons to try and get Val out on a date and perhaps get married in time. Yet other things may throw her off kilter. Pops still grieving and angry at this lost son writes to his family back in Italy and begs for a creative cousin to come take his child's place. This Giovanni Stanley Tucci thwarted in love has attempted clumsy suicide after suicide with no luck. A strolling cafe violinist he seizes on this new invitation to change his life. Once installed in family Bazzini its obvious that Giovanni has eyes immediately for Val and that he may be able to bring young Bobby out of his traumatic silence. More importantly with the Zitos breathing down their necks can Giovanni provide the spark needed to invent the best fireworks in the region? This lovely sweet and funny film is a total treat. Yes there may be some stereotypes of Italian Americans involved but weren't there some in other movies such as Moonstruck? The cast is wonderful too with Tucci transforming himself into a bumbling Italian while its so fabulous to see Giannini Shire and Alberghetti on screen. Most lovely of all is Fonda who made this movie her last. She looks so beautiful as the blonde surrounded by brunettes and she gives a most touching and strong performance. In addition the scenery costumes lively script and direction provide a most enjoyable film experience. Want to add a bit of fireworks to your life some future evening? Get The Whole Shebang and sparks will light up your sky.".

Bridget Fonda's role was less successful. Giancarlo Giannini's performance as the family father is superb. He is fascinating to watch. The style of the story and direction has a European relaxed attitude which is a refreshing change from so many overdone Hollywood formula efforts. It's not deep and its more visual than thoughtful but the spirit is right. The soundtrack is a fun mix of 50's style Italian oldies and make you want to join in with a big glass of red wine.

	schema:reviewBody "Not everyone will love Last Days. Nonetheless it concludes a minimalist trilogy that does more to build Gus Van Sant's cred as a serious and original filmmaker than anything since Drugstore Cowboy and My Own Private Idaho. And in its way it's every bit as good as its predecessors Gerry and Elephant and like them is HBOsponsored and exquisitely filmed in a boxlike and claustrophobic small format. The irony is that this careermaking role for the young Michael Pitt that Last Days contains is one in which he only mumbles and hardly speaks. But he embodies and lives and becomes his role as few actors you will see this year have done. He goes to a dangerous and disturbing place. River Phoenix might have taken the part but maybe it's a good thing for him he never did.Pitt channels the dying spirit of Kurt Cobain as he was isolated in a big house avoided by people there and avoiding them and almost everyone who came looking or called. Once he picks up the phone when his producer is calling and he listens but never speaks. Blake Pitt's character's name is a shaky peripatetic Howard Hughes who goes native in the first sequence wandering in a daze walking into the woods bathing in a river spending the night by a bonfire of sticks. The mumbling is eerie it's eavesdropping without insight for us. As he returns to the house stumbles about prepares makeshift meals in the kitchen puts on a dress and brandishes a shotgun the lack of human interaction brings home as no dialoguewritten scenes ever could how isolated and mad he has become.Since Last Days is largely a mood piece  a splendidly original dreamlike one  setting is crucial and the old stone house with its crumbling paintpeeling walls and mess and sound equipment and instruments and paintings is a major player so well represented in the elegant original cinematography of Harris Sayides that it resembles no place else you've ever been. There are three or four other people in the house  the action's so chaotic and haphazard you may not quite know who or how many. One's clearly Asia Asia Argento and she's sleeping with Scott Scott Green and there's Luke Lucas Haas tall and gangly in Cokebottle glasses. Blake sneaks up on Asia and Scott with a shotgun when they're in bed together sleeping. Typically nothing happens. He doesn't shoot and they don't notice him. They and other people go out to and return from nightly revels. Blake is just there.As in Elephant Van Sant's approach is neutral. He does not analyze or explain or judge and the actors are free to improvise and be themselves. Blake's respected because it's his house but he's also a kook. Random visitors who're let inside are grotesque and comic first it's dorky but cute twin Mormon Elders then a large wellspoken black man selling a renewal of a Yellow Pages ad from the year before. How's your day been so far? he asks as an opener. Uh.it's another day. mumbles Blake. He's cooperative in a rote sort of way but there's little indication he knows what he's talking about. There's a detective and a young man who once knew Blake who escapes them and other people by running outside to the woods again. These two are neither sinister nor funny they just are. They're just interlopers like everybody else into Blake's lost world.The method in this trilogy has in common that it requires quiet acceptance of the proceedings that if you give yourself up to its sometimes real time sequences especially in Gerry where Van Sant says they're influenced by Hungarian filmmaker Bla Tarr they're hypnotic and special and if you don't they're just irritating and boring. The experience requires a lot from the viewer. It's hard to describe a movie in which little happens. Nothing turns out to be quite a lot and you might remember that James Joyce wrote a long detailed novel about the events in the life of a little man in a single day in Dublin. It's certainly important that Pitt is deeply in character. If his acting were mannered or theatrical or unfelt nothing would work. When he finally sings one song a plangent cry of despair with the refrain It's a long lonely journey from death to birth it's very Cobain but Pitt's own song and passionate exciting performance.There's a kind of climax here but there's nobody but us to witness it. Luke and Scott are up in bed with each other. As in Elephant several sequences repeat. Blake seems to be dying repeatedly as Asia stumbles upon him lying on the floor and he seems to nod out though you never see him do drugs and maybe it's just the after effect of them from long before. Finally he's gone. We don't see him do that either. His soul quietly climbs naked up out of his supine body like a Duane Michals photo. Then there's all the police the ambulance and the other inhabitants sneak off as Blake did. It's all a pageant. I felt right at home in it remembering Oregon Washington the hippie days of the Sixties it was there for me. I know it was Grunge Rock and Kurt Cobain to whom this film is dedicated died in 1994 at 26. The point is that it feels real. But its relation to real events is tangential. And if you give yourself to it and take it in its own context it's a wonderful film a beautiful funnysad experience of doomeddamned youth and a deeply felt meditation on isolation and death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nirvana were big around about the time I was in my teens so I do have a certain amount of cultural involvement in his suicide. By this I'm not claiming anything special just saying that it was an event I remember from the time rather than since. As such I was quite interested in seeing this film although I did think it would be detailed than it was. Instead it is literally Blake's last days in a remote house with a group of friends. We see him in a state of isolation falling deeper into whatever it is that is eating at him from the inside out. Van Sant has drawn this fall out over 90 minutes where lets be honest not a great deal actually happens.To some viewers this has given the film a tragic and haunting quality that has produced a lot of insight into the man Blake. I am not one of those viewers. It wasn't that I was waiting for the film to do a lot of work for me or spoonfeed me emotions but I did need more than what was delivered and I confess that the film bored me intensely at some points. Van Sant has written these last days and based them on Kurt Cobain but I would have liked him to have imagined a bit more detail in his character and perhaps done more than delivered some stroppy teenager silently moping around the place until the inevitable happens and even that is done in a very low key way. It is hard to fault the intimate nature of Van Sant's filming but this is very different from getting into the character and actually benefiting from this degree of perceived intimacy.Pitt does as he is told and spends most of the film looking through his hair in a sort of creative and tragic way. Without any dialogue to speak of sorry this is all he can really do and I found it totally unconvincing and uninteresting  which is a pretty big failing given that he is supposed to be the heart of the film and the reason we have all come along. The rest of the cast are fairly unimportant and it says a lot that the only one that held my interest was Ricky Jay  but that was only because he was Ricky Jay.Perhaps this will really touch major fans of Cobain but it did nothing for me at all. Silent and surprisingly dull this badly needed depth and insight as well as a serious and respectful tone.".

By this I'm not claiming anything special just saying that it was an event I remember from the time rather than since. As such I was quite interested in seeing this film although I did think it would be detailed than it was. Instead it is literally Blake's last days in a remote house with a group of friends. We see him in a state of isolation falling deeper into whatever it is that is eating at him from the inside out. Van Sant has drawn this fall out over 90 minutes where lets be honest not a great deal actually happens.To some viewers this has given the film a tragic and haunting quality that has produced a lot of insight into the man Blake. I am not one of those viewers. It wasn't that I was waiting for the film to do a lot of work for me or spoonfeed me emotions but I did need more than what was delivered and I confess that the film bored me intensely at some points. Van Sant has written these last days and based them on Kurt Cobain but I would have liked him to have imagined a bit more detail in his character and perhaps done more than delivered some stroppy teenager silently moping around the place until the inevitable happens and even that is done in a very low key way. It is hard to fault the intimate nature of Van Sant's filming but this is very different from getting into the character and actually benefiting from this degree of perceived intimacy.Pitt does as he is told and spends most of the film looking through his hair in a sort of creative and tragic way. Without any dialogue to speak of sorry this is all he can really do and I found it totally unconvincing and uninteresting  which is a pretty big failing given that he is supposed to be the heart of the film and the reason we have all come along. The rest of the cast are fairly unimportant and it says a lot that the only one that held my interest was Ricky Jay  but that was only because he was Ricky Jay.Perhaps this will really touch major fans of Cobain but it did nothing for me at all. Silent and surprisingly dull this badly needed depth and insight as well as a serious and respectful tone.";

	schema:reviewBody "Last days This is the final instalment of Gus van sant's trilogy of the disenfranchised and the alienated human condition. It began with 'Gerry' dealing with two guys trapped in a desert with no way of finding civilisation again and continued with 'elephant' dealing loosely with the columbine school killings. Last days is loosely based on the life of Kurt Cobain the late nirvana singer. Last days is really gelephant a mix of the first two films. Similar themes like repetition and the same story told from different characters perspectives are lifted straight out of elephant and the endless hopeless tracking shots of despair are taken out of Gerry. Here the main character Blake is lost unlike the two central characters in Gerry who are lost in the desert without hope Blake is lost in his own head seemingly without hope. We meet Blake in the title of the film his last days being destroyed by drugs although we never see him take anything harder than a cigarette and emotional vampires who pretend to be his friends sucking the life out of him coupled with the pressure of fame and impending 86 date tours Blake is quite simply falling apart. Here though it is a beautifully subtle take on madness gone are the visions you see in films like 'Jacobs ladder' replaced with a clever underscore of sounds of doors opening and closing and mutterings and oddities. It's as if as you travel round with Blake you too can here the doors of insanity opening in his head you too struggle to make out all the sounds. It's gently handled but eerily effective in linking you in with Blake's mindset. Elsewhere he stumbles and crawls round trying to function in the face of increasing paranoia and his drug addled inability to perform even the simplest of tasks. With record executives band members his manager and a private investigator all on his trail doing little for his state of mind Blake only seems comfortable when making music. This is also the only thing he can do with any sense of achievement this could be down to the fact that it is second nature or the fact that he is a musical genius. The film also has an amazing sense of space the landscapes around the mansion the emptiness of its rooms and the vacuous nature of the hangers on to Blake's coat tails. With some amazing scenes look out for the Venus in furs scene and the amazingly shot and framed acoustic song performed by Blake in the studio with probably one of the best little pieces of improvisation I've ever seen this is a brilliant and touching portrayal of a great man left to fall to pieces by those who should have helped him stay together. Although different in its approach it deals with madness in a way not seen since Polanski's 'repulsion' and ultimately it is a film that stays with you long after the final chilling shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gus Van Sant just as he had done in Gerry and in Elephant has taken a reallife mystery and filled in some of the trivial missing parts with his imagination. I haven't seen Gerry or Elephant but this time he has created a masterpiece.The movie follows Blake an isolated young rebel who is a rockandroll clich during the last days of his life. We see him mumbling to himself and he seems incoherent unable to stay awake. He is constantly running away pursued by everyone but unable to face his obligations. He is dragging himself through life.The atmosphere of the whole movie is determined by the characters' state of mind. Every single element conveys the despair and pointlessness of Blake's existence and the blurry thoughts that might be going through his brain. But these ugly days are filmed with an unsympathetic contemplative and poetic eye. Every shot has the rare beauty of a renaissance painting. All the other elements fit together in perfect harmony the music the sounds that have no apparent source but the inside of Blake's head and Michael Pitt's song From Death to Birth sent shivers down my back. The song and all the actors' performances are authentic personal and uncompromising.Another thing it was a very pleasant surprise to see a movie about the death of a rock star that's not filled with trashy violence aimed to shock and move viewers.Forget about who Kurt Cobain was and about his legend this movie is not about him. Forget about the critics and the Cannes Film Festival it's not about them either. Last days is a sincere and personal movie by people who apparently respect Kurt's memory. At least enough to tell a touching and aesthetic story inspired by his ordeal.".

Well i just finished watching this film 20 minutes ago so i'm writing this fairly fresh and still haven't completely formed an opinion of it its probably best me writing these comments in this state of mind because most of you will probably be thinking the same thing.I watched this film without reading any reviews seeing any ratings or hearing about it through word of mouth after 2 minutes of seeing Micheal Pitt as Blake you will clearly see Kurt Cobain 30 minutes later you will be slightly confused by just what the hell you are watching and for a time this movie will seem like a chore to watch and if i'm honest it just carry's on like that.So why then did i give it 7 out of 10? Because roughly an hour into the film i was actually impressed by something up until this point in the film all you see is a blonde skinny guy fumbling around looking like his half way to falling asleep or down a flight of stairs this is pretty much what you have watched up to now. Then he starts playing guitar and singing now i have been a Nirvana fan since i was 13 years old and that spans almost half my life time this one scene reminded me why. Its a shame this is a movie site otherwise i could carry on with a review that could get me hired by rolling stone but it isn't so i won't.To sum up if your looking for a source of entertainment please forgive me for the caps and DO NOT WATCH THIS. This is not a film you watch to be entertained in any form if you watch this searching for something to give you a thrill or move you in anyway you will most likely be let down by it an example of why this would be so? how about at one point in the film you are watching a TV showing a Boyz 2 Men video for the entire duration.However if you want to watch a film with some incredible acting great direction and is a good deal different to anything else thats had a decent size release to it lately this might be for you.It may also be worth it for Nirvana fans to check out.

I sat with the remote control in my hand wanting to press the FF button but out of respect for this great director I chose not too. I hoped something towards the end might enlighten........nope. The actors however did a good job with what they were given and I did like the boys from 'the church of the Latter day saints' scene. Was it supposed to be based on Kurt Cobains last days?? I honestly hope that the good man Kurt did not spend his last days in such a boring capacity. I was also a fan of grunge in the 90's I hoped for more of a grungy feel to the movie and maybe some more music. It was too light on music drug scene etc. If you're after an entertaining musicfilled homage to Kurt Cobain..this is not the movie for you. Too soft for me".

Nothing happens like everybody says throughout the film and Van Sant partially succeeds in showing us the big empty inside and around Blake with bitter raw strength. Pitt's performance is lowkey at most and Ricky Jay Magnolia and Lukas Haas Witness two criminally underrated actors don't disappoint in their small roles. We can't say anyone in the cast stands out though because this is a movie where the scenery the house the forest is the biggest character eating Blake up.Last Days didn't engage me enough to make me want to rewatch it but I didn't regret watching it. Far from being a masterpiece but worth seeing if you're looking for a different option and are interested in the main subject of course. This is not a movie for a Kelly Clarkson or Lindsay Lohan fan but please don't say this is the biggest piece of pretentious crap out there  I'm pretty sure BjrkMatthew Barney's Drawing Restraint 9 is a lot worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though I really like some of Gus Van Sant's older movies DRUGSTORE COWBOY MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO... and I do appreciate the fact that he dares to do something different in terms of stepping away even further from mainstream cinema with his more recent work he more or less lost me with LAST DAYS. I think with this movie we see a director who's trying just a little bit too hard to be eccentric. I've read some comments of people who liked it a lot and went on and on about the deeper meaning of things. I've read things about this movie being an accurate and truly sad  touching portrayal of the decay of a musical genius. And some people clearly praise this movie because they're fans of Gus Van Sant completely ignoring the movie's flaws. Well that's all fine by me but that's not the way I saw the movie.When I call LAST DAYS hollow I'm not saying it's insincere. Not at all because it really feels like a sincere portrait of a musician bordering on the edge of sanity and I'm not using the term musical genius because at not one moment in the movie we get prove that he really is one we just have to assume it because he supposedly has a big upcoming tour to go on and a fellow musician asks his opinion on a song he wrote... but hey that's fine by me. When I say LAST DAYS is hollow I mean that it's an empty vessel with no contents. When people start saying that it's about being unable to communicate with each other or that it's about friends draining you emotionally or blah blah blah... I just can't help laughing that away. Because not one single person in the movie actually does something. They all just hang around sleeping doing nothing occasionally listening to music... well okay Blake has two moments where you can see him making music and singing a song those were two solid oneshot sequences and I enjoyed them a lot. But apart from that nothing happens.And what about Michael Pitt deserving an Oscar for his role as Blake? You got to be kiddin' me! You can see him wearing a dress. You can see him fooling around with a gun. You can see him stumbling around in the house and through the forest. And you can see him eat something in the kitchen. That's it. And what's worse he always mumbles the few lines he has in a way that it's almost incomprehensible. But I guess that's what you get when you're a burned out junkie. Assuming Blake IS a junkie that is. Because we never get any evidence or hints as to why he's losing his mind. Everybody thinks oh he's into rock'n'roll so it must be drugs. Has it ever occurred to anyone that besides being severely antisocial he might also be suffering from a psychological affection? Like insomnia or autism or whatever? Once again Gus Van Sant doesn't feel the need to enlighten us with more information. No info no plot... sounds more like a registration than a movie doesn't it? And then after the 'movie' is over and we have absolutely learned nothing about our protagonist Gus Van Sant has the pretension to show us some written text explaining that this movie is based on the last days of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. I mean if he had the rights to use Kurt's name in the end credits then surely he could have build some more references to his real life in the plot no? It just feels pretentious and above all a smart move to draw public attention to the movie. Because way before the movie came out everybody already knew that it supposedly was about the final days of Kurt Cobain. Seriously if that little text would not have been there at the end of the film and this movie was just about some unknown musician I would have considered this to be a much better movie and would certainly have enjoyed it more. It simply would have worked much better for me that way and I would have rated the movie much higher because of it.However... I must say this The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. And the cameramoves and angles are subtle nicely framed and to the point. In fact I believe that if you at any given moment would take a still of any frame in the movie you would always have a perfect photograph. One of my favorite shots was when the camera slowly pulls back from the window when we see Blake playing various instruments inside the house. It must have lasted at least 5 minutes or so. Pretty brilliant. Another good thing was that the movie had a consequent unworldly feel to it. And it was also fun seeing Van Sant doing his ELEPHANTtrick again Showing the same scene from a different point of view later in the movie. Sadly these were the only things that kept me going through the movie.So even if I think LAST DAYS was pretty bad for the reasons mentioned above I'm gonna be extremely mild in my final judgement. I'll add one point for every aspect I liked The cinematography. Asia Argento running around in her underwear. Kim Gordon was in it. The little music that was in it was good Thurston Moore was involved with the music. So there you have it 4 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gus Van Sant does a remarkable job with this film  Last Days. Nothing much happens there is not a lot of dialogue but what we see experience is the slow demise of an individual into oblivion. We are observers albeit at a distance. The urge maybe there to intervene deliberately evoked by the structure of Van Sant's film. We want to say 'You do not have to go on like this. We can help.' The structure is like a memory recalled. We keep going over it adding bits as we do to try to make more sense but never arriving at a definitive version. We especially hope that when the advertising salesman calls to the house and Blake lets him inthat he will engage with the man and forget his morose preoccupations. But the gulf between the two is unbridgeable. The nadir of the film is when Blake left alone by his friends in the rehearsal room starts to play on his guitar. His voice echoes his inner anguish rising from a low to a high and then back to a low. He even manages to break a string on the guitar but dexterously pulls the string while continuing the song. How could such music come out of such gloom? This is the paradox of creativity  of trying to give form to ideas not yet realized. We wait in anticipation incapable of giving directions. Blake is constantly trying to evade the intrusion of others but cannot transcend his own self of being in the world. The final intrusion finds him not there he is dead.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film gives me the chills. I can't quite explain it there's just something about the images and cinematography not to mention the noises which I'll get to later that make me feel like I'm in a dream. Last Days reminds me of several dreams I've had in the past where I'm lost in a huge house and there are people around but I feel disconnected to them. It's like a dream that's ALMOST real but doesn't quite cross over into reality.Why? What is it? You see I'm led to believe that after viewing it 3 times now this film's setting is one of Purgatorysymbolically of course. As many reviewers have mentioned already the characters don't really DO anything. If you know anything about traditional versions of Purgatory or Limbo you know it is a place of complete neutralitythere is no good nor evil. It is the middle ground a place where souls get trapped before they can be judged as either good or evil. There's a sense of misery and detachment surrounding Blake and all of his friends even though Scott steals his credit card to buy a jet heater... or something. It's like everyone is there because they are just ghosts without purpose without meaning. There's even a scene I believe where somebody comments about how decadent life in the house isthat they don't do anything they just party and screw and lay around in the house.There's a little bit of a sense that these people want to escape their grey prison like when Scott repeatedly asks the Mormon Boys if they really talk to Jesus like Jesus is this completely distant figure.The scenes are all very coldlooking except the woods during the day. It's almost surreal.And as I mentioned earlier there are weird noises. Listen really really close. There are sound motifs. There are bells ringing in certain scenes and strange scraping noises. These things are all very unsettling and go along well with the doomladen song Blake plays in his band room. Anyone know what opera that is at the beginning and end of the film? I'm sure that's important somehow...Finally Blake is able to transcend Purgatory into Paradise. He climbs the ladder bridging the gap between death and rebirth... It's a long lonely journey  from death to birth. Whether his ascenscion is aligned with Christian or other spiritual dogma is irrelevant.Remember I'm not trying to say that the characters in this film are all ghosts and the land surrounding the house is Purgatory itself. I simply believe that Last Days captures the hopelessness and disconnection Kurt Cobain or anyone in such social isolation must have felt and therefore am able to link that to some minimal allegory of Purgatory.However I give this film 8 out of 10 stars and not 10 out of 10 because while it captures a very specific atmosphere it still is not a GREAT film. It is not a strong film there is no solid good or evil no intense conflict. It's a movie about gradual decay about getting lost in the middle somewhere.".

But this film just didn't move at all. It was kinda weird as I got a feeling in the first few minutes that it just wasn't going to go anywhere. I get what Van Sant was trying to do  representation of the monotony of Cobain's final days and the mundane existence of a washed outdrug addled rock star but fundamentally this film lacked any kind of passion or devotion to it's subjects. One would imagine that the cynical sense of humour that Cobain would cause him to roll his eyes at this film. There was no exploration of the why's of his suicide. In fact there was little exploration of anything apart from the aforementioned monotony. It has been a long time since I have walked out of a film before the ending ... but this one caused me to. So unless something mindblowing occurred in the final few minutes this is the worst film I have paid to see at the cinema in a long time.".

Last day's is a fictional account of the last days of Kurt Cobains life set in a different location to where Kurt actually lived and died. And the fact that the main character is called Blake in inconsequential. What this movie actually is in my mind is a true piece of gonzo film making Gus has taken a well known event and put his own spin on it from his own imagination. Look at Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that is a true story which has been woven with Hunter S. Thompsons imagination. Even the main character Raole Duke is clearly Hunter himself. Last Days is the same concept. I read someone say about Michael Pitt mumbling well Kurt was well known for mumbling so how is that bad acting?Pitt captures the spirit of Kurt Cobain perfectly not only does he understand the role completely but he delivers it so well that for an hour and a half I felt like i was watching a ghost. facially he may not be 100 Kurt in fact he is slightly better looking but this isn't a look alike show. If you want to see the image of Kurt Cobain go and watch an interview with him or a documentary!There are a lot of hidden hints at things that maybe only Nirvana fans will understand. The tin Blake digs up I believe is meant to represent his stash of drugs. The drug use is implied. The hospital wrist band is a nod to the stint Kurt spent in rehab before escaping shortly before his death and the green house is an exact replica of the room above the garage at the Cobain house in which Kurt actually died.In short I believe that this movie is not just cast well it is a work of art.

After Elephant a film about the massacre in an American high school Van Sant deals once more with another moment of crisis of the youth culture of the 90s once more triggered by a senseless act of violence. In Kurt's Pardon me for using the forename but I feel very close to him although I never actually was suicide note he tells that the success of his band and his role as the voice of his generation for him the depressive grunge poet was a burden that suffered him to death. In the public dialogue of the music business in 1994 he was considered to be the first MTVvictim the last true rock'n'roll rebel who slipped into something he couldn't cope with.It's brilliant how Van Sant's achieves an exterior shallowness in the shots and images we see on screen to the contrary odds of the inner life of the main protagonist a restless wanderer on an everlasting search for oneself and the final resignation I lost something on the way I am today. The film is very meditative and naturalistic a minimalist drama which locates for the most part in a roomy building and depicts the events which might have caused to the suicide of the musician. It has some intensely spellbinding musical moments kind of an abstract form of the style of Nirvana's music and the grunge movement per se when BlakePitt murmurs for almost 5 minutes a acoustic ballad and finally furiously tears the strings of his guitar. Or there's the sequence when Blake talks on the telephone with a member of his band who wants to argue him into making another tour. This conversation like so much more in the film goes off into nothingness  at some point Blake doffs the handset and leaves his pal talking into the void until the scene interrupts. Another great moment in the film is when we see Blake from a distance in his rehearsal room through a window while the camera almost imperceptibly backs up and one by one releases the view at the luxurious country house walking around and operating several instruments. The chords of an electric guitar crescendo to a voluminous drone sound and with every instrument Blake plays the intensity increases while the camera slowly moves away from the house. This gives a feeling as if Van Sant withdraws from his protagonist with the awareness that also the camera can not get to truth of Blake'sKurt's story and that certain secrets should rather left to be untouched. It's also remarkable that Van Sant avoids any direct reference to drug use but there are hidden innuendos such as the Velvet Underground song Venus in Furs we hear from a scratched record I am tired I am weary I could sleep for thousand years. This extolled numbness of the body has also befallen Blake whereas the association of the record and the heroine needle is kind of a 'witty' pun.At the end when Blake leaves his body in admittedly too much pathos and goes up the Stairway of Heaven you just seem to be relieved that his misery of mental and physical exhaustion and mundane loneliness finally found an end and you have to agree with Kurt Cobain's famous line It's better to burn out than to fade away.".

Here are the tragical Colombine school events.It's not about this but it shows that we live in a society that enables people taking other's life as fun.Last Days uses the same method by taking the icon figure of Kurt Cobain as an example in a movie that deals with loneliness despair futility of living. The main character is not able to find solace in anything that surrounds him family friends music and nature. This is a very slow paced movie in which death seems to be just around the corner. It was said that nothing happens in van Sant's movies. But what happen really mean? People moving around talking nonsense preparing spaghetti is not a form of happening? Van Sant has a mystical view of life in which the slightest act is nothing but an initiation ritual and dying is the very achievement of this ritual. Last Days is a bleak sparse difficult demanding haunting masterpiece. It's about a man who seems condemned to live but he chooses to escape. He says nothing and nothing is said in the movie silence and a non sense hum depicts better than anything the world in which he seems not to belong. His music too is full of anger suffering despair thirst of death. It was said the van Sant had no reason to put a gay scene in Last Days. I don't know. It might be that Scott and Lucas are really a gay couple perhaps is this pulsing of life in a death haunted world. I can say that after seeing the movie twice I could really understand its issues. Highly recommended movie for open eyed open minded and open hearted audiences.".

	schema:headline " Innocent pilgrimage to a soccer god";
	schema:reviewBody "The Argentinian director Carlos Sorin has staked out a small but secure place for himself in the world of cinema. His gentle road movies have tended to use nonactors in congenial roles to depict wanderings in obscure regions mostly somewhere in Patagonia or the far south of the country. The most recent Sorin films concerned traveling dog show followers 'Bombon el perro' and a small collection of minor people whose tales were intertwined 'Historias Minimas'. This time his main traveler is more driven and has a more mainstream mission. He makes it almost all the way to Buenos Aires and he is essentially doing what millions do or would like to.Tati Benitez Ignacio Bentez is a fanatical sports fan. What could be more fanatical in Argentina than the need to worship and follow Diego Maradona the soccer god? There's nothing offbeat about Diego. Tati a healthy young fellow who has a sweet and honest and innocent and rather pretty face lives in a remote village in the Misiones jungle with his pregnant wife Paola Rotela the actor's actual and actually then pregnant wife. Tati's uniform is a soccer shirt with Maradona's number 10 on it and has a huge 10 tattooed on his back. Fellow villagers joke that he's married to the star. The presentation of Tati's obsession is tongue in cheek as various villagers tell the camera about it. He's even got two parrots who chime Maradona. Times are tough and Tati has lost his job as a lumberjack. He goes to work for Silva Miguel Gonzales Colman an ancient Indian woodcarver who speaks only the guaran language learning the trade in exchange for small rewards. His wife is at home expecting the baby. Tati learns all about the kinds of wood. One day in a forest looking for good pieces to carve in a heavy rainstorm Tati finds a big root rising up out of the ground that he thinks is the spitting image of his soccer idol standing with arms lifted in triumph after scoring a goal. Thinking himself blessed by the magical appearance in his path of this symbolic object Tati lugs the root back and in time Silva brings out the likeness. We never quite get a good look at the whole thing up close but it's clear the resemblance is largely in the eye of the beholder and grows in proportion to one's fandom. Eventually the news comes this is in 2004 when it happened that Maradona has had a heart attack and is in intensive care in Buenos Aires. Everyone hangs on watching communal TV's. When he first hears the news Tati thinks it's just a bad joke. After a few days El Diego is reported to have abruptly left the hospital. Later he's reported to be playing golf at a club.A youth club has offered to accept the carved root but after consulting with a fortune teller Tati Sorin's rural sports fan everyman decides he must make the pilgrimage to his idol and present it directly to him. He goes off the carving wrapped in black plastic secured with a rope. Of course people keep asking what it is and he must unveil it. He meets lots of people along the way including the main actors in 'Bombon' Juan Villegas in a camera shop and Walter Donado driving an ambulance. Also notable is Maria Marta Alvez as a girl from a roadside brothel and Lila Caceres as a young wife on a pilgrimage to pray to the cowboy saint Gauchito Gil. Most notable because they are together longest is Waguinho Carlos Wagner La Bella actually a film producer a big burly bearded Brazilian driving a giant truck who when he hears about the sculpture at first refuses to give Tati a ride Maradona of course being no friend of Brazil where the god of soccer in case you didn't know is Pel Edson Arantes do Nascimento who dare we say it is the greatest soccer player of all time. But it only said arguably  and that was on a Brazilian website. Waguiho does give Tati a long ride and his rambling monologues bring home the folkloric aspects of football worship. After all the big carved root is a kind of idol and it's clear the common people in Latin America come close to attributing supernatural powers to their athletic deities.When Tati finally gets to the place where Maradona's supposed to be he finds a whole encampment. It's surely no accident that San Diego could signify the athlete's sainthood  though his failings  drug excess obesity sheer unruliness  do not go unmentioned either  and Santiago i.e. San Diego de Compostela is a famous Christian religious pilgrim's destination. This is the clearest sign that Sorin's work feels more mainstream this time not only because he is dealing with an object of mass popularity but because where Tati goes is where in a sense everyone in the country wants to be at this moment. And not only that but there is a kind of accomplishment in the handling of crowd scenes shots of big trucks in motion full of standing riders not to mention Tati and the Brazilian in the big cab all showing more technical ambition this time. There is a kind of propulsive forward energy in 'El Camino de San Diego' that 'Bombon' and 'Historias Minimas' lacked. The love of ordinary folk of the little guy the forgotten person is stronger more touching than ever this time. Sorin might reach a larger audience with this film. If ever there was a feelgood movie this is it. There is at the same time a certain sense of loss. Carlos Sorin no longer seems an obscure director one loves in a special way because hardly anyone else knows or cares about him  but that was really never true anyway. Shown as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival 2007.".

When he loses his job Tati begins getting wood he finds all over that he uses for carving making all kinds of figures of animals. He doesn't have to go far for his inspiration. The area of the country where he lives is poor his prospects of employment are nil. Like most of his countrymen is an avid soccer fan. His idol Diego Maradona one of the best players of all time. One day walking in the woods he sees a tree with a strange formation. He gets an inspiration he will make a sculpture in his idol's image.When Maradona gets sick Tati like the rest of the country sits glued in front of the television set in town. The eager soccer fans have staged vigils outside the Buenos Aires clinic where the great Diego is being treated. Tati acting on an impulse decides to bring the statue to Maradona. The only problem is he doesn't have enough money to pay for the trip. His wife who understands the need for Tati to go to the capital borrows some money so he can go.Tati has a winning personality. He is a contented person that has not been outside of the area where he was born. Carrying the statue of Maradona wrapped in plastic he starts his journey that will bring him closer to his idol. All he wants to do is pay homage to the man that gave him so much when he was active in the game. Along the road Tati proves to be a resourceful man making friends with all he comes in contact with.The one person that made the difference was a Waguinho a Brazilian truck driver who is going to Buenos Aires with a thousands of chickens in his semi. Yes he will take Tati to the capital along the way the two men bond in unexpected ways. The older Waguinho understands Tati because he sees a kind soul even when his own preferences lay not with Maradona but with another Brazilian Pele. The two newly acquainted friends get into an easy friendship until they get to the end of the line.Tati decides to take his statue directly to the golf course where it has been reported Maradona has been going after his escape from the clinic. He had left against his doctors' advice. The last leg of Tati's journey involves a bus ride with a blind man who makes a living selling lottery tickets. Tati helps this man get to the area where he will peddle his chances right outside the golf course. Tati goes to the security area to give his present he is told to leave it with the guard. Maradona who is thought to arrive in an ambulance is never seen. Tati wonders if Diego has seen the gift the guard checks and nothing is found leading the young peasant to believe his gift has been accepted. As he walks away he goes to say good bye to the blind lottery seller. He wants to know if the man wants help. Instead the blind man gives him a lottery ticket as a token of his gratitude telling Tati he feels it will be a winner.Carlos Sorin the creator of this immensely enjoyable film shows he is a great observer of humans. As he has demonstrated with his delightful Intimate Stories he is at it again with this tale about a kind hearted but naive man that embarks in a trip of discovery just to repay in a way the joys a soccer player of the stature of Maradona has given him without asking. As with his other film this is a type of road movie in which a man will discover a world he didn't know but in doing so he also will touch the lives of the people that he comes in contact with.Part of our enjoyment is watching a beautiful story that rings true. This is a film where non professional actors carry the film effortlessly. The charismatic Ignacio Benitez is playing himself. A peasant that probably has not seen the world outside his village he does a wonderful job for the director. Equally excellent is Carlos Wagner LaBella who plays Waguinho a jolly man that sees the good in the young man on a mission. They bond together in unexpected ways complimenting each other and enhancing the film in the process.The soundtrack is by Nicolas Sorin the son of the director. The amazing views of the unknown countryside that tourists never see is by Hugo Colace who has worked with the director before. Carlos Sorin surprises us yet again with this vision of hope. This is a positive film that will charm its viewers.".

Before reading on be warned that what follows contains spoilers. The title involves a play on words. First it refers to Argentine soccer hero Diego Maradona as St. Diego since he has been accorded saintlike status by the movie's protagonist and by many Argentines. It also evokes the Spanish phrase El camino de Santiago The Way to Santiago which refers to the route that medieval pilgrims took to travel from all over Europe to the city of Santiago Spain which was alleged to have the remains of the apostle St. James. This movie's protagonist is like a medieval pilgrim on a holy quest. Marginally employed and living in poverty he could use a miracle for himself and perhaps that is the unconscious motive for his journey but its conscious purpose is to support Maradona who at the movie's beginning is hospitalized perhaps as a result of an overly indulgent lifestyle made possible by a budget that is beyond this poor follower's imagination. In short the film is a compelling commentary on the human urge to find something to believe in. It is a bit slow at places but is well worth viewing.".

Particularly in this movie El Camino de San Diego the title referring to Argentina biggest living Icon Diego Armando Maradona SOrin shows as that a fantastic road movie which includes all the components of this genre can be done in this part of the world and with the surprising fact of the main character not driving a single kilometer. We get to see two main thing in this movie. First of all a unique love story. That is the one which exits between Argentines and the football idol. A love thats surpasses any distance monetary limitation and even the reality. The main character is up to everything in order to achieve his wish. That is to give Diego a piece of wood with his face on it. The second main point of this movie and here we enter SOrin's favorite field is the accurate picture of the Argentina's country and town inhabitants all of them trying to help the story hero so that he can achieve his goal. Again an in Historias Minimas and Bombn Sorin gets fantastic performances from nonprofessional actors. Not to extend it any longer I can Farly say that this is the best picture about Maradona and it doesn't even has to show him on screen".

	schema:headline " The Dangers Of Cape Horn";
	schema:reviewBody "The Light At The Edge of the World marks Kirk Douglas's second filming of a Jules Verne novel. The first of course was one of his most popular films 20000 Leagues Under The Sea. But this film is far more serious and has far more adult themes than Walt Disney's film aimed for the kid trade.This was the last novel Jules Verne had published during his lifetime and it's a story of survival against almost impossible odds. In the original novel Kirk Douglas's character was named Vasquez which certainly was more in keeping with someone assigned to lighthouse duty on Cape Horn. But in giving Douglas's character an Anglo name it better explains his presence on the island and it certainly is in keeping with the international tradition of Jules Verne's writings.Cape Horn is one of the loneliest parts of the globe and the geography of the southern tip of South America. Look on a map of the many islands and rocks in that part of the globe and imagine how rough the sea is because it has only limited space. It's not without reason that sailors in all cultures say that no one is really a true sailor until they've made a voyage crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean in that area. Remember also this is 1865 as Yul Brynner identifies the year and the Panama Canal had not been built.Which makes the lighthouse at Cape Horn an international concern which was something that is ever present in Jules Verne's writings. But then as now there are malevolent forces in the world and they are in this story Yul Brynner and his pirate crew.On one desultory like any other down there Yul Brynner's ship docks at the island and kills lighthouse keeper Fernando Rey and his young assistant Massimo Ranieri. By sheer dumb luck Douglas is not at the lighthouse when this happens but he becomes a hunted man by Brynner and his pirate crew who want to set up headquarters there and use the light to pile up as many wrecks as they can plunder. Also they want to eliminate Douglas who's now the only witness to their crimes.I did like this film very much both when first seeing it in the theater and now on VHS. One thing of interest I found here is that there is no ambiguity no shadings of character. Kirk Douglas is a good guy and Yul Brynner a bad one no one is going to walk away thinking anything else. In fact Yul Brynner's pirate captain Jonathan Kongre is the most unredeemable villain we've seen on screen since Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance.Definitely fans of Kirk Douglas Yul Brynner and Jules Verne should earmark this film for their collection.".

	schema:headline " A Study in Procrastinating Evil Which Got Botched";
	schema:reviewBody "Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called Master Zacharias or the Clockmaker's Soul. It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress  the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA or Robur from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel THE MASTER OF THE WORLD are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing such as THE BARSAC MISSION partly written by Verne's son Michael THE SURVIVORS OF THE JONATHAN THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science but also dealt with political systems and economics for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him but seems to go back to his potboiler period when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre renamed Jonathan Kongre is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific and reach Staten Island a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them but the third one named Vasquez  he's from Chile remember hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage and increase their illgotten gains. But the key to the novel and it is not in the movie is that Kongre's right hand men Carcante and Vargas keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat and massacres the crew a scene that is done in the film. The sole survivor is an American John Davis the name became Denton in the film except that it was given to the character of Vasquez. Now with an ally and not a drunken one as in the film Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving but Kongre unused to someone annoying him successfully keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft kill most of his crew and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie with Denton picking off crew members one at a time is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel a rarity in most of Verne's stories  he could be quite a feminist when he wished. The egotism of Jonathan Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton but his singlehanded success Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.".

But the key to the novel and it is not in the movie is that Kongre's right hand men Carcante and Vargas keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat and massacres the crew a scene that is done in the film. The sole survivor is an American John Davis the name became Denton in the film except that it was given to the character of Vasquez. Now with an ally and not a drunken one as in the film Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving but Kongre unused to someone annoying him successfully keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft kill most of his crew and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie with Denton picking off crew members one at a time is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel a rarity in most of Verne's stories  he could be quite a feminist when he wished. The egotism of Jonathan Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton but his singlehanded success Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.";

	schema:reviewBody "I read the book first a fairly good novel by the prolific Jules Verne entitled The Lighthouse at the End of the World. I enjoyed the book sufficiently to look forward with a degree of eagerness to the film but my anticipation was shattered once I saw the actual movie.It's a terribly dreary affair about lighthouse keepers near to Cape Horn who are attacked by a band of pirates. The pirates seize control of their island and more importantly their lighthouse and use it to steer unsuspecting vessels onto the nearby rocks.Kirk Douglas plays the surviving lighthouse keeper and Yul Brynner plays the main pirate. Both roles are under written and both stars seem ill at ease with the material they've been signed up to work with. The action is littered with distracting embarrassments such as the scene where Kirk leaps from a cliff into the sea but it is so obviously a dummy making the fall that it evokes laughter more than excitement.This might have been an enjoyable kids movie if treated better but every now and then it lapses into brutality which makes it unsuitable even for the juvenile crowd. In particular there's a savage scene in which a hostage is skinned alive by the pirates and we see peels of skin being torn off with a hooked pike to reveal blood and raw flesh beneath. This is not the stuff of a childrens' flick. Furthermore the film frequently turnd up in an incoherent chopped up 95 minute edition which has been cut down from the two hour original so badly that it barely makes sense at all. An interesting dilemma for the audience is whether to watch the short illogical version or the long dreary one. Suffice to say both are awful!".

	schema:headline " There's A Fine Classic Hidden Within This Work";
	schema:reviewBody "It would be very interesting to know who's decisions marred this potentially good film! Within the final cut of this gripping work lays a truly exiting story dealing with survival in extreme situations. Between the Director failing to differentiate from drama and folly Writers too many fiddled with it and lost sight of the seriousness of the situation Editor missed important shortcomings and Producer Mr Douglas himself they failed to allow the strongest story elements to shine through. In his fine book 'The Films of Kirk Douglas' Tony Thomas also highlights some of the above shortcomings with the running time given for the version he reviewed even being 6mins shorter than other releases listed! Tony also notes the overindulgence and explicit brutality that kept this film away from much of it's target audience. With smart post production editing this could have should have and still can be a classic.Look at the dynamics of the story Will Denton Assistant lightkeeper witnesses the terrifying murders of his only colleagues. He is alone in a hostile desolate situation. He is unarmed desperate beyond words. He is hunted from all quarters and feels helpless at preventing some of the shocking activities he is witnessing. While this screenplay is based on Jules Verne's fascinating book the last sent for publication before his death it only uses Verne's basic situation. Some of Verne's story tends to have its basis in Historical fact. Strangely the film almost throws away an expensive opening scene the inauguration of Argentinas first serious navigational aid 'The Lighthouse at the Edge of the World' on Christmas Day 1865 it does so by presenting this colorful ceremony under the opening credits! No further mention is given to inform the audience of the significance of this historic event. The film was released around the world in many varying lengths  between 95 and 126 Min's. Shorter versions were released in Australia and the U.K. etc these were in many ways better...Several of the more overdone scenes were dropped this offered considerable improvement to the overall believability although one cut left a gap in continuity...IE Denton's underwater flashbacks to his past following his fall from a cliff.Surprisingly the latest Studio Canal reissue has removed one of the films stronger scenes but sadly left in all the overindulged segments that would have been far better removed The scene in question involves Denton and Montifiore's escape on the antagonists magnificent white horse. In the original during the escape the horse stumbles and is unable to get back up leaving no alternative than to shoot it. This cut leaves us with the question...where is the horse from this point on?! Why make this cut and not the others...?The cast is strong and mostly convincing even the support characters are interesting Ferando Rey Head Lightkeeper Renato Salvatori Montefiore  ships engineer with Massimo Ranieri's 'Felipe' adding innocence warmth and credibility as apprentice light keeper. The film has a superb look via the work of top French Cinematographer Henri Decae. The man credited with creating the look of the French New Wave his work has since been much imitated but seldom to the same effect Working within very difficult locations Decae's camera is continually in motion drawing the viewer in forcing you to feel as if you are part of the action. Second unit photographer Cecillio Paniagua contributed some additional shots of interest. The locations are eye popping with rugged wind swept land and seascapes creating a vivid threatening atmosphere. The quality of the Sound recordists work both 'on location' and post production is nothing short of superb. The Music of multi talented Piero Piccioni plays an important part it forms a virtual tone poem a suite with themes written for each character and situation. His compositions constantly weave from glorious panoramic melodies  recollections of the past  to exiting gut tearing panic. Leonard Maltin sums up a longer version fairly well 'Has some excitement but is more often unintentionally funny' but he too throws away the high standard of technical quality and need for editing. The special effects vary from very good to average. Scenes involving the use of pyrotechnics are well done indeed. Good examples are the blasting of Kongre's schooner with the crew rushing and falling amid explosions and flames this is always dangerous work and all done without CGI!. The fire in the lighthouse is a stand out with exploding glass and twisting metal. And even though the sinking of a passenger ship is intercut with models not too bad overall the shots on board involving the passengers desperate panic are quite convincing.It's difficult to understand though with many well done effects why the scene involving a dummy falling over a cliff was so badly done. The shot was not even necessary in the film... So why leave it in?Come on Canal give us the good film thats locked away amid the mess. Drop such scenes as Denton and Arabellas kiss just a tiny clip during the 'charade' set up The foolishness of noisy cross dressing Pirates cavorting around the island. Ease off some needlessly overdone brutality and gore the short versions did this very nicely Drop the foolish shots of Denton and Montefiore calmly building a Bonn fire in broad daylight! Drop or halve the silly sequence involving Kongre and Arabella following Tarcantes death  just some of the scenes that helped to sink this fine production. Mr Douglas has given us many great films and even though this was nearing the end of his distinguished career it seems he should have taken a far more focused approach. While its late this work is still worth saving. A mere 1015mins edited from various sections could do this....Anyone interested could end up with a far better film even a semi classic......KenR".

Anyway the film's thin plot of a lighthouse keeper Douglas still athletic at 55 combating a band of pirates led by a boredlooking Brynner is stretched for a hefty and slowmoving 129 minutes which is 9 longer than the official duration given on most sources!. Even if I hadn't checked this out in 20 years or so I still recalled some of the imagery involved  such as Douglas hanging upside down from the lighthouse tower or his showdown with Brynner which ends in a fireto say nothing of those indelible and unmistakably European faces some of whom I've come to know by name in the interim of Brynner's sinister cutthroat cohorts.The rest of the cast includes Samantha Eggar illatease as a shipwreck victim who unwittingly becomes an object of contention between the two male stars a sure indication of how perfunctory the role was to begin with is that she's ultimately raped and murdered with not even the hero bothering to do anything about it! Renato Salvatori as another survivor who befriends Douglas but when finally caught by Brynner and his men is painfully skinned alive! as well as Fernando Rey and popular Italian crooner Massimo Ranieri  both of whose contribution is brief being literally done away with as soon as the villains make their first appearance! While the film's tolerable enough as lowbrow epic adventures go one can't really call it entertaining in view of the seediness and sadism on display that said the thing does become unintentionally hilarious with the clichd flashbacks to Douglas' past as a golddigger in the Old West and especially the accidental slipping almost at the cost of his life of Brynner's wildeyed longhaired righthand man when engaged in an impromptu campy dance in drag!".

However I must admit and admire the sheer artistry of these actors including the unsung Ann Sothern and their ability to take a simple story and turn it into an engaging emotional tour de force film of power and majesty.Miss Gish was in the twilight of her life in this her last film but you could still see the same actress who touched audiences in 1919's Broken Blossoms...the same powerful skills which are on display in 1928's The Wind and the same quiet dignity portrayed in 1959's The Night of the Hunter. Her scenes are by far the finest of the movie.I must respectfully disagree with my fellow reviewers in their dismissal of Bette Davis's performance. Her character was supposed to be hardheaded mean and in bad health why else keep harking on dying?. Bette is all of these things. I could really feel that she WAS Libby. Although her constant yelling of SAYrah was a little annoying but that's Ms. Davis for you.Vincent Price was a revelation for those of us who have only seen him as a schlockmiester. His role as the Count warm friendly scared and courtly was probably the most sympathetic character in the film.All in all a touching beautiful tribute to the legends of the screen and to the movies themselves. A lost breed of film.".

Starring not only Bette Davis and Lilian Gish alone worth anybody's money well advanced into the autumn of their years but also a very welcome Vincent Price and a magnificent Ann Sothern together with her real daughter Tisha Sterling.A slow sensitive story in which each one looks back on life from differing perspectives as usual Bette Davis is in a dominating rle which despite her advanced years carries off quite well Lillian Gish is just superb lending that toneddown equanimous nature of hers which pervades the whole atmosphere of the film. And as the film develops around their house and in the garden and on the clifftops looking out to sea in earnest attempts to see the whales making their way south the quiet contemplativeness of the film holds you. This is a film you will cherish and savour long afterwards. Which is why it is in my video collection since 1993 and why IMDb contributors 15 years on are still commenting on this heartwarming piece half a dozen of them only so far this year.So as to make a contrast I suggest that impressive classic 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?' 1962 with Bette Davis playing against Joan Crawford an intense dramatic piece.

	schema:headline " The waning days of one last summer on the coast of Maine";
	schema:reviewBody "This 1987 film is truly remarkable in its own small way. The film centers on a beautiful and simple story about the bonds of sisters the disappointments of life and the waning days of one last summer on the coast of Maine.The legendary and I mean LEGENDARY Lillian Gish stars here at age 93 as Sarah. Having appeared in about 120 films over an incredible span of 75 years 191287 Gish goes about her business of being an actress with great dignity and skill. There are several quiet scenes in which she talks to old photographs as she cleans or fixes up her hair and makeup. She's truly enchanting.The legendary Bette Davis doesn't fare quite as well playing the harsh Libby. Davis post stroke is certainly easy to believe as the flinty sister who is blind and bitter. Davis was almost 80 here and had also racked up about 120 films dating from 1931. As Tisha Ann Sothern more than 100 films earned a welldeserved Oscar nomination as the nosy pushy friend who hasn't quite given up on life. Sothern started as a dancer in films in 1927 as a delicate blonde beauty. Vincent Price almost 180 films from 1938 plays the charming drifter and foreigner who may be looking for a new place to live. And Harry Carey Jr. son of Harry Carey a cowboy star in silent films plays the fixit man who wants to install a picture window. There's little action here as the sisters squabble about daily routines and longago events in their lives. Gish is ever hopeful while Davis is always mistrusting. The 4 stars work well together although the age differences are apparent. Davis uses her usual Boston voice Sothern tries out a pretty good down east accent. Price plays a Russian migr and Gish speaks in her own voice. The feeling of 50s Maine is just right. The house perched on a small cliff looking out to sea looks right. The island this was filmed in Casco Bay is gorgeous and captures the simplicity of old Maine just perfectly. The atmosphere is windy and overgrown and rocky. It's the Maine of my childhood.This marks the final film appearance of Gish and Sothern. While Sothern was the only one to win an Oscar nomination she along with Gish and Price won Independent Spirit nominations. What a pity that Gish did not win Oscar recognition for this role and for her astonishing longevity in film. Gish earned only one Oscar nomination for DUEL IN THE SUN and an honorary award in 1971.Gish did win the best actress award from the National Board of Review.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lindsay Anderson's The Whales of August stars silent film legend Lillian Gish in her 95th year and Bette Davis 79 as widowed sisters one warm and supportive the other cold and cantankerous who have been coming to a small cottage on the Maine seacoast for sixty years. Every August they watch the journey of the whales passing in the nearby waters together but the sense is that this may be their last summer together. Knowing that their time is limited the siblings attempt to resolve longstanding differences but face many obstacles. The Whales of August takes place during the course of a single day and the camera stays mostly inside the house except to follow the sisters on occasional walks to the ocean. It all sounds static but there is a great deal of emotion churning beneath the surface.Libby Davis is nearly blind and very difficult to live with always talking about how her life is over. Her sister Sarah Gish on the other hand is the polar opposite. She is sweet in her sisterly devotion to taking care of Libby and avoiding getting drawn into her moods she always calls her dear. She brushes her hair fixes breakfast for her gets her clothes together and tends to the garden. Busy busy busy is how Libby talks about her and irritatingly calls her Sayrah throughout the film. Ms. Davis looks gaunt but her face shows a strength that is as craggy as the seacoast rocks. The film also features Vincent Price as Mr. Maranov a down on his luck but charming Russian refugee whom Libby suspects is trying to worm his way in with them and Haray Caray Jr. as Joshua Brackett a handyman who is forever making a racket in the house. Also featured is Ann Sothern as Trish a friend and neighbor who is close to convincing Sarah to leave Libby's care to her daughter until she remembers how Libby supported her when her own husband died. Sarah draws every ounce of emotion from a lovely scene in which she celebrates her 46th wedding anniversary by having an imaginary conversation with Philip her long deceased husband. Fortysix years Phillip she tells him. Fortysix red roses fortysix white. White for truthred for passion. That's what you always said  passion and truth that's all we need. I wish you were here Phillip. Another moving sequence is when Libby brushes her face with a lock of her husband's hair while sitting alone in her bedroom. I had heard that The Whales of August was little more than a vehicle for two aging stars to sing their swan song however I found the screenplay by David Berry to gracefully complement the performances with an emotional honesty that captures the truth of the characters. Not a great deal happens in The Whales of August but that is often true of life. It is a gentle and civilized character study that lets us know it is never too late to bury longstanding grievances and open a picture window to possibility. It may be elegant and old fashioned in its style but it has a grace and beauty that is timeless.".

	schema:headline " A Golden Tribute";
	schema:reviewBody "I will attempt to be as impartial as possible in my review but right from the outset I do believe that the flaw in this magnificently presented tribute' is not in the actresses as most commentary' seem to be intent  particularly on Davis but in the film itself.Libby Davis provides with gusto a controlled deep and thoughtful portrayal of ageing that has soured with time. Hating being dependent on anyone she has to rely heavily on her sister Sarah Gish because of her physical limitations and her near blindness. She provides the backbone to this gentle fable and without her strength we would have little to learn from. Her solo scene in her bedroom with her late husbands clip of hair is touching and heartwarming. Here she is photographed superbly and you come away from this shot reassured that there is timeless and unconditional love still around us in the world somewhere. If there is one fault in her overall performance it is her first scene where appearing to almost glow in the dark like a ghostly image wanting to convey to us her blindness she relies heavily upon her trademark hand and eye movement for which she is renowned for instead of allowing us to observe more gently the introduction of Libby Strong.Gish stands out as truly magnificent. Her denial of an Oscar' nomination for Best Actress is a sad fact for if ever she earned it in the last twenty or so years this was the one. Her expressions and reactions to her fellow characters are without blemish. We feel for Sarah' and are delighted when she gets her picture window. Not solely for the picture window' but more for the fact that Libby' shows her first sign in possibly many years of not giving in to death. Gish also carries her solo scene effortlessly when celebrating alone her beloved husband Philip's memory on their 46th Wedding Anniversary. It's beautiful and elegant.Sothern Carey Jr. and Price add substantial weight to their respective supporting performances and they also give us a little uplift when the spirits' almost seemed to be weighing down with age. Sothern though appears too young for the storyline though in fact she wasn't. Price is grand. His sponge' is likeable and meticulously interpreted though I was always glad when his part had finished I wanted back to the ladies. Carey Jr. could have hung around a bit longer. He was a delight in his too few scenes. He gave it a charge. Davis and Carey Jr. where a good match  I must say!!The fault as far as I'm concerned lay in the storyline and the static photography with the conversation pieces.  We didn't need the real estate scene and we could have had more in depth conversation between Sarah and Libby alone. The hand held photograph viewer scene was the perfect opportunity for a journey into the realm of their respected lives  the sad moment and the happier moment. Again it escaped us on the shoreline when seated on an upturned dinghy. A breath of fresh air from the almost claustrophobic feel of being confined to and around Sarah's home beautiful though it was  this was cinema after all. Then there is the cinematography. Heavily reliant upon editing the camera didn't seem to have any interest in following the cast nor the story. It broke off as if bored to show us Sothern' picking a berry from a bowl then upon approval taking it to share with the others. The entrance back inside the house after their walk to the edge Gish and Sothern broke off from Davis hanging her coat to seating herself when I feel that we could have had more interest for the viewer if we could have done that in a single take. Some POV shots from the arm of the Libby's armchair or her pondering over the ocean when recalling the November chill in her bones remembering her late husbands passing to see the scene as she could only feel it and not seen it could all have been handled better  much better. These are only two of the faults as I have seen them. Anderson deserves much credit for allowing this opportunity see the light of day in such a commercial' day and age. And also some of his handling is gentle and sensitive. However it is obvious that he holds a long held passion for Lillian Gish' in her hey day and this somewhat overshadows the whole project  a deserved as it may be. When you consider the wealth of talent dabbling in their shallow pool of opportunity you can't help but wish that they had made more of their Whale of an opportunity and given us something deeper for the Whales of August to dive away into.Still. it's a golden tribute to America's greatest. Thank you Bette Davis Lillian Gish Sothern Carey Jr. and Price. It's well worth the 88 minutes of watching time just to see you on the screen where you always belonged.".

	schema:headline " Legends and grace!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the last film of Lillian Gish and it has to be the most graceful exit an actor or actress has ever had. All screen legends should have the dignity of their last film being this touching. This story is about two elderly sisters who are staying in their family cottage on the coast of Maine. Lillian Gish plays Sarah Webber the oldest of the two and she is caring for her sister Libby Strong Bette Davis who is blind and maybe in the early stages of senility. They have a neighbor and life long friend in Tisha Ann Sothern who suggests to Sarah that she might want to think of selling the old cottage. An acquantance named Mr. Maranov Vincent Price asks to fish on their shore but he really is fishing around for a place to live. He is of European nobility and full of stories but he has no money and seems to exist on the kindness of others. Both Sarah and Libby are widows and frequently relate events of the past to each other. The film is directed by Lindsay Anderson who usually makes satirical English films and this was his first American feature. He does an adequate job but he has the sense of just allowing the camera to catch every emotion these actors convey. This is not a great film but it is a very special one. Its a very simple story but thats just fine something extra special doesn't have to be happening for this film to work. Gish was an amazing 93 when she made this and even at that age she showed she could carry a film and display an incredible amount of energy. She still had that girlish nature about her and her performance is a revelation. Davis was also incredibly strong but she suffered from having to recite some unbelievable dialogue. I didn't quite buy the scene where she comes out of her bedroom saying she had a dream about her and Sarah. But her best moments come in the quieter scenes. When Davis is gazing at nothing and thinking about her future you can only guess what is going on in her head. I thought she was at her best when the camera would just focus in on her face and she didn't speak. These two actress's were very different in their personalities and Davis was very difficult to work with later in her career. But I read a wonderful thing about the wrapping of this film. When the shooting was done Bette walked over to Lillian Gish and gave her a hug of mutual respect. It was high praise to have a cantankerous Bette Davis show that type of respect. Of course Gish could charm anyone. She spent her career doing it. For you trivia buffs Ann Sotherns real life daughter Tisha Sterling Valley of the Giants plays her as a young woman and Mary Steenburgen plays a young Sarah. This film is a must for all film buffs.".

This is because I particularly drawn to this movie by its cast because I am a MAJOR old movie buff. The thought of seeing Lillian Gish Bette Davis Vincent Price Ann Sothern and Harry Carey Jr. again after all these years made this a mustsee for me but a lot of people have no idea who many or even all of these people are and the slow pace may irritate those who MUST have an action picture or comedy or nothing.I must admit the movie is very slow paced. But instead of this being an impediment I see it as more a slow leisurely movie based on older characters who SHOULD be slow due to their extreme age. What surprised me most was how incredibly spry and capable Lillian Gish was as an actress. I read that she was nearly 100 when this was filmed and she was EXTREMELY hard of hearing but she pulled it off like a pro! Davis though more than a decade younger was much more infirmed and she spent most of her time yelling acting senile and being nastybut that also worked because that was the character she was playing. Unlike Gish and Davis this was not Vincent Price's last movie he did Edward Scissorhands just after this and he is delightful as the charming and soon to be homeless neighbor.Plot? Nah it's not that important herereally. I mean YES there is a plot but it really isn't that importantthe joy of this movie comes from just turning on the camera and watching them do their craft.".

Lillian Gish as Sarah reminded me of one of my grandmother's friends. In some episodes it seemed like she hadn't even changed since her young years only some wrinkles added. I disagree with those who say that Bette Davis is hammy in this film. Some moments with her were really touching and made me feel sad for this woman for example when Sarah says that she encountered a stereoscope with the old family pictures. There is such sadness in Libby's eyes because she won't be able to see those faces she can only remember them in her mind. The episode when she takes out her husband's lock of hair is moving and wonderful she has strange beauty in her face even though the actress' illness is clearly seen in this film the consequences of a stroke etc.. Lillian Gish has beautiful closeups her eyes are unusually expressive. Mr Maranov is strikingly different from so many Russian caricaturelike characters in American movies. He is a man of dignity who says a touching monologue about the beauty of life that can never be too long even if it seems that one has outlived one's time. Tisha seemed to me a little annoying the only weakness of this film. But the film is in my opinion a mustsee because of the two old sisters. It is one of the best duets I have ever seen in the cinema.".

Based on a stage play there is much discussion about how one should go through life knowing it will all end soon. Vincent Price does well as a Russian count who lives off the generosity of others.

The Plot line is predictable but it is the concepts that the director explores along the way that make it interesting an thoughtprovoking assuming you pay attention and didn't just rent it for the bangbang or a chance to see Demi in a wet Tshirt. Ridley make some mistakes but he does some really good things too. Let me comment on what some other people have said and talk about what I think Ridley does well with this film.I think Mr. Scott gets a really excellent performance from Demi. I feel this is her best film but I haven't seen to many because she usually gets on my nerves. However she is believable in the role of a woman who just wants to prove to herself that she can do this. I believe her when she says she doesn't want to be a poster child for women's rights... and the Commander is right in telling her that she's gonna have to wear that hat anyway.Viggo is great too. I don't think too many people knew who he was when this movie came out but he was even billed above Anne Bancroft. Someone said he looks embarrassed in every scene... hogwash. He looks like a very tough character in a very difficult situation. He knows that the issue is not whether a woman can make it many can. This isn't about women's rights... this is about how men mainly YOUNG men relate to women in stressful situations. If all soldiers were in their late thirties emotionally and psychologically then the issue would be much smaller. Most of these guys are young dumb and full of... you know the rhyme. I was there too once upon a time. Viggo is excellent he reacts the way many military instructors would... trying to stop the inevitable fighting against politicians way over his head who have never been in the crap but think they know better. Pay attention you can just see that he respects LT O'Neil. But he believes he has to make an example out of her. Ms. Bancroft is excellent as well some people say over the top they obviously haven't had to deal with high level politics before. Perhaps she is a bit rough for reality but remember it is a movie making a point and being entertaining things have to be gritty... and Senate will always be more vicious than any military training. I find her performance fun and a joy to watch.I don't know if Mr. Scott has any military training but he does a better job of conveying the realities of it to the screen than most. Yes the SERE segment goes farther than real SERE training would go... but not by much. Talk to someone who's been through it. It would not have been the same group of instructors... it's a very specialized field and the instructors have extensive psychological screening and training. However I'll give that one to Ridley he's trying not to complicate the plot and he needs the scene with Master Chief Urgayle. BTW Women do go through SERE sometimes... and the instructors do use them against the men's emotions.As for other Militray stuff much of the language feelings about chain of command frustration with training constraints and political acovering was On The Spot. I speak from 6 years of experience as an Army officer some of the stuff you see on active duty is amazing but in the end it all balances out and the US Armed Forces are still the best in the world. Even the way Ridley has to frig with the plot to put the trainees in a an actual firefight was plausible... not possible but plausible. Remember it is a movie he's got to have a real combat situation to entertain the dumber audience who just came to see the boom. But Ridley even goes far enough to give the Master Chief a chance to back out. It is a group of Navy SEAL trainees deep into their training cycle with a buttload of prior experience IF you pay attention you will note that one of the trainees is a US Army Ranger one a Marine probably from RECON these are guys who know the job already and this is true to reality. You are also talking about a straight forward mission facilitating extraction of US Army Rangers from the deep inland mission. Ridley even has that right this would be a Ranger mission and the Specops community may do a joint op where the SEALS secure the seaside extraction point.Quite frankly... the movie is better than most people could have done. Matter of fact I think it was a tough challenge for Mr. Scott and don't think anyone could have done much better. One bad point I agree with is that artistically the movie is shot entirely too dark.. that's about the worst thing I can say about it though. As for plot predictability... how often do you REALLY see an original plotline?One last comment. I was at the Army Officer's Advance Course when this movie came out. There was a group of Officer's that were gong to see this movie ostensibly to have a good laugh. These were Rangerqualified Infantry guys a Marine officer from RECON a couple guys going to or coming from SF training... all Type A's. The next day they weren't laughing... they just said you know what that wasn't half bad. That don't sound like much but it's high praise from that group.Probably why this has such a poor rating is because it isn't Hollywood enough for the lowestcommondenominator crowd.Enjoy the film.".

However I saw its main point as trying to promote a cando scenario for women in the military I am a female veteran of 24 years and I think several things in the movie do just the opposite.  If the idea problem or goal is to prove that women can succeed in a traditionally male career task or training then that should be presented while maintaining the woman's gender.  What I mean is O'Neil doesn't succeed until she shaves her head shorter than the men's  and unnecessary bulks up to the point where her body fat falls below normal and she ceases to menstruate and generally becomes one of the boys.  The point is she's a woman not a man.  She shouldn't have to become a man to prove she can succeed with a group of men. This is painfully clear when she screams Suck my dick at the Sergeant. The obvious point is that since she's a woman she doesn't have one of those.  Nor should she need to metaphorically develop one in order to succeed.  Another point I'd like to make is that her dialogue as a prisoner of war was ridiculous.  The object is to survive.  If you don't your mission has failed.  Taunting bragging and arguing with captors is a big NONO.  Her I'm sorry am I supposed to be afraid? line would have gotten her stripped naked and suspended under a water hose for hours.

	schema:reviewBody "Actress Demi Moore shaves her head dons fatigues and totes a machine gun in British director Ridley Scott's opportune but exploitative G.I. Jane a sexual equality polemic about the first female to graduate as a Navy SEAL. This lackluster basic training epic serves up a volatile but exemplary message about equal rights and the armed forces that cost the filmmakers the aid of the Department of Defense. When G.I. Jane isn't preaching gender parity this cynical but slickly done Top Gun clone is gung ho on showing Moore kicking butt in the kind of role her husband Bruce Willis excels. Sadly G.I. Jane's melodramatic storyline combines with its juvenile heroics to undermine what little credibility it musters as a socially conscious exercise in political correctness.Writers David The FugitiveTwohy and Danielle Alexandra collaborated on what can only be called a prefabricated screenplay. G.I. Jane marches to the familiar beat that has characterized the formulaic military service picture since the 1920s. Movies such as Courage Under Fire Heartbreak Ridge and Stripes. have done what G.I. Jane tries to do. Moreover they have done it better. Basically the plots and the heroics in military pictures remain the same only the sex of the hero has changed with G.I. Jane. The TwohyAlexandra script alternates between Congressional and Naval brainstorming sessions about Lt. O'Neil and the obstacles she confronts at the SEAL training base in Florida. A shrewd but slippery Texas Senator Lillian DeHaven Anne Bancroft cuts a deal with the future Secretary of the Navy Theodore Hayes Daniel Von Bergan. He'll snag her vote of approval if the Navy opens its elite SEAL commando school to a woman. Secretary Hayes caves in to Senator DeHaven's request but squirms when she demands approval of the SEAL candidate.DeHaven picks Lt. Jordan O'Neil Demi Moore for her physical agility and her keen mind. O'Neil is the kind of woman who makes men nervous. When we first meet her she is monitoring a satellite transmission with a commando unit trying to escape from enemy country. She arouses the hostility of her male superior officer when she provides the best solution to the extraction problem. But Lt. O'Neil is not a person easily ignored. Neither Senator DeHaven nor Secretary Hayes expects her to finish the course. After all Navy SEALs are the most demanding and merciless elite combat force in the world. Sixty percent of the recruits who enter the program wash out.When the press snaps photos of O'Neil on SEAL maneuvers a controversy erupts in both the Pentagon and Congress. Secretary Hayes and Senator DeHaven sought to keep the project under wraps but the news wants to interview O'Neil. Suddenly O'Neil finds herself caught in the middle of a JAG investigation.Guys will relish the last halfhour of G.I. Jane. That's when the bullets start to fly. During a training exercise in the Mediterranean Sea the SEALs get to help out U.S. troops retrieving a fallen satellite in Libya. This part of the script is straight out of a Star Trek movie because the SEAL recruits are the only force close enough to respond to the situation. Nobody else can rescue these troops so the Master Chief Viggo Mortensen takes his recruits into battle. Unfortunately things go sour and the Master Chief catches a bullet. He sends O'Neil packing but she refuses to leave him to his fate. Instead O'Neil figures out the master chief's escape plan and stages an ambush to wipe out his adversaries. Not since World War II Nazi movies have the enemy been so gullible and easy to kill. These Libyan soldiers present about as much a threat to the SEALs as the Iraqi soldiers did to Charlie Sheen in the Hot Shots movies.Demi Moore knocks herself out as Navy Intelligence officer Lt. Jordan O'Neil. Even her character's name has a masculine quality to it. When Demi isn't trying to impress us with her brains she displays her feminine brawn. The calisthenics that she performs in her tight undies defy gravity. The onearmed pushups are enough to make you break into a sweat. All of this resembles the grunge side of last summer's idiotic opus Striptease except that frontal nudity is avoided. Moore's performance to her credit here is both straightforward and serious even when O'Neil plays toy soldier in the last reel.Veteran actress Anne Bancroft of Point of No Return shines as the crafty Texas senator whose willing to use as well as abuse Lt. O'Neil to save her own congressional bacon. This is Bancroft's juiciest role in years and she plays it to the hilt. Her best scene with O'Neil has Bancroft's cagey Senator explaining why women in combat will remain a hot issue. According to DeHaven lawmakers fear the political suicide that television images of dead women being shipped home in body bags would prompt. Director Ridley Scott pulls some slick optical tricks to bolster G. I. Jane but they don't beef up the action. Jiggling his camera during the combat scenes may create disorientation in audience but it doesn't trigger a rush of adrenalin. This artsy gimmick doesn't generate either tension or suspense. Anyway you know that Demi Moore isn't going to get a scratch on her because she's smart enough to dodge the bullets that stupid men are firing at her.Simply Scott doesn't make G.I. Jane rock and roll. The grueling training sequences are okay but the final combat scenes resemble Boy Scout antics compared with even a marginal effort like In The Army Now. Ridley Scott has produced some memorable films that deploy women in gender stretching roles such as Alien and Thelma  Louise. G.I. Jane boasts none of the art hype or viscera of those movies. In the commercially oriented market place if the next movie doesn't top the last trouble lies ahead. Compared with last summer's dignified masterpiece Courage Under Fire G.I. Jane amounts to sheer hokum.".

The TwohyAlexandra script alternates between Congressional and Naval brainstorming sessions about Lt. O'Neil and the obstacles she confronts at the SEAL training base in Florida. A shrewd but slippery Texas Senator Lillian DeHaven Anne Bancroft cuts a deal with the future Secretary of the Navy Theodore Hayes Daniel Von Bergan. He'll snag her vote of approval if the Navy opens its elite SEAL commando school to a woman. Secretary Hayes caves in to Senator DeHaven's request but squirms when she demands approval of the SEAL candidate.DeHaven picks Lt. Jordan O'Neil Demi Moore for her physical agility and her keen mind. O'Neil is the kind of woman who makes men nervous. When we first meet her she is monitoring a satellite transmission with a commando unit trying to escape from enemy country. She arouses the hostility of her male superior officer when she provides the best solution to the extraction problem. But Lt. O'Neil is not a person easily ignored. Neither Senator DeHaven nor Secretary Hayes expects her to finish the course. After all Navy SEALs are the most demanding and merciless elite combat force in the world. Sixty percent of the recruits who enter the program wash out.When the press snaps photos of O'Neil on SEAL maneuvers a controversy erupts in both the Pentagon and Congress. Secretary Hayes and Senator DeHaven sought to keep the project under wraps but the news wants to interview O'Neil. Suddenly O'Neil finds herself caught in the middle of a JAG investigation.Guys will relish the last halfhour of G.I. Jane. That's when the bullets start to fly. During a training exercise in the Mediterranean Sea the SEALs get to help out U.S. troops retrieving a fallen satellite in Libya. This part of the script is straight out of a Star Trek movie because the SEAL recruits are the only force close enough to respond to the situation. Nobody else can rescue these troops so the Master Chief Viggo Mortensen takes his recruits into battle. Unfortunately things go sour and the Master Chief catches a bullet. He sends O'Neil packing but she refuses to leave him to his fate. Instead O'Neil figures out the master chief's escape plan and stages an ambush to wipe out his adversaries. Not since World War II Nazi movies have the enemy been so gullible and easy to kill. These Libyan soldiers present about as much a threat to the SEALs as the Iraqi soldiers did to Charlie Sheen in the Hot Shots movies.Demi Moore knocks herself out as Navy Intelligence officer Lt. Jordan O'Neil. Even her character's name has a masculine quality to it. When Demi isn't trying to impress us with her brains she displays her feminine brawn. The calisthenics that she performs in her tight undies defy gravity. The onearmed pushups are enough to make you break into a sweat. All of this resembles the grunge side of last summer's idiotic opus Striptease except that frontal nudity is avoided. Moore's performance to her credit here is both straightforward and serious even when O'Neil plays toy soldier in the last reel.Veteran actress Anne Bancroft of Point of No Return shines as the crafty Texas senator whose willing to use as well as abuse Lt. O'Neil to save her own congressional bacon. This is Bancroft's juiciest role in years and she plays it to the hilt. Her best scene with O'Neil has Bancroft's cagey Senator explaining why women in combat will remain a hot issue. According to DeHaven lawmakers fear the political suicide that television images of dead women being shipped home in body bags would prompt. Director Ridley Scott pulls some slick optical tricks to bolster G. I. Jane but they don't beef up the action. Jiggling his camera during the combat scenes may create disorientation in audience but it doesn't trigger a rush of adrenalin. This artsy gimmick doesn't generate either tension or suspense. Anyway you know that Demi Moore isn't going to get a scratch on her because she's smart enough to dodge the bullets that stupid men are firing at her.Simply Scott doesn't make G.I. Jane rock and roll. The grueling training sequences are okay but the final combat scenes resemble Boy Scout antics compared with even a marginal effort like In The Army Now. Ridley Scott has produced some memorable films that deploy women in gender stretching roles such as Alien and Thelma  Louise. G.I. Jane boasts none of the art hype or viscera of those movies. In the commercially oriented market place if the next movie doesn't top the last trouble lies ahead. Compared with last summer's dignified masterpiece Courage Under Fire G.I. Jane amounts to sheer hokum.";

I have to say that actually I enjoyed G.I. Jane I think that the rating on IMDb is a little unfair but I can let it go. My problem with the film was the way it ended it just turned into those big twist stories that wasn't really needed because you are just rooting for Demi to make it throughout training and there is always some kind of block to make the audience interested.Jorden O'Neil has been given a very special assignment the army does not feel the need for equal opportunity for women when it comes to their jobs. But Sen. Lillian DeHaven wishes for them to give one woman a chance to prove herself that she can do a man's job she gives this assignment to Jorden Jorden isn't just given any average boot camp but the SEALS which is the toughest boot camp around. Of course no one will accept her into their teams but she pulls her way through to prove that no one will hold her down.I loved how hard Jorden kept pushing herself Demi did a great job in showing the hardships of what it is still like to be the outsider in a man's world. Like I said the only main problem was that it just didn't need a little twist you'll see what I mean it just could have been cut like 30 minutes shorter.

	schema:reviewBody "G.I. Jane is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS the most elite and toughest training. Now O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and cowritten by the creator of the Chronicles of Riddick series I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like Pitch Black that much so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it.Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill a tough nononsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in this is my favourite one yet. She's strongwilled determined and as the film goes on she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of The Expendables Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head forms abs and gets totally ripped she is still incredibly hot.Viggo Mortensen plays John the Master Chief. No not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal mean and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword.The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going Yeah I couldn't do that. That's just gross. Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place.The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like Full Metal Jacket in the way that once they leave bootcamp the movie goes downhill. But unlike Full Metal Jacket the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool.Overall I highly enjoyed G.I. Jane. I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on BluRay.".

Instead it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play makebelieve with the boys.And that's what this movie ultimately is  Hollywood makebelieve. The training sequences are over the top. The politics  over the top. The political correctness  over the top. The combat scenes  you guessed it over the top. Your mission is to get in and get out without being detected. So what do you do? Why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible of course. Oh G.I. Jane you can be my wing man anytime.The premise is good but as soon as Hollywood gets a hold of it we end up with Top Gun with tits.What more is to be expected from commercial US films anymore? Not much I guess.".

But she came out bruised and smiling.

In Paris he is just starting to film his latest movie a remake of Les vampires 1915 and has hired Hong Kong based Chinese actress Maggie Cheung as the title lead Irma Vep an anagram for vampire despite she knowing no French and she not being an obvious choice to most. Maggie has never worked with Vidal before and knows little about his movies but many of his primarily French crew are part of his regular stable. As such Maggie may become isolated among the cast and crew unless there are those who bring her into their English conversations they who may have somewhat ulterior motives in doing so. There are also factions within the cast and crew who based on their history have a poisoned sense of what is going on. With Vidal he is dealing with some personal issues while he tries to regain his film making form. He may transfer his...";

She is perfect as the exotic object the ephemeral other the object of desire who finds herself at the centre of the film's obsessive and sexually driven visual vortex.In the privacy of her hotel room Maggie Cheung zips herself into a fullbody black latex catsuit which is going to be her vampire costume on the film set the next day. Maybe she is just getting into character or maybe she shares something of the director's fascination with nocturnal life... predatory sexuality... visual fixation... the bound female form... anyway the film really comes to life as she creeps through the hotel her haunting feline eyes piercing through the spookysexy costume... the suspense here is that she is enacting her own vampire fantasy of her own accord not under the director's gaze. Maggie Cheung all alone on the roof in the rain exploring her own version of a male fantasy sequence. This is an unforgettable moment in arthouse cinema.The film really does justice to its themes with the male characters degenerating from visionaries into voyeurs and the female characters showing real depth in their willingness to accommodate the male gaze without losing their savvy postfem powers. If you are a predictable guy like me you will love the FrenchAsian grrrl power which gives the film a pulse.The theme of visual obsession is presented very well the director is shouting the cameras are rolling and Maggie Cheung in her catsuit is ready to suck blood. In these moments she is bound but free powerless but in control objectified but liberated. I suppose this makes the film contentious and provocative but I thought the message was very clear.Without spoiling the end of the film the last five minutes of Irma Vep is totally unique. You will never see another film which ends like this one. I can only describe it as a profoundly futile gesture an act of great passion and impotence and a brilliant moment in Lettrist art. It is Rene Vidal's last stand a terrible but beautiful moment caught on celluloid the work of a madman? a savant? a genius? you can decide but I am sure you will agree that Irma Vep does a lot more than just scratch the surface of modern film art.If you like Irma Vep check out Shadow Of The Vampire as well.".

For one to get someone to play themselves in a lead role in a fictional film Jackie Chan films and Roy Rogers aside is usually a risky thing to do. But Cheung fits in beautifully and is so charming that she is obviously perfectly cast.The film is in English and French and even though the French is subtitled I think it's easier to get caught up in the flow of the film if you understand both I'm fluent in French and didn't have a problem but I can see where it might be overly distracting. Some scenes seemed particularly important for one to be constantly looking away from the action so to speak.The film was a little long and some scenes probably could have been cut down or cut altogether but it gives a good view into French filmmaking especially the snobbish elitism that is apparently common in more intellectualartistic film circles. It's hysterically funny at some points and the characterization of the different crew members is brilliantly portrayed.I especially loved the scene where Maggie Cheung gets into characters by actually prowling around as a cat burglar though she throws away her bootyOverall a tight well done film. It drags just a bit at points but strong acting and strong writing help to overcome such lags. A pleasant surprise and a fun film! 810.".

It's not very often that a film strikes me as not having enough of a plot but in the case of this there did seem to be a certain irrelevance to it all. There's nothing really new about the making a movie movie and this doesn't add much to the mix although i do think it is well done for what it is and occasionally even approaches a sort of protoLost in Translation with Paris standing in for Tokyo and Maggie Cheung's Asian otherness replacing Bill Murray's fishoutofwater Americanness. But the film is never really focused enough to compare in any significant way to that film. Irma Vep really only comes alive when Assayas gets away from his nagging tendency towards a certain French talkiness and indulges in the moments of pure visual cinema that make up the other half of his general approach and which seem to be invested with much more enthusiasm here  such as the scene scored to Sonic Youth's Tunic another foreshadowing of Demonlover. Certainly he does have a way with capturing pretty little images of neon lights reflecting through car windows and things like that enough that I can acknowledge he is definitely a talented filmmaker but within this film he never quite finds the correct way to integrate his little artistic flourishes into the whole and overall the film feels more like a collection of separate ideas than a cohesive statement of any kind.".

Good natured well acted and occasionally brave but also occasionally obscure I quite enjoyed this and it did provoke some thinking. But I couldn't see it as the super deep film some did.

	schema:headline " Irma Vep or Eerma Wep? Who cares in this friendly eccentric movie about making a movie?";
	schema:reviewBody "What the world needs is a movie about producing a book. You know the creative angst of the author as he tries to remember when to use which and when to use that the nasty arguments over choosing a typeface the dust jacket tantrums about artistic integrity if both boobs are shown or just one the cattiness of the editors and perhaps most insightful whether the proofreading will continue to be the night guard's responsibility during his dinner break or whether the delivery boy from the next door deli should be given a crack at it. Until that movie is made Irma Vep will have to do. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed but there are absolutely no spoilers here or in the movie. Irma Vep is a movie about making a movie and it's stuffed with angst pettiness tantrums ego and confusion. Taken on one of its own terms  is it any good just as a movie  the answer in my opinion is a loud yes. Forget all the inside cineaste stuff it is French after all and you may find that Irma Vep is funny not just clever. It's goodnatured with a friendly performance by Hong Kong kung fu heroine Maggie Cheung playing herself. Most of all it is so eccentric a movie I seldom could stop smiling. Rene Vidal JeanPierre Leaud an aging New Wave director now well past his sellby date is planning a comeback. He'll remake a long long and long ago silent movie called Les Vampires a movie about a gang of criminals who prowl and stalk. One them in a skintight black body suit and black mask is named Irma Vep. She will be Vidal's inspiration. He has just the star in mind to play Irma...Maggie Cheung. Maggie who doesn't speak French shows up in Paris ready to work. Cast and crew snipe and argue in many minidramas. Vidal collapses. Cast and crew snipe and argue some more. Maggie an outsider and quite taken by the black latex outfit she and the costume designer Zoe Nathalie Richard picked up cheap at a Parisian sex shop whiles away the time one night by creeping about her hotel wearing the suit. Like Irma Vep Maggie sees things in the hallways and rooms some worth taking and then there is the nighttime rain and the high outside fire escape leading up to the hotel's roof. All does not go well for the movie. Eventually Maggie leaves for New York to take a meeting with Ridley Scott. Not much there I know except for director and writer Olivier Assayas' amusing style and Maggie Cheung's bemusement and lithe creeping. There is much pleasure in Assayas' take on movie making and movie people but the pleasure for me comes from noticing how I came to rather enjoy and like all those behindthescenes groupies workers and jerks. The dish of course is amusing. Directors thrive on hypocrisy says one. Yeah says another but sometimes they go overboard. The interview between Maggie and a young intense film enthusiast is priceless...John Woo versus JeanLuc Godard. The film enthusiast has strong opinions about both. Maggie doesn't.

	onyx:emotionText "What the world needs is a movie about producing a book. You know the creative angst of the author as he tries to remember when to use which and when to use that the nasty arguments over choosing a typeface the dust jacket tantrums about artistic integrity if both boobs are shown or just one the cattiness of the editors and perhaps most insightful whether the proofreading will continue to be the night guard's responsibility during his dinner break or whether the delivery boy from the next door deli should be given a crack at it. Until that movie is made Irma Vep will have to do. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed but there are absolutely no spoilers here or in the movie. Irma Vep is a movie about making a movie and it's stuffed with angst pettiness tantrums ego and confusion. Taken on one of its own terms  is it any good just as a movie  the answer in my opinion is a loud yes. Forget all the inside cineaste stuff it is French after all and you may find that Irma Vep is funny not just clever. It's goodnatured with a friendly performance by Hong Kong kung fu heroine Maggie Cheung playing herself. Most of all it is so eccentric a movie I seldom could stop smiling. Rene Vidal JeanPierre Leaud an aging New Wave director now well past his sellby date is planning a comeback. He'll remake a long long and long ago silent movie called Les Vampires a movie about a gang of criminals who prowl and stalk. One them in a skintight black body suit and black mask is named Irma Vep. She will be Vidal's inspiration. He has just the star in mind to play Irma...Maggie Cheung. Maggie who doesn't speak French shows up in Paris ready to work. Cast and crew snipe and argue in many minidramas. Vidal collapses. Cast and crew snipe and argue some more. Maggie an outsider and quite taken by the black latex outfit she and the costume designer Zoe Nathalie Richard picked up cheap at a Parisian sex shop whiles away the time one night by creeping about her hotel wearing the suit. Like Irma Vep Maggie sees things in the hallways and rooms some worth taking and then there is the nighttime rain and the high outside fire escape leading up to the hotel's roof. All does not go well for the movie. Eventually Maggie leaves for New York to take a meeting with Ridley Scott. Not much there I know except for director and writer Olivier Assayas' amusing style and Maggie Cheung's bemusement and lithe creeping. There is much pleasure in Assayas' take on movie making and movie people but the pleasure for me comes from noticing how I came to rather enjoy and like all those behindthescenes groupies workers and jerks. The dish of course is amusing. Directors thrive on hypocrisy says one. Yeah says another but sometimes they go overboard. The interview between Maggie and a young intense film enthusiast is priceless...John Woo versus JeanLuc Godard. The film enthusiast has strong opinions about both. Maggie doesn't. Maggie Cheung gives a sweet center to this movie but I liked just as much Nathalie Richard as Zoe the lean blonde tentative cigarettesmoking girlliking costume designer. She's past her prime if you're a teenage boy but right at her peak if you're an adult of either sex. Film lovers might enjoy one message. Cinema is not magic. It's a technique and a science.

I hate that postmodern shtick.  Besides I just assumed that director Olivier Assayas had a crush on Maggie Cheung  understandable  and came up with the movie as a thin pretext to doll her up like Catwoman. So it feels almost like a preemptive strike when JeanPierre Leaud playing himself playing Francois Truffaut playing Olivier Assayas  clears his throat and intones Films are based on desires.  That may be true but good directors have desires that go beyond the fetishistic.  Luckily Olivier Assayas is a good director.  Not great but good.His saving grace is his skill at imparting a documentary feel to wholly fictional material.  I say saving grace because the fictional material here is actually IMmaterial.  It's the latest in a seemingly neverending stream of what I'll call AntiFilms  films about the boredom of making films.  The most recent example of this pestilent subgenre is Tom DiCillo's Living in Oblivion but the best is Fassbinder's Beware of a Holy Whore. As for JeanLuc Godard's Contempt to which Irma Vep is hilariously compared on the back of the video box that movie is only incidentally about moviemaking and primarily about ambition and betrayal.And Irma Vep?  Really it's just a chance for us outsiders to observe what it's like to work on a film set.  We believe what we're seeing because Assayas has a gift for making us feel like we're watching reality unfold right under our noses.  In fact the movie feels a lot more real than say The Real World probably because actors playing actors are more convincing than snotty frat boys playing snotty frat boys.  At any rate the camera just sort of bounces around these characters without passing judgment just casually observing no momentum.  It ain't much but it's still a lot of fun if you're in the right mood.  Maggie Cheung is indeed delectable and doesn't suffer from having no real role to play.  To the contrary  her helplessness in a Paris far from home endears her to us.  No less endearing is the frazzled wardrobe girl with an unrequited crush on Maggie.  In the end the life of a movie pro comes off as rather sad considering their friendships are doomed to end as soon as the director says It's a wrap! Or in this case as soon the director has a nervous breakdown and retires to the country.Only drawback  if you're a New Wave aficionado and watched JeanPierre Leaud grow up you will be horribly depressed by how old he has become. He looks  and sounds  very harsh.  It almost ruined the movie for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Jaglom has often been accused justifiably of self indulgent movie making. A Safe Place is no exception yet here it's an indulgence in experimenting with cinematic form itself. As always with Jaglom it's a pretty mixed bag. There are scenes with some striking moments but many which ramble on for much too long.The question remains does this experiment work ? The answer has to be  no. But the attempt itself is not without interest. While much of the film will certainly test your patience the rewards are there though not as predominant as to make one want to champion this as a film that should be seen.The film is centered round Tuesday Weld. Weld has always been something of an enigma. The movie persona of her earlier films established her firmly in the mind of the public as yet another pretty blonde. It took her a long time to shake this off. This need to find herself as an actress to be reckoned with must surely have drawn her to this project written and directed by a newcomer. Her beauty and talent are in abundance here. This may have led to her next big role made the following year Play It As It Lays. Sadly despite a great performance Weld never seemed to be able to prove her worth to the wider public or indeed the studios and moved towards a career in mainstream television movies in which she still managed to shine.A Safe Place boasts an intriguing cast. Alongside Weld is Orson Welles a close friend of Jaglom's obviously having much fun as a magician of sorts as well as a young and as always devilish Jack Nicholson. Jaglom allows them much room for improvisation. He once related having written a scene for Nicholson and Weld it somehow wasn't working. His feeling was that knowing them personally they were both far more interesting people than the scene he had written for them showed. He simply let them improvise their dialog.A Safe Place is the kind of film that sounds more interesting than is actually the case. I for one despite being in favor of much of Jaglom's work and certainly that of Welles Nicholson and Weld am reticent in recommending it. For those with special interest in these people or the times New York 1971 there will be points of interest but I must admit to being ultimately somewhat let down to what I sensed could have been far more than what I found.".

	onyx:emotionText "Henry Jaglom has often been accused justifiably of self indulgent movie making. A Safe Place is no exception yet here it's an indulgence in experimenting with cinematic form itself. As always with Jaglom it's a pretty mixed bag. There are scenes with some striking moments but many which ramble on for much too long.The question remains does this experiment work ? The answer has to be  no. But the attempt itself is not without interest. While much of the film will certainly test your patience the rewards are there though not as predominant as to make one want to champion this as a film that should be seen.The film is centered round Tuesday Weld. Weld has always been something of an enigma. The movie persona of her earlier films established her firmly in the mind of the public as yet another pretty blonde. It took her a long time to shake this off. This need to find herself as an actress to be reckoned with must surely have drawn her to this project written and directed by a newcomer. Her beauty and talent are in abundance here. This may have led to her next big role made the following year Play It As It Lays. Sadly despite a great performance Weld never seemed to be able to prove her worth to the wider public or indeed the studios and moved towards a career in mainstream television movies in which she still managed to shine.A Safe Place boasts an intriguing cast.

He makes a film every couple of years they play in like three cities in America and no one seems to like them. A Safe Place was his first film adapted from his own play which he wrote in 1964. Tuesday Weld plays an insufferable hippie chick who doesn't want to grow up. Phil Proctor is a square who wants desperately to bone her so he puts up with her nonsense he knows that she's half crazy but that's why he wants to be there. Eventually a much more exciting Jack Nicholson shows up and steals her away. Orson Welles plays a magician who occasionally enchants Weld with his magic. Gwen Welles whom you might remember from Altman's films California Split and Nashville in her film debut also appears and rambles on about her dreams of being sexually assaulted. The film is pretty and that prettiness is very much augmented by Tuesday Weld's enchanting beauty. But honestly there's not much going on here. It's very repetitive there are some nice old songs on the soundtrack but each of them plays all the way through like three times and well boring.".

Weld is wonderful in her characterization of a simple juvenile young woman caught in the limbo between innocence and adulthood. This film is from the period which I consider Weld's peak. She is beautiful charming and completely earnest in her delivery.Others in the cast are interesting at best. Orson Welles is good as the father figure in Weld's life. Philip Proctor is not much acting wise but at least he has a pleasant voice. That seems to have helped his career in the years following this film. Jack Nicholson is his typical cocky slimy character in this one. I didn't feel his acting was anything new here but his presence makes for an interesting triangle relationship.The editing is choppy utilizing audio and image clips flashing by altered and repeated again. It would seem to get old after a while and it does to some degree but it's effective nonetheless. There are some good vignettes here and there throughout the film namely a scene where Weld describes to Proctor the importance of telephone exchanges. Not every actress could pull this off well but Weld does so with empathy and charm...brilliant! The Ouija board scene also stands out as do the ones of Weld and Welles in Central Park Zoo.A fascinating and surprisingly engaging film. If for no other reason it's worth watching for Weld's performance.".

That sentiment can be said of so many flaky relationships with supposed 'magical beauty' that 90 of the viewers have already experienced or will experience. This movie does absolutely nothing to justify or caution the naive lustful immaturity of the whole ordeal. If anything it exploits Noah for being an overly attractive airhead that men put up with in order for sex. And as long as they do she will eventually put out for them. I found this more distasteful of any Russ Myers or Roger Cormanesque 'Grindhouse Sexploitation' movie I've ever come across. And believe me I like those movies A LOT!

Billy Bob and his sensational young co star Brett Kelly create characters never seen before on the screen and as a consequence we cling on to their every nuance incapable to predict what could happen next. That in itself makes Bad Santa a very welcome surprise and a great time at the movies.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw Terry Zwigoff's latest effort coexecutive produced by the Coen brothers Bad Santa I didn't know whether I was watching a comedy that had astonishingly funny and madcap moments or if it was a really bad movie. At times the script felt like it was under the penmanship of demented cretins off loan of some lowrent porno company. But there were scenes and moments with good old Billy Bob Thornton that had me laughing uncontrollably so I decided to see it again recently. Now I understand it this is a digin nails ribald hardcore satirical look at one unkept is a term used loosely man in the midst of Americana during Christmas time. This man is Willie played by Billy Bob as something of a loser lowself esteem boozing cursing and a thief though only at Christmas time. In a sense he's a modern day pirate without a shave though with a yearly plan to rob a large store in a given mall he's given a job at with his copatriot Marcus Tony Cox whom you may recall from uproarious bit parts in Friday and Me Myself and Irene. In one season however he meets a Kid Brent Kelly who for some reason looks up to this conman in a red suit giving him a place to stay in turn never asked for for some advice and help with bullies and selfesteem. On the first viewing of Bad Santa along with not knowing whether I was seeing a good or bad film I didn't know whether Billy Bob was pushing the 'rottendude' envelope over the top or just right. This may be a problem for most viewers going to see it once and not thinking of seeing it again. But I think Bad Santa is one of those movies that merits a repeat viewing you may laugh less or harder at certain jokes and moments of outrageousness some may fly over your head completely or make you go eww. Yet I think the brilliant aspect about Bad Santa is it never takes itself a bit too seriously. Even in the denouement when we are sort of assured things will turn out alright it's like a denouement on a South Park episode. In fact that's something that can be said about Bad Santa is that it feels like a work in the vein of Parker and Stone but since it's from the director of Ghost World it comes off a little fresher with an appeal all its own.".

Soke and his assistant Marcus Skidmore are professional thieves. Every year Willie disguises himself as a department store Santa Claus and Marcus disguises himself as an elf in order for both of them to rob the store at night using Marcus' wife Lois as their getaway driver and accomplice. Marcus takes his duty as an elf seriously but Willie is a sexaddicted alcoholic and is gradually unable to perform his Santa duties appropriately with children plus likewise a diminish in his safecracking performance much to Marcus' dismay. When they are hired at the Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix the following year the vulgar remarks made by Willie shock the prudish mall manager Bob Chipeska who brings them to the attention of security chief Gin Slagel.Now this film has had 4 different cuts. 1 The Theatrical Cut 2 Unrated Extended Edition Aka Bader Santa 3 The Director's Cut 4 The Television CutNow my preferred version of this film is the Unrated Bader Santa edition. This film is funny! It is mean spirited at times but it is not trying at all to be a Politically Correct Hallmark Movie.Billy Bob Thornton is very good in the role. However the late John Ritter and Bernie Mac are gold here! Lauren Tom is unrecognizable here but she is funny! There is several upsetting images in this film but if you have a funny bone and you want to laugh then watch. Watch this Anytime of the year. It will make you laugh.".

His partner in crime is Tony Cox Santa's little person helper who keeps him sober and lucid enough through the season to not royally screw things up.I won't go into details because frankly the plot needs work. But the acting is superb the script hysterical and the unbelievable jokes and inappropriate situations are just so entertaining you won't care about anything else.Bernie Mac and Lauren Graham deliver polished supporting roles as does John Ritter in his final film role before his death. The kid doesn't have many lines and I want to slap him for the ones he does deliver but just looking at him makes me laugh so I can't complain there.Basically this is the ultimate inappropriate Christmas movie one that makes you stand up and scream Holly s!t I can't believe they did that! This movie is just so blatantly wrong the only other film I can compare it to is South Park The Movie. Just as South Park crosses every line of decency that previously existed so does BS. A great movie because of it? Hell no. But a funny and entertaining one? Hell yes!".

For those of you who are fedup with clichd Christmas films Bad Santa is the perfect film for you as it is an entirely altered perception of a nowconsumerist holiday. No Bad Santa is not It's a Wonderful Life Miracle on 34th Street and nor is it Home Alone yet it still incorporates features from all of those films and that is what makes it such a special take on the Winter holiday.Willie played by Billy Bob Thornton is a perverted alcoholic parttime conman who during the Christmas season indolently works in shopping malls with his fellow criminal in disguise Marcus Tony Cox. Willie dresses as Santa while Marcus the more professional of the pair acts the elf due to his height. Throughout the tedious Christmas period the pair use their job at the mall to exploit the opportunity to rob the store overnight. While working at a mall in Arizona Willie meets a child who teaches him the meaning of Christmas whilst falling in love with an attractive waitress and having lawenforcement hot on his trail.When a film starts off with a guy in a Santa outfit sitting at a bar drinking his life away you know you are not watching your average tale of good tidings. From the crude opening narration to the wonderfully inflated finale Bad Santa is a taste of comedic genius. Billy Bob Thornton performs as a crude dishonest cynic who hates everyone and everything. Bringing comedic energy and offensive characteristics to his character he impeccably balances the grumpy scrooge of Christmas with heart. I honestly believe that Billy Bob Thornton's performance in Bad Santa was worthy of an Oscar nomination.It is not a case of whether you are a lover of Christmas or not although it would come as an advantage when viewing the film as Bad Santa is continually entertaining and at times even charming. Through its witty script fuelled by grumpy drunken humour it is almost impossible not to become entranced by the inconsiderate lines of raucous profanity. Director Terry Zwigoff proves his quirky talent once again after the success of 2000's Ghost World. Bad Santa is comedic bliss and a highly recommended comedy for fans of something a little more extreme than the average feelgood Hollywood extravaganza.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am sick of most the Scroogetype Christmas movies where the main character does not initially believe in Christmas or is too busy to celebrate Christmas and in the end he's all celebrating it with some strangers because he's become kind hearted. 'Bad Santa' comes as a breath of fresh air. Many people have criticized it because they were expecting the usual boring sugarcoated winter holiday flick and thus the use of bad language may have come across as a huge shock. Well 'Bad Santa' certainly ain't for the kids. While the swearing and cussing provide humour they also make the characters more authentic.'Bad Santa' in spite of the language and sexual content is kind of a sweet movie. Zwigoff does a great job as the director. It's not a brainless tasteless comedy as it does deal with some themes quite sensibly. I laughed out loud at the dialogues and oneliners and in the end I was left with a grin on my face. Ficarra and Requa's writing is very good. We're provided with 90 minutes of wholesome entertainment. Even though the protagonist Willie isn't likable you can't help but laugh at this guy and eventually you end up liking him.Another strong point is the unique ensemble cast. Only Billy Bob Thornton can excellently pull off 'Bad Santa'. I couldn't picture anyone else that could suit the part more. Ditto for Tony Cox. It's good to finally see him in a more significant role that has more scope for his talent to shine. Child actor Brett Kelly is cast well as The Kid. He's not the usual filmy cute kid who gets on your nerves and reminds you why you hate child actors. Kelly plays his part naturally and is very likable. The sizzling Lauren Graham brings out the other side a much darker one of Lorelai Gilmore of 'Gilmore Girls fame. She skillfully portrays Sue's weirdness sensuality and sweetness. Lauren Tom is funny as Marcus's bitchy girlfriend. The late John Ritter has some of the funniest lines and he delivers them with complete ease. Bernie Mac however is the least funniest of them all. It's not his acting but more the comedy of the character that isn't enough. Otherwise he's quite adequate.Basically 'Bad Santa' is one of the darkest funniest Christmas films one that has a strong repeat value as it still makes me laugh in repeat viewing and sometimes when I think of the situations in the film I at least end up with a smile. Strongly recommended but watch it after the kids have been tucked in bed.".

Granted it was mostly brought on by circumstances beyond their control but has nevertheless influenced their respective modi operandi noticeably  and mostly for the worse.Willie T. Soke or simply Santa Billy Bob Thornton is bitter alcoholic wreck of a human being with among other things two passions that he often combines  those for husky ladies and anal sex. Throughout most of the year he crashes and burns around good ol' US of A eating and drinking into the money he madestole the previous Christmas while anxiously waiting for the next one to roll around since he's usually dead broke by June.He and his partner Marcus Tony Cox who happens to be a handicapped black midget have an annual ritual of getting jobs as mall Santa and his helper Elf which allow them to scope the place out and rob it blind after closing time on Christmas Eve. It's an uneasy 8year relationship based solely on mutual financial interest but more serious cracks are showing every new Christmas. By the time they reconvene in Phoenix for yet another holiday score Willie is at his alcoholic lecherous unprofessional worst  showing up drunk for work almost every day having quickie sex in the plus size department etc etc...Despite his abhorrent veneer he is befriended by not one but two local oddballs whose names he doesn't even care to ask simply referring to them as the Girl and the Kid. The Kid later we find out his name is bullyfriendly Thurman Merman is lonely wideeyed leech capable of creeping you out of your shoes one moment and melting your heart with his sweetness the next. He sees Santa as the ideal of everything good in the world. That this Santa is a foulmouthed grizzled unkempt drunk is of not much concern to him. I guess Willie will do just fine when you're a bullied adolescent being raised by your comatose grandmother.The girl on the other hand is little less of a weirdo. She 'only' has a Santa sexual fetish dating back to her childhood and makes Willie wear his Santa outfit when they make love  although they both use a different term to describe this activity.The whole lot fits nicely in this world created by Terry Zwigoff who specializes in characters on the margins of society Crumb Ghost World. Also memorable are Bernie Mac as oily mall security chief late John Ritter as mall manager and Lauren Tom as Marcus' greedy girlfriend Lois.Watching this film doesn't make you feel good about the state of humanity but IT IS funny and since that's really the only thing they were going for  mission accomplished. Besides you'd have to be very deprived to take any of this seriously.".

The acting and emotions of the lead actors and actresses were very well executed and their love for their child and the extent they went to protect their child was very touching.

The background music aided in the suspense of the film and provided an eerie enough atmosphere.One thing different about this horror film that I liked is the tone down on the use of 'ghosts' in place was just the effects of the supernatural forces. I also like the use of inyourface graphic images which was also something scary and horrorfilled on its part.

And if only the lack of suspense or story would get compensated by drama or action or even comedy than it would be great! But this is not the case! Colic isn't very scary! There is lack of drama and no humor at all! Example The mother of the main character dies very sudden! No tearsno crying except for the baby! No funeral! No real conversations between the husband and wife about what happened! There is no show of emotion like nothing is wrong! And this is the main problem! Something bad happens and things go back to normal without any change! Sure you see the parents of the baby searching for help to cure the babybut that's it! They visit a priest but he is not really helpful! The absence of a real dialog especially between the husband and wife makes it difficult to care for these persons! The explanation at the end makes it all worse! At least they could have come up with something better! The only thing that really was outstanding was the sound! The sound is the major reason that this horror is worth watching! But overall it is very average!".

	schema:reviewBody "Colic is the latest Thai horror movie to hit our shores and given the gimmicky promotion in local theatres where a cradle with that nasty picture of the baby inside you'd start to wonder if this movie will actually give you the creeps without resorting to the usual cheap gimmicks which plagued the slew of horror movies of late.By the look of that powerful palm imprint on the baby's body you'd think that there are devilish pugilistic forces to be reckoned with in Colic. However sorry to disappoint things that start to go bump in the night are as tame as a pussy cat exhibiting a hissy fit. While the movie scores in its dealing with the atmospherics it had forgotten that an engaging story is king nevermind how implausible ghost stories what the premises is. Colic actually has potential in taking something that couldn't be very much explained in scientific terms and adding a dash of the spiritual to it. But it turned out to be wasted potential instead.Newlyweds Pong Vittaya Wasukraipaisan and Phrae Pympan Chalayanacupt have an infant son who suffers from cholic  that incessant crying for reasons attributed to various factors unexplained in the movie until the end more or less. Should there be a hidden message in the movie it'll probably be not to smoke when you're expecting or that karma will work against you if you have premarital sex and have to undergo a shotgun wedding if not adequately protected.Anyway I digress. The happy family move to the suburbs and there's where unexplained happenings start to occur to them. I must warn you that it takes a long time for the family to move and for the first of such bumps in the night. In between bumps are uneventful stuff that seem to be put in as fillers which made the entire narrative storyline very episodic and extremely dragged out between scenes. The horror here has a familiar look and feel to it kinda like old Hong Kong horror flicks.What the movie couldn't decide and it shows in the film is what to do with the inexplicable stuff. Do we want to deal with spirits or ghouls maybe poltergeists or gore like Saw or Hostel. There are some truly intense moments though which will leave you at the edge of your seat but when looking back at hindsight they're pretty much a mixed bag and seem all over the place. It takes a long time for things to build and during this time it's pretty boring as you literally observe an infant grow up in quarterly stages.So long as you don't expect too much and not expect the cholic phenomenon to be explained in detail from both the scientific and occult standpoint you could actually enjoy this movie. Like I mentioned the atmospherics is top notch though the finale looked more like an action movie instead. And when the filmmakers do explain something important in the end the reaction I'd reckon will be Huh? That's it? in a much ado about nothing manner.".

There are some nice scary moments often reminding me a lot of the Poltergeist Movies with an Asian flair of course. I liked the scene with the autistic kids in the hospital in that the movie fuses the boundaries of modern science and knowledge with the supernatural and a very Asian philosophy on it. Colic is basically a Ghostmovie trying to incorporate other elements and although it has its upsides there is also passages where the movie is dragging a lot. The final explanation left me rather disappointed and with a feeling that the story somehow didn't quite add up. There is sure a lot worse movies than colic but I don't think Colic is a movie that one needs to know since most scares have been there before and the whole movie seems a little undecided on where it wants to go.".

The movie then progresses to something that seemed like a 60s horror movie in a modern format.

Like his two Fu Manchu films never quite convince as either typical horrors in the oriental series or untamed Franco productions this doesn't quite come across as a straightforward thriller  but then it wouldn't would it? Somehow this works and works very well.I get the feeling Franco felt somewhat restrained when 'limited' to realising someone else's ideas this is an adaption of Edgar Wallace's 'Secret of the Black Suitcases' one of three 1970s Wallace adaptions and this could be seen as something of a compromise. I say this mainly because two Jess trademarks nudity and sex are virtually absent. It is stylish though and acted with urgency Horst Tappert as Barton is particularly good as befitting the complicated plot.I enjoyed this it's a strange beast. It is convoluted but very engaging. Apart from the fine performances it seems to have a fairly substantial budget. There is also a good mix of fairly nasty drama and comedy a balance which is difficult to get right. Two further things I notice in this most of the location filming seems to be carried out in misty London but some scenes are shot in sunny Spain  with Vaseline smeared over the camera lens to try and signify UK smog this idea is rejected in the middle of the film but returns later! A couple of scenes feature a comedytwangingspringing sound effect dubbed over the action of particularly dramatic scenes a double knifing.Ultimately this is hugely enjoyable. It is a curious production but it really works well proceedings benefitting hugely from the fast pace and often beautiful visuals.

This one is a bit of that too even if there are no supernatural aspects here and the focus is mostly on police investigation. Franco is also one of several people who worked on the script. The two lead actors are Horst Tappert still very known in Germany today because of Derrick and Fred Williams who is not known here anymore today. The latter played the good guy even if he was almost too nice for the role while Tappert plays a character where you never knew if he was good or bad except at the ending. The female characters are written pretty badly again but that's a common problem from the 1970s. I personally did not enjoy the watch too much. I believe Tappert elevated the material on some occasions but it was a fairly weak film overall. The base material here is by Bryan Edgar Wallace son of Edgar who followed in his father's footsteps but this film is mostly an appendix as the Wallace film series was pretty much over in the 1970s. I give this one a thumbsdown and I am glad it was over so quickly even if it still dragged despite only 1hour and 15 minutes. Thumbs down.".

	schema:headline " a man's alcoholic descent into hell over one day's time turns out as superlative filmmaking and acting";
	schema:reviewBody "Under the Volcano could have made as just another 'Lost Weekend' film if not for the attention to a simple narrative though one that has a lot underneath the surface and a performance to compellingly take us through the unbalanced emotional state of its protagonist. From what I've read about what the novel became by this adaptation Huston took out the big poetic bits that made it such an unclassifiable and as many claimed unadaptable work and made it into a tale of a man's downfall from grace and good times. The story is as such Geoffrey Firmin Finney is a recently retired consul in Mexico who has that big admirable personality that comes with those who have lived or boasted to live quite a life and have taken now to mass consumptions of alcohol. It's not even about the enjoyment of it but a compulsion for 'balance' to drink just to get sober as it might be. He's also divorced recently but his wife Bisset comes to him again wanting once more to patch things up.This is set in the backdrop of the 'Day of the Dead' festival and on the brink of world war 2 but these things are however brilliantly and as a kind of delicate lining around a backdrop for the emotional and mental and it should be noted spiritual struggle of Firmin. Huston never preaches about this man's rotting addiction and there's no easy sympathy either. We see his emotional state rock from happy and hopeful to the pits of despair following the bullfight his halfbrother Hugh Andrews takes part in where he can't basically grasp his own reality anymore. Underneath this surface of the film though where we're given this proud unstable character there's chaos riling about attached in a way to the mood around with rumored Nazi collaborators in the midst of things a nearmurdered body on the side of the road the matteroffact metaphors of the symbols of death that as Huston makes in one of the most Gothic openings to a movie I've ever seen opens the film with marionette skeletons to an eerie Alex North score.But lest to say that all credit should go to Huston for his storytelling. It's an interesting film for the first three quarters though in a way feels like it has to be building for something here and there even as we're with these character wandering in a state of mind of disarray will Firmin and Yvonne stay together split apart who will run away are the basic questions as well as how Andrews might have something to do with it on either side it starts to feel like it could become meandering. In that last quarter however Huston lays on a feeling of dread maybe not entirely with coincidence that hasn't been seen since Treasure of the Sierra Madre something bad just HAS to happen and it will come out through the worst devils of the protagonist's nature. There is that for Huston the power of that brothel sequence the terror and even the dark humor.The best reason above all else even as it's one of Huston's most challenging films is that Finney is so terrific in the role. It's a startling work of an actor taking down his guard making himself vulnerable and naked so to speak to the discord booze has brought to his mind. He gets depth to a guy that should be just another Hemingway figure of the sorrow that really lies in every little moment and gesture and inflection. It also goes without saying he's one of the top three or four convincing drinkers in modern film. And at the same time it's not easy to peg what he'll do next as an actor which step he might cross or doubleback on. While his costars are very good in their parts he dares to overshadow them with a tourdeforce. Under the Volcano pits its character into hell and Huston brings us without going overboard with stylistic flourishes right along with him.".

Only Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas has done as well of a job of capturing the emotionalism and physical mannerisms of a drunk.

	schema:headline " Underrated Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fairly forgotten gem from the mid80s based on the classic and tragic novel of the same name. The film is also the legendary John Huston's third last movie as a director. Taking place in Mexico during the festival known as the Day of the Dead the film also works against a backdrop of the early days of WWII and explores the fragmented love triangle between a former British diplomat Albert Finney his estranged wife Jacqueline Bisset and his adventurous journalist brother Anthony Andrews.Under the Volcano starts out slowly following the corpselike wandering of retired diplomat Geoffrey Firmin as he explores the Day of the Dead and seeks out booze to feed his alcoholism. We're given various clues as to what has left him in such a sodden and rambling state and we learn that his wife divorced him from abroad. Geoffrey proceeds to drink himself into oblivion and into the fray enters his erstwhile wife Yvonne... testing the waters as it were for a possible reconciliation. Geoffrey's brother Hugh recently returned from the Spanish civil war is at a loss as to where he fits in with regards to their relationship and also in regards to the world itself. The three decide to take a day trip out of town with Yvonne and Hugh unsure of where Geoffrey's health and state of mind will literally lead them.This film is a rambling elegaic swansong to suntouched dreams fortified by alcohol. These three people try to outrun their demons and replace their mistakes with hollow new plans  Yvonne hopes to start her life anew but Geoffrey's disgracefully drunken state makes him an unpredictable quantity to bank on especially in regards to whether he can forgive her for the adultery that left him in such a state. Geoffrey tells a story at one point about a colonial named Blackstone a man who turned native and disliked the puritans who tried to save him so much that he simply just disappeared into the wilderness. There's obviously something about this story that appeals to Geoffrey as he seems to identify with Blackstone so much that he later tells strangers that it's his name and you can't help but feel that this is the only solution to the problems at hand that he can truly grasp at. Bubbling underneath the surface of the film all this time is a slowly building sense of doom highlighted by the coming of WWII the ominous woodwind score and the film's title itself. Geoffrey alludes to a horrific war story at several points drawing comparisons with the 30s horror film Mad Love referred to here as The Hands of Orlac with his belief that Some things you can't apologise for and this quote echoes throughout the film whenever the main characters are forced to come face to face with each other's mistakes.This won't be a film to everyone's taste it starts out as something approaching a traveldrama but kind of mutates into outright tragedy in it's second half. At the core of Under the Volcano is a staggering performance from Albert Finney as the drunken diplomat.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a fairly forgotten gem from the mid80s based on the classic and tragic novel of the same name. The film is also the legendary John Huston's third last movie as a director. Taking place in Mexico during the festival known as the Day of the Dead the film also works against a backdrop of the early days of WWII and explores the fragmented love triangle between a former British diplomat Albert Finney his estranged wife Jacqueline Bisset and his adventurous journalist brother Anthony Andrews.Under the Volcano starts out slowly following the corpselike wandering of retired diplomat Geoffrey Firmin as he explores the Day of the Dead and seeks out booze to feed his alcoholism. We're given various clues as to what has left him in such a sodden and rambling state and we learn that his wife divorced him from abroad. Geoffrey proceeds to drink himself into oblivion and into the fray enters his erstwhile wife Yvonne... testing the waters as it were for a possible reconciliation. Geoffrey's brother Hugh recently returned from the Spanish civil war is at a loss as to where he fits in with regards to their relationship and also in regards to the world itself. The three decide to take a day trip out of town with Yvonne and Hugh unsure of where Geoffrey's health and state of mind will literally lead them.This film is a rambling elegaic swansong to suntouched dreams fortified by alcohol. These three people try to outrun their demons and replace their mistakes with hollow new plans  Yvonne hopes to start her life anew but Geoffrey's disgracefully drunken state makes him an unpredictable quantity to bank on especially in regards to whether he can forgive her for the adultery that left him in such a state. Geoffrey tells a story at one point about a colonial named Blackstone a man who turned native and disliked the puritans who tried to save him so much that he simply just disappeared into the wilderness. There's obviously something about this story that appeals to Geoffrey as he seems to identify with Blackstone so much that he later tells strangers that it's his name and you can't help but feel that this is the only solution to the problems at hand that he can truly grasp at. Bubbling underneath the surface of the film all this time is a slowly building sense of doom highlighted by the coming of WWII the ominous woodwind score and the film's title itself. Geoffrey alludes to a horrific war story at several points drawing comparisons with the 30s horror film Mad Love referred to here as The Hands of Orlac with his belief that Some things you can't apologise for and this quote echoes throughout the film whenever the main characters are forced to come face to face with each other's mistakes.This won't be a film to everyone's taste it starts out as something approaching a traveldrama but kind of mutates into outright tragedy in it's second half. At the core of Under the Volcano is a staggering performance from Albert Finney as the drunken diplomat. Finney was more than rightfully nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for his realistic depiction of the life of a hopeless drunk... full of whimsy and cheer and rambling anecdotes treading a fine line between absolute tankdom and lucidness and tapping into all kinds of ambivalent emotions that would be far too challenging to a less complex and accomplished actor.

	schema:headline " A Magical Mexico Tourof Tragic Fatalism";
	schema:reviewBody "The novel explores the Consul's past and present relates his private doom to the tragic fatalism of the Mexican scene  Stephen Spender Under the Volcano was a novel written by critically acclaimed Malcolm Lowry. The book eventually became a film starring Albert Finney and Jacqueline Bisset directed by critically acclaimed John Huston. Both the film and the book failed to reach a wider public despite the brash braying praise of critics.Like Lowry I lived in Mexico for a time from fall 1980 till late 1981. During that time we traveled to a number of places including two trips to Cuernavaca. I loved Cuernavaca the city where this story primarily occurs the Land of Eternal Springtime where Cortez established his winter palace. Like Lowry and the tragic hero of his novel I too was present in Tepotzlan on a holy day when the darkfaced peasants in loose white clothes and wide hats brought out Christ and the Virgin from the shadows of monasteries parading holding high large displays and brightly colored pillars burned incense celebrating intently the blended religion of the peoples.This story covers 24 hours in the life of an alcoholic his last 24 hours with his singular preoccupation on where he will get his next drink simultaneously immersing the reader into his internal despondency hopeless selfwreckage introspection and hallucination. It is a tragic life culminating in a tragic end perhaps intended to be the mirror of a forlorn culture shrouded in apparitions of death.I originally took an interest in the book because I'd read that it was supposedly structured like the Cabala the chapters being a series of steps toward enlightenment. My first effort to read it in the late 80's left me flat however and I placed it back on the shelf for a couple years. I was not convinced that the effort would yield a sufficient reward. The second attempt ended about a fourth of the way through with the same frustration. A couple more years past and upon beginning the story I was transported inward to the heart of the characters the culture and the bleak futility of the hero's quest.John Huston took this very complicated bundle of soiled images and attempted to iron it out into its essential story. The film inadequate to the task did capture the book's essence. There is no way it could capture the spinning surrealistic writing compelling inner monologues and painfulness of Lowry's heartfelt bloodletting.Malcolm Lowry wrote the first draft in Mexico while living in Cuernavaca in 1938. Director Huston does an outstanding job of giving the feel of Mexico during this time frame. And the film brings to life many vivid memories of our time there Despite its shortcomings I found myself still moved by the film. This is the second time I've watched it and this time I enjoyed the performances of Finney and Bisset whom a few here have been especially critical of. Finney is nearly perfect throughout in his portrayal of a wrecked man. Bisset is equal to the task she must perform confused frightened compassionate pained.There are two scenes especially perfect. The one of Finney as Geoffrey Firmin searching desperately for a bottle a search that leads him into the garden where he immerses himself in the object of his quest. This scene is a summing up of the man's lost life. And the last scene revealing that his own selfdestruction hurts more than himself... hurts all who are around him.The weakness of the film for me was perhaps the feeling that it was put together by a nostalgic older director who could have done more with the music the camera work the edits. Great films often grab you from the opening images credits and soundtrack. Despite what a few have written here I found myself having to overlook what I considered a weak appetizer that insufficiently lured me into the depths of our hero's heart mind soul struggle.Huston could have done more with the film but did not. Perhaps it is because of the era. He did not feel it necessary? I can't say. The grandeur of his foreign setting is hollow. I cannot blame the actors for this. Finney was remarkable throughout almost over the top. Bisset's broken heart shone through with clarity.It's a good film based on a rich but difficult book. If it is too depressing or too convoluted and enigmatic you're under no obligation to finish either.If you find yourself stimulated by old Mexico the companion documentary based on this film is wholly worthwhile. Watch the film first though.Time is a fake healer anyhow. How can anyone presume to tell me about you? You cannot know the sadness of my life. Alas what has happened to the love and understanding we once had?  Geoffrey Firmin Under the Volcano".

	schema:headline " An Indulgent Often Incoherent but Interesting Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "John Huston's adaptation of Malcom Lowry's celebrated novel is very much like his adaptation of Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood foggy dreamlike and at times unwatchable. Huston finds a strange distant tone that is somewhere between ironic and completely bizarre with intentionality that is questionable at best. Even though Huston was getting old at this point he was still tackling challenging material in his old age which possibly explains the odd mix of provocative dense material with stilted unintuitive storytelling. If his age isn't the main culprit for the film's weird failings then it may be his stiflingly traditional filmmaking which seemed a bit outmoded in 1984. Either way the film never finds a proper stylistic center causing Under the Volcano to continually sink into incoherence.Huston's most grave misstep was his choice to pace the film with mostly static shots and slow editing rhythms. For being so conservatively made there is an almost constant lack of clarity as no one element in the film complements the other. Albert Finney's goforbroke performance as British diplomat Geoffery Firmin is fearless and raw but Huston's shot selections and mostly bland miseenscene distract from the brimming anger and pain the actor tries so nakedly to express. Similarly the absorbing mythical imagery of the story's Mexican Day of the Dead setting instead feels random as the foregrounded symbolism seems hamfisted where it should have been atmospheric. Instead of casting the story's eerie spell Huston's filmmaking suffocates the material causing it to become overblown yet underdeveloped.That is all not to say Huston is completely to blame however. Screenwriter Guy Gallo's task of condensing such enormous literary ideas into a stand alone twohour film is admirable and structurally he does great things to keep the story immediately revolving around Geoffory's character arc but by the end it feels like too many corners were cut to make it happen. The character of Hugh Geoffery's dashing halfbrother is extremely undeveloped to the point of feeling unnecessary and Yvonne Geoffery's estranged wife is never given the psychological need that would make her sympathy toward him credible. Even worse the conclusion comes with a clumsy thud ending the film suddenly and untidily.2 out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think I have ever seen a movie quite as deliberately and aggressively depressing as Under the Volcano. In fact I can hardly even imagine a more unpleasant film. It should be required viewing at AA meetings as the central character could almost be said to be the tequila and mescal that Geoffrey the nominal lead guzzles from beginning to end. There is no plot to this movie. But there is Albert Finney and that's just enough. It is a performance that saves Under the Volcano from director John Huston's almost sadistically morose tale. If there has ever been a better celluloid depiction of raging alcoholism I haven't seen it. Finney is by turns funny morbid loving and spiteful. Did I mention that he drinks? Yes he drinks. He drinks in bars at home at bullfights and even on carnival rides. His drinking isn't excessive it's superhuman. Joining Finney in Mexico is his estranged wife Yvonne played by Jacqueline Bisset. Hers is an even more incomprehensible character bright beautiful and seemingly sane Yvonne returns to Mexico in hopes of salvaging a marriage that I for one can't believe ever took place. There is no chemistry between Finney and Bisset. The other principal character Geoffrey's halfbrother Hugh has also just arrived in Mexico from Spain where he claims to have fought in the civil war. He and Yvonne had an affair once but it's clear that neither intends on rekindling it for fear of sending Geoffrey even further into besotted selfpity and selfloathing. Bisset and Anthony Andrews who plays Hugh are fine actors but their characters are preposterous and superfluous. Geoffrey doesn't deserve either of their affection and the harder they try the harder he resists.I am not a fan of the feel good movies of redemption that so often fill theaters these days. But Under the Volcano is the ultimate feel bad film. If not for Finney's truly amazing performance I wouldn't recommend this film to friend or foe. But Finney takes one of the hoariest clichs in cinema and inhabits it convincingly refreshingly heartbreakingly. Because of him you will not easily forget Under the Volcano however much you wish you could.".

However the structure of the film was totally different from how it had been described there was not a single monologue in the film and it was never the sort of apocalyptic journey into a man's tortured mind that I had hoped would fully test an actor of Finney's calibre.Instead we see Firmin joined by his half brother and wife played by Anthony Andrews and Jacqueline Bisset respectively as they go for a walk and have a journey on a bus.That is basically the entire film Firmin's character is surprisingly serene compared with what I was expecting no rage or acting fireworks at all whilst Andrews and Bisset play the sort of dotty stereotypically English twits that wouldn't look out of place in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'.The fact that the two characters are former lovers is supposed to add tension to the proceedings but it really doesn't.Although the role never allows Finney to be brilliant his skill and assurance is in stark contrast to his two costars who look awkward in comparison and their limitations are all too obvious alongside a far more talented performer.So this dull and rather pointless film plods along towards its supposedly tragic but unintentionally risible conclusion which rather than providing shocking drama delivers slapstick comedy akin to Laurel and Hardy.Why John Huston chose to make this is a mystery this type of film is destined to fail.".

The streamofconsciousness and hallucinatory profile of a former British consul drinking himself to death in 1938 Cuernavaca served as a metaphor for the world's imminent fall into the precipice of World War II.Immediately Hollywood responded and a 35year pursuit of the elusive project began. Orson Welles showed interest. Followed by John Ford and MGM producer Frank Taylor. The list goes on to include director Jose Quintero actor Zachary Scott and directors Luis Bunel Joseph Losey Tony Richardson Joseph Strick and Anthony Harvey.Why all the interest? Despite the complex literary references employed through the novel Under The Volcano remains one of the most cinematic literary devices ever published. Influenced by the fluid and subjective camera work in F.W. Murnau's silent classic Sunrise Lowry succeeds in brilliantly portraying the psychological awareness panic and deliberate downfall of Geoffrey Firmin amid the spectacular gardenofeden setting of Mexico with the shinning array of the snow capped peaks of Popocatepetl looming beyond. Symbolism drama the d.t.s of alcoholism mysticism and the ever present hope of salvation are further layers that shaped the novel during it's eight year gestation.Huston's film adaptation discards all the cinematic brilliance for the sake of simplifying the story. In other words the film eviscerates what makes the novel great and we are left with an adequate performance by Finney and laughable work by Bisset and Andrews. An all round dismal and forgettable film.".

The drunk his wife Jacqueline Bisset and brother Anthony Andrews are no ordinary people they are all romantics who love one another and the world it's 1938 and Nazism is on the rise and in turn we care about them and want this case of alcoholism  broken marriage to be fixed somehow. Or maybe if the guy is doomed then his wife can hope for a better life with his brother? Not so. This movie is like falling off a cliff and it ends abruptly.

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I have never read the cult novel which is the basis of the film. I am reviewing the film as just that  a film  and what a film this is! A class act  and an acting class allinone. Albert Finney is pitchperfect in every instance voice and body language are used to create an absolutely authentic characterization of the Consul. When Mr. Finney was not awarded the Oscar for his performance it was the equivalent of Citizen Kane not having won for Best Picture! Apart from the acting all of which is terrific and the muscular tight Guy Gallo script and the innerdemonic Alex North score and the crystalperfect cinematography and the palpable atmosphere of each and every setting and the consummate direction by the legendary John Huston the film is about Life and Death in the deepest meanings of those ultimately indefinable words.Jacqueline Bisset Yvonne Firmin was never more lovely. Sadly her past brief adulterous fling with Geoffrey's half brother created a lasting rift between her and Geoffrey in spite of their enduring love and respect for each other. What a story humanity struggling to live at the brink of its limits. I suppose it's been told a lot of times but it's hard to imagine that it's ever been told better than this. This film really delves into Lowry's psyche and you see the horror of being a man. It's a difficult and painful film but the filmmakers never turn it into a cheap sensationalistic film. It's narrated by Richard Burton who had one of the greatest voices an actor ever possessed. Burton's narration lends a dignity to this film and to Lowry's life. Albert Finney gives one of the most devastating portrayals of an intellectual mind pickled in alcohol ever captured onscreen. And the legendary director John Huston shoves our faces in it.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

I saw it in a theater shortly after its original release then several times on video in the late eighties. I hadn't watched it again until a couple of nights ago mainly as a reaction to seeing some of the imbecilic remarks here. It's scary because after seeing the film again I realize that Hollywood has alot to answer for in manufacturing twisted junkfood audience expectatations with their atrociously slick homogenization of already shallow stories push button audience emotion manipulation... oh well you get the idea. People fed a constant diet of McDonalds don't recognize a good steak when they bite into one.PADRE PADRONE integrates nearly documentary footage seamlessly with a very realistic often funny often poignant but never manipulative depiction of what it's like to grow up the first born son of a nearly impoverished Sardinian shepherd. The beatings the boy receives from his tyrannical father are convincingly shown but in such a way that especially if you've ever been on a set or involved in filmmaking you can see that the punches and slaps could be easily pulled without the audience knowing it. The boy's struggle as he grows into a man to express himself and learn how to read and write no matter how fierce his father's opposition is truly inspiring because it is so matteroffact so intense but without a shred of the narrative tricks such as treacly music cues that Hollywood would pull to needlessly manipulate cheap audience emotion.There's one scene right near the end just before the young man leaves home again for the final time where he has to go to retrieve the family suitcase from under his parents' bed. His angry powerless dad sits on the edge as his son gropes under him for the suitcase. The two have already come to blows and lifethreatening words. Suddenly the young man sinks his head against his father's leg in a brief second of weary contradictory affection. His father instinctively moves his hand to at first comfort the boy. But before his fingers can even touch his son's hair he is possessed by temper and raises his hand to strike him instead. However we don't see if he strikes him or not because the Tavianis cut to black then we next see the son leaving town going on to his destiny as a linguist and bestselling writer. This simple scene is one of the most unbearably moving in any film from the last thirty years and indicative of the general excellence of the entire movie. The Taviani brothers have made many other good films from ALLONSANFAN with Marcello Mastroianni through this through NIGHT OF SHOOTING STARS and the excellent 3 hour long anthology of stories by Pirandello KAOS.".

	schema:headline " Compelling metaphor on traditions education and coming of age";
	schema:reviewBody "Padre Padrone Father Master in Italian is inspired from Gavino Ledda's autobiography. The book provides invaluable insight on living conditions and biggerthanlife anecdotes. Remarkably the movie transforms this authentic account into a metaphor on traditions indigence knowledge emancipation and growing up.The movie only adapts selected passages of the book as usual notably because of length but interestingly adds a few scenes men arguing and promising to leave Sardinia during the religious procession Gavino peeing from the truck taking them away Gavino and Cesare speaking Latin in the tank etc. Logically these scenes have a strong visual and symbolic impact. Also the father's role is more developed in the movie and we perceive how he thinks he is a victim of the system like Gavino even though they fight back differently.  WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS The metaphorical dimension is first expressed by the presence of Ledda himself at the beginning and at the end the movie is hence put into perspective we understand it carries a message. The actual life of Ledda is almost an allegory in itself mostly alone when he was a child with limited communication possibilities illiterate he ultimately becomes a famous linguist.The movie illustrates this journey with different symbols. First with silence a bell rings when he is alone in the mountains but also in military class. He hence remains lonely despite being surrounded by people because he does not understand. Silence is also depicted by the fact Gavino cuts his lips twice once to pretend he was attacked once precisely to remain mute.Progressively Gavino breaks free from his muteness and communicates. This initially comes through nonverbal means music. He initially tries to play Strauss' waltz on his accordion and another shepherd in the mountain answers with a flute. He then catches it on his radio and thus passes the army test. Later on he whistles Mozart's clarinet concerto after his father destroys the radio.He eventually learns Italian and articulated communication. He finally is able to answer back to his father. Interestingly the speech he voices to him from his bed is memorised this reminds of the father's speech at the beginning in school which is memorised as well. The meaning seems to be one can progress and learn but can never completely relinquish one's heritage. Other illustrations of this topic the movie starts and ends at school when Gavino is young Gavino does not understand the class at the army as his father did not understand the olive purchaser's speech Gavino recites word from the dictionary as his father recited multiplications when Gavino comes back to the village he is afraid his father will strike him just like he was before in the mountains his father forbids him to eat and locks the food closet just like he did in the mountains Ledda says at then end I might abuse my new privilege as my father did.Indeed everywhere traditions are enduring and difficult to escape from. In the kitchen the father wants to strike the adult Gavino with a stick just like the shepherd stroke Sebastiano in the mountains. After the father violently hit the young Gavino he sings a Sardinian tune which will be repeated during the religious procession when Gavino is adult. Additionally at this fabulous procession the young men carry a heavy statue that we visualise as the father they are dominated by traditions in different forms religion father master.The resulting general psychological tension is visually expressed by instability even when shots are fixed the camera apparently handheld always moves slightly. Traditions are a succession of prohibitions don't leave the sheepfold don't talk to other shepherds don't eat unless you work don't speak Sardinian in the army. Growing up more than transgressing these is being able to bypass them respectively becoming an adult learning music studying learning Italian.The movie has a universal dimension. Nobody bears a name apart from Gavino Cesare the true friend and Sebastiano the mountain legend the father the mother Gavino's sisters and brothers other children and adults. This lack of identity is highlighted by the young men during the religious procession We have no name we are just the padrone's this and that. It is not just Ledda's story we see other children and adults with the same issues and desires. The shots on the children's faces at the beginning and at the end with their inner thoughts at the beginning are striking. These thoughts are horrible like the ones Gavino's family has near Sebastiano's deathbed yet we understand them it is how necessity forces people to think. Some scenes are spectacular for instance when the father fights with Gavino in the kitchen. It plays on different levels. Abstract close shot on hands washing on a hand hitting the red table to have food. Symbolic father and son fight in obscurity expressing their subconscious desire to get rid of each other it is the dark conflict between tradition and emancipation. Ironic they fight as Mozart's beautiful music plays afterwards the mother sings. Ambiguous when Gavino fetches his suitcase afterwards he first ignores his father then puts his forehead on his leg. He still loves him despite everything. And his father first wants to caress his head then strike it. We unexpectedly move on to the next scene so will never know what actually happened but it does not matter the father's emotion stays suspended between love and hate. The following shot is magnificently nostalgic we silently drive away from the village looking backwards. This subjective view echoes the scene when Gavino previously left at the back of the truck we now leave with him apparently forever. In summary Padre Pardone is gripping with social psychological and symbolic reach. Be warned it is violent harsh living conditions harassment child abuse bestiality. However it progressively delivers an optimistic message through education and hard work one can escape one's condition.".

	schema:headline " Slowmoving but absorbing chronicle of conflict between fatherson Sardinian shepherds";
	schema:reviewBody "'Padre Padrone' is based on noted linguist Gavino Ledda's autobiography which came out in 1975. The distinguished directors the Taviani brothers brought the story to the screen two years later. Ledda chronicles his childhood adolescence and young adulthood growing up under the yoke of his tyrannical father a sheep herder from Sardinia.'Padre Pardone' opens with a cameo from the reallife Gavino introducing the story directly to the audience. He brings us back to the time when he was in elementary school when his father suddenly appeared one day and pulled him out of class for good. The father brings him to an isolated area in Sardinia with the intent of molding the very young child into a sheep herder. The child is forced to watch the property in an isolated area Baddevrstana while his father is off tending to business in Siligo a provincial town close by. Since the only means of travel is by mule Gavino finds himself alone on inhospitable turf.Gavino tries to make contact with other children who are forced to work for their fathers in the same way and he ends up being punished for it. The corporal punishment includes beatings with spiny tree branches which is mentioned in the autobiography. In the film it's not as clear as we see the beatings with the branches from a distance. We do see a scene in the film where the father goes a little too far where it appears Gavino loses consciousness for a short while the father brings the son a cup of water to revive him.In another memorable scene Gavino buys a broken accordion from two passersby and pays them with two sheep. Gavino lies to his father that he was attacked by bandits who stole the sheep. He shows his father his selfinflicted cut on the mouth but the father doesn't buy his story and cuts his rations.Due to the isolation of the male children as their fathers force them to work the entire time tending to the sheep they have little or no contact with the opposite sex and develop some rather unhealthy sexual proclivities. A few scenes of bestiality are prominent during the first third of the film including Gavino getting it on a with a mule and a group of boys masturbating with the aid of chickens they're attending to inside a coop.Once Gavino grows up we meet him next when he's twenty. Gavino's father somehow inherits an olive grove under dubious circumstances. After a landowner is killed by a rival Gavino's family helps the widow with the funeral arrangements and disposing of the property. The widow in fear for her life decides to move away from the area but gives Gavino's father the olive grove as compensation for their help. Gavino's father plans to cede the grove to his offspring following his death but a frost destroys all the orchards in the area including the family's olive grove.Gavino's father then decides to sell his herd and all this property except for a garden. The children are shipped off as laborers but the father ships Gavino off to the Army. Before he leaves the father teaches him some rudimentary math and reading so he can be accepted into the Army as they will not accept someone who is completely illiterate.While in the Army with the help of a friend Gavino eventually learns how to read and write. He also completes a course in electronics and learns how to assemble a radio. When his enlistment period is over against his father's wishes he quits the army and decides to enroll at the University of Sardinia to study linguistics. Gavino's father forces him to work long hours in the garden which interferes with his studies and eventually the two have a physical confrontation. Now much stronger than his father Gavino wrestles him down to the ground and humiliates the old man. Gavino concludes it's best that he leave his father's home and then goes off to the university to later become a distinguished professor of linguistics.It should be noted that the Taviani brothers are not out to condemn the brutality of the patriarchal society they're examining. While Gavino's father is sometimes brutal in his eyes he still has Gavino's best interests at heart. A good deal of the father's behavior toward his son is more 'tough love' than continuing acts of sadism. In many ways he's ambivalent toward Gavino. In a most telling scene at the end Gavino is looking for his valise under his father's bed who's sitting right there after being humiliated after their wrestling match.

	onyx:emotionText "'Padre Padrone' is based on noted linguist Gavino Ledda's autobiography which came out in 1975. The distinguished directors the Taviani brothers brought the story to the screen two years later. Ledda chronicles his childhood adolescence and young adulthood growing up under the yoke of his tyrannical father a sheep herder from Sardinia.'Padre Pardone' opens with a cameo from the reallife Gavino introducing the story directly to the audience. He brings us back to the time when he was in elementary school when his father suddenly appeared one day and pulled him out of class for good. The father brings him to an isolated area in Sardinia with the intent of molding the very young child into a sheep herder. The child is forced to watch the property in an isolated area Baddevrstana while his father is off tending to business in Siligo a provincial town close by. Since the only means of travel is by mule Gavino finds himself alone on inhospitable turf.Gavino tries to make contact with other children who are forced to work for their fathers in the same way and he ends up being punished for it. The corporal punishment includes beatings with spiny tree branches which is mentioned in the autobiography. In the film it's not as clear as we see the beatings with the branches from a distance. We do see a scene in the film where the father goes a little too far where it appears Gavino loses consciousness for a short while the father brings the son a cup of water to revive him.In another memorable scene Gavino buys a broken accordion from two passersby and pays them with two sheep. Gavino lies to his father that he was attacked by bandits who stole the sheep. He shows his father his selfinflicted cut on the mouth but the father doesn't buy his story and cuts his rations.Due to the isolation of the male children as their fathers force them to work the entire time tending to the sheep they have little or no contact with the opposite sex and develop some rather unhealthy sexual proclivities. A few scenes of bestiality are prominent during the first third of the film including Gavino getting it on a with a mule and a group of boys masturbating with the aid of chickens they're attending to inside a coop.Once Gavino grows up we meet him next when he's twenty. Gavino's father somehow inherits an olive grove under dubious circumstances. After a landowner is killed by a rival Gavino's family helps the widow with the funeral arrangements and disposing of the property. The widow in fear for her life decides to move away from the area but gives Gavino's father the olive grove as compensation for their help. Gavino's father plans to cede the grove to his offspring following his death but a frost destroys all the orchards in the area including the family's olive grove.Gavino's father then decides to sell his herd and all this property except for a garden. The children are shipped off as laborers but the father ships Gavino off to the Army. Before he leaves the father teaches him some rudimentary math and reading so he can be accepted into the Army as they will not accept someone who is completely illiterate.While in the Army with the help of a friend Gavino eventually learns how to read and write. He also completes a course in electronics and learns how to assemble a radio. When his enlistment period is over against his father's wishes he quits the army and decides to enroll at the University of Sardinia to study linguistics. Gavino's father forces him to work long hours in the garden which interferes with his studies and eventually the two have a physical confrontation. Now much stronger than his father Gavino wrestles him down to the ground and humiliates the old man. Gavino concludes it's best that he leave his father's home and then goes off to the university to later become a distinguished professor of linguistics.It should be noted that the Taviani brothers are not out to condemn the brutality of the patriarchal society they're examining. While Gavino's father is sometimes brutal in his eyes he still has Gavino's best interests at heart. A good deal of the father's behavior toward his son is more 'tough love' than continuing acts of sadism. In many ways he's ambivalent toward Gavino. In a most telling scene at the end Gavino is looking for his valise under his father's bed who's sitting right there after being humiliated after their wrestling match. As Gavino looks under the bed the father is about to gently stroke his son's head but then clenches his fist as if to strike him. In the denouement we see that there were no further physical confrontations.Not everything in 'Padre Padrone' works.

It is a story therefore that is greatly inspirational to anyone who has ever faced opposition to maturation modernization or creativity. The use of detailed sounds and slow simple camera movements force the audience's senses to follow Gavino's. When he is alone in the dark we are alone in the dark. We see a closeup of a snake's poised open jaw and fear it just as he does. We hear the wind through the trees as Gavino's father trains him to recognize his location by it. Likewise the many stream of consciousness scenes allow the audience into Gavino's mind. We also hear fragments of the thoughts of the schoolchildren Gavino's father the selfish townspeople at a funeral and even the sheep Gavino milks. The use of such devices makes the audience take part not only in the physical pain and alienation that was part of a young shepherd's life but also in the mental neglect and torture that followed. We feel abandoned fed up and triumphant as Gavino does. The most important aspect of this film however lies in the fact that while Gavino creates his own boundaries and frees himself from patriarchal slavery he is still selfaware and doesn't turn his story into a fairy tale. He is not living in a mansion with a perfect wife and children at the film's end. Rather the real Gavino is presented to the audience on the same lonely streets on which he began looking content but imperfect. This story allows for the fact that there are still sad aspects to his life and lingering effects to what he experienced. Likewise none of his experience was sweetened his life is presented as was in a beautiful and moving way.".

Therefrom I got the details about the author's home village Siligo and its environment. As a child I was used to spend my holidays with mountain farmers helping them here and there thus I was familiar with rural and agricultural life.At the time I saw 'Padre Padrone' I was 20 years old was used to do bicycle trips in my home country but had never gone abroad. Sardinia was only one day by railways and one night by ship away so I decided to go there.The first original place I came to was Sassari where the author got his higher education and was also a professor. Some roaming through the hills brought me to his little village Siligo. At the entrance I noted an older man steering a cart pulled by a mule. This was not ordinary because all other peasants used small and cheap motoroperated vehicles. Ledda's father being described as tenacious and closefisted it is quite probable that the observed was him. But I didn't dare to ask him.Up from the village I pedaled through family Ledda's pasture called Baddevrstana where I noticed again a being standing on a trail another mule.".

Therefrom I got the details about the author's home village Siligo and its environment. As a child I was used to spend my holidays with mountain farmers helping them here and there thus I was familiar with rural and agricultural life.At the time I saw 'Padre Padrone' I was 20 years old was used to do bicycle trips in my home country but had never gone abroad. Sardinia was only one day by railways and one night by ship away so I decided to go there.The first original place I came to was Sassari where the author got his higher education and was also a professor. Some roaming through the hills brought me to his little village Siligo. At the entrance I noted an older man steering a cart pulled by a mule. This was not ordinary because all other peasants used small and cheap motoroperated vehicles. Ledda's father being described as tenacious and closefisted it is quite probable that the observed was him. But I didn't dare to ask him.Up from the village I pedaled through family Ledda's pasture called Baddevrstana where I noticed again a being standing on a trail another mule.";

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING.....SLIGHT SPOILER!!!!Leni Riefenstahl is fantastic in this film which she directed wrote and starred in. This movie is generally considered to be a German 'mountain film' to which Refenstahl generally takes a great deal of influence from though it came out significantly later than most of the films from that genre such as The White Hell of Piz Palu' Die Weie Hlle vom Piz Pal or Storm Over Mont Blanc' Strme ber dem Mont Blanc both of which Riefenstahl herself starred in.This is a movie about nature and modern man's disrespect for it. Vigo an urban citizen who comes to a village in the mountains meets Junta Riefenstahl an outcast believed by most of the villagers to be a witch. Vigo discovers that Junta is the only person known to have climbed the mountain to the cave where a 'blue light' shines on every full moon. The light which is believed by the villagers to hypnotize young men is blamed for the countless deaths of the villagers who attempt to climb the mountain only to fall to their deaths. When Vigo discovers Junta and followers her to the cave he realizes that the 'light' comes from millions of valuable jewels that lie in the walls of the mountain. Although by this point Vigo has formed a romantic relationship with Junta instead of keeping the jewels a secret and thus sacred as Junta does he decides to tell the villagers who rape the mountain of its riches and become wealthy. The outcast Junta gets nothing and is devastated because the light which once glimmered from the mountain is now gone.Vito is constantly portrayed as a Goethe type'   the 19th century archetype intellectual and we know that he is used to symbolize the higher echelon of German society. Junta however is an outcast and a social misfit. She is filmed much like an animal of sorts...wearing rags hunched over and constantly running from villagers who want to stone her to death. When Junta and Vito get together it becomes obviously unnatural and awkward. The fact that Junta and Vito also do not speak the same language is paramount to the notion that communication between nature and high society does not exist. In the end he uses her knowledge and chooses financial wealth over love. This is a message albeit a depressing one to modern civilization everywhere delivered with expressionistic flair and a filmatic brilliance that won't be found anywhere else.".

Being a reflection of light and shadow it can never be the real thing of course it is merely the mirror that holds the image  which is contrary to a lot of the myth that we have glorified around cinema as the thing in itself. A lot of those images reach our eyes randomly reflected haphazardly or the mirror is pointed without care. It's a pain in the ass to watch these because you know the filmmaker doesn't mean what he sees.But sometimes in capable hands they reflect truly meaning of course not that they portray the world truly as it truly is if we could ever get two people in the same room to agree on their experience of that room but exactly by dint of being reflections cast from lights inside and so like a dream is always true even as it is essentially unreal or like the old tribal ceremonies around the world were from an outside perspective merely the primitive imitation of a scene from familiar life but from inside the dance allowed the participant exactly by the token of his willing submission in the shared soul to sink himself in the level behind the familiar narrative and there purify himself with just the images in just the same way film can penetrate beneath the dream or ceremony by substituting for it and purify with a glimpse of how images life itself are stirred into being.It is a real joy to be able to watch these films what they offer is akin to the experience of ecstacy introspection from outside the self. But first we have to invest ourselves in them and the film needs to operate from the center. What we get in turn is not just the image this is important but an image we understand is being mirrored this is the perspective we're missing in real life. So not an aesthetic but a way of seeing.Look here. The story revolves around a small village at the foot of a mountain. Every fullmoon mysterious lights glint from the top and the men climb the rock to discover. Every time they fall from it  and are symbolically embodied inside the rock as small statues. But there's a woman in all this an outcast a pariah exactly because she can freely venture where they can't who knows the secret pathway.The mystery is of course simple as the man who climbs her soul to discover in turn comes to know crystals that reflect that same moonlight seen from below. So the source of so much allure and sacrifice was merely the reflected light from the real thing that was plainly visible above their heads the whole time and which they shied away from in fear as an evil portent of their own impotence and disaster. Oh eventually they're allowed to get their hands on the coveted treasure which now as well as before reflects truly upon them.But the woman Leni Riefenstahl casts a longer shadow in all of this whose soul the treasure is snatched from to satisfy the social good. She illuminates deeper for this  twice herself in the film as both actress and filmmaker  because we know now that she was surrounding herself with real darkness at the time. Of course it was never a social good her treasures gave voice to but rather something that just had to be deemed so because society collectively pulled that way.Too many words. You just have to see how she arrays herself in this. Her face when she discovers the crystals plucked from her cave a mask of so much anguish and heartbreak and then imagine how many real nights she must have spent huddled behind that mask for the rest of her life following WWII.Of course for her the character it was always the beauty of the thing that stirred the heart. But not a beauty such as you appreciate in an art gallery or read from a book. Beauty that makes the body stir from sleep and by some intuitive pull is drawn to climb the steep rock  and the discovery of the path no doubt was also intuitive  for a fleeting glimpse of what?But of course emptiness in full bloom. Wonderful bloom.I suggest you see this with the sound muted  it's poorly integrated inside the film  and music of your choice like you would watch a silent. It's a magical film of interior landscapes.".

It can it does.Or you may simply come because you are fascinated by the woman a dancer celebrant of the body an Arian ideal sexually active for 75 years including with top Nazis. Shunned by the film world and finding a new challenge in underwater photography. But when you come you will confront a strange form of narrative the spiritual metaphor the Goethe model with blunt plain cosmology. Its that used by Nazis extremely effectively and now appropriated by similar zealots. Extreme differentiation between good and evil good fundamentally linked to spiritual forces which we do not deserve. Only severe dedication can allow us to deserve to adore it. Its all rather curious how superstitious structures can be sold and you'll have to slog through it. And with some extraordinarily blunt acting.Sir Arne's Treasure of a dozen years earlier did all these things with natural skill and they work.But what you will get is some astonishing composition even in this her very first film as director. A striking location that is almost unbelievable but the most striking thing is her in the local. Every time she is set in the mountain it is done with such lightness that we cannot avoid feeling visited by the supernatural. You have to see her climbing a vertical wall with bare hands and moccasins thousands of feet up. You have to see her scrambling like a sprite around the bottom of the waterfall. You even have to see her present a sort of holy pulchritude while sleeping. This alone impresses once it settles that everything you see of her was designed by her. It weaves a fascination for a transcendent earth and womb that's genuine.So my visit with this was a matter of awe at what a person can do but I have that from elsewhere. More it was accompanied by a parallel awe at the pull of the story the story that I know ends badly and possibly always will but we follow it.I suppose that a slight a very slight adjustment in this woman's makeup would have made a profound difference for several billions of people and I further suppose that had she been trained slightly differently in dance that adjustment that introspection would have been implanted. So if we had that fabled magical time machine and wanted to go back in time to prevent the holocaust perhaps killing Hitler isn't the right touchstone. It may be spending an evening in deep conversation with the man who loves the woman who taught Leni's dance teacher. Yes that would do it.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Riefenstahl stars in and directs this artsy film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting film in that a sound version in German with English subtitles and a silent version on the same disk. Now this might seem weird today but in the late 1920s and early 30s many theaters were still not equipped for sound and studios made two parallel versionsone sound and one silent. I've seen this before with some other DVD releases and it's very nice that both versions were included. However like so many of the films that were made in sound and silent versions the sound version has mostly the same scenes with only a few sound scenes insertedso it really plays much like the silent versionespecially since the sound system they used seemed primitive and the sound seemed like it was tacked on later.The film stars the infamous Leni Riefenstahla woman far more famous the documentaries she directed than for the earlier films in which she starred. This is one of her earlier films when she was seen as one of Germany's preeminent actressesand a woman whose speciality were films involving mountain climbing! I've seen about a dozen of her films and nearly ALL of them have mountains in themand often lots and lots of ice and snow! It's an odd sort of genre but somehow Riefenstahl made it her own! Like these other films the actress risks her life climbing about in the Alps much of it barefooted or in sandals and you have to respect her willingness to go allout for this film.Riefenstahl plays Juntaa strange woman who loves climbing about in the moonlighta task the men and boys of the alpine village cannot do. When they try they fall to their deathsand soon people of the town begin to talk about Junta as if she's bewitched or in league with the Devil. It doesn't help her case any that Junta is a weirdo and behaves in a rather eccentric manner. Later when an outsider becomes fascinated with her and follows her on one of her mountain treks he learns a secreta secret that will ultimately destroy the woman he has come to love.This film is clearly not an ordinary film. The plot is rather strange and fantasticlike a modern fairytale. The cinematography is luminous and quite beautiful and almost like Ansel Adams pictures come to life. And combined with the music it's more a piece of art than a traditional film for mass consumption. If you can watch it and appreciate it on this level then you'll no doubt enjoy this movie.

	onyx:emotionText "This is an interesting film in that a sound version in German with English subtitles and a silent version on the same disk. Now this might seem weird today but in the late 1920s and early 30s many theaters were still not equipped for sound and studios made two parallel versionsone sound and one silent. I've seen this before with some other DVD releases and it's very nice that both versions were included. However like so many of the films that were made in sound and silent versions the sound version has mostly the same scenes with only a few sound scenes insertedso it really plays much like the silent versionespecially since the sound system they used seemed primitive and the sound seemed like it was tacked on later.The film stars the infamous Leni Riefenstahla woman far more famous the documentaries she directed than for the earlier films in which she starred. This is one of her earlier films when she was seen as one of Germany's preeminent actressesand a woman whose speciality were films involving mountain climbing! I've seen about a dozen of her films and nearly ALL of them have mountains in themand often lots and lots of ice and snow! It's an odd sort of genre but somehow Riefenstahl made it her own! Like these other films the actress risks her life climbing about in the Alps much of it barefooted or in sandals and you have to respect her willingness to go allout for this film.Riefenstahl plays Juntaa strange woman who loves climbing about in the moonlighta task the men and boys of the alpine village cannot do. When they try they fall to their deathsand soon people of the town begin to talk about Junta as if she's bewitched or in league with the Devil. It doesn't help her case any that Junta is a weirdo and behaves in a rather eccentric manner. Later when an outsider becomes fascinated with her and follows her on one of her mountain treks he learns a secreta secret that will ultimately destroy the woman he has come to love.This film is clearly not an ordinary film. The plot is rather strange and fantasticlike a modern fairytale. The cinematography is luminous and quite beautiful and almost like Ansel Adams pictures come to life. And combined with the music it's more a piece of art than a traditional film for mass consumption. If you can watch it and appreciate it on this level then you'll no doubt enjoy this movie. If you aren't then it will be very tough goingmostly because it is so strange and because it does not have a particularly conventional narrative.By the way if you get a chance see the amazing and very long documentary on Riefenstahl The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl. It not only talks about this film at length but gives you a lot of facts that will help you admire AND dislike this highly unusual womanand put it all in context.";

	schema:reviewBody "How astonishing can it be to see how a fictional story can metaphorically translate the life of someone? Even more when it is that very person the one who invents the story of her destiny? This film has to be the answer.Here we have a genius of composition and visual rhythm in her first attempt which guesses everything that would come.What would this goddess in several meanings be thinking when she embraced this adventure? Lenni was a student of the human body and therefore of her own. Student of the Hellenic harmonic dynamics who understood the power of movement applied to cinema. She understood it so well she would pay for her whole life for that. In this film she is simultaneously observer and observed object. She the body is one of the reasons for this film to be. At the same time we have a story about a special woman. She is special because she has access to a secret she knows a path. That secret has a geographical identity there is a division between sacred and mundane mountain and city. The preciousness surrounded by an aura of inaccessibility to reach it is a privilege of beauty of commitment and in the end of love. And Lenni is at the centre of that sacredness and there at the moment when it breaks. And she is doomed to be rejected forever for keeping such a secret. That's Junta as it is Lenni. That's the prophecy this story written by Riefenstahl which is a story even inside the film a book with her photo on the cover! This woman changed more than the history of cinema she did more than to enlarge the possibilities of visual contemplation and consequently beauty concepts. In her coursed work coursed because it is good! she helped to change the face of the world having her as the ambiguous element always. In this film we have her linking the sacred mountain and the city linking two worlds. Now check the geography of the place. The mountain the power of its various sequences the strength of that geographical object. The woman climbing the mountain the power of contrast. Junta under the effect of the full moon exhales sensuality which works still today when we are totally addicted to images that aim at sensuality. It works because it's genuine a woman who is more that it seems. Note how the sweater reveals the shoulder a provocation no doubt a desire to place the body at the centre and to enhance Man in relation with Nature.In this metaphorical mythology Germanic and Nordic see how the symbols are materialized and shot. The composition of the shots of mountain climbing and specially of Vigo getting into the sacred crystal area is genius the set of a potential Valhala and the expression of Junta as she finds out about the intrusion reveals everything.This film still obeys too much to the codes of silent film. I saw the sound version but apparently there is a silent one since in those days the transition was still being made. Anyway the sound in this film is uncomfortably placed and dialogue does little more than directly replace the inter titles of the silent. And the montage still doesn't exist with the supreme sense that Lenni would give it years later and that affects rhythm because the work of the montage masters Eisenstein Kalatzov Vertov... totally depends on the rhythm images themselves can give for what happens inside every shot and for the cut between shots. That dynamic does not exist here and the codes are dated and i suppose they might already be dated than. But Riefenstahl is body face she is expression. She is movement dynamic rhythm. But is all that both as an observer sensitive and visual and as an interpreter sensual sexual! and intense. That's her genius here.My opinion 45 see this several times.httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

One of the best entries in the Mountain Film genre Das Blaue Licht conveys a strong sense of atmosphere. It transports its audience into the world of a little folkish insular Germanic village sometime in the relatively recent past.The mountain overshadows the villagers just as it overshadows everything in this story. Climbing it can be read as a metaphor for human ambition which telling comes at the destruction of the lives of others and environmental degradation.Riefenstahl uses a simple but effective framing device to tell her story which serves to situate it firmly in the realm of the village's folklore. Moody lighting helps add to the atmosphere and she displays effective use of parallel and contrasting scenes. The scale of the mountain and its treacherous narrow paths give the film a nicelyclaustrophobic feel. Certainly more effective as a director than as an actress the tragedy is that Riefenstahl would later waste her skills making political propaganda.The contrast between Riefenstahl's character and the insular narrowminded country people is effectively conveyed. Ironically it is these same bigoted people from the Bavarian country town folk who would later form the Nazi party's biggest support base. By portraying the countryside dwellers for the bigots they are this film could almost be read as an attack on what would become the NSDAP's support base. As others have commented the male lead is drawn straight from the writings of Goethe and is effective as a nuanced compassionate counterpoint to the villagers.Ultimately this film is highly recommended provided one feels comfortable watching Riefenstahl's early output on its own merits and separating the artist's early work from her political beliefs and later propaganda films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Das blaue Licht or The Blue Light is a German blackandwhite film from over 80 years ago. Writer director and lead actress is Leni Riefenstahl and this film is one of the main reasons that brought Riefenstahl the adoration of Adolf Hitler who made her his number1 propaganda documentary filmmaker for years to come. This one however was still made before the Nazi party came into power. Riefenstahl plays a woman dishonored by society who lives in the mountains. The men lover her though and several men go to the mountains because of her where they die from falling in the rocky rough landscape. However when the main character Junta finally warms up to a man courting her she is about to face the most severe form of betrayal.The reason is that this is not only a film about love and interhuman relationships but also about trust and a huge treasure. I must say I liked the ending here. But I am not sure if it is worth waiting for 80 minutes as most of the scenes before aren't really that great or memorable. As solid as Riefenstahl's and Bla Balzs' work behind the camera is I am not too sure if casting the filmmaker for the main character was a good choice here. She does not have the looks for being considered some sort of femme fatale. Then again tastes differ and were probably especially different that long ago. This is a sound film but there is no color yet and this fact really hurts the film as you could expect with a color being included in the title even. As a whole I do not recommend the movie. Simply not good enough.".

	schema:headline " Under Appreciated Murder Mystery!";
	schema:reviewBody "The real mystery of DTox hereinafter referred to by its video tile Eye See You is why it never found a distributor in North America. I thought it was a good movie. You have to give star Sylvester Stallone a little credit for trying to shed his Rambo heman image and playing a distraught and tragic hero. The story involves a serial killer who has been murdering cops and whose murders will be investigated by FBI agent Jake Malloy Stallone. When the killer murders Malloy's girlfriend Mary Dina Meyer he goes into a funk and finds solace at the bottom of a bottle to the point of contemplating suicide. Malloy's friend and partner Hendricks Charles S. Dutton convinces him to go to an isolated DTox center in Wyoming run by shrink Kris Kristofferson. Malloy is thrown in with other cops from various locations who also have demons to exorcise. Among them are Christopher Fulford as Slater who tries to befriend him Noah Robert Patrick who has a chip on his shoulder McKenzie Robert Prosky Jones Courtney B. Vance Brandon Mif and Lopez Angela Alvarado among others. Polly Walker plays Jenny a sympathetic nurse and Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang as two suspicious workers at the facility. It turns out that the serial killer that Malloy thought he had killed earlier has in fact infiltrated the DTox Center and has begun systematically murdering the people there. But who is he or she? Director Jim Gillespie gives us a murder mystery rather than an action film. It has the isolation and claustrophobic feeling reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing 1982 except in this case the killer is human and not alien. Stallone is good in the lead role experiencing a wide range of emotions. Its one of his better performances in recent years. Of the supporting players Patrick stands out as well as Fulford Dutton Prosky Vance Alvartado and Lang. Berenger hardly has anything meaningful to do and is wasted here. And watch for Ron Howard's dad Rance Howard as the proprietor of the lodge that Dutton stays at. Eye See You is an under appreciated film and deserves a chance to find an audience. It is hoped that the video release will give it proper visibility.".

Among them are Christopher Fulford as Slater who tries to befriend him Noah Robert Patrick who has a chip on his shoulder McKenzie Robert Prosky Jones Courtney B. Vance Brandon Mif and Lopez Angela Alvarado among others. Polly Walker plays Jenny a sympathetic nurse and Tom Berenger and Stephen Lang as two suspicious workers at the facility. It turns out that the serial killer that Malloy thought he had killed earlier has in fact infiltrated the DTox Center and has begun systematically murdering the people there. But who is he or she? Director Jim Gillespie gives us a murder mystery rather than an action film. It has the isolation and claustrophobic feeling reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing 1982 except in this case the killer is human and not alien. Stallone is good in the lead role experiencing a wide range of emotions. Its one of his better performances in recent years. Of the supporting players Patrick stands out as well as Fulford Dutton Prosky Vance Alvartado and Lang. Berenger hardly has anything meaningful to do and is wasted here. And watch for Ron Howard's dad Rance Howard as the proprietor of the lodge that Dutton stays at. Eye See You is an under appreciated film and deserves a chance to find an audience. It is hoped that the video release will give it proper visibility.";

	schema:reviewBody "Well having not only spent two years on the shelf but getting released straight to video AND the original studio  Universal  disowning it removing its logo and Universal presents... as well as giving it to another studio to release on DVD and video I was expecting yet another Stallone bomb. Actually while I would never say it's a good movie it nowhere as bad as you might think  it's certainly better than recent Stallone turkeys like GET CARTER.It's actually starts surprisingly well. Not only is Stallone's character given a lot of dialogue Stallone actually acts when delivering it. The subsequent events that traumatize his character are well done with a genuine eerieness to them. Things continue well for a while longer showing the utter pit of despair Stallone's character has fallen in and Stallone once again is up to this challenge.Then he goes to the detox center and the movie quickly falls apart. The biggest problems are1 WAY too many characters. It was extremely difficult to remember who was who with all these people walking in and out of the camera. It's also difficult to separate each person in your mind because we hardly learn a thing about each character  if we are lucky.2 REALLY bad editing. Scenes and some individual cuts go by so quickly that we often don't get the chance to properly digest what we're given to ponder. Two things happening at the same time in different places are cut back and forth with no seeming purpose and no coherent flow. Though the DVD has eight deleted scenes it's obvious that there was originally a lot more shot. I have to agree with another poster that there are signs there was a desperate effort to save the movie in the editing room.3 Once in the detox center poor Stallone has almost NOTHING to do. He's given almost nothing to say and frequently sits on the sidelines while things are happening. Not exactly a star vehicle this movie.Still there is a good amount of atmosphere the movie is briskly paced though sometimes incoherent because of this and the setsproduction values are pretty decent. While I wouldn't have recommended anyone to see it at a theater if it had gotten released there you have to remember there have been far worse films with and without Stallone that did get such releases.".

I was however impressed by the performances by Jeffrey Wright although they seemed to forget that he existed in the last 20 minutes and Sean Patrick Flannery first killed off unfortunately.I think this could've been quite good as a dramatic story about a cop in detox trying to come to terms with his problems but as a serial killer thriller this movie is a flop.".

It was cool to see Sly try something different and in my humble opinion he succeeded 100!. however it was hard to see since a lot of it was set in a snow storm however that made it a lot more creepier and mysterious if you ask me. The Direction is very good. Jim Gillespie does a very good job here using a great mysterious locationkeeping the film creepy and atmospheric some cool overhead shots and keeping the film at a nice pace! very good job. There is quite a bit of harsh violence here. We get drilled out eyespolice beater stick impaled through head ATFlots of bloody corpsesa few bloody gunshot woundsbloody slit wristssome ATF slit throatsa bit of slicing and dicingand 2 nasty bloody impalings. The Acting is GREAT!. Sylvester Stallone is AMAZING as always and adds another amazing performance to his career and when he breaks down when his wife dies i really felt it it was incredible in my opinion Sly is one of the most talented actors of all time and if you think he can't act watch this movie! he was amazing in this Sly Rules!.Polly Walker is pretty good here with what she had to do and had decent chemistry with Sly she wasn't that bad to look at either. Charles S. Dutton is good as always and wished he had more screen time. Kris Kristofferson does what he has to do well as the Doc. Tom Berenger was terrible here and was terribly miscast!. Robert Patrick is good but got on my nerves i usually love the dude. Overall i highly recommend it! 12 out of 5".

This defunct nuclear command and control outpost is only accessible by snowmobile . As he checks into a rehab clinic that specializes in treating law enforcement officials with unexpected consequences . But is is not the ordinary clinic  being run by excop Kris Kristofferson and staffed by a doctor Polly Walker and bitter as well as sneering loonies Tom Berenguer. There takes place horrible crimes and Jake is taunted by a serial murderer . Thrilling suspense movie packs chills  noisy action  gratuitous violence  intriguing events  gruesome slaying and winds up into an astonishing finale . Exciting and stirring development  though predictable  when starring finds that his fellow patients are being murdered one by one . This is an acceptable thriller but contains several flaws and gaps  in fact there was trouble brewing on the set because of overages and creative concerns between the director and the studio  as producers let it sit on the shelf for many months and after over a year it was decided to do a reshoot . Nice production design and spectacular snowy scenarios in fact  the film's snowstorm sequences were shot in Canada . Decent acting by Sylvester Stallone  as he comes off lightly as a cop who comes undone after witnessing a brutal scene on the job . Very good support cast though really wasted  all of them play excops patients varying from psychotically aggressive  paranoids  drunken  suicidal person  being performed by Robert Prosky  Sean Patrick Flannery  Christopher Fulford  Jeffrey Wright  Angela Alvarado  Robert Patrick  Courney B Vance  among others .

Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Deam Semler  shot on location in Vancouver  Whistler New Westminster British Columbia Toronto Ontario Canada This killerchiller was professionally directed  though with no originality by Jim Gillespie . After the movie was finished in 1999 Universal studio decided to screen it to a test audience but all screenings of the first cut got very bad reactions by them  it was then shelved for quite some time while reshoots and story changes were being done  in conclusion  the movie debuted in USA in home video .

The best part is the ending Spoiler Warning! when Malloy throws the killer into some spikes and takes him off them a second later he throws him into them again.If you like Stallone or the serial killing genre it's worth watching.For more insanity check out comeuppancereviews.com";

If you look up information about this movie youll find that it has been finished for nearly 3 years and now i know why they havent released it for so long. Its sucks.  SUCKS  I wasnt impressed with Get Carter either  but at least that movie had some cool OneLiners and Stallone played a bit more like he used in movies like Cobra. Back to DTox as it is called here in Europe and why it sucked1. The Cast  What idiot did the casting ? Why do you take actors like Robert Patrick Sean Patrick Flanery  Tom Berenger Dina Meyer etc. and give them the worst parts ever ? I bet they all hoped that this crap was not gonna be released. Robert Patrick looked like a Fag  Tom Berenger played a stupid janitor  Dina Meyer had a 20sec role and Sean Patrick Flanery? I remember seeing him in one scene and in the next he was dead. Great stuff CastingEinstein. Why didnt you take crap actors for these parts and give the better i dont use the word good here parts to the known actors. At least it would be more fun to watch.2. The Script  Written by Firsttimer Ron L.Brinkerhoff which is based on some book i doubt that the book was a hit. It feels like a ScreamS alike only with older actors and different setting. The dialogues are boring have no depth and theres nothing memorable at all. A script like can be made it into directtovideo movie with zgrade actors but not into a 60mio budget thriller starring stallone. I think they took 3 screamalike scripts and probably some treatments for I know what you blabla 3 and rewrote it into one. I cant imagine the book was anything near to this.3. The Director  You know its really a bad sign when the tagline of a movie goes like From the Director of I know what you did last summer and its no wonder that this genius hasnt made a movie since this masterpiece. I think i dont need to mention that his previous and only effort I know..... was crap as well. He has no own style at all  the scenes have no real tension and everyhing looks cheap. Im really curious where the whole budget went.4. STALLONE  well .. he tries .. its sad to see him in a movie like that. Hes not bad he tries to act and stands out in the movie but that doesnt help much. In fact it even makes the movie worse because its painful to watch him go further and further to the bottom of his career by choosing crap like that to do.I cant recommend this movie to anyone not even to the screamfags .. aehh.. i mean screamfans. Theres no real action the twist at the end where they reveil the murder is a joke and whole story does that minialcatraz really exist ?? haha is laughable.Sly if you read this  you should have listend to Emmerich he sucks at movies but even he did know what kind of crap this movie would be when he was about to helm this masterpiece but jumped off. Quote  If youre going to do this movie youll ruin your careerCouldnt have said it better.Cmon  get back to the roots  next time chose a kick ass  filled with oneliners  actionscript and please look whos the director first. If you continue to make movies like that you end up in history as a guy who made forgettable movies  try to make the movies that made you big because nearly all of your fans want to see you kick ass like in Cobra  Rocky and Rambo. At least give us some Demolition Man ...".

As it started off as a TV mini series  I decided to watch maybe half at one sitting  but hey  from the first 5 minutes it was just totally engrossing viewing  and I saw all 3 hours plus in one sitting . And what a story ! The characters were clear and bold the acting was just wonderful almost Shakespearean at times in its intensity The photography and scenery  just stunning  As a person with an interest in history and legends  I found the story line quite remarkable and perhaps the best retelling of the Arthurian legends I have encountered. The author of the book had so obviously done her homework .The soundtrack alone was worth the cost of the DVD . The depiction of the ancient mother earth religion is most beautiful to behold  and has to be a highlight of the movie for me . A GREAT movie indeed !".

As it started off as a TV mini series  I decided to watch maybe half at one sitting  but hey  from the first 5 minutes it was just totally engrossing viewing  and I saw all 3 hours plus in one sitting . And what a story ! The characters were clear and bold the acting was just wonderful almost Shakespearean at times in its intensity The photography and scenery  just stunning  As a person with an interest in history and legends  I found the story line quite remarkable and perhaps the best retelling of the Arthurian legends I have encountered. The author of the book had so obviously done her homework .The soundtrack alone was worth the cost of the DVD . The depiction of the ancient mother earth religion is most beautiful to behold  and has to be a highlight of the movie for me . A GREAT movie indeed !";

	schema:reviewBody "Over the past two nights I was carried away to Avalon and Camelot.  Even though I've seen virtually every version of the Arthurian legends ever filmed and was a bit hesitant about seeing yet another this was a winner! Being told through the eyes of the women involved who are generally reduced to Guinevere Morgana aka Morgaine and the Lady of the Lake's arm in most tellings made this completely an original. I must admit that I have never been a great fan of Juliana Margulies even though I've watched ER since it first aired but she was wonderful as Morgaine in this.  Joan Allen and Anjelica Huston gave performances worthy of the Oscars they've been nominated for and Samantha Mathis as the illfated Guinevere was heartbreaking. As a final note I believe the casting director definitely merits an Emmy since the little girl who played young Morgaine looked EXACTLY like a preteen version of Juliana and Hans Matheson who played the evil Mordred Morgaine's son couldn't have resembled Juliana more if she'd have really given birth to him! As an enchanting mythological fantasy tale I recommend it to anyone over 14 due to a slightly graphic necessary sexual scene dealing with incest and one of a menage a trois nature.".

	schema:reviewBody "KingHamlet you frighten me.Arguing that Mists either the book or the film is not true to Arthurian myth is quite meaningless. As Ms. Bradley says in the book there is no such thing as a true story only perspectives with the truth lying somewhere betwixt them. There are many versions of the Arthurian myth plenty of which are preChristian in origin. Bradley's book is a masterful retelling of Arthur's story from a unique perspective. Dismissing it as feminist revisionism simply demonstrates a lack of knowledge about the subject and closemindedness.Anyway back to the miniseries...I think that any adaptation can be judged on two levels. First does the adaptation faithfully convey the source material? Second barring success on the first point does the adaptation work in and of itself separate from the source material?I feel that TNT's The Mists of Avalon fails on both counts.First the movie has little if anything to do with the book. Other than the title and the general idea Arthur's tale told from the perspective of the female characters primarily Morgaine there's really very little of the book that survives the transition. There are wild departures from the plot characterizations are vastly different and one of the crucial elements of the book the presentation of the Old Faith is really given short shrift. You half expect Viviane to ride in on a broom and make people grow warts.Second as a film independent of the source material Mists is just plain not a very good movie. I was initially excited by the casting but their actual performances are quite middling. Margulies' accent is atrocious and her performance unremarkable. Allen is practically twirling her mustache throughout the film. Houston is passable at best. The rest of the cast are generally unremarkable though I will say that Samantha Mathis turns in a good performance as Gwenhwyfar matching the spirit if not the letter of Bradley's book. The actors who play Morgaine and Arthur as children though given little screen time are also fairly good.Visually there are moments when the film is impressive. The costume design though not really matching the book's descriptions in any way does a god job of capturing the Romanized Celt look of the period. Still there are also moments when despite the reputed 20M budget the film looks quite cheap. More thoughtfulness and less CG might have helped.In all it is unfortunate that screenwriter Gavin Scott or the studio execs who sign his paycheck felt the need to so drastically rewrite Bradley's work. The novel has sold millions of copies and been translated into numerous languages. Why Scott felt the need to so mercilessly tamper with what was obviously a proven successful story is beyond me. It is an audacity I see quite often in Hollywood and I still don't understand its allure.TNT's The Mists of Avalon will disappoint all but the most forgiving Bradley fans and will ultimately be remembered as yet another bad fantasy film. Give this one a pass and go read the book instead.".

And please do not think that I am some fanatical devotee of the book  I found that it had plenty of flaws but at least it had a point. This hack job misinterprets or leaves out just about every important aspect of the book.The story has been rewritten and greatly condensed and I understand the need to trim things out in order to fit it into four hours. What is unforgivable is that screenwriter Gavin Scott has turned Bradley's novel on its ear. He's deftly disposed of almost all of the PaganChristian conflict often making it seem as if the main threat to Avalon is the Saxon invasion. If you are not willing to portray the Christians as the ostensible bad guys in the piece why even attempt to film this tale? And in order to simplify things for the audience Joan Allen's Morgause is turned into a fullscale witch and evil doer. Apparently they felt the need to have someone to root against but instead of making it the traitorous Arthur his religionaddled Gwenhwyver and the turncoat Merlin Kevin Harper  as it is in the book  Morgause takes the blame for everything bad that happens here. It's a particularly gutless and feeble switch.Having Morgaine find aid and help at the convent near the end of the film is a special slap in the face to anyone who understood the book. That Morgaine would take refuge under the auspices of the very forces of intolerance that she's been harried by throughout the story shows that no one involved in the production seems to have grasped the Church's critical  and negative  role in the book.Leaving the destruction of the plot alone the production values were nice enough  some great capes! The casting was especially bad though. Joan Allen as a teenager?!?! And Michael Vartan as Lancelot is quite poor  this guy's supposed to be an irresistible man of action but Vartan plays him as a dour and stonyfaced simp. And who was it that gave that horrid dishwaterblonde wig to Samantha Mathis???All in all this is an amazingly distorted poorly rendered version of the story as presented by Bradley. If the producers just wanted to make their own silly version of the Arthurian legend why did they feel the need to buy the rights to Bradley's novel? They sure didn't film it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really surprised to hear someone actually tackled the difficult task of turning this fantastic book into a movie. And how I hoped the movie would be true to the spirit of the novel! Having watched it I'm both disappointed and angry because it is clear the script doesn't even TRY that.The first part was actually ok although several important scenes that are absolutely needed to understand the story later on like the relationship between Morgaine and Lancelot were edited out. At least they got the pacing right in part one  I didn't get the feeling they were rushing through the story.Then I saw part two and it got real nasty. Not only did the pacing change of course they had to put 34 of the book in 12 of the total running time as part one only covered about 14 also every detail that would have made the story and characters understandable was left out. Lancelot's relationship towards Morgaine towards Arthur ! and even towards Gwenhwyfar remains completely undefined Morgause's motives are reduced to pure envy and the religion of the goddess is reduced to having visions and being able to part the mists of Avalon. The sequence of actions was completely mixed up major portions removed and others completely mangled Morgause killing Viviane? Come on!. The worst screwup is the ending which was purely disgusting and showed the writer of the script either completely misunderstood the book or even worse decided to turn it into its own opposite on purpose. In the book Morgaine realizes that although the power of Avalon may be gone the goddess is not when she sees a statue of Brigid once an Irish goddess now turned into the holy Bridget by the new religion symbolizing the survival of the old religion even through the new one. She then sees once more an image of the holy grail in the chapel symbolizing the possibility of a peaceful coexistence of both religions and finally manages to open the mists of Avalon for the last time and disappear into them.The movie lets her look at a statue of the virgin Mary the very symbol of how Christianity glorifies virginity and reduces women to the sole purpose of childbearing and understand the goddess is alive ???In short everything remotely nonpc was relentlessly cut from the novel and the rest was turned into a medieval soap opera without any character development. The only consolation is that Marion ZimmerBradley did not have to see this butchering of the very spirit of her work.As to how the movie will appeal to someone who did not read the book I don't know  I suspect it will be seen as a decent medieval adventure but the holes that the removal of multiple important scenes leave will probably confuse.Nice acting by Margulies however and especially by Hans Matheson Mordred.".

	schema:headline " If you liked the book you'll hate the movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Most movie adaptations of books have their problems missing characters and storylines. Those problems are abundant here but The Mists of Avalon compounds all of those by miscasting the characters adding special effects that look like 6th grade art projects and turning the whole thing into a fantasysoap opera.  In the book Morgause is 10 years older than Morgaine. Here Joan Allen at least 35 years old plays Morgause and Morgaine is about 11.  Igraine is even older than Morgause and by the time she conceives Arthur she must be 40 even though she conceived Morgaine at 15. Fortyyear old mothers were rare in 450 A.D.  The book talks about dangers to women in their late twenties.  Lancelot looks like a super model with light chain mail on.  In the book he is certainly attractive but he is also the greatest warrior in the land.  The actor playing Lancelot wouldn't and couldn't harm a flea.  Angelica Huston is particularly bad as a 60year old Viviane delivering her lines woodenly while at the same time coddling Morgaine to a degree that the book does not contemplate.  Those who did not read the book won't care about the miscasting though they may be appalled at Huston's acting but I'm embarrassed for TNT when I see Viviane raise the mists to reveal a papier mache Avalon.  Then the cut back to Viviane and Morgaine on the boat looks like they are sitting on a sound stage with the sort of generic offblue background you might get sitting for a family portrait at OlanMills.  They have also added a lot of sap to the relationships but it seemed like they added it to all the wrong ones. There isn't enough sap between Lancelot and Guinevere to match the book yet Morgaine appears to be everyone's best friend.  I was prepared to be disappointed because you can't squeeze 50 characters and 900 pages into a two hour movie but I expected better casting and special effects and a lot less hugging.".

Spare  yourself the agony and frustration don't watch it.  It's painful.  Keep the movie you have played in your head as you read the book as your own.  I could not bring myself to watch the entire second part.  It strayed immediately from anything recognizable as MZB's book.To her credit though Julianna Margulies did do a great job with what she was given. I think I can say she is the face of Morgaine. As for the rest of them I think they were sadly miscast.  Even Angelica Huston who I think I have liked in almost everything I have seen her in.  She was just not Viviane.I can say one nice though. It was pretty.Unfortunately it in the end became like every other tale of Arthur. Leaving out ALL the good bits.  They should have left well enough alone. I would like to speak of all that was ruined but that would spoil things for those who might watch in future.  Just be warned.That is my rantThus Ends The Tirade".

I cringe when I think that people who haven't read the original book might think that the story of the film was the story that Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote. The book was profound and it stood out as a new feminine perspective of the Arthurian legend taking all the exaggerated mythical magic deception and melodrama and turning them into believable humanity with a respectful portrayal of spirituality both Christian and Pagan.One can't expect too much from a madeforTV version of any story. Quite often they are glamourised so that very little subtlety shows and the whole turns out to be obvious and even cheesy. I understand this and I just wish that they had not bothered to make a miniseries of this wonderful book. It seemed to take a step backwards into those exaggerated myths of old with treachery and villains added in distracting the viewer from the worthwhile plot. I can only hope that the film might engage people's curiosity into reading the book. I encourage you to do this  you'll be pleasantly surprised.".

The costumes are well done and true to period almost  it depends on whether you hold with Camelot being dated to the mid 400's AD or the 1400's AD.  Next the scene with Arthur  Morgaine at the Beltaine feast where they are in costume and unaware of each other's identity was very cleverly done.  I liked the details on the wall of the chamber and the markings on Juliana's face arms and legs.

It is set in ye olde Britain where Christianity is gaining ascendancy over the ancient druid religion.  In an increasingly desperate effort to keep the old ways alive Viviane  the Lady of the Lake  shapes the destinies of Morgaine Arthur Gwenwyfar Lancelot and the other familiar characters.  But some of them begin to rebel at being moved around like pieces on a game board.Why in such a quintessential British story were so many American actors used?  They either speak painfully slowly in their attempts to sound English or they use dreadful fauxBritish accents that frequently slip. And while Angelica Huston's accent is admirable she is too strident and not ethereal enough as the Lady of the Lake.  The thoroughly evil Mordred acts entirely with his eyebrows and there are some abysmal performances in the minor roles.Such a lavish production deserves better.  The sets scenery and costumes are visually spectacular but there are too many annoyances to distract the viewer.  The 'mists' of the title are created through an overindulgence in smoke machines and perhaps this is symbolic of the fact that in the wrong hands a good story can become a bad film.".

But there were parts that kept to the book and so it goes. But oh man if you watch this and never read the book I feel sad for your loss. The book is a thrilling tale about change and fate. It delves into realms of religion and how one religion overcomes another. There are also sub plots of innocence trust and the betrayal of trust. This show was more about the men and their lives. I had hoped that maybe someone would have the nerve to show a differing viewpoint but I suppose not yet. I am sad and so I lament. Please someone have the nerve to make this book as a movie as it is not for the forwarding of a differing perception but because it is a beautiful book.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mists of Avalon 2001 Starring Angelica Houston Joan Allen Julianna Margulies Michael Byrne Edward Atterton Samantha Mathis Michael Vartan Hans Matheson Mark Lewis Jones Clive Russell Ian Duncan David Calder John Comer Tony Curran Karel Dobry Biddy Hodson Noah Huntley Klara Issova Edward Jewsbury Christopher Fulford Hugh Ross....Director Uli Edel...Screenplay Gavin Scott.Based on the popular novels by Marion Zimmer Bradley Mists of Avalon was adapted into a successful cable miniseries that nevertheless strayed from the original literary source but turned out to be a grand cinematic affair complete with a superb and talented cast stunning visual effects and artistic direction. The familiar legend of King Arthur Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table is approached in a radically different manner. It has been revised so as to appear closer to the historical period where the myth of Arthur developed the time of the warring Anglos and Saxons as well as revised so that the female characters that figure in the legends are even more significant. Angelica Houston delivers a strong performance as the spiritual matriarch figure Lady of the Lake Vivien the High Prietess of Avalon. Avalon is an eternally beautiful island hidden in the mists where the ancient mysterious primeval Goddess is worshipped. She has under her tutelege two women Morgaine Julianna Margulies who is the most qualified to succeed her as High Priestess and the darker more ambitious sorceress Morgause Joan Allen. While much of the same content from the old legends remain intact  i.e. Uther Pendragon beds Igraine to conceive Arthur Arthur grows up to be king after receiving the sword Excalibur Lancelot and Guenevere are accused of committing adultery and treason Mordred battles Arthur the wounded and dying Arthur is transported to Avalon  the events are manipulated behindthescenes by the cunning magic and influence of the women each who have wills of their own and envision a Camelot of their own making. Morgaine and Arthur commit incest without knowing it during a pagan fertility ritual the result of this union is the evil Mordred who is himself reared to be king by the evil Morgause. King Arthur Edward Atterton finds that he loves both his friend and champion knight Lancelot Michael Vartan and his wife Guenevere who is bitter because she cannot bare his children. The result of this a threesome between the three of them. Guenevere Samantha Mathis finds that she cannot have children cannot have a proper husband in a king with too many loads on his back nor a lover in Lancelot so she retires to a convent. Morgaine learns to value spiritual matters over material ones and throughout the film grows as a woman. Despite the attempt at a feminist version of the Arthur saga the women cannot take matters into their own hands and instead scheme and use witchcraft to do their work far from true feminism in which a woman proves herself worthy on her own. But even with this turnoff the film is excessively beautiful and contains a magical mysterious quality that takes you to another world and time. With music by Lee Holdrige and Loreena McKennitt a popular Celticblooded singer of the late 90's this is a story of interest to women Arthurian legend lovers and Wiccans whose rites like Beltane as depicted in the movie are still very much a part of their religion. This movie is powerful emotional and perhaps the only real fault is that as many viewers have noted the series stray from the original novel.".

	schema:headline " Poor adaptation of the book but still interesting to see the story as a movie";
	schema:reviewBody "SOME SPOILER CONTENTI have seen this film twice and my reaction after seeing it the first time was Wow what crap! I can't believe the book turned into this! However the second time I watched it I was able to cut them a little more slack because I could focus less on the story and more on the acting and choice of characters and possibly why they made certain parts of the film as they did. Obviously one of the main issues with the film is that the book is very long and they had to find a way to cram 900 pages into a 2hour movie. That is hard enough in itself which means a lot of the book had to be chopped out or addressed only very briefly. Which means that if you were watching the movie and had never read the book you would probably be really confused as to why things are happening. A lot of major events were slimmed down into 2minute or less conversations or sometimes only 1 sentence. However I do give them credit for putting a lot of the major events in the movie given the short time frame. The second time I watched it I was amazed at how much stuff they actually did manage to put in the movie and gave them credit for that.The next issue was the whole tone of the movie does not match that of the book. In the book the old religion and Avalon are mystical magical mysterious and powerful. The whole tone of the book is like that but it really doesn't carry over into the movie. In the movie they keep saying things like If you don't help Avalon we'll bring you down but if you hadn't read the book you'd probably think Why? They don't look that powerful. In a lot of the scenes the people of the old religion example the Beltane scenes end up seeming like barbarians which was totally not how it was in the book. The issue of the rivalry between Christianity and the old religion was extremely toned down in the movie presumably to fit modern Christian audiences. The book showed both pagan and Christian fanatics but in the movie the Christians were not as hardcore as they were in the book. I think a lot of the issuesthemes were less extreme in the film.Another issue was the entire end of the movie which I will not go into here! The last 3040 minutes of the movie had no resemblance whatsoever to what happened in the book. Was this creative license a wish to rewrite the ending or was it designed to prove a point or made that way to Hollywoodize the movie? I don't know but it was disappointing.OK the next issue is casting. Good Casting I loved Julianne Margulies as Morgaine and I really think she did a great job of being Morgaine and was probably the bestcast actoractress in the movie. Samantha Mathis also did a good job as Gwenhwyfar although her religious fanaticism was not really discussed in the movie. Arthur  Lancelot were OK but they didn't do any really extraordinary acting they were really on the sidelines of the movie. Bad Casting I did not like Anjelica Huston as Viviane. I thought the entire character was way off from the book. In the book Viviane was a powerful aloof sorceress but in the movie she was smiling and hugging people and crying. Viviane did not do these things! Maybe the decision to change the character for the movie was made by the director I don't know but it was a poor decision. The power of Viviane was basically nonexistent in the movie. I did not like Caroline Goodall as Igraine she was way way too old she was supposed to be about 16 or 17 at the beginning of the movie but she obviously looked 3540! Igraine's character should have been more feisty but it really just seemed contrived. As for Joan Allen as Morgause I thought Joan Allen was good as an older Morgause but someone much younger should have played her at the beginning of the story she was supposed to be 1214 at the beginning. Also obviously Morgause was made out to be a villainess for expediency's sake in the movie but she was really not like that in the book. I think I understand why they did that in the movie but her character was really more complex than just a villainess. Also the part of her using magic to curse people was way off from the book Morgause was not really a practitioner of magic she didn't have the knowledge.Horrible Casting Merlin. His character had zero impact he might as well not have even been in the movie.All in all it was still interesting to watch but woefully inadequate as an adaptation of the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's been almost five years since I read the book so my memory on the original story is a bit dim.The movie was a lot better than I believed it would be and although the plot makes huge jumps and goes on really fast at times I was still very entertained the whole way through. Or maybe entertained isn't the right word to describe the experience since the story isn't exactly a very happy one.Casting was mostly good. The actor of Morgaine did the role very well hmm also being super hot all the while... ahem as did Mordred's. It's amazing how much the actor managed to squeeze from the scant lines he was given in the movie. Arthur was also good as this somewhat gullible very sincere person that was brought down by the people around him that he loved  trusted. Except that there wasn't really any air of command around him he just didn't seem like this radiant personality he was supposed to be. Most others were at least fine but I didn't like Anjelica Huston as Vivianne too much. Maybe if she didn't look like a burnt out hippie on crack for the whole movie I could have concentrated more on the portrayal of her character. Now she just didn't fit in really.Obviously a lot was cut out so there's not really any point in complaining about that... Well. In the end they DID make some rather awkward shortcuts like the whole scene of Morgaine returning to Camelot with Mordred holding court there. Just horrible PConsidering that this is a TV production the audiovisuals in the movie are very acceptable. I also liked that the props were mostly quite down to earth and believable. No knights running around in shiny plate mail here  And people do get old and get tired during the course of the story. Some parts were a bit suspect though... The Avalon priestesses with their silly tiedye hippie new age gear were almost downright laughable as were some of the female leads' gowns and stuff. The soundtrack was very good and fit the new agey theme well with all the sarangis and other accidental occidentalisms... And gotta love Loreena McKennit anyway!I liked the first half better than the end especially the last 20 minutes or so just didn't work. Somehow I was left with the impression that the director originally wanted one 60 minute episode more but had to cut it and shoot through the whole second half of the story with way too much speed.I also liked the way how the personalities  relationships were the focus of the story. Yup Zimmer Bradley's stories might be a bit of soap but they still are refreshing when compared to these Woman waits at home. Man goes out to kills orcs  goons. Man returns. And then they pork except that we're spared this since the writer is some utter puritanstories that Tolkien  co have churned out.But really how CAN you spoil this story? I've read a few versions of the story and you really WOULD have to try to lose all the drama...OK next I've just GOT to see King Arthur 2004 with Gwenhywfar sp? goddamn welsh is sick the warrior princess and whatnot D".

The movie has just started.Made in 1986 Dust in the Wind belongs to the first artistic decade of Hou HsiaoHsien. This was a period when the Taiwanese director was preoccupied by the story of his own generation the youngsters from the sixties coming to age while their country was coming to age. Teenagers leaving the countryside for the big cities facing the challenges of an unknown environment trying to understand the new realities and to adapt while still reluctant. Youngsters behaving erratically like dust in the wind dreaming big till confronted by time and fate time to erode all illusions fate to treat all dreams like dust in the wind.Nothing remarkable happens in this movie. You can consider the plot as extremely boring only this is not the point. Also some reviewers stressed out the unsentimental approach of the director in telling a story that after all implies sentiments. It's true but again this is not the point. Like in all films of Hou HsiaoHsien the plot has the unique role to create a universe and to leave room for meditation. The language of images is here essential to operate on the subconscious level. Watching Dust in the Wind calls immediately in mind the world from the movies of De Sica but the Taiwanese master gets subtly beyond. It's just amazing how this director takes the sordid in good neorealist tradition finds the perfect place for each actor for each object and processes everything in hypnotic long takes.The influence of Ozu is also present in this movie let away the same love for railroad scenes think at the last scene showing the ocean it's the moment of stasis the way all Ozu's works end coming immediately after the dramatic outcome of the plot it suggests that whatever happens is unimportant in the cosmic order of things life will go on anyway. What differentiates Ozu and Hou is the way they treat the plot. If you watch any movie created by Ozu you have the feeling that the Japanese master is seated near you enjoying the events from the screen as much as you do. For Hou the story is like an executive summary detailed just to the point where the images can exist on their own to play on the hypnotic register.I found Dust in the Wind on youTube in ten consecutive videos. I know that watching a movie by Hou HsiaoHsien on youTube can be painful so I suggest you get a DVD copy if possible. I watched it on youTube and my Internet connection was getting slower every now and then. However it paid.".

Like most of the films of Hou Hsiao Hsien viewers will be divided into two sharply opposed camps.The main characters in the film are two highschool students. The first is Wan who  seeing his village as a deadend careerwise decides to leave their home town to go to Taipei to find work intending to complete his education via nightschool. His girlfriend Huen also leaves for Taipei after graduation. The other personages are family members employers friends and coworkers.The story presented consists of a number of vignettes in typical Hou fashion with stationary camera and naturalistic performances. Glimpses are given of their occupations their moments together and their times apart. Though varying from the very funny to the emotionally raw they have a cumulative effect resonating with a reality that is not idealised and is yet still filled with moments of sublime grace somehow existing with situations of despair misery boredom and loss. There is little music only a solitary guitar used to punctuate scenes almost like a musical interlude often combined with stunning scenery.Apart from the immediate plot something can also be glimpsed of the attitudes of the rural native Taiwanese towards the city and the higher classes as well as to the vicissitudes of life in general. On a whole the film seems imbued with the melancholy fatalistic philosophy indicated by its title.A worthy member of Hou's inimitable body of films 'Dust in the Wind' was touching and memorable though with an absence of schmaltz. It is a film I hope to revisit soon. As for recommendations I'm not sure that it will be everyone's 'cup of tea'. Some will find many of its aspects in particular its detachedness quite alienating. Certainly those already familiar with Hou or fans of Taiwanese cinema in general will want to see it. Those who like Ozu Bresson or Tarkovsky may find it worthwhile also. There is the same naturalistic feel understated acting and long takes. But it is also very much the work of an original auteur who is honing his craft and producing unique personal films.".

	schema:reviewBody "SLIGHT SPOILERSHou Hsiaohsien is a filmmaker whose name has been dropped a thousand times in conversations I've had in the past year. Last week I had a chance to see A Time to Live and a Time to Die. It was terrible. BUT it was early in his career and I was warned that many did not care for it. I can't imagine who would but apparently there are some on the planet. And to boot not that many people had seen it. It is not available on video in the US. Those who alerted me to this filmmaker's existence were thoughtful and intelligent people so I had no intention on giving up on Hsiaohsien. This week I got a chance to see Dust in the Wind. And I liked it. Now it's nothing to write home about but this being I think the film he made right after ATtLaTtD his maturation can be seen quite clearly. The script of Dust in the Wind is much better. When this film began and I saw the aging but humorous grandfather the injured and quiet father and the harsh mother I figured oh hell this Hsiaohsien guy is such a poor writer that he can't even come up with a different family for his next film. The family of ATtLaTtD consisted of an old grandmother who supplied all the comic relief a mother who was constantly disciplining her children and a father who was dying of TB. The only difference in DitW was that the grandfather was actually amusing the grandmother in the earlier film was simply a nuisance. And lo and behold Hsiaohsien and his editor had learned how to edit! ATtLaTtD worked on the assumption that all a movie has to contain to be great is a multitude of long takes. A film can be good if it has a fondness for longer takes take a look at anything Andrei Tarkovsky's made but I would say that only a pro should depend on them so heavily. We arthouse patrons may like the occasional ten minute take but those who know their stuff can tell when the director and editor were keeping the takes long simply because they have no imagination. Hollywood style editing has proven itself over and over again and unless you are a Tarkovsky or an Ozu forget it bud. The first scene of DitW is made up of a couple of long takes of 1 a train pushing forward on the tracks about a three or four minute take and 2 of the two main characters standing in the train about a two minute take. The second scene where grandpa attempts to feed the children is edited with quick cuts almost jump cuts which suggests the old man's mounting frustrations with his disobedient grandchildren the way in which he gets one grandson to eat his dinner is classic. This is how editing works and Hsiaohsien has learned that. Now his ten minute takes are not a burden. They carry more weight.The film also contains its share of truly fantastic scenes including those opening two that I referenced. Another one involves the two main characters Wan the boy and Huen the girl who are dependent on each other and call it love at a bar with a bunch of friends. The emotions that play out in this scene are fantastic. Wan's friends convince Huen to take her first drink of beer which she does in one huge gulp followed closely by a second on her own accord. Then Hsiaohsien cuts to a shot over Huen's shoulder. A space to her right is left open around the otherwise full table and from across the table Han fills that gap. The shot lasts for some five minutes. Han is angry at Huen and the emotions are broadcast marvelously mostly by the way Han smokes in this composition. The best scene in the movie involves Han's attempts to steal a moped. This was the only scene that truly affected me. At least one scene really bothered me. The visual style of this film is rather bland. And I don't mind that the genre is neorealism whether Hsiaohsien knows that or not his debts to Vittorio de Sica and Satyajit Ray seem clear enough to me and the visuals are supposed to look cheap because well these movies are made for very little money. For a film like this when I say that a shot is well composed like the bar scene I mentioned above it is because it is composed in such a way to give the scene its maximum emotional weight. That shot was marvelous not because it was flashy but because it seemed natural and it was miraculously economical. Now there comes a shot nearer the film's end after Han is drafted into the army in which two soldiers are shot at a high angle in silhouette as they stand on top of a hill bluish storm clouds against a pinkish sky. In a film where naturalism is the goal of every composition this particular shot stands out like a sore thumb. C'mon Hou if you want to emulate Ingmar Bergman wait until your next film and then style your film in that manner! It's a truly embarrassing shot. I've said nothing about the film's story. Suffice it to say it is touching but not too much so. Han is a well developed character but I felt that I ought to have known Huen more. Her decision near the end of the film comes too quickly and at too great a distance from the action. The audience then has no choice but to make a bitter judgement on her character. We side solely with Han when we it should be more ambiguous previously they had been given rather equal footing in their developments. The final scene is quite beautiful however and leaves the audience feeling like they've witnessed something at least somewhat worthwhile. 710.".
