At the beginning he flees from his impoverished countryside origin  Jaen  for the broader horizons of the big city . This is a good film about a young who emigrates to big town  Barcelona  like many others  however  he finds exploitation and hardworking and finally he gets his dream  to be a successful bullfighter . At the same time it deals with Spanishstyle bullfighting  it is called Corrida De Toros literally running of bulls or la fiesta the festival.Neorealist yarn talks about a young peasant goes to big city to achieve great success as matador . Along the way he finds distresses  penury and hard as well as parttime jobs . The flick deals with the relationship between man and society  between man and glory hunger . It describes the hardship existences of lower classes on countryside as well as big cities where a lot of people working for nothing in short wages and precarious works . Director Francesco Rosi attempts to reflect Spanish life of the past sixties  including social habits  as there appears Holy Week Procesiones  religious parades  San Fermin parties  Flamenco dancing  among others . Evocative and sensitive original musical score by Piero Piccioni and atmospheric songs of Saetas  Andaluz Cante  Flamenco and religious music . Colorful cinematography by Pasqualino De Santis  though a perfect remastering being necessary . The film gives a real description about Bullfighting art  as the bull is released into the ring where he is tested for ferocity by the matador and Banderilleros with the magenta and gold Capote Cape. This is the first stage the Tercio de Varas the lancing third. The matador confronts the bull with the Capote performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull . Next a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a Vara lance. In the next stage the Tercio De Banderillas the third of Banderillas each of the three Banderilleros attempts to plant two Banderillas sharp barbed sticks into the bull's shoulders . In the final stage the the third of death  the matador reenters the ring alone with a small red cape or Muleta and a sword .The motion picture was well directed by Francesco Rosi . Francesco Rosi was born 1922 in Naples  Campania  location where he often shoots his films . Rosi is a very good Italian filmmaker whose themes are always more or less the same  the relationship between man and society  between man and power . Most of his films deal with controversial issues and have political messages . It includes terrorism issues  political murders  Mafia and policy . He tried to reflect a little of Italian life of the past fifty years  using Italy as the context all the problems that come from the oppression of people by power  whether it's economic power  military power  political power or the power of the Mafia . Rossi was a writer and director known for Salvatore Giuliano 1959  Hands Over the City 1963 Case Mattei 1972  Lucky Luciano 1973  Illustrious Corpses 1976  Carmen by Bizet 1984  Chronicle of a Death Foretold 1987 and Truce 1997 .".

With that out of the way it must be said that not only is this an interesting film about a young man's rise to the top of his profession it's also a beautifully made feature. Shot in colour and in Techniscope Moment of Truth features terrific widescreen compositions both inside and outside the matador's arena. Miguel Mateo is superb as Migeulin the tall dark and handsome country boy who trades in the family plough for a matador's finery and it must be said that from all indications he was a real bullfighter the filmed corridas definitely feature the lead engaging in battle against bulls.".

There are a bunch of major sequences that pits the main character against raging beasts. These scenes aren't staged or faked with trick photography of any kind the players seriously put their lives on the line to confront real bulls on screen. They come dangerously close to getting mauled and gored as they gracefully maneuver and evade the animals. Perhaps most shocking of all is that the bulls themselves are hurt onscreen often soaked in blood and the camera lingers on their agony.There is a basic narrative at work it's generally the same formula that goes into movies like Gladiator or Rollerball for these are all movies where some dude gets involved with a deadly sport and proves to be so good at it that he's pushed to the top. The Moment of Truth is a more original feature though with characters that look and act quite realistic. The film boasts some intriguing parallels to the politics of the time but even on its own the plot is not bad. My only complaint is that it's pretty dry in between the more exciting scenes.The film has a look and style that's at least halfway like a documentary. Photography tends to be rather pedestrianlooking and there are a lot of distant shots. It looks quite gritty and real this way but I think it also distances the viewer a bit and I think the film could have been more effective if the camera could be closer to the action. Editing is pretty rough for this film as well. Acting and writing tends to be understated and appears authentic that way. This production uses some very reallooking sets props costumes and locales. There is no music score.This film reveals a lot it shows the valor courage and skill of bullfighters but also the bloody brutality and mortal danger of it all. If you have the stomach for it it is worth seeing at least once.45 Entertainment Pretty Good  Story Pretty Good  Film Good".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Red Squirrel' starts off like a Hitchcockian thriller but soon becomes more complex and difficult to categorize. By the end of this utterly fascinating movie I would be hard pressed to label it. A mystery and a love story don't give you the whole picture. Just see it for yourself if you want something challenging and original. I know nothing about writerdirector Julio Medem but after watching this film I will rectify that as soon as possible! The basic plot is fairly simple  a washed up pop star contemplates suicide. Before he can do so he witnesses a road accident a motorbike crash. A young girl is injured slightly but appears to be amnesiac. On the spur of the moment he tells her that he is her boyfriend and invents a name for her Lisa his exgirlfriend who he still loves. He visits her as she recuperates in hospital and as it looks more and more likely that he will be found out he smuggles her out and takes her on a camping holiday. Then things get a bit strange... The plot as I said is fairly simple but the movie is not. I was hooked from the opening scenes and was fascinated until the very end. I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " A mesmerising thriller with hints of magical realism";
	schema:reviewBody "Julio Medem is something of an underrated figure within the spectrum of world cinema. He regularly produces bold imaginative and exciting films that shatter the usual preconceptions we might have of the limitations of cinematic language and storytelling in the visual sense as well as presenting an incredibly intelligent and original approach to the ideas of production design editing and cinematography. Despite this however he has yet to be fully acclaimed universally as a great filmmaker in the tradition of Tarkovsky Bergman Hitchcock Kubrick Godard Welles etc  or even ranked alongside contemporary cinematic figures such as Pedro Almodvar Lars von Trier Aki Kaurismki Michael Haneke and Guillermo Del Toro. The Red Squirrel 1993 was only Medem's second feature following the elliptical historical satire Vacas 1991 and yet even now we can already see the themes from that particular film being further developed in preparation for the later perhaps even great films such as Tierra 1996 The Lovers of the Arctic Circle 1998 and Sex and Lucia 2001.Like those films The Red Squirrel is a multilayered work rife with possible interpretations and elements of broad Buuelian surrealism that are at odds with the more recognisable presentation of reality established in the film's intriguing first half. On our initial viewing the plot can seem incredibly straightforward revolving around the strange relationship between a suicidal former pop star and the mysterious amnesiac woman who literally falls into his life. With this section of the film Medem creates a truly unique modernday thriller building on elements of Hitchcock  most noticeably Vertigo 1957 with its iconographical depictions of mysterious blondes shadowy villains damaged heroes and seething paranoia  but intelligently subverting them by way of elements as diverse as Salvador Dali the aforementioned Buuel lowbudget Bmovies The Road Warrior 1980 elements of magical realism and ideas central to the Basque regional identity again drawing parallels with the hypnotic and selfreflexive world of Vacas. These subtle editions compliment the more recognisable characteristics of the romanticthriller mystery story at the heart of the film to create something that is much more engrossing enticing and unique.As the story progresses and we are drawn ever deeper into the film's central mystery we begin to note the emergence of further plot influences such as psychological horror melodramatic eroticism heartstopping suspense black comedy and eventually fullblown surrealism. As it does the film then becomes much more complex taking on issues of love sexuality mental and physical manipulation mindgames and cinematic roleplaying. Medem ties the whole thing together with some wonderful set pieces and a staggering use of cinematic style put together on an obviously limited budget. It isn't purely the imagination and intelligence of Medem that impresses us though with every wild narrative UTurn or directorial flourish  incorporating everything from Kiss Me Deadly 1955 to Raising Arizona 1987  being backed up by the fine performances from lead actors Nancho Novo and Emma Surez both of whom manage to makes us care an enormous amount about these two protagonists and the relationship that forms between them.Although it's always tempting to say that both Medem and his work is unlike anything else you will ever see I think there are some obvious reference points here many of which have been mentioned above as well as a certain similar approach to filmmakers such Krzysztof Kieslowski  with the deep meditative and vaguely hypnotic use of camera combined with the intricate presentation of a narrative driven by the purely psychological most apparent for example in his epic TV series Dekalog 1989 and one of his greatest films The Double Life of Veronique 1991  and especially a filmmaker like Wong KarWai with the idea of the lead character's enigmatic pop song describing the narrative and the central location manipulating the story so as to take on more selfreflexive metaphorical notions being very much in keeping with films such as like Happy Together 1997 In the Mood for Love 1999 and 2046 2004.As with much of Medem's work including the 2001 erotic mystery thriller Sex and Lucia the film uses much in the way of cinematic coincidences with the various coincidences that form the basis of the plot acting as clues to the narrative. This turns the film into a wonderful example of cinematic storytelling creating a real mystery for the audience in which all the pieces fall perfectly into place during the film's final act but still leave us room for interpretation. Without question this is a delightful cinematic experience that goes way beyond the limitations of film elaborating on some of the complex ideas regarding narrative time character and spirit presented in Vacas whilst simultaneously foreshadowing the ideas of escape transcendence imagination eroticism and the notion of a story being written as it goes which will all be further developed in Sex and Lucia. With this in mind The Red Squirrel is an absolute marvel an epic ornate jigsawpuzzle for the audience and  without question  one of the greatest films of the 1990's.".

Jota reinvents Lisa's past and travels with her to the camping La Ardilla Roja where they befriend the family of a taxi driver. When a stranger comes to the camping claiming that Lisa's name is Sophia indeed and that he is her husband Jota feels trapped in his lies and questions whether Sophia has had amnesia.La Ardilla Roja is a weird and entertaining love story with an original and surrealistic screenplay and bizarre characters and situations. The gorgeous Emma Surez has a stunning performance and shows a great chemistry with the odd and unusual Jota performed by Nancho Novo. The climax with the arrival of Felix to the camp site is strange and a little disappointing but the happy end fits well to the plot. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Esquilo Vermelho The Red Squirrel".

	schema:reviewBody "One year after Medem came to the spotlight with Vacas he made The Red Squirrel a deceptive film about love sex paranoia mystery violence and existence. Complex fascinating and worthy of many viewings it is a film which marks Medem as a special talent but which will probably confuse and annoy the average moviegoer with its interesting take on storytelling heavy imagery and colourful symbolism.Jota is a young Spanish man on the literal brink of suicide. A failed musician and lover who sees no future he stands on the top of a bridge and prepares to jump. From nowhere a motorcyclist appears and races off the bridge crashing heavily below. He goes to the wreckage while an ambulance is called and sees that the rider is a beautiful young women. When he goes with her to the hospital he says he is her boyfriend so that he can stay with her. The doctors say she will recover but that she has suffered total amnesia. The doctors hope that Jota will be able to awaken her memories believing he is her boyfriend so he goes to her and acts the part. She does not remember but they leave together. Jota decides to invent her life and their past calling her Lisa making her into his old girlfriend Vertigo style and she goes along with it. Soon they are in love and they decide to go on holiday to the Red Squirrel camp site. However there both Lisa and Jota's motive's and pasts become less clear as fragments of memories blur with the present and startling imagery surrounds them. They meet a family at the camp and spend time with them. They have their own problems which gradually rise into view and Lisa acts strangely around them in a powerfully erotic manner towards their son and as a strongwilled women to their daughter. Soon a mysterious man appears who claims to know Lisa and the lies soon begin to fall apart. Did Lisa know all along that Jota was lying so she could escape the past? Was Jota trying to pave over the mistakes of the past or did he have more sinister plans? And who is this new guy? The film descends into surrealism with funny parts and plain mindbogglingly absurd scenes before coming to a close. There is much visual invention throughout the film which becomes chaotic towards the climax with that inexplicable '3rd arm punch' being the highlight. There is a tone of mistrust and paranoia throughout the film we don't trust any of the characters just like they do not trust each other. Apparently Kubrick felt this was one of the best films he had ever seen and it has much in common with much of his work both visually and thematically. It draws more comparisons clearly with Vertigo showing the same attention to symbolism which can be discussed till the end of time. Emma Suarez is perfect as Lisa one of the best Spanish actresses alive and Novo is also excellent as the plotting pityinducing and paranoid Jota. The only real faults to be found are that it maybe moves too slowly will deceive everyone and that the main part of the film is such a jigsaw that the makers and the audience have difficulty trying both to decipher everything in the last part and have a suitable ending. Not everything is answered but that is the way it should be and while the ending is satisfying there is always that lingering suspicion in our minds that the story is far from over.8 out of 10".

A magical intriguing story unravels in which the plot seems to be important actually the process of your thinking while watching this movie is more important guided by powerful images and sounds. Julio Medem proves to fit in the Spanish tradition of storytellers using slightly distorted or original images that refer to very basic and elemental issues like nature earth food and sex and suggesting supernatural events. Reviewing the movie with the knowledge that Julio Medem studied medicine before becoming a director adds to insight in the script. If Hitchcock had been still living he would definitely approve of the romantic atmosphere of this thriller!!  The three actors playing the main characters also appear in Medems other movies which in itself starts to form a magic oeuvre. La ardilla Roja or the red squirrel received many prizes at a number of film festivals including the Prix de la Jeunesse at the Cannes Film Festival. I only regret that Julio Medem himself hasn't been playing a character in one of his own films because he is one of the most handsome men I've ever seen beating Banderas with a street length!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Red Squirrel 1993To cut to the chase I genuinely enjoyed watching The Red Squirrel. The story for the most part is unpredictable and ticks along never becoming boring.As you probably know the story starts off with a guy standing on a bridge at night looking down at the crashing waves wanting to throw himself off. His suicidal thoughts are interrupted by a motorbike loosing control smashing through the bridge barrier onto the beach below. As luck would have it the motorbike was being ridden by the rather pretty Emma Surez.

There was not a single cast member when I'd wish someone else was playing the part.I experienced The Red Squirrel on the Tartan DVD release. Picture quality is fine not exceptional. With a story such as The Red Squirrel picture quality somehow means less unlike it would with a film that relies on style over substance.If like me you like foreign language films and don't mind subtitles I can recommend The Red Squirrel".

The story for the most part is unpredictable and ticks along never becoming boring.As you probably know the story starts off with a guy standing on a bridge at night looking down at the crashing waves wanting to throw himself off. His suicidal thoughts are interrupted by a motorbike loosing control smashing through the bridge barrier onto the beach below. As luck would have it the motorbike was being ridden by the rather pretty Emma Surez.

So what happens because of the second ratedness of Vis that Red Squirrel becomes a third rate movie before one's very eyes. Towards the end of it we learn in flashback that Lisa was seen in passing by Jay before the accident that supposedly brings two strangers together and that this brief sighting so smote him that he wrote what would become his favorite song. In the beginning Jay is about to off himself for reasons ultimately that are never revealed when he witnesses a motorcycle smashing off an elevated road and landing in the sand of a beach. But folks the woman driving turns out to be Lisa Elisa who he had already met and fallen desperately in love with after seeing her for less than sixty seconds. THE EXTREMELY LONG ARM OF COINCIDENCE ONCE AGAIN POISONS THE WELL. Sometime later in the movie we learn from ElisaSofia's brother that she was never hurt badly enough to suffer from amnesia. Even Hitchcock didn't mess up logic this much. Jay because of his lying about ES being his livein girlfriend and subsequent behavior indicates that he should be in a mental hospital getting daily analysis and the appropriate medication. Perhaps too a red squirrel may have deep psychological meaning to the Spanish nation but to this North American the repeatedly visual references to it had zero affect. By the way a massively huge problem with Red Squirrel was that the subtitles were out of sync with the actors lips.

The cinematography lighting and visuals create a very recognizable world and yet the way it's presented contributes to the element of surrealism. The score is used efficiently and the acting is superb especially that of Emma Surez Nancho Novo and Mara Barranco.His proceeding releases only prove that Julio Medem is getting better and better with each film.

Being puppets however the viewer is left feeling detached from them even if there is a sense of humanity present that one can grasp.  Oddly enough that is a good thing in this case  it increases the sense of how the only thing that one could do when the tragic events unfold is to watch.This is not a film for all tastes obviously.

Soon live actors replace the puppets but the puppeteers remain in the background silent participants changing the sets assembling the props and pulling the strings representing perhaps the inexorable hand that guides our lives or as Shinoda has said the thin line between truth and falsehood. The film is intensely emotional and has the feel of grand opera but the puppeteers make clear the artificiality of the drama and keep us distanced.In the film Jihei Kichiemon Nakamura is a paper merchant who is married with two young children. Though he loves his wife Osan he has been secretly seeing a courtesan Koharu Shima Iwashita who also plays Osan for two and a half years. He has dissipated his fortune at the brothel and now cannot raise enough money to redeem Koharu from her enslavement to the brothel's owner Kamatari Fujiwara. Though his family finds out about their romance and Osan tries to persuade Jehei to sever the relationship it becomes apparent that the bond is unbreakable and we watch helplessly as the inevitable tragedy unfolds. Double Suicide has a haunting score by Toru Takemitsu and amazing black and white photography shown in sharp detail and contrast in the new Criterion DVD and is highly recommended for a unique viewing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "With highly stylized indisputably unique arthouse films like Masahiro Shinoda's Double Suicide it's always a challenge to describe these works because there's just so much to say. This movie is considered to be one of the most notable films from the Japanese New Wave aka the movement that never officially existed but let's just call it a movement movement which is nevertheless one of the most thematically and artistically fascinating movie periods.Double Suicide is based upon the 1721 play The Love Suicides at Amijima by Monzaemon Chikamatsu which touches on one of Chikamatsu's apparently recurring themes love and individuality getting royally owned by the system. This play is often performed in bunraku puppet theatre style while Shinoda's film mixes avantgarde techniques with bunraku and kabuki theatre styles. The sets are strange and not at all realistic huge white floors with doodles and letterskanji characters written all over them revolving background walls characters getting lost in the indoor decor with giant traditional drawings all over the walls and floors and so on. Sometimes the footage goes into slowmotion or the camera just freezes on a single frame for a dramatic effect. Some halfsecond long establishing shots are repeated. The backdrops change their appearance as the film progresses. For example the calligraphic texts on the walls of the protagonist's shop become amorphous ink blobs dripping down.Kichiemon Nakamura and Shima Iwashita who plays both main female characters as well as the other actors do a great job in their extremely theatrical and melodramatic roles fitting in with the rest of the kabuki charm this movie has going for it. Before the threeact storyline begins we have the opening credits scene which shows the puppets for the play being prepared before getting substituted by real life actors while we listen to a phone conversation between Masahiro Shinoda and Taeko Tomioka a cowriter where they discuss the script as well as location hunting for the penultimate scene.Another notable factor is the use of the kuroko blackclad stagehands a Japanese theatrical tradition. The kuroko intervene in nearly every scene but they never come across as a gimmick. Sometimes they fit in so naturally that you forget they're even there until they move. They assist the actors in handling objects they prepare the stage and the backgrounds but never literally interfere with the storyline after all they're just spectators such as ourselves the audience. One scene in particular I find to be amusing  after a character receives a letter a kuroko takes it and brings it closer to the camera so the viewer can read it while the two actors in the background freeze and stay still until the kuroko returns the letter to one of them. Now they can finally snap out and resume the dialogue.The final 10 minutes are pure genius. The muchawaited suicide scene it's not even a spoiler because the title and the intro make it obvious has gorgeous photography all around. Just the shot of the kuroko standing at the far end of the bridge while the lovers are positioned in the middle is one of the most astonishing and memorable film shots I've ever seen. It all culminates in the incredibly shot hanging scene the kuroko of course are there to prepare the noose accompanied by Toru Takemitsu's fantastic score he also cowrote the film before settling down to the shot of two corpses laying on the ground which closes the movie suddenly without any ending screen or anything or is my version of the film defective?Double Suicide is one of the best Japanese New Wave films I've seen and the proof that a creative filming style can singlehandedly salvage a plot that in itself is not that interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stemming from a Japanese puppet play from the 1700's Double Suicide stands tall and beautiful as a new wave love story similar to that of Romeo and Juliet on the surface. Masahiro Shinoda takes some risky strides in his directing by utilizing a series of dark puppet master characters to linger in the majority of all scenes alluding to the story in its earliest form. This concept manages to workout wonderfully by some miracle and really compliments the thematic elements of the film as we watch the cast manipulate one another or pull each other's strings. The performances are all stellar in this film as Shinoda makes sure to direct each to have a very vacant and detached approach to their roles allowing their characters to fall into the deceit of one another. Jihei Kichiemon Nakamura is perfect in his dark conviction of his immoral affair with a 19 year old prostitute Shima Iwashita while still attempting to maintain a healthy relationship with his tooloyal wife Osan also played by Shima Iwashita. Osan takes the feminist's nightmare role of a wife whom stands by her husband's side and is supportive of his every wrongdoing. The prostitute Koharu balances the relationship by playing the role of a friend to the wife and promising to end her affair while professing her neverending love for Jihei when Osan is out of the picture. Everyone shares a shifting balance of power control and love for one another really adding up to the thrilling climax of this film.Visually this film is just as outstanding as is its narrative. The cinematographer plans his shots smart by finding the ideal balance for including the puppet masters in appropriate shots. This is a film full to the brim of wide and establishing shots with puppet masters cleverly tucked in the distant background of each frame opposed to using unnecessary closeups. This is most similar to how puppet masters in the original puppet play productions would remain shielded in the darkness of the stage to remain being seen as little as possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never heard of Shinoda or Double Suicide prior to enrolling in a Japanese literature and film class in college. The memory of watching it though remains with me. As I did when I first saw Chinatown or Greed or 2001 I sat there like a codfish mouth open and catching flies. I had never seen anything like it and I have not seen anything like it since. The film is based on Chikamatsu's 18thcentury bunraku play a type of play that uses puppets and leaves the cloaked puppet masters in plain view of the audience and offers a wonderful translation of that text and that style of theatre. That's correct cloaked puppetmasters move about on screen along with the characters. This element and this element alone could have caused my love of this film to grow. It's a simple choice really but creates such depth to the story. In the traditional play the puppetmasters were there because they had to be. In the film they become fate guiding the actors through the world. It's a wonderful touch and an interesting concept. The photography of the film is incredible as well though the stark black and white melding beautifully to the basic raw emotions of the characters and the harsh view of love put forth by the film. The set design is mindblowing as well with its oversized woodblock prints of that era. The film has a visceral impact on its audience but it does so without overly manipulating one's emotions. If anything the audience is kept at a distance from the characters and is therefore unable to feel anything sentimental for them. However the film's bleakness is effective and affective giving one the feeling at the end of having been punched in the guts. Granted such a feeling is not for everyone but I appreciate films that can affect me in such ways.".

In the film they become fate guiding the actors through the world. It's a wonderful touch and an interesting concept. The photography of the film is incredible as well though the stark black and white melding beautifully to the basic raw emotions of the characters and the harsh view of love put forth by the film. The set design is mindblowing as well with its oversized woodblock prints of that era. The film has a visceral impact on its audience but it does so without overly manipulating one's emotions. If anything the audience is kept at a distance from the characters and is therefore unable to feel anything sentimental for them. However the film's bleakness is effective and affective giving one the feeling at the end of having been punched in the guts. Granted such a feeling is not for everyone but I appreciate films that can affect me in such ways.";

I really don't think a movie where the audience knows the couple who are the main characters will have to die by the end would create a lot of ticket sales in the Westespecially when this is known by the audience before the film even begins. There is a beauty in suicide that is strictly Japanesemaking these sort of films difficult to fully appreciate and understand.Double Suicide begins with the fourth wallactors readying for the movie producers and directors discussing the locations etc.. This is a highly unusual move and was done because this film apparently was originally a playwith a rather familiar theme for Japan. So instead of trying to hide this the beginning pays homage to it and the film shows its stage roots various times throughout the story.The story involves a poor man Jihei falling for a prostitute Koharu. His goal is to buy her contract and free her but he just just can't manage it because his business is not doing very well. So for most of the film Koharu broodsmaking her a very unsuccessful prostitute since no one wants to sleep with a woman who constantly talks about killing herself. As for Jihei he broods as well and interrupts any potential clients from having sex with Koharuas he's jealous. However this cannot go one forever and you know that by the end of the picture both of the lovers will have given up on the idea of marriage and they will be dead.So is this any good? Well since it won so many Japanese awards the answer is an emphatic YES...provided you are Japanese. However for other audiences it is far less satisfyingthough you must admit that the film is wellconstructed and very stylish. I see that Criterion has produced this DVD so there must be some audience outside of Japan for it after all I am watching it and the few other reviews for the movie are all quite positive...but it will definitely be a niche audience and I can't see this appealing to the average viewer. Not bad....just not particularly enjoyable due to there being little suspense about the ending after all it's Double Suicide and the film seems to drag in between. After having watched several hundred other Japanese movies I just can't see this one as being among the best the country has to offer.".

The film never takes itself seriously yet somehow keeps it from ever going into slapstick territory.Supporting actors do well also Presly is always a stunner Wayne Newton gives his best ever performance as Fairlane's nemesis and Ed O'Neill is a riot as a former disco singer turned detective. Robert Englund gives a rather amusing performance as a very inept crook who's ultimate fate is nothing short of hilarious.Finnish director Harlin directs with a sure hand everything in the technical department in tip top shape and it's very visually stylish at times. The Adventures of Ford Fairlane is definitely not for everyone but it's not only for die hard Clay fans since I sure as hell ain't one of them.

If you go to a movie which is a vehicle for Andrew Dice Clay who in my estimation is one of the greatest comic minds in history and he has the records to prove it being the only comedian to sell out Madison Square Gardens 2 nights consecutively how can his brand of humor be used as legitimate criticism in a movie which promotes his brand of comedy to the hilt? It's moronic if you don't like his shtick you won't like the movie..end of story. Why did you go see it? and why do you write sprawling reviews ...when you could sum it up in a sentence. I hate Dice's humor so naturally I hated this movie. That much said this movie was The goods and would have been one of the top 20 box office earners of 1990 had 20th century fox not caved to political pressure and yanked it after only 3 weeks. 12 million opening week? flop me thinks not. The cinemephotography is some of the best work since michael chapman's work in the Lost Boys. The cast are all wonderful in their cartoon roles With Dice in the lead and Wayne Newton as the villain steeling the show. The movie is hilarious. But to prove that I am not completely biased as a dice fan there where some minor elelments that bugged me. The editing towards the middle of the movie seemed to get sloppy especially during the scenens in which biker hit men descend upon the sorority house. And there is a scene in which ford fairlane is being inducted as an honorary member this is silly and does not jel with his macho stick. Also Morris Dey in a supporting role gave a dreadful performance which is sad because he can act as anyone who has seen Purple Rain knows. Aside from these minor annoyances the adventures of ford fairlane delivers all it promised and should have become a franchise film had 20th century fox maintained more artistic integrity in the face of controversy not to mention business savvy as it was still making money when they pulled it despite al the undserved negative publicity. One of the best comedies of the 90s.".

	schema:headline " Not as enjoyable as it used to be";
	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this movie for the first time I was just getting into Dice's comedy so I guess my point of view was more biased.  Plus I was much younger and found it entertaining enough to watch a movie with a good deal of profanity and sex jokes.  Naturally I was also less critical of movies back then.  I still like Dice's humor and don't participate in the bandwagon of people who think he's the Antichrist.  Reason why?  I don't believe he really is the sexist pig he portrays himself as on stage and his whole intention is to poke fun at the stereotypical ItalianAmerican from Brooklyn who thinks he's hot stuff and believes he can treat any woman like a piece of meat.  It's a cliche when someone says a celebrity is nice and sweet in real life as opposed to the character he plays on the big or small screen but with Dice I believe it's true.  I mean he's a married man with two children and isn't even Italianhe's Jewish!  I could understand why people would be offended by his material but I feel I have more of an understanding of who he really is and as a result don't take his profane and misogynistic comments seriously.  With all that said I was disappointed watching this movie for the first time in about 5 years.  First of all I'm a firm believer that when a comedian stars in a movie his job is to be a good actor first and then be funny.  In Dice's case he's a good comedian but he definitely possesses very little acting talent.  His trademark gestures and expressions that are amusing to watch on stage became annoying to watch on screen.  I wasn't able to buy him as the character he was portraying.  All I saw was Dice for 95 minutes!  Not Ford Fairlane.  So when I criticize comediansturnedactors like Mike Epps I'm not just being prejudice against them because I don't find them funny but because they're simply not good actorsand when they're not funny it makes matters worse.  I was still able to get a few chuckles here and there and during the first 20minutesorso I found myself imitating Dice's expressions.  But after a while the welcome was worn out.  There are other actors in the cast who possess more talent like Ed O'Neill and Robert Englund.  Even Wayne Newton showed that he can be a fairly natural actor.  Unfortunately their roles are small and moderately thankless even though I liked Gilbert Gottfried's cameo and to be totally honest this isn't much more than a star vehicle for Dice.  Judging by the poor box office I guess it was proven that he's better on stage than screen.  I enjoyed him in certain supporting roles like the one he played in One Night in McCool's but he certainly isn't star material.It also kind of bothered me that all the women in the film were portrayed as either ditzes villains or sex objects.  Plus the film gets plotheavy at times which doesn't help since the plot isn't all that interesting. However if you decide to buy or rent the DVD it contains a good commentary by director Renny Harlin.  My score  5 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "When I saw this movie for the first time I was just getting into Dice's comedy so I guess my point of view was more biased.  Plus I was much younger and found it entertaining enough to watch a movie with a good deal of profanity and sex jokes.  Naturally I was also less critical of movies back then.  I still like Dice's humor and don't participate in the bandwagon of people who think he's the Antichrist.  Reason why?  I don't believe he really is the sexist pig he portrays himself as on stage and his whole intention is to poke fun at the stereotypical ItalianAmerican from Brooklyn who thinks he's hot stuff and believes he can treat any woman like a piece of meat.  It's a cliche when someone says a celebrity is nice and sweet in real life as opposed to the character he plays on the big or small screen but with Dice I believe it's true.  I mean he's a married man with two children and isn't even Italianhe's Jewish!  I could understand why people would be offended by his material but I feel I have more of an understanding of who he really is and as a result don't take his profane and misogynistic comments seriously.  With all that said I was disappointed watching this movie for the first time in about 5 years.  First of all I'm a firm believer that when a comedian stars in a movie his job is to be a good actor first and then be funny.  In Dice's case he's a good comedian but he definitely possesses very little acting talent.  His trademark gestures and expressions that are amusing to watch on stage became annoying to watch on screen.  I wasn't able to buy him as the character he was portraying.  All I saw was Dice for 95 minutes!  Not Ford Fairlane.

	schema:reviewBody "I like Renny Harlin. I have yet to see a movie from him that I hate and that includes the illreceived Cutthroat Island before pirates were trendy again. So I watched this movie with mixed feelings. You see I hate Andrew Dice Clay. The man sums up everything I dislike about dumb American comedy. I have nothing against American comedy some of the better acts Bill Hicks Steven Wright Steve Martin Mitch Hedberg Rchard Pryor etc etc deserve to be right up there with the best of the bunch. But sadly many of the more popular acts seem to rely on a mixture of unsubtle punchlines recognised by the audience because they are LOUD or stale material mixed with flagwaving patriotism. Clay falls into the former group.He's unfunny he's brash and he's a complete dick. BUT that's fitting for the character he plays. Sadly it doesn't make him any more enjoyable. It just means that I have to try to enjoy a Renny Harlin action comedy with one of the worst lead characters I've ever seen.The sad thing is that the rest of the cast is a veritable goldmine. Gilbert Gottfried Wayne Newton Lauren Holly Priscilla Presley Vince Neill and Ed O'Neill all appear and all do well in their supporting roles. The movie is also helped by a script that is chock full of gems. Some of these lines are even delivered by Clay which weakens their comedy kudos but most of them just appear and make you chuckle instantly.The plot hanging over everything is flimsy nothing is too subtle and Clay is the biggest downside of the matter but Harlin walks the line between reality and cartoon incredulity far better than for example Sam Raimi in Crimewave. It's big dumb fun and those who like Clay will derive a lot more pleasure from it than I did.".

	onyx:emotionText "I like Renny Harlin. I have yet to see a movie from him that I hate and that includes the illreceived Cutthroat Island before pirates were trendy again. So I watched this movie with mixed feelings. You see I hate Andrew Dice Clay. The man sums up everything I dislike about dumb American comedy. I have nothing against American comedy some of the better acts Bill Hicks Steven Wright Steve Martin Mitch Hedberg Rchard Pryor etc etc deserve to be right up there with the best of the bunch. But sadly many of the more popular acts seem to rely on a mixture of unsubtle punchlines recognised by the audience because they are LOUD or stale material mixed with flagwaving patriotism. Clay falls into the former group.He's unfunny he's brash and he's a complete dick. BUT that's fitting for the character he plays. Sadly it doesn't make him any more enjoyable. It just means that I have to try to enjoy a Renny Harlin action comedy with one of the worst lead characters I've ever seen.The sad thing is that the rest of the cast is a veritable goldmine. Gilbert Gottfried Wayne Newton Lauren Holly Priscilla Presley Vince Neill and Ed O'Neill all appear and all do well in their supporting roles.

Well there could have been more balanced reviews but my attention span is just too short.I rated this film 410.  Some elements work but most fall flat.  I will start with the positives.This film has a great supporting cast with too many moments to mention.  The jokes of breaking the fourth wall hit every time.  The theme song Rock the Cradle of Love is fantastic great bridge.  The koala bear and the sorority house cannot be beat.  And the My Hair moment at Capitol Records busts me up!However all is not well for this film and most of it falls squarely at Dice's feet.  His character is just not that sympathetic.  Even after living through events resembling a depressing country song his character is barely sympathetic enough to keep the story together.  His rock and roll sequence at the recording studio is laughable.  The Diceman just can't sing.I loved the film when it was new but when I saw it again recently I was shocked at how bad it was.  However the film picks up when he finds the koala.  Following that up with the sorority house gave a onetwo punch that put the film back on track.  It's a shame those setpieces didn't come earlier in the film.On a side note I was a kid when this film came out.  I remember the Rock the Cradle of Love video.  When I saw it recently I was shocked at how young that girl looks!  She didn't look that young before.  All a part of getting older I suppose.Back to the film.  It has some smutty elements in it so if you're a Holy Roller avoid this film.  Otherwise I recommend giving the film a chance. Just remember that class is not readily apparent.".

He's the brutal head kidnapper jumping at the opportunity of the chance kidnapping of business head Mastroianni who really only wants to rush off with his mistress for a weekend of hankypanky hence the title.The version on TCM TV was dubbed  and not too badly at that. I'm sure Reed's voice is as was though but with an 'accent'  how accurate it is and how insulting it would be to Europeans I do not know. I'm presuming that they had to dub him into Italian for its home release. The film skips along briskly featuring many of the things we associate with Italy largely through aforementioned films by Fellini and the like. Namely scavenging paparazzi in pursuit of story and scandal jostling with the Police on the chase. The price of capitalism and trappings of wealth all questioned through the dialogue. The whole feel seems to be par of the course of its era for many adult crime thrillers both from Hollywood and the UK. It's the first time I'd ever encountered the film let alone on TV.

	schema:reviewBody "The anthology that include three short films that take place in New York City was made by three great American directors Martin Scorsese Woody Allen and Francis Ford Coppola.Life Lessons directed by Martin Scorsese literally took my breath away  it made me want to rewatch all Scorsese's films with the one exception GONY though. What a magnificent work  visually it is as powerful as the painting Nolte's Lionel was painting. Combining in one short film Procul Harum's A whiter shade of pale and Puccini's Nessun Dorma from Turandot was a stroke of genius. This film is an ode to the power of talent it is about greatness and curse of the gift not about love to the woman. The best scene of the film and I'd say one of the best ever made about the Artist's work is Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece  his love desire lust cries whispers tears and humiliations magically transform with every stroke of his brush into the immortal triumphant brilliant work of art. By the time the painting is finished he would need a new source of inspiration and selftorture and the cycle will repeat over again. Devilishly clever portrait of an Artist as Not a Young Man. 9.510 I loved Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks and I think it is very funny and touching. Looks like Allen has met mothers or grandmothers like Mrs. Millstein in real life and his little gem is his lovehate letter to them. In the end mom always knows what is best for her little boy. Mae Questel and Julie Kavner Marge Simpson were wonderful. Woody's face after his mom disappears and the scene when he practically makes love to the chicken drumstick are pure delight also the commentary that New York is used to everything and readily accepts the crazy situation  it is so true. One of the best Allen's films I've seen lately  I am very glad that I finally saw it.Larry David Seinfeld Curb Your Enthusiasm plays the Theater Manager. It made me think if Estelle Costanza created by David and Mrs. Millstein Woody's omnipresent mother have a lot in common in making the lives of their sons miserable and smothering them with their merciless love? 910 Coppola's Life Without Zo was much weaker than Scorsese's and Allan's stories and paled in comparison  this episode from the lives of the reach and beautiful was pretty and cute but you can skip it. 510".

This film is an ode to the power of talent it is about greatness and curse of the gift not about love to the woman. The best scene of the film and I'd say one of the best ever made about the Artist's work is Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece  his love desire lust cries whispers tears and humiliations magically transform with every stroke of his brush into the immortal triumphant brilliant work of art. By the time the painting is finished he would need a new source of inspiration and selftorture and the cycle will repeat over again. Devilishly clever portrait of an Artist as Not a Young Man. 9.510 I loved Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks and I think it is very funny and touching. Looks like Allen has met mothers or grandmothers like Mrs. Millstein in real life and his little gem is his lovehate letter to them. In the end mom always knows what is best for her little boy. Mae Questel and Julie Kavner Marge Simpson were wonderful. Woody's face after his mom disappears and the scene when he practically makes love to the chicken drumstick are pure delight also the commentary that New York is used to everything and readily accepts the crazy situation  it is so true. One of the best Allen's films I've seen lately  I am very glad that I finally saw it.Larry David Seinfeld Curb Your Enthusiasm plays the Theater Manager. It made me think if Estelle Costanza created by David and Mrs. Millstein Woody's omnipresent mother have a lot in common in making the lives of their sons miserable and smothering them with their merciless love? 910 Coppola's Life Without Zo was much weaker than Scorsese's and Allan's stories and paled in comparison  this episode from the lives of the reach and beautiful was pretty and cute but you can skip it. 510";

	schema:reviewBody "Three 40 minutes short films by three of the greatest American directors Scorsese Coppola and Allen. I personally like Scorsese's introducing segment the most Life Lesson. Even if I personally is not a fan of Nick Nolte the movie has depth and it's just as good as you would expect from a director like Scorsese. Unlike many other directors Scorsese manages to capture sexual attraction in this case felt by the main character Nolte. Freshly photographed and good ending that makes you recall upon your own life. Not a masterpiece but indeed great.Coppola's segment Zoe is a total disaster. It is beautifully filmed but the acting and the story is far below good. Better fit for the children's hour on TV. I don't know if the story was supposed to be ironical a satire of spoiled extremely rich kids on Manhattan which could be the fact since there were some scenes where the young girl interacts with a homeless man. That could have been a good theme if it was Coppola's intention but no matter the case  it just don't work. It is silly and it doesn't feel satirical at all. Another idea is that it was supposed to be funny a short comedy however neither does it work on that layer. It somewhat makes me lose my respect for the director.Woody Allen's part however is a pleasant refresher after Coppola's borer. Very funny typical Allen good acting from Allen's side and good music.Overall rating is a mere 6 dragged down by Coppola. Without his segment I would rate this movie an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll step out of the loop here about New York Stories three tales of New York from 1989 directed by three formidable directors Martin Scorcese Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen. I happen to think all three films had something to offer and the fact that the Zoe sequence is about a child does not for me make it the weakest segment.I found the Scorcese segment starring Nick Nolte and Roseanna Arquette the most thoughtprovoking the Zoe segment the most charming and the Allen segment the wackiest. The first episode is about a tortured artist Nolte who expresses his sexual frustrations and problems with his young protge Arquette in his work. She no longer sleeps with him and wants to quit New York and go home he wants to kiss her foot and professes undying love for her. To Puccini's Nessun Dorma he stares at his artwork and goes through a variety of emotions as he paints another masterpiece. This particular muse in the form of Arquette used up one sees him at his art show connecting with another wouldbe artistmuse whose identity will also be lost in his genius.The second sequence directed by Coppola is a takeoff on the Eloise stories by Kay Thompson. This little girl's name is Zoe. Her father Claudio Montez Giancarlo Giannini is a famous flautist who travels and her mother Talia Shire is a photo journalist who travels. Zoe lives with a butler and her dog Vegas at the Sherry Netherlands Hotel. She proves herself smarter than either parent in this charming film. My only question is why Giancarlo Giannini speaks Italian to his daughter when the name Claudio Montez is emphatically not Italian. Okay it wasn't typical Coppola but who said it had to be? The last one is pure Woody Oedipus Wrecks about a man with a nagging critical mother who wants to marry a young woman Mia Farrow with children. He loves his mother but he wishes she'd disappear. During a magic show he gets his wish when his mother goes into a magician's box and never comes out. Later she shows up in the sky telling him what to do with the world as a witness. His girlfriend can't take it. He then goes to a psychic Julie Kavner who makes him a boiled chicken dinner. A complete delight.Three different interesting stories by three great directors.".

Martin Scorsese's Life Lessons is a good example of what caliber of work Scorsese had when he made those three student films in the 1960's.  It is a film that has a lot of depth but it is quite worth it for fans of the actors and those who could get interested in Richard Price's story.Coppola director of THE GODFATHER and APOCALYPSE NOW makes Life Without Zoe here a film that is 180 degrees out of whack from those two movies in that it tells the story of a little rich girl whose best friend is a doorman and revolves around a rich boy's birthday party.  In a way it almost could appeal to kids but it's the wrong place to put in between a story of artists by Scorsese and a comedy of mother and son troubles by Allen.Which brings me to the last short film Oedipus Wrecks where Woody plays a character whose mother suddenly out of the blue disappears.  This is a good showing of what Woody can do in comedy without having to have a picture length presentation not that he makes many bad films by the way. So New York Stories is worth checking out for Life Lessons and Oedipus Wrecks and there could be an audience somewhere for Life Without Zoe although the biggest flaw of the movie comes that neither one can connect at all outside of the fact that they all take place in New York and are made by New York directors in short fascinating and imperfect in some ways.

Other anthology films that I've seen like Four Rooms have not been very good despite the amazing credentials. I haven't been a fan of most movies with more than one director hence more than one vision thus many colliding like an orchestra playing unharmonious notes. New York Stories is satisfactory however eve if its mood swings leave one feeling many different ways about it. You'll feel stimulated yet strangely unfulfilled.Martin Scorsese's segment Life Lessons is very melodramatic in that hardened grungy way of his. Nolte gives a wonderful performance very intense and Arquette is very realistic and effective. Scorsese employs his usual machine gun multigenre soundtrack and plunging stylistically passionate and energetic cinematography. His segment says something very profound and important about the human characteristic of selfishness and how much more abundant it is in ourselves than we care to accept.Then comes Francis Ford Coppola's segment Life Without Zoe. Arg. The acting despite the leniency one may generously give child actors is awful. Heather McComb did in fact fill out very very nicely when she grew up but that does not excuse her very scripted performance here. She's the least of the cast's problems though. Everyone sounds like the salesmen on the used car commercials. The story is something quite silly. Perhaps it would be fine if it were its own film but Coppola had to know that he was being teamed with Scorsese his fellow creator of quintessential Mafia cinema and Woody Allen the prolific source of mature and sophisticated comedies about sex and relationships. Did he submit this segment for shock value? I guess so. Well it worked. I don't understand why Coppola works with kids. His daughter Sophia who at age 18 here cowrote the script and designed the costumes did in fact go on to become a fine director herself but did he not notice his pattern after awhile? He makes The Conversation the Godfather films and Apocalypse Now and we think he's found his niche. Then he starts making movies like this following up with films like Jack with Robin Williams.Woody Allen's segment saves the film. I suppose this is one way anthology movies are interesting. In a single featurelength narrative film when it takes a plunge in the middle it can't really be saved in the end especially if it was as bad as Coppola's segment. In an anthology if the middle of the movie is terrible you still have the end to look forward to. This is the case in New York Stories because Woody Allen's segment Oedipus Wrecks the final third of the movie is hilarious. It's one of the funniest satires he's ever done of the Jewish Brooklynite's culture. It's goofy in a subtle way and fascinatingly surreal the way a lot of Allen's best and most creative work is. Actually Oedipus Wrecks is perhaps the only one of the three parts that actually clearly represents a hue of New York's culture. Scorsese's part didn't represent New York as much as it represented the emotional tempests of an artist and happened to take place in the meatpacking district. Coppola's midsection represented the lives of wealthy children whose lives are so free that they live practically like very spoiled and gossipy adults but to such an outlandish degree of familyoriented fantasy that it's not at all credible. Woody Allen firmly focuses upon his division of New York culture. And by the by it's a very pleasant surprise to see a younger Larry David preSeinfeld and preCurb Your Enthusiasm in a bit role in Oedipus Wrecks.Whatever was going through Coppola's mind it's because of him that New York Stories can be described as a film in the shape of a circular saw. It's on one level then takes a ninety degree plunge to a different level then again with the third segment it takes a ninetydegree ascension to the precise level it was at before.".

It's on one level then takes a ninety degree plunge to a different level then again with the third segment it takes a ninetydegree ascension to the precise level it was at before.";

Every facial expression sported by Woody is a gut buster as well special mention goes to Jessie Keosian as hisdeaf Aunt Ceil for the same reason.  Witty biting and with one ofTHE oddest plot twists I've ever seen Oedipus Wrecks is theicing on the cake and a great ending to this film conjunction.  910has to be seen for the chicken drumstick lovescene if nothingelse!Unfortunately the film overall is not an even delivery despite thenoble attempt.  Scorsese and Allen shine with their spoton storiesof intrinsic inhabitants of the Big Apple Coppola just provides theworm.  I can only recommend portions of the film and as such canonly give it a 710 in good conscience.  Enjoy what you can!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd seen NEW YORK STORIES NYS before on cable and I'd enjoyed the trilogy of short films by Martin Scorsese Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen. However I hadn't been aware that a teenage Adrien Brody was supposed to be in it until I happened to look up his credits on the IMDb. Since he was listed in order of appearance as part of the cast of Coppola's segment LIFE WITHOUT ZO I kept a sharp eye out for young Brody in the school cafeteria scene  at least it looked like it was supposed to be the cafeteria! The artistically dim lighting made things a little hard to see which may be why I and other Brody fans I know could hardly find Brody at all. Judging by the order in which he's listed in the credits as a character named Mel Brody should've shown up in Zo's school right after the knowitall character Andrea Alexandra Becker shows up just before the SherryNetherland robbery scene with Chris Elliott. Brody must have had dialogue at some point or he wouldn't have been in the credits at all. However I guess Coppola  Company pulled a THIN RED LINE on the adolescent Adrien because I didn't see or hear him utter a single syllable. My only inkling that Boy Brody was in the scene at all was that when I looked very closely and pressed my DVD remote's Slow button I thought I detected a familiar noblenosed profile amongst the students stylishly silhouetted in the background. Oh well at least Brody got an early screen credit and presumably a paycheck out of the experience as did another future Oscarwinner Sofia Coppola who cowrote the script and designed the cute opening credit sequence. Nevertheless I found LIFE WITHOUT ZO entertaining even when the game of Spot the Adrien came a cropper despite its reputation as the weakest of NYS's trio of vignettes. While it has its overly precious moments it's basically an uncredited 'tween update of Kay Thompson's ELOISE AT THE PLAZA book series one of my faves think of this as ZO AT THE SHERRYNETHERLAND. With gorgeous New York locations catchy songs by Kid Creole  the Coconuts and a likable cast including young Heather McComb Don Novello Giancarlo Giannini and Talia Shire you could find worse ways to pass the time. As for the other entries Scorsese's LIFE LESSONS with a screenplay by Richard Price is wellcrafted and wellacted though the temperamental manipulative artist and assistantmuselover played respectively by Nick Nolte and Rosanna Arquette were so immature and strident they got on my nerves after a while. Hands down my favorite of the 3 vignettes and the fave of most folks who've seen NYS was Allen's uproarious OEDIPUS WRECKS the story of a Jewish mother Mae Questel the cutie who voiced Betty Boop and Olive Oyl is a devious delight whose wellmeant domination of her henpecked son Allen gets out of hand when the audience participation portion of a magic show goes horribly yet hilariously awry. Mia Farrow and Julie Kavner provide able support CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM fans should keep an eye out for Larry David in a brief bit as the magic show theater manager. Kavner's homecooked chicken drumstick gets my vote for Best Performance by an Inanimate Object! ".

	schema:headline " Mixed bag";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is actually three short films only connected by the fact that they take place in New York City. So I will comment on them individually.The first short 'Life Lessons' is directed by Martin Scorsese and is about Lionel Dobie an artist Nick Nolte whos girlfriend Paulette Rosanna Arquette dumps him as a lover yet stays in his atelier to live. Nolte from the first scene portrays a neurotic 'typical' New York abstract painter complete with discrete little temper tantrums about deadlines. He seems balanced and normal. But his painting is going nowhere. So he drives to the airport to pick up his girlfriend and she discloses to him that she is leaving him and going home to her brother. She fell for a standup comedian played by Steve Buschemi  his comedy scene is great because it's bad humour in a stunning setting but he dumped her the day after. But this fling flung her out of her comfortable relationship with Lionel where we get the image that she was never happy anyway and now she's going home. Lionel stays cooler as you would expect and convinces her to stay with him no strings attached for her sake. We believe him at this stage.Back at the atelier however the reality of this new relationship starts to shine through. Paulette doesn't like Lionel very much and has a real identity problem you get the impression that she paints just because Lionel does but Lionel appears more and more obsessed  not so much with Paulette herself but with the company. He percieves Paulette as his property and becomes ragingly jealous when she brings guys home. Paulette stuck in his atelier teases him by dressing provocatively and asking him questions like 'Do you love me?  Then prove it by...'. Because of Paulette not being within his grasp Lionel goes down the tubes. It's not love in my opinion. It's pride.But as Lionel's real world fades and collapses his painting grows and changes and comes to life. The moment his own life with Paulette ends the life of his painting begins.It's sort of a heavy story in the way that you really have to concentrate and suss out the character's motives. It's not light 'E.R.'type drama but it's a lot more fulfilling.And so we are led into 'Life without Zoe' directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It's about a 12yearold girl and her little life. If Martin Scorsese had stayed in the director's chair for this segment too we could have had a rerun of 'Taxi Driver' where the 12year old was a prostitute and the story was rough but excellent. Instead the 12yearold is a rich Vada Sultenfuss and the story is saccharine and empty. This middle film is destined to be the one people forget. For one thing there is no narrative drive in the story as far as I can see  there is a robbery which is pretty pointless there is a rich little boy who has a costume party and there's the parents. While there are a few charming qualities  that the parents act childishly and their child mothers them that the costume party is ludicrously lavish to the extent of having violinists and flambeed whatever at the baby's table  this segment is a children's movie. Nothing more nothing less. Kids would get a kick out of seeing the wealth and possibilites of the kids and the fun of the party but that's about it. Bad acting is acceptable in children  and abundant here  but it's also present in the adult performances. Some loser says after the robbery 'Wow if I could only hold on to that sense memory I'd be head of my acting class'. You've got a long way to go buddy...And so it's time for 'Oedipus Wrecks' by Woody Allen. This is the funny one. In fact it's so wonderfully absurd that I won't spoil it by telling you much about it. Only that Woody Allen surprisingly plays a neurotic New Yorker and this time he is embarrased because his mother is always on his back and bothering him. The development of this story is just so strange and funny that I'll let you find out about it for yourself. It's not Woody at his best but it's still funny.Altogether the segments I would rate 747 giving an average of 6.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is actually three short films only connected by the fact that they take place in New York City. So I will comment on them individually.The first short 'Life Lessons' is directed by Martin Scorsese and is about Lionel Dobie an artist Nick Nolte whos girlfriend Paulette Rosanna Arquette dumps him as a lover yet stays in his atelier to live. Nolte from the first scene portrays a neurotic 'typical' New York abstract painter complete with discrete little temper tantrums about deadlines. He seems balanced and normal. But his painting is going nowhere. So he drives to the airport to pick up his girlfriend and she discloses to him that she is leaving him and going home to her brother. She fell for a standup comedian played by Steve Buschemi  his comedy scene is great because it's bad humour in a stunning setting but he dumped her the day after. But this fling flung her out of her comfortable relationship with Lionel where we get the image that she was never happy anyway and now she's going home.

The writing is uneven but tremendous performances by Nolte and Arquette make it work. 4 stars.Coppola's 'Life Without Zoe' is ridiculously bad on each and every level from the acting and writing to the ludicrous theme song. Unlike many I don't think the blame lies entirely with Sofia Coppola Francis's directorial work is subpar here. 1 star.'Oedipus Wrecks' is by itself enough to make this essential viewing for Woody Allen fans at least as it's classic Allen and possibly one of his finest works. Mae Questel of Betty Boop and Popeye fame is brilliant as Allen's mother. 5 stars.So the only fair way to rate New York Stories is with a completely objective average which comes in at 3.33 stars.

	schema:reviewBody "There has been arguably the strongest outpouring of negative commentary in IMDb ever seen about the supposedly little afterthought of the New York Storiues triad  Life without Zoe. Could I at least ask a reconsideration? This dear tender piece created as a light bonbon shows through the magicalreal prism of the young eyes that Ihope that you all experienced looking at the world as a child. One object or friend takes one's fancy for some reason for a little while then another. Pace and cinematic tempo must reflect that which may look a mishmash to adult viewer's eyes.The film basically just follows a bright attentive young girl's life over a number of daysevents being magnified or diminished just as they are as a girl records her diary highlights or tells you the essential summary of what happened at school at the end of a day when you pick them up to take home. Seeing a drunk in the street may loom large or the latest hip item of local kids clothing to be seen in.Many of these daily events don't necessarily have a further deep meaning a filmistic solution or terminationthe halfsculpted and wonky images of a day's life just end hangingor disappearing into thin air.Matt Groening recently commented admiitedly speaking about the different genre of adult comedyin a UK interview that he felt that US audiences needed to be hit with a sledgehammer to produce an adequate comic effect and he would sometimes love to produce comedy with the subtlety acceptable to overseas audiences. I don't want to inflame any transatlantic passions but is it possible that US audiences are just not able to handle stories such as the running of a child's mind that doesn't necessarily have a beginning a middle or an end? What if you just sat in the film and took in the experienceno punchline only feeling and seeing...But young girls have bigger dreams and special lovesand there is for many nothing more special than the daughter's adoration showoffinessand special love fortheir FATHER. It may extend to magnification of Dad to almost superhuman proportionsin this case Dad is a classical flautist and the dreaminess about her suave charming European traveled father creates a delightful loving giant edifice of her father in her eyes who creates special flute wandering leitmotifs to lull her to sleep and informs her life with love. In reality there is no fluff in here at all. I became blessedly a father to identical girl twins well after seeing this movieand the relationship I have with my girls was perhaps more accurately portrayed here than in any other resonance or description I've encountered. The special tenderness of love for a father's daughter and when young this special inexplicable bond mutually returned is beyond 25 words or lessbut Coppola has sensed this no doubt especially helping to create this reciprocal magic by employing Sofia in the filmic role of the daughterat this age and stage of Zoe's tender life although her early cinematic ability is undoubted and has since been proved I would judge being employed firstly as being the real daughter and distant secondly as an actress.And in my view he and she have both sensed this and made a good filmic depiction of it. There is great depth of love mingled with total child's whimsyquite a tough mix to encompass in a film short.Although I hinted this paediatric Ulysses a day in the life of...little girl X as a child thinks doesn't have beginnings middles or ends the adoration of young Zoe mingled with all her other dreams is crafted into an aesthetically stunning ?how real? climax of her father's achievement as a musician when he is lead flautist at an orchestral performance in the open air at the foot of the Acropolis commencing at duskjust one of these stunning life lasting images that Coppola has this ability to produce. Perfectly timed with kids in the select audience father stands up and playsand the repertoire drifts as thrilled Sofia's mind hears him playingat least to her earsthe special children's music he plays to her when they are together putting her to sleepmy memory may be wrong but I think it is is a rearrangement into multiple rather simple chord inversions and hence variations of 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'but to Sofia it is a classical triumph a peak moment in a girl's pride in her father and an orchestral triumph of course of the highest order. Dramatic irony taken right back to the home of it!Give it a go and look at it againif you liked the dreamtime aspect of your own childhood and especially all Dads of 712 yo girls ESPECIALLY twinsand I expect Grandads too whose love for their grandchildren granted the gift of spare time and maybe reflection often to me seem to even be more tender about the young than parents. It's not really a storysorry no big plot no hardhitting tagline. It's drifting along that magical stream of consciousness of a child with parents that loom very large and blurred with an aesthetically beautiful finale at the Acrolopis with orchestra lit at dusk Mark Allan Nedlands PerthWestern Australia".

Further he puts on rock music to fuel his inspiration and cranks it up LOUD. Yet his offbeat interpretation grew on me. By the time the story was over I was impressed. He did a more than credible job with the role helped along by whomever was actually doing the painting. Just as interesting was his oftpathetic interaction with Rosanna Arquette who plays his delectable but cruel assistant. She is jealous of his artistic success fed up with his ambivalence toward her own work and tired of his disturbing habits. I've seen her in a handful of roles and she never looked more attractive or did a better job her Joni Mitchell sort of appeal at its most layered and alluring. Nolte as the painter was so hung up on her that he would do anything to keep her around. For example he takes her to a party and watches helplessly as she leaves with a young upstart returns with the guy to Nolte's own loft and then spends the night with him right under her mentor's nose. Ooooo! That hadda hurt.I agree with the other reviews that wondered what the heck the Coppola flick was doing in the middle of this otherwise interesting montage. It would've been far more appropriate as the after school movie on TV.The Woody Allen flick Oedipus Wrecks was quite amusing. Nothing much to say about it other than it was a fairly typical Woody Allen movie. I always wondered how in real life Mia Farrow could go from Frank Sinatra to Woody Allen such different sorts of men but that's another question entirely. Both Farrow and Allen deliver good performances here. I especially liked his zany antics with the psychic.".

They called themselves the Funk Brothers. Fortyone years after they played their first note on a Motown record and three decades since they were all together the Funk Brothers reunited back in Detroit to play their music and tell their unforgettable story with the help of archival footage still photos narration interviews recreation scenes 20 Motown master tracks and twelve new live performances of Motown classics with the Brothers backing up contemporary performers.";

I have watched the DVD of this film and more recently the highdefinition version on ShowtimeHD. The 5.1 soundtrack is impeccably mixed. You can hear every instrument clearly but the vocalist is not drowned out. With this type of mix you want to listen to your favorite numbers over and over concentrating on a different part each time. And you can rest assured that there is no lip syncing or studio overdubbing. This is real music for real people.All of the vocalists are superb creatively interpreting each song while at the same time paying respect to the style of the original recording artists. Viewers will have their own favorite performers but mine is Joan Osborne whose powerful rendition of What Becomes of the Brokenhearted brought tears to my eyes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Standing in the Shadows of Motown is a terrific documentary that gives us a wonderful introduction to The Funk Brothers the musicians behind the hits at Motown. This is their story therefore little time is devoted to Barry Gordy or the label's stars. The Brothers emerge as engaging personalities in their own right  it's a pleasure to listen to them tell their tales of life in the Snake Pit the studio at Motown.Even more a pleasure is listening to them play and hearing new interpretations of some of the great old tunes. Especially for me Bootsy Collins on Cool Jerk Bootsy puts the fun in funk and Joan Osborne on Heat Wave the Brothers really groove on this one and What becomes of the Broken Hearted  a stirring rendition that raises the roof and brings down the house! Great stuff. A few of the other new performances are not quite as strong as this but overall the music is just great. The old guys have still got it. I really loved hearing little bits of their jazz playing sprinkled throughout the movie  in fact I'd like to have heard more of this but of course there are time constraints in any film. It was also great to hear some of the arrangements broken down to or built up from individual parts. It brings home the fact that these guys are really creative players try to imagine My Girl without the dum da da da da da guitar lick for example.I already knew a bit about James Jamerson the genius bass player for Motown before watching this movie but meeitng the rest of these great players and hearing their stories was just a pure pleasure straight through. Good to see these guys getting their props  they are The Funk Brothers!".

I happen to be a fan of the Temptations movie and saw this DVD next to it. Had I not bought it on a whim I would be so much more empty. 2 James JamersonI would love a documentary on him alone. Not because of his quirks but because of his tortured spirits a great moviemaking project! Also upon my research of this topic after seeing this film I came across an extensive web site bassplayer.com with a great tribute page to Jamerson. Among the most outrageous discussions that have not been resolved to my knowledge who played bass on Stevie Wonder's I Was Made to Love Her? The majority of folks strongly contend it was James Jamerson however a woman named Carol Kaye states she was the actual bass player for the song.I don't know the truth but I do know that after never hearing the bass in the song for the 30 plus that this has been one of my alltime favorite songs I ONLY hear the bass line. That bass line is so masterful so exceptional and so unrelentingly funky that I believe only a virtuoso could have done it. The fact that that song and bass line were done in 196667 amidst so many hundreds of other Motown hits and other songs tells me that the Funk Brothers and James Jamerson were truly blessed talents.3 Chaka Khan's rendition of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On is undoubtedly the very best performance I have ever seen her do and is among the top performances ever recorded. That she won a Grammy for the song is amazing. She actually sang it in 2000 the movie was released in 2002 and won the Grammy in 2003! I get teary every time I hear her singing the song in the movieI replayed this section at least 10 times when I first saw the movie and I don't think she will ever have another brilliant performance that would match that intensity. Bottom line I strongly recommend this movie and subsequent deeper research into other great RB music roots. Rod Walker".

These talented musicians gave America and the world some of the most memorable songs of its history.The Funk Brothers' music had such an edge that everything else written by popular songwriters pale in comparison. Detroit nurtured these magnificent musicians and gave them the base where they were able to excel by creating something that wasn't easily duplicated by their contemporaries or their followers. In a poignant performance Chaka Khan perhaps the best and most original exponent of the genre gives an amazing rendition of the old Marvin Gaye's mega hit What's going on. Then to end the film this incredible and generous singer is seen and heard with Montell Jordan singing Ain't no Mountain High which keep us singing smiling and shedding a tear for that innocent bygone era that the sensational Funk Brothers created for our delight and pleasure.Long live the Funk Brothers and the sound they left behind.

It's also overwhelmingly inspiring to see musicians playing their music so well and just enjoying it.  The looks on the faces of the Brothers while playing are priceless.  As for the new singers on each track I was extremely happy with these renditions of classic Motown songs.  Yes Joan Osborne is mostly known for her 90s hit One of Us but she also is an amazing soul singer who KNOWS her music.  I defy anyone to listen to What Becomes of the Broken Hearted and tell me that it was not an inspired performance.  Also Ben Harper and  Gerald Levert do fine turns on classic Motown.  Sure these aren't AList superstars of today.  But would it really be about the music if shudder Whitney or Mariah got their hands on these songs?  And lets face it the few Motown artists from that era that are still touring today are shadows of their former selves.  The vocalists in Shadows are wellpicked respected members of a musical elite who are in touch with their roots and show that respect in every note they sing much like the Funk Brothers themselves.".

Most times when we watch documentaries about celebrities we tend to see much of the bad and ugly moments from their past. Certianly nobody is perfect with a squeeky clean background however I appriciate the fact that the producer of this movie put more emphasis on the good things and the funny stories and less on the conflicts and the shortcommings.All of the extra features give you a sense of who these people are with the extra unedited footage of the band interacting with one and other. The part about the guys that died before during and after production was especially touching because it brought closure to a situation with many loose ends. I feel that this story has a happy ending because those who are still living and those who passed on are satisfied that they were recognized for their contributions.Personally I would have liked to see the concert in its entirety instead of a few clips in between the candid interviews but overall it was a very well balanced and well written story about a band that most people didnt even know existed. Even though most people didnt know about the band we can all relate because we know the songs. As each musican shares his involvement with Motown I know and feel where they are comming from because I probably have listened to their music a hundered times over.".

If you hear a Motown record by any number of great artists like Marvin Gaye the Temptations Smokey Robinson  The Miracles the Supremes or dozens of others that's them playing that great backing music. Standing In The Shadows Of Motown is a movie that finally salutes these unsung heroes without whom the music of Motown might not have been half so brilliant.The best part of the movie without a doubt is the new concert footage. All the surviving Funk Brothers were recently reunited for a concert in Detroit the home of Motown to play some of their biggest hits with a diverse group of singers. These live scenes are so powerful and breathtaking that it only reinforced my opinion that the Motown music of the 60's and 70's is some of the best music ever recorded. Pop music never ever before or since sounded so pure and beautiful as that music does. All these performances are great but my favorites have to be The Four Tops' Reach Out I'll Be There sung by Gerald Levert which kicks off the movie with fire and energy and Jimmy Ruffin's What Becomes Of The Broken Hearted? sung passionately by Joan Osbourne.The rest of the movie is pretty regular documentary stuff featuring lots of insightful interviews with the musicians and narration by Andre Braugher.It goes on a little too long like I said in my review for Bowling For Columbine 2 hours is usually pushing it for a documentary and some of the reenactments aren't as effective as intended.But man those performances. There isn't much music I like more than classic soul and if you have at least a passing interest in it you'll be wanting to get up and dance in the aisle just like me.".

I'm not surprised that they had more hits than the top five rock and RB acts in history combined. But what's even more amazing about them is how river deep mountain high their influence has been. So much so in fact that I knew who they were without KNOWING who they were.It is mentioned in the documentary that they only received credit on an LP for the first time in 1970 for their efforts on Marvin Gaye's seminal classic What's Going On. But that was not my first real encounter with the Funk Brothers. That happened a few years later. More than likely inspired in part by Marvin's groundbreaking work producer Norman Whitfield created his own song cycle about love loss struggle sorrow and hope in an urban setting. With The Temptations he crafted one of Motown's and The Temps finest albums ever which shamefully has  long been out of print. The name of the album said it all MASTERPIECE.The most amazing thing about it to me even more than the music locked within the vinyl grooves is that Whitfield saw fit to thank every musician who worked on the album Melvin Wah Wah Ragin Bob Babbitt Richard Pistol Allen Earl Van Dyke Uriel Jones Jack Ashford. And about a dozen more. Spellbound I had no idea even then that I had just made the acquaintance of the Funk Brothers.Now nearly thirty years later with this documentary it's like meeting them all for the first time. To my knowledge none of the singers who shot to fame thanks to the Brothers' talents had ever publicly acknowledged their worth and maybe Mr. Gordy knows the reason for that. But the documentarians have my eternal gratitude for righting this terrible wrong...Maybe not in time enough for James Jamerson Bobby White or Earl Van Dyke but at least while a lot of the Old Masters are still with us. For a little while longer.IMHO the highlights Joan Osborne Gerald Levert with Tom Scott Chaka Khan both alone and with Montell Jordan and Bootsy Collins whose goodtimey vibe is still as infectious as ever. But the shining stars of the piece are and now forever will be The Brothers.Don't rent this baby...BUY it. You'll be glad you made the investment because you'll find yourself playing the concert cuts over and over again...just like an old Gordy Tamla or Motown 45.".

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary is based on an extremely interesting group of guys The Funk Brothers who are responsible for a large amount of Motown number 1 hits but never got the credit.  And now this film unfortunately has immortalized these guys on celluloid in an incompetent documentary.  The story is all about how these guys were left in the shadows more attention was given to the lead singers instead of them.  In this film there are a number of songs performed where these guys get to reunite and play once again.  But during these songs the camera spends 80 of the time focused on the singer.  Here the documentary works against everything it was preaching. And during these songs whenever we do get a glimpse of the Funk Brothers we aren't able to see them play the camera is swooping too fast and is too impatient for this.  Usually we'll get a glimpse of a hand playing the guitar and then we'll see a closeup of a smiling face and then back to the singer.  And that's another thing the singers in this film.  These guys are so important and yet the best talent they can get is Bootsy Collins and Joan Osbourne??  Joan Osbourne who is responsible for What if God was one of us? which includes classic lines like nobody calling on the phone except for the Pope maybe in Rome is in too many scenes of this film and why??  Is she related to the director?  Was Aretha Franklin busy that day? In the film there are at least 8 songs played in full not so that we can get a chance to see these guys play no since the scenes are focused on the singers anyway but there are so many songs because the movie has absolutely nothing to say at all.  During some of the horribly unoriginal anecdotes we get to see dramatizations of dull stories which seem to echo the cinematic brilliance of an E True Hollywood Story rather than a credible documentary. And through these anecdotes we never really learn about the tribulations these guys were under we never find out anything about them really except little cute stories.  Suddenly one of the guys will say Yeah that's when he died of drugs but the film has not set up that this individual had been having any problem with drugs.  These guys never become clear characters and it is never made clear how they feel about being forgotten what it was like then or anything not from episodic little anecdotal segments placed between songs.  And there are two white guys in the Funk Brothers but there is no dramatization showing either of their pasts.  For the other African American guys we get to see how a boy would strum a guitar string in an ant hole and make the ants dance and we get to see how another guy made a guitar on the side of his house.  But the white guys just get stepped over they don't fit into the simplistic minds of the filmmakers.  And even the scenes which propel the men to talk about their anecdotes are ridiculous. In one scene we get to see one of the men on his back attempting to play a bass he then says Man nobody can play a bass on the floor like this this then spurs one of his buddies to say No that's not true Jemmerson could do it.  Why I remember one time...  Not only does this scene have horrible acting embarrassing these men but it also has such a contrived premise to bring on pseudo nostalgia that it recalls sitcoms like The Golden Girls when they have one of their remember the past episodes.  The story dealing with these guys is very interesting and they deserve to be honored and remembered but not like this.".

What about the background singers like the Andantes who sang on nearly as many recordings as the Funk Brothers played on? Did anybody talk to any of Motown's producers the guys who hired the Funk Brothers for their sessions? What about the arrangers who actually wrote the music. And why do the movie give the impression the Funk Brothers were paid poorly? Earl Van Dyke at the height of Motown's rise in the sixties said he was making 80000 a year. This was good money for the sixties. As for not being listed on album covers until Marvin Gaye's What's Going On album. What popsoul musicians of the sixties were? The movie gives the impression that the Funk Brothers were the main reason for Motown's success. Not true.".

What about the background singers like the Andantes who sang on nearly as many recordings as the Funk Brothers played on? Did anybody talk to any of Motown's producers the guys who hired the Funk Brothers for their sessions? What about the arrangers who actually wrote the music. And why do the movie give the impression the Funk Brothers were paid poorly? Earl Van Dyke at the height of Motown's rise in the sixties said he was making 80000 a year. This was good money for the sixties. As for not being listed on album covers until Marvin Gaye's What's Going On album. What popsoul musicians of the sixties were? The movie gives the impression that the Funk Brothers were the main reason for Motown's success. Not true.";

Most of all the personalities of the remaining Funk Brothers shine playfully and heroically through. Like  workers across the globe who actually create the world's wealth these guys lined Berry Gordy's pockets with a fortune that they saw very little of. In this sense they emerge as remarkably generous and unembittered characters seeming to prefer the joy and laughter of their musical lives to any sense of recrimination.However this provokes the two questions I would ask of the makers. Firstly and rightly I think they have concentrated on celebrating the musical story of a bunch of devoted craftsmen. Plenty of time and space is left just to enjoy their playing at a reunion gig with a variety of guest vocalists. But I wonder why the culprits were let off so lightly ? There's no attempt by the filmmakers to nail Berry Gordy or Smokey Robinson about their treatment of the workers in Detroit and Martha Reeves apart no attempt to show how the likes of Stevie wonder Levi Stubbs or other surviving frontmen benefitted at their expense. I think that would have added to the dramatic aspect of the film.The second question is what does this tell us of the contemporary world of music and culture ? Was it just a onceinalifetime set of variables that allowed a bunch of musicmad jazzers to improvise and jam in downtown clubs for peanuts then feed those riffs and hooks into the halfformed directives of HollandDozierHolland tunes and lyrics as their dayjob ? Has the industry displaced the artistry ? Despite his songwriting talentspotting personnel management skills was Berry Gordy always going to put profits before people ?Neither of these questions should spoil the utmost quality and searing emotional punch of this movie a fifteenyear labour of love. Participant singer Joan Osborne was coincidentally in London and spoke at the screening. She told how these songs were almost part of our DNA we seem to know their words and tunes without thinking. But maybe we could have a sequel which asks my questions and seeks some reparation for these mighty mighty musical providers. Even servants deserve dignity and reward.".

	schema:reviewBody "You WISH this was great filmmaking because the story it's trying to tell is so important.  Here is the tale of the guys who backed up Miles Davis Marvin Gaye Stevie Wonder Aretha Franklin and NEVER got the credit they deserved.  It's a tale about some great local musicians from a wide variety of backgrounds with a sad ending.  From the very beginning I felt that the filmmakers didn't quite know what tone or form to use to tell this story. Is this a concert film a historical film or something more personal?   Shadows of Motown ends up covering way too much ground some of which work better than others.  The postivies include Andre Braugher's solid narration recollections about James Jamerson and guitarrist Robert White's frustration and upbringing and the little stories about sessions with Stevie Wonder Marvin and others.  It's great to hear how spontaneous pop music could be back then it's especially enlightening to hear Jack Ashburn remember how back then everybody wanted to be Miles Davis or Charlie Parker no matter what instrument you played.  Likewise the story about Jamerson's growing up in the Old South and the shots of that area are wonderful once you understand that upbringing it makes perfect sense that California life just didn't jive with Jamerson's way of living.  The real problems come with the attempted anecdotes about the band and the concert performances the anecdotes are only funny if you WANT them to be funny.  INDIVIDUAL stories are interesting but connections and reenactments of the band seem rather lame by comparison.  You want to feel there was some real connectivity to the Funk Brothers.  There is that one great story about the Lugar.  Justman does not do the BAND justice they come off just seeming like a bunch o' guys.  I got names mixed up quite frequently and this problem was especially evident in how often Justman had to use chyrons to the very end of the film.  The story about what the Detroit riots did to Motown and indeed to black and white relations deserves a bigger highlight and it seems here almost an afterthought.   I personally liked Me'Shell Ngedecello Gerry Levert and Joan Osborne especially pouring their souls into the music.  Unfortunately they are also the PROBLEM with the performances.  Besides the interactions between Gerry Levert and the saxophonist on Shotgun and the strong TELL ME! rep that Osborne brings into The Broken Hearted The Funk Brothers are once again the afterthought in the songs.   This film will be compared perhaps to Buena Vista Social Club which is a better made film with stronger personalities and performances in a far more surreal environment.  Buena Vista by comparison felt far less contrived and more naturally humorous.  More than that though there truly was something magical about watching Ibrahim Ferrer walk through Midtown Manhattan that night marveling at where his life had gone THAT MAGIC OF REDISCOVERY IS MISSING FROM THIS.     The most telling shot of the entire film is right at the beginning it's this man Joe Turner who played piano backup all those years for all those hits without recognition playing in Troy Michigan at a hotel unrecognized still yet glad to be doing what he's good at.  In other words whereas Buena Vista really DID become a hit with their music which the concerts illustrated these concerts seem more like CONSOLATION for these great neglected musicians which really have no effect in their lives.  Detroit you deserve better!  ".

	schema:reviewBody "Dex the leading male character has told Syd that he's falling in love with her and she asks why he doesn't stop seeing other women. He responds Why? So I can bask in the warmth of your annihilating contempt? The story of this film meanders much like its goodfornothing hero Dex as we follow him through a slacker routine that allows him to do virtually nothing but pick up women and play games with his male friends.He believes that he has the key to life in the Tao of Steve which is essentially a guide to fooling women into having sex with a fat loserhimself. He exclaims Why does the American Slacker get so little respect? The clever dialog and the sweetness of Dex's discovery that he actually loves Syd and doesn't really want to be a professional cad all his life makes the movie worth watching. Also fun is the truth in the Tao of Steve with its three edicts 1 suppress your desireand your agenda of getting her into bed 2 be excellent in her presence and 3 retreat. It's true that going into a relationship with nothing else in mind but sleeping with a woman is a huge mistake and Dex recognizes the wisdom of being cool rather than needy but then he uses it the wrong way or the right way depending on your perspective. We watch him explain his philosophy use it to manipulate women and then have to violate it as he finally figures out that while the Tao of Steve may get him women it won't get him the one woman he really wants.".

Dir Jennipher Goodman Donal Logue.  The name may not ring any bells but you've seen him before in countless tv shows including The XFiles' as an arrogant fellow agent of Scully's and Mulder's and films one of Tom Cruise's fellow agents in Jerry Maguire' and in this summer's blockbuster The Patriot' as a racist who sees the error of his ways on the battlefield but his biggest claim to fame seems to be as the greasy bespectacled chatterbox philosophizing taxi hack Jimmy The Cabdriver in a series of promos for MTV in the '90s.  Well all that's about to change in this starmaking role in a devilishly funny and accurate look at the relationship war between men and women. Logue who pulls a De Niro by gaining nearly a hundred pounds stars as Dex a selfdeprecating parttime kindergarten teacher who attends his ten year college reunion in the dusty oasis of Santa Fe New Mexico where he is told by stunned classmates at his jarringly gonetopot visage that he was like Elvis.  Yeah well now I'm Fat Elvis' he says with a hip shake and a smirk.  It is here the journey begins into Dex's eventual chipping away at the wall of sardonic intelligence he's built since attending the university. Dex has a certain acquired charm that he attributes to his own quasiphilosophy the film's title referring to the ultimate in guy coolness as being a Steve as in McGarrett  the Jack Lord character of Hawaii FiveO' Austin The Six Million Dollar Man' and McQueen the coolest actor of all time or any suave icon down the pike James Bond James Dean et al.  and the opposite being Stu  and the certain guidelines in wooing the opposite sex wrapping up with his ultimate kwon We persue that which retreats from us.'At the reunion he bumps into Syd Goodman the stunningly attractive sister of the filmmaker a fellow alumni who turns out to be one of Dex's apparent number of sexual conquests in which he later learns he cannot recall her at all.  She is equally selfeffacing smart and opinionated and naturally proves to be the ultimate love of the loveless I love my dog' Dex.   Here the plot sets into motion the inevitable formula of two people so right for each other yet both guarded Syd for her share of heartbreaks and Dex for his chronic lying and seductive charisma like some sort of catnip for women including the wife of one of his pals who he's engaged in a hot affair.Logue makes Dex sympathetic funny pathetic infuriating likable and ultimately an original character the likes haven't been seen since John Cusack's hey dey in the Eighties and the characters of the 90's indie comedy Kicking and Screaming' about arrested development and lifelong search for the perfect love.  Dex is an enigma and the joke is that Dex realizes how unsavory he has become which also is the underlying angst he knows all to well someone with so much potential only wasted by his own hand. Goodman and her sister both excel in portraying women who are smarter than men think and provide the true anchor in a freely funny comedy that also examines one's own frailites and insecurites on a truly appealing level. Cowritten by the sisters and Duncan North the reallife model of Dex the dialogue rings true in a brilliant string of set ups for Dex to pontificate before he deflates himself in recourse.One of the best films and comedies of this year or any.  And remember that name Donal Logue.".

Sorry  this from a film student who abhors my dinner w andre  thank God this film ended up as eminently watchable as it was. I avoided seeing it for a long time because I feared exactly the opposite. Firstly the central observation this film makes about human nature is so spoton  namely that every relationship is comprised of someone chasing and someone being chased  that almost no direction it could have taken from there would have undermined the essential honesty of it. But framing as it did a story of boy meets girl forgets he slept with her in college strikes out becomes desperate finally gets her back by going against every rule in the book the story becomes a smart nononsense telling of a quintessential human drama that resonates realistically on so many levels. People have said it's a chick movie it's not. It's a movie for guys who fear intimacy its essential message being that a relationship of real value can never be condensed from the vaporous nuance of gamesmanship slyness intellect or skill. But at the same time it demonstrates very realistically how all the above can combine to get the average guy laid far more than he deserves. So not only is it valuable on both these levels it leaves you nodding your head so many times mumbling that's so fing true that by the end you're pretty much ready to write your own Tao of Steve  a better one  and isn't that kind of inspiration the loftiest goal of any good and truthful work of art?".

	schema:headline " Slight and relying heavily on the cool factor but still an enjoyable little film if it catches you in the right mood";
	schema:reviewBody "Dex is a ladies man who has a Zenlike art of seduction under his belt. So despite the fact that his belt has expanded since his best days in high school he generally still has that going for him even if he has generally underachieved in everything else. Basing his rules around the approach of Steve Steve being the embodiment of American male cool Dex has managed to get into more beds than his looks really should have allowed him to and generally he is happy despite being a slacker in his late twenties. When he meets Syd though he finds himself feeling a bit more than normal which is nothing and genuinely liking her as a friend. Will she make him look again at his approach to life?The title should at least give you some idea of the type of film this is going to be because it manages to sound cool and interesting and a bit hip without really doing a lot  which pretty much sums up the appeal of this as a film. The story is essentially quite a nice romance but it is set in a postmodern word of slackers who have relaxed jobs relaxed morals relaxed approaches to life relaxed houses and generally just shoot the breeze about nothing. I suppose it will depend a bit on your age but as some in his late twenties at least at the time of writing I am I suppose I am target audience and I must admit it quite won me over. The story doesn't really go to any depth and at the end of the day it does just what you expect it to do in terms of how it ends but it manages to get passed all this by having the same relaxed attitude of the characters.I'm sure it was not as easy to put together as it appeared but the film moves nicely along with a lot of pop culture references slacker humour and a touch of genuine humanity in the romance. It wasn't the most convincing story or scenario but I was so happy to just buy into the cool nature of the world within the film that I forgave it perhaps a bit too easily for this. The direction helps because it all looks sunny and chilled while the use of music is cool without being too obvious. The cast also help and in particular sterling work from Logue who manages to take a fat sexist womaniser and make him into a character who has those characteristics but still managed to make me like him and care where his story went. Goodman gave a good performance and like Logue she came over very natural probably helped by being the writer. Although these two carry the majority of the film the support cast are still pretty good and enjoyably fill in the film and match the mood.Overall a chilled and enjoyable little comedy that drew me in despite being slight and not having that much to it. Probably best watched by older members of the slacker generation or those that have grown up but still look back affectionately this is quite fun and quite charming even if these qualities are covering up a multitude of sins in the background.".

For one thing it's tough to identify with the protagonist who's boorish and a drug user. I suppose he's supposed to be really a nice guy deep down but it doesn't come through.Having something real to say about how to treat your girlfriend comes through in a heavyhanded formulaic fashion forcing the plot to meander and there isn't really any romantic chemistry. This makes it unengaging and the humor is subintellectual. Worse the film takes itself pretty seriously as a drama that will teach you about life... that sort of thing can backfire. If it had been a little campy and fun the flaws wouldn't have mattered as much.Who should see this film nobody see What Women Want or High Fidelity instead.I am forced to give The Tao of Steve a 2 out of 10.".

The plot is simple and unoriginal which would be fine if the movie went any deeper than that. But it doesn't.  Every character is a bad stereotype.  Donal Logue plays Dex the guy who gets lots of chicks who acts much more like a whiny lattesipping wuss than the Steve McQueentype he is made out to be.  What makes this movie even more unwatchable is the soundtrack which is a cross between the background music of a softcore porn flick and an episode of the Brady Bunch.  A couple other things I couldn't get over the pillow stuffed in Logue's shirt to make him look like a fat guy also if you're going to play a guy who plays frisbee golf every day learn to throw a frisbee more than ten feet.  Tao of Steve is a weak halfhearted attempt at a romantic comedy that would barely give a warm fuzzy to a person whose goal for 2001 is to not miss the 'Friends' wedding.  It would be a shame if Donal Logue's greatest achievement remains his early 90's portrayal of Jimmy the Cab Driver on MTV.  Keep trying man.".

The two lead characters were good though there was this one character with a space between his teeth that was horrible. The scene where they're playing poker and he's asking who Steve McGarrett and Steve Austin were was a testament to not only bad acting but also horrible cliched screenwriting. 70s pop culture references need to be put to rest.

Dex is a character who believes the best way to get a girl into bed is to make her think that he doesn't want her in bed.  That doesn't make sense.  The chick most of the time knows that when a guy asks her out it isn't because he is a gay guy who wants to be just friends and not sex but because he wants her most intimate of places.  Dex is also a liar and fat which even with a bit of bad sarcastic charm usually can not get girls especially when a guy is more transparent than used Neutrogena.  Not too realistic in my book even though I'm no one to talk but I guess it isn't that bad if you have seen everything else.  Some of the film I found interesting but the rest maybe fair.  C".

So some arabian skeikh Omar Sharif sends for him to take part in the biggest horse race in the world 4.800km long through the Arabian desert to prove that Mortensen's nonthoroughbred horse is not as good and resistant as arabian horses. That's the starting point. And from that moment on we will witness a marvelous adventure through the desert in which the starring will have to face all kind of difficulties and traps. As I've said and old style adventure movie. No absurd and meaningless special effects no absurd and unbelievable plots and no pretensions but to make the audience have a good time. And no doubt Joe Johnston achieves that the movie is 136 minutes long but you don't feel tired nor boring in any moment. The rhythm is just great and well measured. The photography and the landscapes are just astonishing and the work of Mortensen is so remarkable. He seems to be the perfect heir to those actors specializing in adventure movies just like Harrison Ford though Mortensen's characters Hidalgo LOTR usually are a little more darker than Ford's.

His subtle blend of virtue such as honor honest and pride  without being the least bit preachy make watching his performance an utter joy.All of the actors are brilliant in their roles especially the one in the title role!  Hidalgo is clever and entertaining without being unbelievable as many animal movies are these days. You won't find him standing on his hind legs and doing the hokeypokey but his talents are very evident and he becomes a hero that we all love before the end of the movie.One of the best parts of this movie is the fact that it is a movie by grownups for grownups although it carries enough action and suspense that kids will probably like it to.  Absent however is the sickeningly sweet kids scenes that we simply cannot get away from in movies today.  No charming close ups of dimplefaced waifs.  No little wisemouthed child prodigies  nothing but good old fashioned grownup fun!  How refreshing.You will be happy to know that the ending isn't as predictable as it could have been.  Although falling into the happy category of course there are poignant moments and you might shed a tear.  One other aspect of this film which I found intriguing is the issue of examining and accepting who we are.  It was very well done and meaningful. Overall this film is easily a 10.  Please see it".

The music was very moving and beautiful.Perhaps some people have become so jaded that a movie simply isn't complete unless there's a helicopter chase an exploding car or two or in this case a wagon a trip to the nearby strip club with the flashing lightswhere all characters in search of answers seem to end up at gratuitous sex scenes oh yeah don't forget to use the 'F' word and while we're at it let take God's name in vain a few times for the sake of 'realism'.Hollywood needs to make more movies like this.";

	schema:reviewBody "An excellent epic tale. This is not a fastpaced film rather think of it as story unfolding before your eyes so sit back and enjoy the ride. There's plenty of adventure along the way and I shed a few tears as well. It is a moving narrative. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead character Frank T. Hopkins with aplomb humor humility and spunk. Hidalgo his painted mustang plays his part well also! Hopkins is a cowboyPony Express rider with a heritage that he holds to himself and is revealed in time. Especially heartwrenching is the Battle of Wounded Knee. More massacre than battle it had a profound and personal impact on Hopkins' life.In the legendary 3000mile Ocean of Fire race across the sands of the Arabian desert Hopkins and his horse must face treachery and the cruel desert elements in an endurance race that pushes man and beast to their limits. If you like horses adventure and epic films this is a movie for you. Expect moments of triumph and humor that make you laugh and cheer as well as moments of tragedy. It is a story beautifully told and carefully crafted though not without mistakes. A few scenes could have been edited to preserve the epic feel while maintaining the film's pace. At certain points it was natural for the film to slow down but it should not have been allowed to slow down to the point of stalling. However in defense of the filmmakers they were successful in capturing the tedium beauty and peril of crossing a desert in a 3000mile race and it gave viewers a real feeling for what it might be like to make such a journey. The relationship Frank T. Hopkins has with his horse in this movie is especially touching and is perhaps the highlight of the film. Supporting roles by the rest of the cast were outstanding. Omar Sharif was amazing as always. Even the smallest actors shone in their parts.Mr. Mortensen's diverse talents including his aptitude for learning languages LakotaSioux in this case his own horseback riding skills and his versatility as an actor made him a perfect fit for this part. Mr. Mortensen's book Miyelo which sprang from this movie is a fine choice for anyone who wants to see a sampling of Mr. Mortensen's outstanding photography. Frank T. Hopkins remained a staunch advocate of the wild Mustang horse until his death. Keep in mind that the real Frank T. Hopkins was known for his weaving of tall tales thus the legendary Ocean of Fire race.A highly recommended movie.".

The only problem is the Liberal bias in here which is brutal.Several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because thanks to the previews they thought it would be an actionpacked adventure story such as The Mummy. Well it wasn't and it was way too slow for them.Frankly I thought the slow parts were the best and overall thought the film had just the right amount of action instead of overdoing it as the recent Mummy pictures did. Another big plus was the cinematography. This is a beautifully filmed movie stunning in some parts. Another good point is the language hardly a swear word.On the negative side there was the usual political correctness a la Dances With Wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at Wounded Knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys. The horse race had some credibility problems too as Hidalgo came back from the dead not once but twice to race like Secretariat! Anyway if you are looking for a modernday adventure story with oldfashioned storytelling and no language problems this film is for you and the rest of the family.".

Of course there are many trials and obstacles along the way including his fellow racers who hate the idea of a Mustang horse competing in the race.

	schema:reviewBody "A great actionadventure movie! I was surprised at just how good it was as it has received so little attention. Viggo Mortensen of Lord of the Rings plays Frank Hopkins a reallife cowboy although probably much fictionalized in this movie. He is a halfbreed part Native American and part white. In the film's prologue he works for the cavalry and witnesses the massacre of his people at Wounded Knee. The event scars him and he becomes a lush. For some easy money he and his horse Hidalgo enter Buffalo Bill's roadshow. Hidalgo is so famous that a sheik has sent a servant to invite him to participate in a race across the Arabian desert which he accepts it being a better alternative to the humiliating performances. It's really a classical adventure movie with princesses and scimitars and sandstorms and swarms of locusts. Omar Sharif costars as the sheik. Its nice to see a movie like this made with care. It never gets stupid and while it moves quickly it isn't too fast either. The director is Joe Johnston whom I think is an undervalued filmmaker who specializes in these kinds of enjoyable yarns. His previous films include Jurassic Park 3 which is my favorite of that series Jumanji The Rocketeer Honey I Shrunk the Kids as well as episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles which I loved in my tween years. He also made October Sky which I haven't seen but has been recommended. The film also features good performances from Zuleikha Robinson soon to be a star I'm sure Louise Lombard and Adam AlexiMalle one of my favorite character actors he was the guy who wrote Chubby Rain in the movie Bowfinger. 810.".

The riding that Viggo Mortensen did was awesome and the horse that was Hidalgo was quite an actor.  I was riveted throughout and it should be considered an epic.  This movie shows so much about this particular piece of our past and how we started and what happened to the Native American Indians and to the Mustangs.  We don't have enough of this kind of movie now.  There are children that don't know about these things.  There were many messages in this movie that were courageously and sensitively put forth. Viggo Mortensen was perfect in every way as was the horse.  I found all of the actors wonderful the scenery so different from just a western and the horsemanship outstanding.  What a movie.  I loved it.  I will see it again in the movie theater and I will buy it when available.".

Ever since I was 6 years old now i'm 15 I loved Viggo Mortensen as an actor poetry writer etc..... and i still do love him. I think he is incredible at everything he does or at least tries. What I liked about Hidalgo was the bond Frank T. Hopkins had with his horse Hidalgo. I also liked the humor here and there. I think no one else could of played Frank T. Hopkins like Viggo can. This movie is one I will recommend for everyone to see. It is just great. Hidalgo has also given me a love for horses more than I had before. For any one who loves racing or horses this is the movie for you to see.".

	schema:headline " An Oldfashioned Somewhat Predictable but Thoroughly Entertaining Horse Opera";
	schema:reviewBody "As westerns go Jumanji director Joe Johnston's new movie Hidalgo out of  qualifies as an oldfashioned somewhat predictable but thoroughly entertaining horse opera about the 'Ocean of Fire' endurance race over 3000 miles of Arabian desert from Aden to Damascus in the 1890s. Actually Hidalgo meets the criteria of a western hybrid. Usually Hollywood reins in its oaters on the far side of the Mississippi. However this offbeat picturesque dustraiser with Rings trilogy hero Viggo Mortensen and Lawrence of Arabia's Omar Sharif doesn't flog sentiment to death like the usual Disney animal epic. Furthermore the hellbentforleather competition occurs well off the range in another corner of the world. No Hidalgo isn't the first western to blaze a trail overseas. Cowhand Glenn Ford traveled to Brazil to deliver Brahma bulls in William Castle's The Americano 1955 while drunken outlaw Lee Van Cleef pursued kung fu master Lieh Lo to China in a search for hidden treasure in Anthony M. Dawson's The Stranger and the Gunfighter 1976. More recently David Dobkin's Shanghai Knights sent Jackie Chan  Owen Wilson to London to recover the Great Seal of China. More often Europeans and Asians do the emigrating. In Edward Dmytryk's Shalako 1968 a buckskinclad Sean Connery buckled on a sixshooter as a cavalry scout and escorted aristocratic Bridget Bardot on safari through hostile Indian territory while Terence Young's Red Sun 1974 teamed up samurai warrior Toshiro Mifune with roguish bandit Charles Bronson to retrieve a stolen ceremonial sword.Like the aforementioned frontier classics Hidalgo breaks new ground both with its protagonist and setting. Scenarist John Fusco whose credits include the Billy the Kid bio Young Guns 1988 and the animated nag Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron 2002 has appropriated the reallife figure of Pony Express courier Frank T. Hopkins with his trusty mustang Hidalgo and sets this exciting saga in the distant deserts of the Middle East. Johnston  Fusco take their time and sketch in an interesting backstory for Hopkins before the action breaks into a gallop in Saudi Arabia. Not only does Hidalgo take advantage of a fistful of western clichs but also it depicts the culture clash that occurs when an outsider enters an alien society. Literally our hero finds himself a fishoutofwater in the Middle East without a clue about Muslim culture. Hidalgo stereotypes both Americans as well as Arabs. Indeed the most despicable character in Hidalgo is a Muslim but the film presents positive images of Muslims too. Nevertheless the filmmakers cast a shadow over Arab culture particularly its intolerance toward women and its rigidly segregated society with enslaved Africans languishing in chains. Eventually Hopkins frees one a small boy and enlists him as his waterbearer. Hidalgo opens with an unsuspecting Hopkins riding into Wounded Knee South Dakota with an order for the 7th Cavalry to disarm the Indians. An overzealous trooper tries to take a rifle away from a deaf brave. The struggling Indian accidentally fires a shot that triggers the infamous December 28th massacre in 1890. Like the disillusioned Tom Cruise hero in The Last Samurai our guiltridden protagonist holds himself to blame for the senseless slaughter. When he isn't drowning himself in alcohol he performs stunts in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Buffalo Bill J.K. Simmons of SpiderMan advertises Hopkins as the best horseman in the world. Sheik Riyadh Omar Sharif challenges Hopkins to compete in his Ocean of Fire endurance horse race. Not only is Hopkins the only American in the race he rides the only mustang. Everybody else including the treacherous Lady Davenport Louise Lombard of Tale of the Mummy races pureblooded Arabian steeds. Nobody believes Hopkins has a snowball's chance in the Sahara to win. When Hopkins doesn't fall for Lady Davenport's charms she bribes Riyadh's evil nephew Katib to kill Hidalgo Hopkins' beloved horse and set the halfSioux halfwhite wrangler afoot. Had director Joe Johnston devoted the entire movie to the race Hidalgo would only have been half as interesting. The villainous Katib Silas Carson of Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones raids the sheik's camp and kidnaps his headstrong daughter Jazira Zuleikha Robinson of Timecode along with Riyadh's own stellar stallion. Johnston takes time out from the race to stage a bulletblazing shoot out as Hopkins rescues Jazira from the bad guys Indiana Jones style. The last hour of this marathon 136minute epic generates whiteknuckled suspense as Hopkins nurses his wounded horse back onto the trail and rides like the wind toward the finish with his opponents nosetonose with Hidalgo.John Fusco's adventurous screenplay based loosely on mythic Hopkins' life follows the ideology of the John Ford western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. When the legend becomes fact print the legend! Hidalgo inflates the legend instead of the fact. Most historians classify Hopkins memoirs as tall tales. Pretty much straightforward in its linear narrative development the story concentrates on Hopkins with interludes with the Sheik's daughter who behaves a lot like Mulan. In his first starring role virile Viggo Mortensen delivers a quiet but sincere performance. Mortensen evokes memories of iconic cowboy Gary Cooper. Viggo appears at ease whether he's straddling his painted pony twirling his rope or fanning his singleaction Colt's revolver like Robert Redford in the bestknown western hybrid Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969. Doctor Zhivago Golden Globe winner Omar Sharif enlivens the proceedings with his colorful but crafty Sheik of Sheiks. Sharif and Mortensen have several good scenes together as their relationship gradually goes from adversial to amicable. Meanwhile Silas Carson excels as Katib. You'll want to cheer when he gets his comeuppance. A Clockwork Orange star Malcolm McDowell makes a brief appearance as Lady Davenport's bewhiskered hubby. Veteran lenser Shelly Johnson of Jurassic Park 3 captures the scenic grandeur of the sprawling Moroccan locales which convincingly substitute for Arabia and gives the action a sense of spectacle with his widescreen photography. Happily Hidalgo is short on giddyyap and long on giddyup.".

It does seem to me today that a movie needs to be ridiculously full of stunts and action sequences and blood violence etc to be considered worth while by the rank and file who are watching. How sad is that? I guess I am in the minority but I want more to a movie than special effects.I had wanted to see this movie from the start but was never able to get to the theater so I got it the minute it came out on DVD. I know it was supposed to be a True Story but as is I would doubt it  too Hollywood. But hey the long and short of it is . . . Viggo. Horses. I am so there. Who cares if it did not really happen this way?Anyway now that I have seen it I can't say I was disappointed at all. I was raised in a scouting family that was very involved in Indian Lore and the chants brought back memories. I think Native American history is complex and interesting and we can still learn from the mistakes made on both sides. And Native Lore is ingrained in the message this movie had to tell. EVERY movie lately seems to be overcoming obstacles and winning even when you had no chance . . . you can't sit through a day of the Disney Channel without getting that drummed into you! But this was different. Frank T Hopkins was what was then called a half breed but he passed as white and not wanting to deal with his race he hid it except for speaking the language which I assumed many white men who were close to the land could do. Although he tried to deny it his bloodlines brought him back to it time and again. Although being in the race had nothing to do with being a half breed on the surface it was all about it in the end. Hidalgo was an Indian pony  a breed that was facing extinction. The horse was constantly being put down by both the whites and the Arabs. While defending the horse constantly Hopkins yet shunned his own heritage and culture and only when he accepted it did he win the race. And yet he should have known it all along since the horse the symbol of that heritage was his most prized friend. I got my back up a little when I read that someone thought the movie was was moralistic until they finally got to the action. Gee aren't movies supposed to be moralistic? Should we not learn from our entertainment or is it just mindless slaughter and CGI? It was like yeah yeah forget the plot let's see some action.Action is fine but I liked all the little coincidences symbolisms and tieins to other characters. The tiein to Jazia the sheik's daughter wearing a veil over her head was perfect. They were both less in the eyes of white men but in reality they were fine for what they were. They just had to accept it. The symbol of the natives a necklace given to him by a chief friend became his symbol as well when his servant mistakenly used it for their flag. In the end it was no mistake at all. Yes it was the typical Disney underdog wins but there was something extra to it. At least to me and I am not sorry to say I still watch movies for the message not the phony thrills.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is based on a real man but not a true story  it is an outright lie. First out the race of Ocean of Fire is nonexistent. Second the real man is a native of New Jersey and works for digging tunnels for a subway in Pennsylvania. Thirdly he never worked for Buffalo Bill Show the closest he came to this was as a horse hand for the Ringling Brother's Circus. Fourthly he had two wives. Making such an adventure a seemingly impossible task since he was married since his childhood. First was a Canadian wife who lives in New Jersey and had several children. The second wife was Gertrude Hopkins who tried desperately to keep secret of his first married and to promote him as a hero was suspicious when an editor demanded proof that the legend was true which of course she could not prove. Keeping his family a secret is important so no newspaper writers could verify his story from family members. Oh yes there is a surviving Hopkins siblings but they too remain suspiciously silent about this film. Fifth he had nothing to do with Wounded Knee or even buying a land to protect the Indians. Sixth the Indian Chief mentioned in the movie never existed.Finally and most important Iraq didn't exist in 1890. It became an independent country in the 1930s. Also newspaper interviews in Philadelphia Public Ledger in 1926 of Frank Hopkins which was made before Iraq existed made no single mention of the great Arab horse race. So my guess is Hidalgo was made up after Iraq became an independent country. If that is not enough years ago Hidalgo story has been proved to be a hoax.I avoided watching Hidalgo movie when it first entered the movie theaters because the feel of Yankee conquering the East sounds suspiciously like the Yankee in King Arthur's Day. When I finally had a chance to rent the movie the mention of Iraq was very suspicious. Also the promotion of any particular horse sounds very suspicious in this case a single breed that Mustang is good for long distance race is not true in fact other breeds can also cross the country such as the Pinto. All mentions of hundreds of race which Frank Hopkins mentioned made me very suspicious. If you watched Seabiscuits you will realize winning hundreds of race is nearly impossible. In fact if Frank Hopkins can do this he could easily beat Seabiscuits and become a millionaire. The truth of Seabiscuit not mentioned in the movie is that the horse was and truly is a real looser. And the reason which the movie was correct is the bonding between the rider and the horse. So in fact there was in fact little bonding between Frank and Hidalgo another red flag when I watched the movie Hidalgo. Other suspicions about the movie includes an awfully liberal Sheik after discovering Frank Hopkins together with his daughter. For those who know how strict Arabs are on this matter you probably know this act of benevolence just doesn't exist especially in the 1890s. If I suspend the idea of based on true story I still find it hard to convince myself where all these prize money comes from and why do Arabs bothered to get an American to race and let the American keep all the prize money when the Arabs are the partner in sponsoring such an event.I will not have any spoilers here and will let you decide who won the race. I give the movie good marks for cinematography 910. A story even if I think it is true I just simply did not buy it I give it 310 because it was not convincing enough even if it is A LIE. When I do watch a movie the story always come first so I will never complain of any bad fx or cinematography I do complain about the cardboard actor and the story therefore I give the movie 310.".

If DANCES WITH WOLVES would ever have a sequel I would imagine it would pick up where the first film left off and end at Wounded Knee.For the film HIDALGO the old West was only looked upon briefly.  Most of the film was spent in Arabia.  It is very interesting how the film's release is timed  while the US is still in Iraq.  The film shows that the Middle East had feelings of illwill toward America in the 1890's as much as they did in the 1990's.Viggo Mortensen made for a very convincing cowboy.  It is good to see that he is finally receiving top billings in movies something that is perhaps overdue.  We saw him briefly in WITNESS but I do not remember seeing him again until CRIMSON TIDE which was 10 years later.  His performance in that film made me believe he was finally receiving recognition.The film has powerful overtones along with a basic plot.  Overall it made for a great adventure film that I plan to watch again.  Its ending was certainly bittersweet  if you love something set it free...".

	schema:reviewBody "John Ford paid the wagons his tribute of a special picture 'Wagon Master' made after two big Indiancavalry epics... It is a lovely poetic movie full of romanticized reincarnation of the pioneer spirit... It didn't have to top the big ones that had preceded it...Photographically it is extremely simple... The camera moves only once or twice in the entire film and never when a director would have made it move to underline a shot... Ford even resists the temptation to track his camera in the breathtaking twilight shots of the women wearily marching along in the dust behind their wagons... They comeand gowhile the camera remains immobile and the audience stays a spectator to the march of history not a participant in it... Of course when Ford wants to involve his audience emotionally or dramatically as in 'Stagecoach' he knows just how to do it... But Wagon Master is a tender nostalgic look backward...Filled with traditional Western songs rendered by The Sons of the Pioneers it tells of the trek West to Utah in 1879 of a Mormon wagon train led by Ward Bond in the role of Elder Wiggs and two young horse traders Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. And in a series of beautiful images as the wagon train fights outlaws Indians and nature in its struggle to reach the 'promised land' the modest 'Wagon Master' manages to capture the history and legend of the West... Ford himself has said that 'Wagon Master' of which he wrote the original story was among the three films of his which 'came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve.'Ford's career as a Western director was astonishing... More than anyone else he was able to use the genre to protect his feelings about the family society and the American way of life... Ford saw the frontier as a land to be subdued by a special class of settlers and lawmen whose great sacrifices make the land safe from those who come after... These early westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they earned and the civilized townsfolk who followed must always hold them in fear and respect... Ford's Westerns often employ flashbacks that emphasize the historical authenticity of his approach...In 'Wagon Master' for example folk songs on the sound track tell us of the hardships of the pioneers of a century ago and Ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion... In one sequence the train is camped in a circle and the settlers decide to hold a square dance... To fashion a dance floor they have to lay boards over the desert sand and with this ritual celebration Ford shows the defeat of the wilderness through the metaphor of boarding over the land...It's a lovelytolookat film full of a marvelous lighthearted optimism and it is easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying It never breaks faith with the mood and style set in the first few sequences But one is left wondering whether the ultraromantic best suits the chosen themeThe wagontrain experience must have been one of the most physically demanding and nervewracking ordeals that man with his womankind ever set himself It must have been riddled with doubtswas I wrong to sell up everything and come? How can we hope to survive? How will we contend the other end?almost every other aching step of the wayYet none of this feeling really comes through in Wagon Master. The journeysuch is the general ebulliencedoes not strike one as particularly hazardous It could be of course that the Mormons were so 'high' on religious spirit that this tended to act as an anesthetic In other words their reactions weren't those of normal human weakness... If so Ford was right and the doubters were wrongWhat is beyond doubt is the right and proper ebullience especially at first meeting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This is the essence of lighthearted adventurous youth particularly one feels of Western youth of those extraordinary times It's a remarkable relationship and it remains lodged in the mind".

Mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by John Ford himself the story that was elaborated by Frank Nugent and director's son  Patrick Ford and turned into a screenplay and because of director's personal opinion regarding it Wagon Master is the film John Ford called the one which came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve' to say so is not to say a little but as Ford confessed once to Lindsay Anderson his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any other.   Wagon Master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a John Ford's film. Wonderful cast delivering his best thou not featuring any major stars except the most fordian' of all actors  Ben Johnson. Very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and Wagon Master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing Sister Ledyard Jane Darwell in her shot but very inspired gigs. And last but not least legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth passage through it after Stagecoach My Darling Clementine Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.   The film starts with two friends cowboys Travis Blue Ben Johnson and Sandy Owens Harry Carey Jr being hired to be Wagon Masters or guides for a caravan of Mormon settlers who are headed to Silver Valley a place that's for them like a promised land. On their way they are joined by a very peculiar Dr. Locksley Hall Alan Mowbray with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors. They are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into Cleggs a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the Marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery.   Overall Wagon Master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of John Ford's wonderful Westerns.  A must see.  910".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most poetic narrative films ever made WAGONMASTER is nonetheless a difficult film to immediately like.  I love this movie but I recommend seeing some of John Ford's other westerns before taking a look at this one. The first time I saw it I was 18 years old and I hadn't seen too many other westerns and I hated it.  I thought it was incredibly boring.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  It took several years for me to love this picture.  First I fell in love with westerns in general  the traditions characters landscapes ways of talking etc  and that made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again that a lot is happening in it after all.I also was simply a more experienced moviegoer at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling and to listen to what each image was telling me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual movie by one of the most visual of directors working near the peak of his career.The movie is a celebration of a way of life and its subject matter is more emotional and interior than other Ford westerns.  Actually that's not really as accurate as saying that rather it has a lot less exterior action than the other westerns.  The other westerns have exterior action AND interior emotion.  It quite beautifully places its Mormon pioneers in the context of nature. There are many shots of animals and children  not for any surface narrative purpose but for illustrating this idea.  That is why the movie can be called a poem. It isn't about the surface story which barely exists nearly as much as it is about an emotional idea and it gets this idea across through composition editing sound and music.  In fact one could argue that this is a purer form of filmmaking because the images directly express the emotional idea of the film rather than having to first service a story.Give this movie a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms not the terms of other westerns or other movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails. Because it was a little picture John Ford was not harassed by the studio big wigs. He was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them such as Ben Johnson had been discovered by Ford and given opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work. Years later he would win the coveted Academy Award for his brilliant performance in The Last Picture Show. Ward Bond even outshines Ben Johnson in this movie. He is not the wagon master that role is played by Johnson but because of this movie he was later given the role of wagon master in the classic television series Wagon Train. Ironically one of the bad guys in Wagon Master James Arness would star in the hit television series Gunsmoke on a rival network to Wagon Train. Ward Bond plays the leader of the Mormons heading west who often backslides to his sinning days by cussing only to be called down by fellow Mormon Adam Perkins Russell Simpson. When any bothersome situation arises Elder Wiggs Ward Bond yells Blow your horn Sister Ledeyard! The Mormon sister played to perfection by Jane Darwell then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were famous for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford's classic version of the John Steinbeck novel The Grapes of Wrath.Another of the great character actors in Ford's company was Hank Worden who plays one of Uncle Shiloh Clegg's notoriously mean but not too bright outlaw sons. Worden would become famous a few years later for playing Mose in Ford's The Searchers. Worden lived to be 91. He was still making movies when he died.The wagon master Travis Blue Ben Johnson and his partner Sandy Harry Carey Jr. are horse traders who never take their job seriously having a lot of fun along the way especially with the local sheriff. They get mixed up with a Mormon wagon train heading west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the film. The main reason for the teaming is a redheaded Mormon beauty Prudence Perkins Kathleen O'Malley who catches Sandy's eye. Along the way the train picks up a hoochie coochie show which includes a charlatan doctor Alan Mowbray and two soiled angels Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford. Also joining up along the way is the Clegg family wanted for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how arduous a journey west by wagon was in those days. The songs in the film were written by Stan Jones of the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. Jones' writing was almost as good as that of Bob Nolan who had previously done much of the writing for the group. Jones' most famous song not in this film is the much recorded Ghost Riders In The Sky. The Sons of the Pioneers do the background singing in Wagon Master. This adds to the overall impact of wagons rolling west.It should also be noted that the acclaimed Native American athlete Jim Thorpe from Oklahoma plays the role of a Navajo leader. This was his last film appearance. He died not long after Wagon Master was released.".

Along the way they also encounter Doctor A Locksley Hall and his Hoochey Koochey Wagon and lend them help.Lovingly directed by Ford who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail. The film has a wonderful cast made up of character actors with nary a true star in the film which is actually a blessing to see if just not for a change of pace. Young Johnson and Carey Jr. come off real well but this is Bond's film to shine as he has the best lines. Johnson is the one who seems to understand ruffians and brutes like Shiloh and will certainly come in handy when certain conflict might develop as the Clegg boys ride along side them a piece.I'd have to say this is one of his best and most least appreciated westerns and seems to flow very well.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's a unique place in the pantheon of John Ford films for Wagonmaster Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films with no box office names in them that Ford didn't have to tailor the film around the persona of a star being it John Wayne Henry Fonda or any of the others he worked with. Not surprising that Ford considered all these as favorites of one kind or another. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. a couple of likable cowpokes sign on to guide a Mormon wagon train to a valley in Arizona territory. Along the way they are joined first by a group stranded players from a medicine show and then by a family of outlaws on the run named Clegg. Their stories merge and what happens is the basis of the film's plot.Had Wagonmaster been done even 10 years earlier on the strength of the two performances turned in by Johnson and Carey both probably would have had substantial careers as B picture cowboys. In the case of Johnson it would have been art imitating life. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and and first worked with a string horses for John Ford to use in Fort Apache. Ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history. But the day of the B western was drawing to a close and Johnson and Carey had great careers as two fine character actors.Ward Bond plays Elder Wiggs leader of the Mormons. Bond is a recent convert though and has trouble remembering to not use some four letter words. But he's the leader because of his strength of character not his impeccable LDS theology. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader.In portraying the Cleggs Ford only had to reach back four years to his My Darling Clementine. They are the reincarnation of the Clanton gang and pure evil. In fact if Walter Brennan who after My Darling Clementine refused to ever work for Ford again was willing I could easily see him being cast as Shiloh Clegg the head of the family. As it was Charles Kemper did a fine job this is probably the role he's most noted for. Shortly after this film was done Kemper was killed in automobile crash. He might very well have worked for Ford in the future.Ford makes the Mormons pacifists here and I don't recall that pacifism was part of LDS doctrine. Nevertheless it works here the whole idea being that these people who carry no weapons are innocents when dealing with evil people like the Cleggs. It takes some gun toting cowboys to properly dispose of them. I think that this post World War II film is trying to say that pacifism isn't always the best policy. Another carryover from My Darling Clementine is Alan Mowbray playing the same kind of role he did there as head of the medicine show troupe. Part of that troupe is Joanne Dru who's doing another turn as a woman of elastic virtue the same as she did in Red River. Dru used to do so many westerns that she longed to be out of gingham and into some modern fashions.Wagonmaster is great entertainment and I'm willing to wager in the state of Utah it's a pretty popular film.".

John Ford's stock of character actors including Harry Carey Jr. Jane Darwell Russell Simpson and Hank Worden provide ample support as does eerily silent James Arness a member of the outlaw Clegg clan that joins up with the wagon train. The Mormon trail into Utah was one of the most arduous and demanding enterprises ever undertaken. We can't really get the feel of that but we do see ordeals that had to be overcome by pioneers on the way west river crossings long stretches of dry waterless desert encounters with Indians and the like all set to glorious song by the Sons of the Pioneers. The Mormons actually did dig sections of the trail with picks and shovels as depicted in the movie. My main regret is that it wasn't made in color but I believe there is a colorized version. By the way those craggy rocks featured in various scenes are called the Fisher Towers located near Moab. Highly recommended viewing.".

The outlaws are plain stereotypes painted very similar to the Clantons in 'My Darling Clementine' but the intense interactions between them and the traveling folk are worth watching for. Oddly enough the depth of the film does not lie in the happenings between them but rather in the singing and dancing featured. Song and dance is shown as a uniting force between very different cultures and the songs of the film are very well suited to the Old West atmosphere. The film is a mix of different things there is a typical predictable love interest awkward bits of humour and of course men slinging guns. Then there is the plot of outlaws against the good guys and the almost nonrelated deeper ideas about bonding between different people. The overall product is rather strange and certainly not one of John Ford's strongest efforts.

	schema:reviewBody "WAGON MASTER has been justly praised as one of director John Ford's most poetic films with its vivid evocation of a lost world of a wagon train traveling west in the late nineteenth century carrying a group of Mormons led by Elder Wiggs Ward Bond and guided by two horsetraders Ben Johnson Harry Carey jnr.In view of its releasedate 1950 however it is possible to see the film as a lament for a lost world of community where people of different interests learn to coexist with one another the horse traders set aside their buccaneering lifestyles and agree to guide the Mormons while the Mormons offer them their hospitality in return. The only possible threat to the survival of this community is Uncle Shiloh Clegg Charles Kemper who initially agrees to travel with them yet ends up holding the Mormons and the horse traders at gunpoint. Although pretending to be friendly it's clear he's not someone to be trusted. This notion was something very much on the public agenda in the early Fifties at the time of the anticommunist purges no one could be trusted anymore. WAGON MASTER makes much the same point and further suggests that those who appear to be the most friendly turn out to be the most dangerous.Ford emphasizes the importance of community not only through the screenplay but through the musical score by Richard Hageman and the songs which evoke a prelapsarian world in which people's first loyalty is to their God and their fellow human beings rather than themselves. Although leading a very precarious life subject to attack by various forces including questioning by an overzealous Marshal Cliff Lyons the train keeps resolutely to its chosen path and eventually reaches its own particular El Dorado. The implication is clear faith that inspires people to embrace the frontier myth and proceed westwards brings its own rewards.The film has a clutch of memorable performances ranging from Bond's comically splenetic Elder perpetually trying to stop himself from cursing to Jane Darwell's Sister Ledyard who is always willing to offer succor in the form of words andor food to anyone in trouble. Perhaps WAGON MASTER is not one of Ford's most celebrated films but it is nonetheless a little gem.".

The movie is not just great Hollywood filmmaking but an entertaining and occasionally moving ode to wagon trains and the pioneer spirit. The film is very loosely based on the 1879 San Juan Expedition also known as the HoleintheRock Expedition. This involved a group of Mormon settlers establishing a colony in southeastern Utah. In this story the trekkers are led by two stalwart young horse traders who know the country. They come across Navajos hillbillies and a snakeoil salesman with his lovely entourage.So there you have it Utah scenery wagon trains Mormons hillbillies Indians and lightning elixir. I don't know if the old west was really like this but Ford compels you to share his vision. The story character development writing casting acting dialogue and wagon riding were all superb. It doesn't get better than this.I can't explain it but this movie felt authentic and not clich. The corny old wagon train music was wonderful and evocative. At times it brought tears to my eyes. There are not a few moments in this film that can only be described as magical Sister Ledyard Navajo dancing damsels and tophatted hucksters traipsing through the desert horsemanship of the finest order and so on.This movie is like a time machine. Ford made this movie about 65 years ago. The expedition had occurred only 71 years before. He and his contemporaries were able to reimagine and show these events and characters in a way that would be less plausible today. We don't make movies like this anymore.A jarring aspect to modern eyes is that some of the Navajos were played by white people. That's the only thing that really dates this movie. It didn't ruin the film for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Western can be divided into many subgenres. One of the broadest divisions is that between Town Westerns and Plains Westerns. Most Westerns are a mix of both but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like High Noon and Rio Bravo that take place almost entirely in a settlement seldom venturing out into the real outdoors. At the other end you have ones like Wagon Master where there is barely a homestead on view amid the wilderness.Director John Ford normally thrived on the bit of both Westerns shooting the interiors with an emphasis on their being small and confined and then contrasting this with the wide open exteriors which appeared both exciting and dangerous. Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script with some interplay between seasoned oldsters and green youngsters but still it presents Ford with some fresh challenges. In this picture the dangers do not come from the harshness of the landscape they come from within the group in the form of the Cleggses. What's more the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over time.However Ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space. He shoots scenes of the camp or the wagons so the frame is surrounded and we get that same sense of enclosure as we would in a genuine interior. Also compared to his other Westerns he does not in fact open out the space too much having the wagon trail wend its way through canyons and passes rather than cross the stark and empty plains. One of the few moments where he does throw the landscape wide open is when the Indians are spotted and there is the possibility of a threat from outside.Wagon Master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief and some great contributions from the quirky cast. Harry Carey Jr. was shaping up into a fine actor like his pa and this is one of his better early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointing in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon but she appears more at ease as a character with a bit of sass and is actually fairly good here. Jane Darwell who won an Oscar in the John Forddirected Grapes of Wrath a decade earlier appears here with sole function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a feeble old horn. Still with her great timing and movement she makes the piece work. Francis Ford in one of the many mute drunkard roles he played in his little brother's pictures is at his cheeky best.And now we come to lead man Ben Johnson. Although he was by no means a bad actor he was never going to become a big star like John Wayne. And yet with his effortless horsemanship and easygoing drawl he was one of the most authentically West players around. And this brings me onto my final point. This was apparently one of Ford's personal favourites despite it seeming fairly unassuming. Wagon Master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity it is simply the genre playing itself out. I think this is what Ford loved about it. It's a picture for the Ben Johnsons and the Harry Carey Jrs not the John Waynes or the Henry Fondas. Small in scope but worthy in its class.".

Ford's minor masterpiece isn't much about storytelling it should be conceived more as a poem describing conceptions of old west.

It's a jewel a diamond a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the American West. A West not settled by grand heroes like Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp but by the spread of the everyday man and woman farmers and ranch hands merchants and miners and lumbermen whores and barkeeps and entertainers of the day some looking for riches some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom. It is perhaps a very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the nonMormon cowboys portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people. And in true biblical fashion like David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate Clegg clan likening them to the serpent in the Garden of Eden and regretting what it is they have to do afterward. It's a sweet folkloric tale of the West that hits every target John Ford takes aim at.Nowadays I have a western Santa Claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown Stetson who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope. To my Santa I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt revolver to tuck into his waistband. When people at the office ask why my Santa has to carry guns I simply reply Snakes! After all isn't the spirit of the Christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve? Fifty five years later especially post911 the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then.".

	schema:reviewBody "I never thought I'd be using a word like charming in connection with a Western. But the first half of Wagon Master strikes me as just that charming. The colorful characters and setups blend together in shrewdly affable fashion. Of course the opening hook features brief gunplay but that's just to let the audience know that the movie will include traditional bad guys. Actually there's much less gunplay than expected though the second half is more tension filled than the first. Still the eventual showdown is dedramatized in atypical fashion. To me Ben Johnson makes an excellent westerner. His regional accent is perfect. He may not be a John Wayne icon but neither does he compete with the story. After all the wagon train's success amounts to a collective effort and not that of a single heroic figure. Also Carey Jr. makes a good headstrong sidekick good for a chuckle or two. And yes that is a young naturally blond James Arness as one of the Cleggs even if without any dialog. Two things I really like about this Ford Western. The characters are colorful without becoming caricatures plus the fact that it's filmed in bw. Now Technicolor would bring out the awesome beauty of the Moab locations but also distract from the storyline. The bw photography here is excellent but has the important effect of bringing out the majesty of the surroundings without competing. It's a perfect setting for the movie's theme of a new land for a peaceable Mormon people. Note too how the Navajo are treated with respect and even acknowledged as victims of white men's thievery but without piling it on. Note too that except for the opening scene the entire movie was shot on location. A real outdoor Western.All in all Ford blends the many elements together beautifully. In my little book the result should be more celebrated among his canon than it is. I know it's my favorite among the many Ford Westerns I've seen.".

Tavernier in his comments about the film on the DVD talks about the change in the light in the late afternoon in west Africa. It becomes less intense so he uses pastel colors. Note the light blue walls and the pink shirt of Philippe Noiret who is superb as the village policeman Cordier. Isabelle Huppert who plays the mistress of Cordier with intensity and humor and the other actors make this a must see film.

The mere fact that he acts in function of his later deeds makes this film not a real time story but something of a far more mythological nature. He is destiny in a biblical sense of the word. The crimes he commits are what his victimes deserve. As in many European films they tell you not just the story but an Idea behind it. In my opinion he is some sort of a Jesus but with all to human deficits. He uses human means to act as a God in order to make us aware of our own deeds. Everyone he kills think they can get away with their sins. His deeds are revolting but that is the whole point he is us used by the director who holds nothing but a mirror in front of human nature. The lack of his morality is a nothing else than a clue for Taverniers view on humanity. Typically a great film that should be viewed more than once!".

The West African setting is only proper in that aspect like the setting of the Jim Thompson book it's a doomed dusty limbo blotted out of the map where in the absence of palpable law or ethos humans are allowed to be the lowest they can be. Elsewhere the world is perhaps striving to maintain a moral appearance but not so in Bourkassa no one is looking there. Thompson had a dark view of humanity for his own reasons and for his protagonists his crazed sheriffs and murderous sociopaths he seems to reserve a last word that justifies their existence.It's a really funny film as a comedy it works marvels and I like how Tavernier shifts the tone light to dark goofy to perverse.But what about Codier the policeman of the small African town at the edge of the desert? Another reviewer reads in him a deranged figure of destiny that smites down people who deserve it a vengeful Jesus placed on this earth not to save souls but to release them. But even though his folly is obvious the lack of retribution for his acts the lack of a destiny to smite him is it omission or statement? In an amoral universe that defies order Codier is perhaps trying to maintain a perverse moral ground or he's only serving his own bastard self pushing his luck to see how far it will get him. If the film was a thriller it might have not worked but I saw an absurd comedy foremost and the laughter of that amoral universe is also echoed in Codier himself.When he goes on on his little soliloquis on existence Tavernier reaches for a solemn tone that seems strange at first but at least we can understand that this murderous buffoon is no better than anyone else around him. He's likable because he suffers indignity with the nonchalance of a Mr. Hulot but the next day he'll wake up a coward killer and scumbag. This contrast and his own belief in the incorrigible of his actions makes the movie work.Perhaps he's so successful at being a scumbag because the rest of the world permits it. If everyone else around him is either a moron or a scumbag why should he strive to be any better? As a human being he's pathetic but as a movie character I find him fascinating to watch. The fatalism that everyone gets what he deserves and there's no escaping the cogs of fate is the icing here.".

	schema:reviewBody "After reading some of the reviews on here I felt compelled to write one myself simply because it seems most of the people who reviewed this film did not read the book it was based on POP 1280 by Jim Thompson. Some found it astonishing that one would actually seek out this book in the first place including the director but I happen to be a Jim Thompson junkie and I would say POP 1280 stands as his best work in the psycholawman subgenre that he singlehandedly created. It's far superior to the Killer Inside Me although many would disagree with that. Long ago when I found out there was an actual film based on this book I had to find it and see it. Luckily it was at my local blockbuster and I rushed home to view this take on one of my favorite Thompson books. I have to say it was a bit offputting to see the whole story transposed to Senegal. However as the film played I realized that this was actually quite a brilliant move by Bernard. Aside from the location and French actors everything else is mostly retained from the book in terms of the dark humor and overthetop situations. The acting is superb and the cinematography is just gritty enough to give it the feel it needs. This is one of the best Thompson adaptations and I highly recommend it especially if you have read the novel. I also recommend seeking out SerieNoire which is the French adaptation of A Hell of A Woman. It's not as good as this one but it's still excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lucien Cordier is not like most cops. He's a main chief in a West African village where white people are the minority though in 1938 are as racist and sexist as can be. He's also not a very good cop as he barely ever arrests anyone and his authority can be challenged pretty quickly even by two scummy pimps. He's like the pushover kid in a playground who may be a nice guy but he's also not quite strong enough to actually attain the authority needed to stand up against the bullies. That is until Lucien decides to fight back in a manner that is at a calm extreme an oxymoron perhaps but watching Lucien is an oxymoron in human form but a fascinating one. He'll kill someone anyone he thinks of as an enemy to him shooting a man in the back the pimps or even the man who helps him dig a grave. He calmly explains some of the whys but he never goes too ballistic. Lucien is a man of principles but to say exactly what or why is a mystery.This is what makes Coup de tochon or Clean Slate based on the Jim Thompson novel Pop 1280 mentioned in passing as Pop. 1275 for no good reason at one point in the film is about this man who is warm lustful proud and perhaps a not entirely bright but not stupid either. And as played by Philippe Noiret he makes this film compulsively watchable. The supporting cast such as Isabelle Hupert and JeanPierre Marielle don't fare too badly either but it's Noiret that elevates this to something more than director Bertrand Tavernier could have expected. He gives a performance that is intense without ever being over the top and thoughtful while seemingly aloof in some points. He makes Lucien a guy we might like to know or talk to for a little while until we see the veneer peel away a fragile man who has been pushed around by his bosses and his wife Stephan Audran and in a position with such little power that the only way to bust loose is senseless killing. As he says Would a man with these eyes be a killer? Tavernier's direction is lax and smooth jagged with some documentary style and realism it was shot all on location and it looks it always but there's also a distance I felt to many of the scenes a deliberate attempt to strip down filmnoir elements to light absurdism mixed with sardonic tragedy. There are some great moments don't get me wrong the scene with the film screened for the village people at night that gets ruined by a windstorm as the audio keeps playing on with the film cut off and people scrambling for cover the first killing scene of the pimps where Lucien becomes a larger threat with every passing second leading up to a predictable but still shocking climax an ending which I won't mention here. It has such moments but I wasn't very moved by Coup de torchon throughout and it's not directed with the surest hand. And yet I have to give it to Philippe Noiret in any other film noir he'd be out of place and yet here he's perfect.".

After suffering the indignities of a natural born doormat all his life he strikes back with a vengeance slowly descending into a rational madness that commands sympathy while simultaneously provoking moral outrage at one point he callously murders the innocent native servant who mistakenly witnessed on of his killings.

	schema:reviewBody "Lucien Philippe Noiret our thickset protagonist is a bit of a beguiling figure. On the surface he possesses all the traits of a villain or the very least a very unlikeable humanbeing. He's lazy and selfish he carries on a lustful affair with a married and abused woman Isabelle Huppert and sees his position a provincial sheriff as an inconvenience not even bothering to arrest people who knowingly break serious laws. Furthermore he's utterly weakwilled henpecked by his wife Stephane Audran and her peculiar brother Eddy Mitchell and harassed by his superiors in the provincial capital. What's worse a ballsy pimp who enjoys shooting cadavers in the local river decides humiliation is better than bribery as a means to getting what he wants. Something in Lucien finally snaps and he uses his only two advantages to rid the world of his problems his intelligence and his remote location.Coup de Torchon 1981 takes place at the edge of civilization on the outskirts of a French African colony mere months before WWII. Barely accessible by train Lucien's small colorful town is a cesspool of disease decay and crime to which Alex turns from idle bystander to perverted exterminating angel. Yet it is the way he pulls off his various revenges that is at once beguiling and disturbing. Every situation is precalculated and seemingly natural. Lucien never loses his sincerity or blows his cover which makes everything he does absolutely shocking. One minute he's shooting a man in the stomach the next he's genteel with his mistress.At one point Lucien remarks that he is the devil incarnate which while giving him a bit too much credit nevertheless plays into the themes of good and evil in the film. The story is bookended by a scene where Lucien is acting as a Prometheuslike figure to a group of African children then by another where he aims his shotgun at one of the same children as a boy stares at him blankly. As morality and civilization crumbles throughout the film the often felt but never seen rise of Nazism promises to obfuscate the sins of the reckless sheriff. Finally there's the character of the new school teacher Irene Skobline who exemplifies all that is good and innocent. At the end of the film when war is finally declared Lucien dances with her as if she were the spoils of his hedonistic one man war.As despicable as his actions are however Lucien remains a charming central figure. Like Shakespeare's Iago his mischievousness is hidden by an innocuous face and harmless goodnatured wit. Unlike in Bad Lieutenant 1997 this cop doesn't let the audience sit on the sidelines and say there but by the grace of God go I. Coup de Torchon seduces you into indulging in Lucien's Machiavellian plans and for an instant lets you have sympathy for the devil.httpwww.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

I have not read the Thompson novel from which it was drawn but transplanting a story from the American South to crumbling colonial West Africa alone is inspired.If the film is a comedy then it did not work me. The melding of slapstick with social commentary ran thin for me but again it could just be that I lack le bone funny. At least I recognized parts here that likely were intended to be ribald as opposed to some Japanese humor where I'm often completely lost.Perhaps it is not that the humor is stupid although the recurring dimwit incest interlude and the outhouse surprise...surely push it but that the characters are stupid. That being said the lead character it is of course crucial that you see him as a bozo of sorts but behind his broad caricature of indolence is there some intuition or even initiative stashed away? Again an ambitious choice to have an apparent laggard as your lead character. He's seen as perpetually exhausted and at the same time amazingly lazy. An inept if not corrupt sheriff but potentially very fairminded. A slothful yet irresistible sex machine? That character alone was worth the watch for me especially a couple of more serious discussions he has.But ultimately what does the film do? Take us from the joys of a meaningless existence to the tragedy of a meaningless existence. The directors sets up some of the early kills as somewhat justified only to move through less and less necessary slaughter ending abruptly with the image of innocence being as wantonly wasted? And that image is meant to tie back visually to the films start as if to imply this is just the way of the world. A cycle of violence.Does this excuse our potbellied peculiar policeman? Do his messianic delusions even make sense as he plots to seduce the pure schoolteacher? And do the three women intentionally seem to similar as if they are plots along the same curve and that curve is a circle.I don't know and regrettably I did not care as much as I should have. Perhaps the clumsiness of the film that might pass as charm for other viewers? Perhaps the predictable randiness that even a few decades ago felt like a use of sex as cheap titillation.Is it just a parable of despair? Is it just a jokey eulogy for the colonial ways saying adieu to its greed stupidity and savagery? I don't know that's why it gets a 510 for me... I do know that it makes me want to read the Thompson novel to see what inspired Tavernier to take on this.See what you think but if you think I'm too harsh on the stupidity of the film I hope you get the DVD that offers the proposed alternate ending with two monkeys... Ugh...that would have got a 310.".

And are they turned indeed... Once started to kill our hero has to keep it up trying to cover his tracks and the only thing you are left to wonder is whether he can pull it off and cover everything up.";

	schema:reviewBody "I adored the first half hour or so of this film. Then sadly the film seemed to lose its waymostly because the main character was practically impossible to understand or appreciate. To put it bluntly his motivation and actions stopped making sense. BUT as there are so many interesting elements to the film it's still worth seeing...though it clearly misses the mark.The film follows the actions of an ineffectual policeman in French West Africa just before the Second World War. Lucien Philippe Noiret does nothing as sheriff but collect a paycheck and ignore crime. He is clearly a cuckold in regard to his job and his relationships. Crooks break laws and mock him and his wife openly carries on an affair with her 'brother' right in front of him. You really feel bad for the guy so when out of the blue he begins paying these people back you are thrilledeven when he begins in some cases killing people. The murder victims really do 'have it coming' and you want to see Lucien to get away with it.Later however the film gets pretty muddled. First he ends up killing an innocent guy simply because he knew too muchand it was hard to feel sympathy for Lucienparticularly because before this you did like him a lot because he DID stand up for the black nativesthough not obviously so. So he went from a secret savior of the Africans to just another white ! and nothing more. Second there were some allegorical religious elements that seemed incongruous. He began to see himself as like Jesus meting out retribution to evildoersbut ended up looking more like Satan or the Angel of Deathor just a real jerk! This religious angle really just clouds the filmnot enhances it. Third I was a psychotherapist and psychology teacher and I STILL had a hard time understanding Lucienhis character though interesting made little sense and just confused me. With a bit of a rewrite this could have gone from a good and thoughtprovoking film to a classic. Too badit did sure excite my interest.".

The film ends when it ends.I saw a 16mm print which did little for what I suspected was nice crisp location photography but it was clear enough Tavernier was trying with success to make the remote and somewhat neglected African village look like a bare stage which along with the hints of pervasive colonial corruption was necessary to allow such a piece of conceptual art as Doormat Goes Nutzoid to come to life.

	schema:headline " pretty good movie with amazing music";
	schema:reviewBody "I happen to like this film... apparently quite a bit more than most people. I even still have a copy of it on VHS somewhere. First and foremost is the music. Absolutely INCREDIBLE old time jazz. The best scene to me is clearly the 'battle' between the sax players at the club. The music in the club throughout the movie and the background score during the nonclub scenes is about as good as it gets. And I'm not really a huge jazz guy though I have always liked the Miles Davis  John Coltrane type stuff. This is my favorite non  Angelo Badalamente sp?film score. Seriously see this flick just for the music alone. And see it for Miranda Richardson who is AWESOME in this movie. I think she really steals the show in this one. J. Jason Leigh is solid and plays the part of a not too bright not very successful midwest girl decently. Also Harry Belafonte is great as Seldom Seen and he just looks and sounds the part so well. Steve Buscemi Dermot Mulroney and the woman who plays J. Jason Leigh's sister are all quite good in supporting roles and Michael Murphy is perfect for the part of the slightly confused yet somewhat powerful husband to the kidnapped Richardson character.The clothes cars and look of the film is nicely done cmon it IS an Altman picture!!! and really does make you feel as if you are in Missouri circa 19351940. Add to that a slightly twisted ending and you have a really good and def. underrated film that I really want to see again... on DVD this time to REALLY crank up the music scenes. I give Kansas City 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Bottom line whether you love or hate Kansas City will depend on your reaction to Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance. Leigh's character Blondie anchors the story as a desperate wife trying to save her husband from the gangsters he tried to rob. Leigh looks great in this role she is fit and trim which makes her face cuter and her character more fragile looking. The contrast between her almost angelic appearance and her tough persona is intentional because the toughness is an affectation qualities she has adopted because she loves her husband and they are a turnon for him. Her's is the key performance of the film the twist is her emulation of Kansas City native Jean Harlow The Public Enemy and Girl from Missoui. Watch Harlow in Red Headed Woman and you will see the incredible physical resemblance between the two actresses. Personally I found it both touching and humorous her character worthy of the brave heroine hall of fame. But it is almost a caricature and some viewer will be put off by this tiny woman talking so tough.As in Nashville there are great songs but jazz rather than country throughout the film. It is important to realize that Blondie's behavior is intended to mirror the cutting contests between the jazz musicians onstage at the club. Just as the musicians borrow from one another and weave each others stuff into what they are improvising Blondie borrows from the movies and weaves Harlow's tough girl phrases and expressions into her conversation.Leigh and Miranda Richardson spend most of the film in each other's company. Although Richardson's character is doped up on laudanum tincture of opium most of the time you get the idea that she is taking in a lot more of the situation than she is letting on. There is almost a Thelma and Louise quality to their relationship in part because Leigh doing Harlow ends up sounding a lot like Geena Davis doing Geena Davis. The two women are polar opposites in the way they react to the desperation in their lives one has lost all restraint the other has lost everything but restraint.Richardson's character is unexpectedly touching. An emotional bond is subtly forged between the two women as the film proceeds with Richarson gradually becoming totally protective of her kidnapper. The ending is shocking but you understand the motivation then looking back you pick up on the various foreshadowing devices that Altman placed throughout the film. He goes out with a bass duet of Duke Ellington's Solitude performed by Ron Carter and Christian McBride.Like many films with downbeat endings Kansas City is destined to be more appreciated 25 years after its release.".

	schema:reviewBody "You know what I didn't do today? I didn't vote.  Carolyn StiltonI absolutely hated Kansas City upon first viewing. Its pace seemed strange its flashbacks seemed oddly placed its camera seemed to dwell on unimportant details and none of its characters seemed to exist to propel any clearly defined story forward. In other words though I'd seen virtually every other Robert Altman film Kansas City still left me in a state of bewilderment.But as is often the case with Altman Kansas City began to make sense  in so far as Altman desires to make sense his films seem to embrace a certain chaos  upon second viewing. Filled with loving shots of jazz musicians the film is itself a jazzy tone poem Altman coming at the audience from odd angles asking us to pick up on his shifting rhythms of plot and character themes of race politics violence and money. Consider the subtle juxtapositions Altman weaves into the film...A poor white man Johnny O'Hara paints his face black and robs a wealthy black man. Seeking assistance the black man visits a powerful black crime boss called Seldom Seen. Seldom agrees to help kidnaps Johnny and kills him.In contrast Johnny's wife Blondie O'Hara kidnaps a wealthy white woman Carolyn Stilton while she applies a white beauty mask. Carolyn is married to Henry Stilton a powerful politician. Blondie wants Henry to negotiate with the crime lord so that she may get her husband back. Blondie is eventually killed by Carolyn Stilton. While this drama is unfolding other characters enter the mix. A young Charlie Parker years away from musical fame finds a pregnant black girl. He takes her to a maternity ward. Meanwhile we learn that Blondie had her baby aborted because Johnny didn't want kids.Similarly a poor black cab driver who helped Johnny stage his robbery is taken to a back alleyway and killed by Seldom and his gang. In contrast Henry Stilton's goons kill a white man in broad daylight because he was hampering their efforts to falsify local election ballots.And so on and on it goes Altman juxtaposing his jazz notes Kansas City less a linear narrative than a series of contrasting sequences or oppositional musical riffs some obvious some subtle but all revolving around class race and gender. Blackface paint is mirrored to white beauty cream black crime lords are mirrored to corrupt white politicians political thugs are mirrored to violent gangsters abortions are mirrored to pregnancies loving marriages are mirrored to loveless couples poverty is mirrored to power underground gambling joints and brothels are mirrored to above ground poll booths and ballot stations.Blondie O'Hara the young kidnapper is herself contrasted with Carolyn Stilton the woman she kidnaps. Blondie loves her husband and would do anything for him. Mrs Stilton in contrast is constantly doped up on opium and has long given up on her marriage. Furthermore Blondie is constantly emulating Kansas City native Jean Harlow an actress whom she idolises. This notion of narrative emulation is itself intended to mirror the cutting contests between the jazz musicians sprinkled throughout the film. Just as the musicians borrow from one another and weave each other's material into what they are improvising Blondie borrows from the movies and weaves Harlow's tough girl phrases and expressions into her conversation. But Blondie's toughness is all a facade a suit of armour used to compensate for her petite size and coarse environment. While Blondie gives up her child and is constantly subservient to her husband it is Carolyn Stilton who possesses true strength. Despite her permanently doped up state Carolyn constantly gives the impression that she knows more than she's letting on always absorbing information and assessing her surroundings. Her final line I didn't vote itself lets us know that she has long cut herself off from a venal world which she refuses to legitimize.And so with Kansas City  a film which ends with a crime lord counting money in the dark corners of a jazz club  Altman has abstracted the politics of power and persuasion threat and privilege. Everything in the film hinges on social power Altman drawing a clean line between those violent people who wield power and all those pathetic dreamers who try to grab it but never succeed in doing so for more than a fleeting moment.The political corruption of the city's democratic machine the country was built on voting fraud and rigged elections practises common even today and the expanding influence of Hollywood and the power of film to seduce and destroy people such as Blondie is as important to Altman as the racial segregation that produces Kansas City's two worlds the white world dominated by the Stilton's and the inverted black world of Seldom Seen a vampiric world of music which seems to only come to life long after the surface world has gone to sleep.The film is also unique in the way it offers jazz music an unprecedented role within the diegetic world. This music is constantly seeping into he story providing a kind of tapestry for the characters to perform against. The result is that the jazz music seems to become intertwined with the very social climate that influences it. Altman himself has said that it was his intention that jazz be the structure of the entire film. Whilst a typical song lasts 3 minutes a jazz tune lasts as much as 17 the effect being that many of the film's scenes are elongated and purposefully stretched out. Seldom Seen is like a brass instrument Altman says when it's his turn to solo he does long monologues and riffs. But the discussions of the two women are like reed instruments saxophones having duets.810  Best appreciated as a kind of cinematic jazz the plot lethargically frustrating as it intrigues.".

	schema:reviewBody "The music is superb. The movie is soso. The period sets are perfect and its just like being back in KC during the infamous Pendergast era. Altman made this movie as a paean to his hometown and the music that came out of it. One cannot divorce the music from the movie. Either you are a jazz fan or you're not. If you're not you won't like this movie. Its that simple. If you are you are really in for a treat. The film features all of the new stars in jazz from the mid90's James Carter and Craig Handy on saxes Mark Whitfield on guitar Geri Allen and Cyrus Chestnut on piano....the list goes on and on. They all play the legends of jazz that came out of Kansas Citypeople like Count Basie Joe Williams Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins. A veritable treat for the intheknow jazz fan but probably a bore for anyone else. Altman stays on the music longer than most directors would because this is a film about the music as much as it is about the plot. And here's the real irony. Movie buffs will say they wished Altman wouldn't have devoted so much time to the music and jazz buffs will say they wished Altman would have done away with the ridiculous annoying plot and grating performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh and focused entirely on the music. How to please everyone? The end result is uneven but there's enough here to keep all parties interested.If any actor should be singled out it should be Harry Belafonte. His turn as the underworld kingpin Seldom Seen is fantastic. He speaks in a low gruff rasp but his dialogue is truly worth the effort to understand. When he goes off on the Marcus Garvey speech its worth the price of admission. Of course it helps to know who Marcus Garvey was. Jazz fans and reggae fans too will get it. After all this is a movie for themus.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am an unabashed admirer of the personal in film. I suppose cinematic personality can be expressed in a variety of ways but I value it most when its from a filmmaker and it affects the cinematic vocabulary. I like Altman. Yes I like certain films of his these stand on their own outside of the long term dialog I've had with him.But I like the dialog as well that long languid experience of punctuated experiments in his worlds and then mine.What he does where his core experiments are rooted is in the rhythm of how he puts his films together. Its unlike anything else that could be considered competently relevant in film. His interest is in the notion of discovered pace.To understand why this is so weird and sometimes so unsettling you have to understand that there are very strict conventions in the business about what viewers will accept in terms of the pace arc and rhythm of a film. Editors and filmmakers learn these conventions either through understanding the theory through intuition or experience depending on their approach. Its very very narrow what these allow.Regular readers of my comment know I believe that TeeVee is one of the worst evils we face. It is because it forces this vocabulary to be ever more narrow constriction the visual imagination of a whole planet.Altman is a sort of Moses in this environment trying every escape he can imagine. He tries to let actors surprise the camaraman and editor. He tries strange overlaps in scenes. He tries all sorts of parallel narratives. He particularly likes to juggle several layers of the narrative at once with contradictory even warring cadences.Here what he does is work with three rhythms. The first is the obvious one jazz and particularly the style originating in Kansas City.The style can be directly attributable to the type of political corruption that dominated the town extreme even when compared to Chicago and St Louis. The corruption is based on a sort of lie that pretends to be the truth but is bent. You can see it here in the voting. In Chicago at this time there would be no pretense dead people's ballots would simply appear in the ballot box without the show of hiring bodies to cast them. Blacks would simply be ignored at best without the church performing nominal help and then lynching. This churchinfluenced neartruth politics still dominates the town even famously to the court system. You do not want a trial in Kansas City.So we have the jazz playing and influencing the action while political power and helping a 14 year old pregnant black girl are suspended. Its a particular trading of phrases that if you listen you can see reflected in the structure particularly the twisted flashforwards of the narrative arrangement.Then you have the characters of the two women each with their own worldrhythms. The character played by Jason Leigh is typical of what she can do personalitywise. Here it actually matters because of the way she pushes the future with the way she shapes words with an aggressive mouth. There's much to say here in the story about how this is folded into a similar characterinduced pacing devised by Jean Harlow who Leigh's character emulates. Harlow was in fact from Kansas City and her style was selfconsciously KC jazz influenced.The other character is played by Miranda Richardson who unlike her sister had at the time a reputation for stiff English types. Here she plays something like that one of those third generation frontier types with corn aristocracy now turned vapid from drugs. Its a pretty layered performance every big as complex as Leigh's. She also has a sort of nonlinear time based on rewriting and scrambling.Its an amazing construction a thrilling experiment. By design it lacks the sort of pace you come to expect. That's the point. Anyone who complains that it doesn't do well pacewise just doesn't get it and if they were in the movie would be disemboweled and then shot by a bullet through your girlfriend.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

She kidnaps the laudnum addicted wife Miranda Richardson of a Roosevelt political adviser Michael Murphy in an effort to somehow get enough leverage to achieve her goal. The Kansas City of the Depression setting looks pretty real and wide open not only for crime but also political fraud. Robert Altman made a great character for Steve Buscemi as a brutal political operative who's assigned to get out the vote by any and all means possible including the use of baseball bats but he failed to give him enough space. Nonetheless he's just another part of this mosaic of the period and does well enough with the meager scenes he has. Jennifer Jason Leigh is at the film's center while social political and economic forces swirl around her. She affects a Jean Harlow persona throughout the film and in one scene is actually in a theater watching a Jean Harlow film. The tough girl act conceals her real life existence as yet another victim of the Great Depression of the 1930's. By the end of the film she appears on screen with her hair dyed platinum blond and in an all white evening gown actually becoming the famous actress who died so young. While the film meanders around going into and out of crooked politics race teen pregnancy drugs etc...and in and out of the HeyHey Club with the ongoing birth of blues and bebop the ending that punctuates the kernel of a plot is quite an exclamation point and is well worth the wait.".

	schema:reviewBody "A kidnapping and a robbery move the plot forward in a film that's less about plot than about cultural ambiance. Kansas City is mostly a cinematic expression of place and time. It's 1934 when gangsters and jazz ruled and Blacks and Whites went their separate ways.Visuals are very dark. And though the film is in color tints are muted which conveys a nostalgic sentimental mood. The thin plot takes place largely at night. And the plot alternates with dark interior scenes at the Hey Hey Club a risqu allBlack speakeasy where an allBlack band jives freeform jazz and where illegal gambling fills the back rooms.None of the characters are sympathetic. But I don't think they're supposed to be. They're archetypes models of desperate people in desperate times. A gunwielding gangster's girl named Blondie Jennifer Jason Leigh wants to be like Jean Harlow. Mrs. Stilton Miranda Richardson is a wealthy spacedout politician's wife. Seldom Seen based on a reallife person and played by Harry Belafonte is the cigar smoking godfather who rules the dark smoky Hey Hey Club with an iron fist and who likes to stand around giving lectures to people.The script's dialogue is mostly subtext with message directed less at other characters than at viewers. And as in other Altman films thencurrent politics dance around the edges of the seedy story. The overall tone mixes depression with desperation.For me this is an easy film to judge. The characters and plot I cared for not at all. Jennifer Jason Leigh was painful to watch. And though the jazz is performed with great competence its freeform improvisational style is too contemporary to reflect the 1930s. On the other hand Miranda Richardson gives a fine performance. Attention to detail in costumes sets props and storefront exteriors make the film come alive with era realism. And lighting is absolutely terrific.If you go into this movie expecting a deep story and wellconstructed plot you'll be disappointed. Absorb the overall texture of the film's visuals. Kansas City is a terrific visual portrait of a specific place at a specific time.".

I heard an interview with Altman before I saw the film and it really helped me understand what was going on. Essentially the whole thing is structured like a tune. There's an exposition of 2 separate themes the LeighRichardson story and the Hey Hey Club those themes are expanded developed torn up put back together and finally combined. The plot of LeighRichardson's story is secondary to the music. Heck the plot of Seldom Seen's story is secondary to the music. The performances are pretty good even if they aren't all really true to the Kansas City stylebut check out Indiana for as close to the real thing as you'll hear anywhere outside of a Benny Moten collection. For pure musical heaven the closing credits with Solitude Ellington is done with so much taste by Christian McBride and Ron Carter. Pure magic especially on first viewing in a theater.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not convinced that this film is not more wellrespected just because director Robert Altman's name is attached. Show Kansas City to your average casual filmviewer without letting them know who directed or you can even let them know if they're not cineastes and do not know Altman and I think the average opinion would be much lower. That's not to say there are no positive qualities to the film but it is far more burdened with flaws and it's more likely to ultimately annoy rather than entertain.The story is of course set in Kansas City during the depression. Blondie O'Hara Jennifer Jason Leigh enters the home of socialite Carolyn Stilton Miranda Richardson under false pretenses she says she's there to give Mrs. Stilton her normal manicure and ends up pulling a gun on her. Mrs. Stilton figures it's just your runofthemill robbery but O'Hara wants something else. O'Hara's husband Johnny Dermot Mulroney has gotten himself into trouble and Mrs. Stilton's influential husband Henry Michael Murphy an adviser to President Roosevelt can help him out.Let me mention the positive aspects of the film first because otherwise I'll likely run out of room. The primary asset is the film's music. Because of the setting including that a lot of the film takes place in a black jazz joint the Hey Hey Club the music is jazz during its transitional phase between swing and early bopheck even a young Charlie Parker Albert J. Burnes is in the film although the setting has Parker too young to be shown performing and Parker turns out to be irrelevant to the film. But it does have musicians playing Lester Young Coleman Hawkins and Count Basie and the musicians who perform throughout the film read like all allstar roster of contemporary jazzers including David Murray Joshua Redman David Fathead Newman Ron Carter Christian McBride Geri Allen and Victor Lewis. The music is excellent if you're a jazz fan as Altman must be.The other asset is that production designer Stephen Altman the director's son does an excellent job getting the period setting right. Especially if you're into classic cars of the era the film will be a treat to watch but all of the details seem right. The cinematography isn't bad either.However even as good as the music is it just doesn't work within the context of the film. Most of the musicians can't act but try to. Maybe it's that they weren't directed very well by Altman. He features them on camera too much and even lingers on them for relatively long songs. A concert film featuring the band would have been great. In the middle of a dramatic film these shots just feel like padding with bad acting.The story itself although relatively simpletoo simple perhaps is chopped up and told as if it's going to have some big revelation or twist. Altman keeps unnecessarily jumping back and forth in timebut just a few hours and he keeps unnecessarily jumping back and forth between different sets of characters in the middle of very long scenes. I guess he realized the scenes were too long and needed to be broken up. The scenes should have been cut back instead. More should have happened. Far too often scenes feel like they're stretched out with pointless dialogue just to increase the film's running time.And the dialogue isn't just pointless. It's loaded with nonsequiturs. I've never experienced laudanum or known anyone who has but one of the characters shown as a laudanum user regularly speaks gibberish. At least that seems to be the excuse for it. It turns out that everyone in the film routinely speaks gibberish as if they're on some kind of heavy drugs. Not every line is like that but enough are that it's relatively inexplicable. The plot in general has a lot of nonsequiturs. It seems almost as if Altman who cowrote the script with Frank Barhydt was shooting for some kind of bizarre surrealism except that surrealism seems so out of context for the setting and basic gist of the film and it's too understated to seem intentional. I just don't get why people in the film would speak and behave so oddly.Then there are the performances. I've liked Jennifer Jason Leigh in some filmsI absolutely love eXistenZ 1999 for example and she certainly can act like someone other than herself which a lot of people seem to use as one of the main criteria for good acting but her character here is so annoying that I couldn't wait for the film to be over. She bizarrely barks out her dialogue in a grating accent. When I thought of it upon waking up this morning with my review gelling in my head I usually watch films at night then think about them while I head off to sleepreviews often pop up almost fully formed when I awake I burst out laughing remembering the character. It's something I'd more expect from an alien sketch on a show like MadTV or Saturday Night Live. Imagine Prymatt Conehead with a sour and somewhat hyper Brooklyn attitude.Harry Belafonte as the ridiculously named Seldom Seen also tended to be annoyingand he probably has more lines than anyone else but Leigh. A number of other characters were primarily annoying too. The only one I really didn't mind was Miranda Richardson despite the gibberish and she's also gorgeous so she's a treat to watch.There are a couple good sequences but they tended to be those focused on actionwhen characters were up and about doing something rather than sitting in a room and talking and the climax was great I even cheered. Unfortunately those sequences were few and far between. The majority of the film just seems flat and drawn out. My advice is to just buy the soundtrack avoid the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Altman perhaps one of the most innovative directors working in Hollywood pays homage to his home town Kansas City. Mr. Altman recreates a long gone era that he probably didn't know that well being only a child at the time the action takes place. It seems as though the allure of the period made a vivid mark in the director's mind as he takes us with this film for a long over due visit. Make no mistake this is not another Nashville quite the contrary. The only similarity is the title that reflects a city name. As written by the director and Frank Barhydt the film succeeds in creating the atmosphere but as far as the story line goes it has the quality to disorient even the most avid of Mr. Altman's fans.What Kansas City lacks in story line it makes up with the glorious music that serves as compensation with the thinness of the material one sees on the screen. The music is the best excuse to watch the movie that showcases an excellent group of musicians playing heavenly in between the action.Mr. Altman's choice of Jennifer Jason Leigh as Blondie is probably what's wrong with the film. This actress mumbles her lines plays Blondie as strident woman and manages to derail the film. On the other hand Miranda Richardson's Carolyn Stilton gives her one of the best roles in her career. Ms. Richardson appears to be on a cloud most of the time because of her opium addiction. She makes us care for her portrayal of this society woman that needs all the help she can get. Having it all she can't cope with being married to a cold man that couldn't care less about her. Where other lonely wives resort to drinking Mrs. Stilton gets away from it all with drugs.Harry Belafonte plays the local gangster in charge of illegal gambling that evidently was prevalent in the city. His Seldom Seen character is at times inaudible by the way he throws his lines. Sometimes we have to strain our ears in order to hear what he is saying. Mr. Belafonte is a fine actor. As far as Dermot Mulroney and Steve Buscemi are concerned they have not much to play in the movie to make us care for them. The supporting roles are good.In spite of this movie not being one of Robert Altman's best it presents a fine opportunity to absorb the atmosphere and the music of the era oh and all that jazz!".

	schema:reviewBody "After a new born to a new audience with excellent The Player and Short Cuts and slip down with the weird and unfunny PrtPorter the master of the independent cinema Robert Altman gets back with a minor but interesting work in Kansas City. Here he reveals the dangerous Kansas City of the 1930's with their corrupt politicians scary mobsters and people involved with all this world without noticing the danger right ahead.In the 1930's the young and beautiful Blondie Jennifer Jason Leigh kidnaps Carolyn Miranda Richardson the wife of a powerful politician Michael Murphy who can help her to save her boyfriend Johnny Dermot Mulroney a little burglar who stole an important big shot in the crime world and now he's going to be killed by another powerful mob figure the gangster Seldom Seen Harry Belafonte. The frightened Carolyn is dragged away along with Blondie to several places in town trying to get along with each other which doesn't work quite well because of their different backgrounds. Blondie is addicted to the films of Jean Harlow and she keeps annoying her hostage all the way while Carolyn is an addicted to opium that barely gets out of the house suffering with her addiction. In the meantime the politician keeps dealing with the case in a very discreet way to not ruin his future election that its getting ahead and because of his proximity with President Roosevelt. On the other part of town Johnny has the chance to know more about what the real world of crime really is listening to Seldom's menacing stories and to lots of jazz that is played in his captivity. Besides these two kidnaps there's a subplot concerning a girl who came to town to get an abortion and a political scandal involving a party which is buying votes to win the election using of deadly tactics. The same team of writers who signed Short Cuts tries to unite several characters that follow the same path in several situations having as link the jazz as musical background played in almost every scene. As I said they tried to unite them but they end up confusing the public by dividing two situations apparently disconnected that will meet in the end and until it get to the final result you keep wondering what's the reason for both kidnaps. When the two parts get together it all makes sense but before some answers appear many will have walked away of the movie because everything is slow almost tedious. The perfect Short Cuts which tells the story of 23 characters crossing the way of each other in a chaotic Los Angeles in a excellent tragicomedy of the real life gets way better than Kansas City with their 6 main characters. On the other hand this confusion in dividing the film in two situations makes a intriguing film that makes the audience wants to know of what happens next.As favorable points Kansas City has a great period reconstitution the costumes of the 1930's the old cars the music Altman worked the same musicians who appeared in his documentary Jazz 34 and a great performance by Harry Belafonte as the talking gangster who has an answer to everything. Michael Murphy surprises a lot in his short moments in which he appears the other performances are not so interesting sometimes they are very annoying and that is the case of the main pair. Jennifer Jason Leigh's voice is tiring and very debauched for a dramatic film Miranda Richardson has a very aloof character a role that she would dominate better in the great Falling Angels.Robert Altman made a good job despite not being too much impressive as his previous works. 810".

It may SOUND like a good idea  Altman sure thinks it does he uses it to make most of his movies  but this is no excuse for offering us a muddled terribly acted halfbaked film that essentially has about three scenes that are stretched out. The plot of this is one of the worst you're likely to see. I remember at the time i was watching it i felt there were such major problems with the motivations within the story that completely undid its narrative structure. It pains me enough to recollect the movie let alone think of it in that much detail.What Altman doesn't seem to realise is that improvisation seems to make most actors nervous. When they're saying a line they know they've made up during rehersals they seem not to believe in it. It may have worked for Brando in Last Tango in Paris  but Brando was a titan. These actors and most name actors Altman shows the true colours of are not.The first major mistake was giving Harry Belafonte improvisation priveleges. God is he obnoxious in this. He's the bad guy but he's not obnoxious in a way that makes you think oh isn't he good or maybe isn't this fun. You just think Belafonte is an arrogant guy.JasonLeigh's accent and acting are particularly hammy. Miranda Richardson is the only one who escapes unscathed. She's pretty good.110.Films this bad are rare. Can't recommend enough that you avoid this like the plague.".

When they're saying a line they know they've made up during rehersals they seem not to believe in it. It may have worked for Brando in Last Tango in Paris  but Brando was a titan. These actors and most name actors Altman shows the true colours of are not.The first major mistake was giving Harry Belafonte improvisation priveleges. God is he obnoxious in this. He's the bad guy but he's not obnoxious in a way that makes you think oh isn't he good or maybe isn't this fun. You just think Belafonte is an arrogant guy.JasonLeigh's accent and acting are particularly hammy. Miranda Richardson is the only one who escapes unscathed. She's pretty good.110.Films this bad are rare. Can't recommend enough that you avoid this like the plague.";

Into this mix comes Johnny a small time criminal who is caught stealing from nightclub owner Seldom Seen.  Seen takes him prisoner to extract revenge but Johnny's wife takes action to get him back by kidnapping the wife of politician Stilton in the hope that his political influence will get her man back.  Blondie babysits the laudanum addicted Carolyn while Seen contemplates Johnny's future political wheels begin to repair the damage before it happens and the voters turn out for a busy election day in Kansas.I don't dislike Altman films in fact I love The Player and MASH but I have struggled the odd time to get into his films where they are solely driven by characters and not plots  for example Nashville and Short Cuts I found hard work..and don't get me started on Pret a Porter.  This I found to be a good mix of character and plot and worked really well for me.The actual plot is great and really works well within a flashback structure that could have failed but instead works well.  However the focus on a bit of plot and a bit of character pulls Altman a little bit and some of it doesn't work. Only the main narrative strand is followed through to completion even though I had gotten involved with the various other characters drifting through  these are just dropped.The plot is interesting enough and there are some pretty good scenes but it just didn't hang together.  Altman drifts off to look at musicians playing quite a lot and these scenes are a welcome break from the disjointed plot jumps.  That's not to say it isn't entertaining but it just felt like it was all half baked.  The performances don't help this feel.Usually a good cast will lift a weak film but here they don't seem to help at all.  Leigh is like a mockery of her self here.  Her twisted mouthed gangster moll being a spoof  if she had forced it anymore her mouth would have moved up onto the side of her face  why did no one tell her during shooting?  Don't they have rushes?  Richardson is OK and I actually enjoyed Belafonte in his scenes with Johnny even if he lacked enough onscreen menace.  Mulroney is wasted as is Buscemi.  Johnson is good as Pearl  but again a character I wanted to follow who just got dropped along the way.Overall this is not terrible it just isn't finished.  The characters aren't followed through and the bad ones are the main ones who we stick. The acting is wasted and is surprisingly bad in some cases and the whole film just feels like it could have been twice as good if only they'd ironed out some of the flaws.  Music's good though!".

The Terror boxer turned actor Jack O'Halloran perfectly cast. Danny's always felt guilty about the subsequent praise as he knows what really happened is that he got lucky.

Jeffrey Kramer of Jaws 1 and 2 Joe Guzaldo who acted with Chuck in Code of Silence Murphy Dunne of the Blues Brothers Band as the theatre manager ravishing Playboy Playmate Karen Witter as Hollywood starlet Ginger Tony DiBenedetto and the always delicious Billy Drago Chuck's nemesis in the second Delta Force movie as a highly unlikely psychiatrist.The reallife Wiltern theatre makes for an impressive setting and there is some decently done suspense in this thing. The music by David M. Frank fits the tone of the movie with its somber quality. Any and all action scenes are rather perfunctory. Still Chuck and the cast  crew deserve some credit for doing something a little different you don't see him in the position of actually being intimidated by his opponent too often although again this might not sit will with some action fans watching.In any event it's enjoyable stuff with a screenplay cowritten by former actor Michael Blodgett Beyond the Valley of the Dolls who does an uncredited bit in an extended restaurant scene.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Out of the ordinary for Norris? In a way it does feel like it but still those sweaty and musclebound elements are still evident but in a lesser tone. Norris does kick some ass but he plays a scarred guiltridden and unsure character that doesn't see himself as some sort of hero the media portrays with the main focus being on the welfare of his girlfriend and their expected baby. Some might say that it's a sombre performance with little emotion but it's a heartfelt turn that you feel every aching and haunting thought. Complementing that broad complexion is David Michael Frank's score which is always there and holds a sorrow edge. The story builds upon its material with a humane angle as Norris battles the demons spares us some wry relationship humour while the killer the terror is mainly a lumbering shadow that emits terror in the most basic and raw way. It's primal and oldfashion policekiller premise but stays stimulating throughout. That's not discarding some repetitive and contrived inclusions and how the killer does feel secondary to Norris. William Tannen's direction gradually forms suspense and moves quick enough even with some useless spots. The action isn't eyeopening but it's a sturdy display with moments of atmospheric lashings and the setting in a renovated movie theatre is a nice touch. The violence is quick with the killer providing a sure cure for neck problems. An abovepar cast do a sound job. Brynn Thayer excels as Norris' girlfriend. Jack O'Halloran's animalistic brute physique is his performance and Steve James is enjoyable too. Rounding the cast off Ryan O'Neil Jeffrey Kramer Murphy Dunne and a short but important seein for Billy Drago this guy has presence who explains the creepy and unsettling nature of the wanted killer.".

I bought all the Death Wishesthe first one is not by cannon and is actually legit and a bunch of chucks. We got drunk and laughed at all the super cheese. Invasion USA is a fave. Well anyways i watched this one by myself and i have to say it really surprised me. I found myself shocked by how much i was enjoying it! Its not even cheesy. Its well directed and has a pretty good cast to it. This is hands down actually a LEGIT Chuck Norris movie. Not your standard comedy act. Chuck acts very well here. Very likable with lol im not kidding some depth. All in all i loved it. LOL even the ending song which sounds like it could be in a sylvester stallone 80's movieCobra First Bloodlol Over the Top. So what im saying is check it out. It'll surprise ya. Ide give a 7.5 outta ten. cant do that here cause you cant go by .5.".

Novelist Michael Blodgett adapted his own book for this along with cowriter Dennis Shryack who has some good horror credits with THE CAR 1977 and MURDER BY PHONE 1982. The plot is pretty flimsy and the drama between Norris and his crazy seeming fianc is really rough. Their birthday dinner scene is really odd to the point I was screaming for Norris to ditch this crazy chick. Also the idea that Norris is the only one who believes the killer is in the theater after three mysterious deaths is laughable.

	schema:reviewBody "Hero and the Terror 1988 out of 4Danny O'Brien Chuck Norris brings down a serial killer labeled by the media as The Terror Jack O'Halloran which gets his labeled as Hero. Three years after the event O'Brien is still suffering nightmares and struggling to put his life together but things get a lot worse when The Terror escapes from a mental hospital.HERO AND THE TERROR is a Cannon film that tried to show their star Norris in a new light. The added stuff here includes seeing Norris struggle with coming to terms with the killer but there's a very large subplot dealing with his pregnant girlfriend and their upcoming child. The melodrama in the picture actually takes up the majority of the running time which is too bad because there's a fairly interesting killer here to work with.I never fault any actor trying to go out of the norm and do something different. It's funny that Cannon would have Norris doing some more than kicking butt in this film and especially when you consider that their other star Charles Bronson was trying something new this year too with MESSENGER OF DEATH. Both films have the stars offering up a new thing but it really doesn't work too well here. Norris actually gives a good performance and proves that he can handle the drama but all of this really waters down the story dealing with the serial killer and in the end this is a Cannon movie after all.The opening sequence actually manages to build up some nice suspense and there's some great one liners coming from Norris. The first forty five minutes or so are actually very entertaining but the film eventually runs out of gas and struggles to get to the conclusion. I think there are several long sequences that just didn't go anywhere including a search of a theater that drags on to the point where you're ready to take a nap. O'Halloran is effective in the role of the killer and it's too bad that there wasn't more of him.HERO AND THE TERROR is a decent movie but not a complete winner.".

	schema:headline " Norris Plays Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "This came out in the last years of the Cannon Group which had produced numerous fun Baction flicks. I saw it at the cinema and liked it. Having watched it again I couldn't help but associate it with another similar Norris's earlier vehicle SILENT RAGE.Detective Danny O'Brien Norris is haunted by his past after singlehandedly capturing a psychotic killer Simon Moon a.k.a. the Terror Jack O' Halloran. Several years later Moon escapes from a sanitarium and returns to the city he once stalked to unleash terror again. This time his 'turf' is a newly renovated theater in downtown Los Angeles that is about to be reopened. As victims start to fall and the opening date of the theater is approaching the Mayor calls for detective O'Brien to track him down and put an end to his terror.This action thriller at times plays like a pilot episode of a TV series. One of the key scenes even borders on becoming nonsensical like Simon Moon's escape.Billy Drago is miscast as Moon's doctor. Drago plays well as an antagonist a psycho FREEWAY or a henchman THE UNTOUCHABLES or any other typically eccentric bad guy but not a good doctor!On the other hand Jack O'Halloran Non in Superman 2 portrayal of the Terror is menacing  he doesn't speak only growls and looks creepy. The music especially when the Terror strikes performed by the same musician who scores Norris's CODE OF SILENCE is effective to create tension.What sets this film apart from other Norris's films is that we get to see him act a lot more than he usually does. Norris is not a oneman army like his role in the MISSING IN ACTION trilogy. Here he tries to act and play more drama he is a cop but a fathertobe and a sensitive lover too which is shown in a scene when he has a romantic birthday dinner with his girlfriend and in another scene when he faints upon arriving at the hospital after hearing that his pregnant girlfriend is about to deliver. Overall this cop thriller is one of Norris's better films where fans can see more of his acting than just his fighting skills.".

Danny O'Brien is a cop who likes to work alone that never waits for his back up. In L.A. he is trying to apprehend the notorious Simon Moon Jack O'Halloran also known as The Terror. Simon has been killing women by snapping their necks and taking them to his lair in an abandoned movie theater. O'Brien is attacked by Simon who almost kills him in the struggle.

When the backup arrives they think O'Brien caught The Terror and the people of L.A. call him Hero. Simon is then arrested and taken to jail.When Dr. Highwater Billy Drago goes to visit Simon he escapes by cutting through the bars of his cell. He then steals a laundry van by push starting it but loses control and falls straight down into a cliff face. When the media hears about this they pronounce Simon dead and the people of L.A. are relieved.Three years later the murders start back up again and O'Brien thinks it's The Terror has returned to his old hunting grounds...Excellent acting script direction photography background effects and music. Directed by the acclaimed William Tannen who has won five Clios the industry's highest honor for clients such as Diet Coke Ford Air France McDonald's and Pepsi Cola. Tannen has directed films like the political thriller Flashpoint for TriStar Pictures and codirected Deadly Illusion starring Billy Dee Williams for RCAColumbia and CineTel Films.

Find out today Simply speaking The Hero and The Terror is classic 80's Chuck. It might not be one of his more talkedabout titles but it's well worth seeing. It's kind of like a better version of Silent Rage 1982 insofar as it's about a psycho killer and Chuck's chasing him while doing minimal Martial Arts. If you have to see one of those two movies see this one. It's a quality production it's excellently shot with very nice cinematography the cast is topnotch and it all exudes an aura of professionalism. It's not at all junky and it would have been very cool to see this in the theater in '88.Chuck puts in a great performance that of a troubled hero haunted by The Terror while still striving to be a rock of stability and companionship for his wife. Fan favorite Steve James is as charismatic as ever and is always a joy to watch. He even wears the same WrestleMania hat as he does in McBain 1991. That must make us truly hardcore Steve James fans to notice a detail like that. Ron O'Neal does a decent job as The Mayor and Billy Drago has a glorified Cameo as a doctor. Come to think of it it's not all that glorified.We very much enjoyed the slower pace of this film. Slow pace doesn't equal bad bad equals bad. We're against the notion that MTVstyle fast cuts and ADDafflicted editing should be the standard we all have to now live by. So by that logic if a movie isn't moving at a breakneck pace it's no good? We reject that entirely. Bring us back to the days when a pace was meant to draw you in and you could get to know the characters. So we applaud director Tannen for that. He went on to be a codirector of Inside Edge 1992 which also featured Branscombe Richmond as does HATT as all the cool kids call it i.e. this movie.For straight downtheline and above board Chuck Hero and the Terror is a great choice.".

	schema:headline " More Like Hero and the Bore";
	schema:reviewBody "I picked this film up from the local Family Video on sale for 1.50 which was probably the first sign it wasn't going to be good. Watching it with 2 friends neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is. I strangely couldn't stop watching it. But this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie.The plot is simple enough and sounds great Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more. Serial murder Norris roundhouse kicks... this sounds like a great film.And some of it is pretty good. The flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense a scene where a van cascades off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing  and I learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than Chapstick gun powder and dental floss. But there is plenty wrong with this movie.One the editor is a moron. When making an action or suspense film you have to keep the energy moving. There are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie slowing it down and distracting from the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better. Two The sound guy is a moron. Apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound so most of the dialog is voiced over killing the stereo and not lining up with mouths. Also the music is far too dramatic in some scenes. Three The casting director is a moron. They cast Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor from Brisco County the Hills Have Eyes and others and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain. His character is so vanilla that Drago's skills are wasted. Four The writer is a moron.

	onyx:emotionText "I picked this film up from the local Family Video on sale for 1.50 which was probably the first sign it wasn't going to be good. Watching it with 2 friends neither of them even wanted to finish it because of how awful this movie is. I strangely couldn't stop watching it. But this film is definitely a textbook case of how not to make a movie.The plot is simple enough and sounds great Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to become reality once more. Serial murder Norris roundhouse kicks... this sounds like a great film.And some of it is pretty good. The flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense a scene where a van cascades off a cliff and gets crushed is amazing  and I learned how to break out of prison using nothing more than Chapstick gun powder and dental floss. But there is plenty wrong with this movie.One the editor is a moron. When making an action or suspense film you have to keep the energy moving. There are far too many scenes that are not crucial to the plot left in this movie slowing it down and distracting from the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pacing would have improved and the film would be slightly better. Two The sound guy is a moron. Apparently somebody tried to film most of this movie in an area where you can't get decent sound so most of the dialog is voiced over killing the stereo and not lining up with mouths. Also the music is far too dramatic in some scenes. Three The casting director is a moron. They cast Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor from Brisco County the Hills Have Eyes and others and would have made the proper serial killer or some sort of villain. His character is so vanilla that Drago's skills are wasted. Four The writer is a moron. Two plots are in this film  the hunting of a serial killer and the romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw that woman on screen I wanted to claw my eyes out. And sure enough she never figured into the other plot making her story completely pointless.Will I ever watch this again? Maybe.

Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love for Lucy and Kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress Lucy then he opens his heart and proposes Lucy.

	schema:reviewBody "At the Academy Awards ceremony on March 27 1957 Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her torrid overthetop portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a Texas oil tycoon in WRITTEN ON THE WIND. The 1956 potboiler adapted from Robert Wilder's novel  was a veritable threeringcircus showcasing alcoholism greed impotence and nymphomania.Malone's performance as Marylee Hadley  a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart was representative of the movie as a whole. Mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the lowest common denominator melodrama WRITTEN ON THE WIND is ultimately the work of one man the incredibly gifted director Douglas Sirk an migr from pre World War 2 Weimar Germany who left his European theater heritage behind to pursue a career in Hollywood.An extremely erudite man Sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as Universal Studios' reliable director of lavish soap operas most notably with Ross Hunter's productions of MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION  ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and IMITATION OF LIFE . Independent producer Albert Zugsmith offered Sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of Universal's demure entertainments and create a more adult  sensational product  hence the sultry WIND and its followup 1957's TARNISHED ANGELS both released under the Universal International banner. It's anyone's guess why Sirk didn't pursue loftier themes but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities. WRITTEN ON THE WIND could be considered Sirk's epic soap opera  indeed it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous perhaps more so. Robert Stack not an actor typically known for over emoting nearly matches Malone in intensity with his offering of the weak willed brother Kyle Hadley a mere shadow of his patriarchal father. When he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride  a beautifully leonine Lauren Bacall   Hadley goes off the deep end escalating an already serious drinking problem with a secret  gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb. Both brother and sister as venal and unlikeable as they are are presented as victims of their past giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous  and far more interesting than the 'good side of the family mainly Bacall and the impossibly handsome Rock Hudson  young Hadley's old boyhood friend and business associate a surrogate son to the old man and Malone' s unattainable object of desire.  Despite all the domestic codependency on display  it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed. With a real panache for pictorial composition and editing director Sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened Technicolor cinematography imaginable  every single shot in this film is an eyefilling canvas of saturated colors from the sight of a tanklike pink Cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury Miami hotel  a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity. Action and dramatic scenes feature Sirk's adept use of tilted camera angles  shadowy lighting and crosscut editing  shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious  drunken Malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase  the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold. What you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind gussied up in lurid Technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Douglas Sirk once said there's a very short distance between high art and trash and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art'. This statement defines his cinema perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations adventure and war films westerns and of course his famous melodramas.Sirk's melodramas were as the very word signifies dramas with music. The music sets the tone for his masterful style and every stroke of his brush Sirk was also a painter leaves a powerful image on the screenturnedcanvas. But this ain't life but its representation an imitation of life. Sirk never tried to show reality on the contrary. None of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by Hollywood most notably Technicolor to distinguish the artificial from the real thing. Let's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama Blackboard jungle Rebel without a cause. Sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else.Another of Sirk's statements summarizes this You can't reach or touch the real. You just see reflections. If you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass'. I defy anybody that has seen Written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen. One ends up giving up.Therefore we are in a hall full of mirrors where there's no difference between real and its false copy. Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people. That town ain't real either with those hideous oil pumps all over the place. So in this realm the acting is affected the decore is fake the trick is visible. Everything is pushed a little bit off the limit the sexual connotations of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower for example. Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time.The angles are the director's thoughts the lighting is his philosophy'. In Written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows. The Hadleys house with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way. A house that resembles a mausoleum that no party can cheer up. As tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night Sirk's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters and so are the colours of the clothes they wear. Drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director's craft.Sirk considered himself a story bender' because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose. Written on the wind is a good example. It wouldn't work in any other hands.The other director that was using similar strategies was Frank Tashlin who was for 50's comedy the same that Sirk was for melodrama. Their films are full of the machinery of american life advertising TV sets jukeboxes washing machines sport cars vacuum cleaners to depict its emptiness and decay. I'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences. The game was played by both sides so it was camp. Now we regard them as cult' or bizarre' because we are not those spectators anymore. That is why Todd Haynes's homage Far from heaven' turns into a pastiche because it reproduces Sirk's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between. Then Sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that Julianne Moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film.Sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly. There were always immovable characters Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here against which he could assemble a series of split ones. His balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters because these are the ones Sirk is interested in too. When Robert Stack flies the plane and tempts' Lauren Bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them obvious Faustian echoes we are strangely fascinated with him too as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with Mitch alone by the river.In the Sirk's universe the studio oftenimposed happy ends' have no negative impact. In fact they worked just great. Sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the Deux ex machinea of his day. Thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the Hadley feud.It was pointed out the many similarities between Written on the Wind with the Godfather saga. I absolutely agree and I'm sure the parallel is not incidental. Both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family. The temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance with Jimmy Caan's Sonny Corleone. The action of fighting her sister's male friend is symmetrical. The nonson in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films as the fact that both families carry the names of their town. Even details as  the gate that gives access to the property and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves suggest that Coppola had Written on the Wind in mind while setting his masterwork. Because both films deal with the subject of Power the acquisition of power its manipulation and legacy even Kyle Hadley's sterility the event that hastens the turmoil is an issue easily tied to the central theme of Power in this case a weakness in sexual power. The other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is Citizen Kane. One wouldn't think at first of similarities between Welles and Sirk's films but there are a good many starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family's fortune and ending in the fact that Mitch Wayne Rock Hudson as Charles Foster Kane was adopted by a tutor having his own father alive. Amazingly the same actor Harry Shannon perform both Wayne and Kane's fathers. This detail is cannot be a coincidence.Written on the Wind is a masterpiece in every aspect in execution and vision in style and technique a highlight in the career of this wonderful director. Some say that this is his best film. In my opinion Magnificent obsession' All that heaven allows' There's always tomorrow' and Imitation of life' are just as good. And for those who put Sirk in the level of Dallas or Dinasty I wish them no happy end.".

This is not to say that Sirk's wicked undertones are not present as they are rather by this time 1956 he had perfected his ability to balance the false and lavish exterior with the sad repugnant interior of the characters and the lives they inhabit.What is unique to this film is how intense and emotional the story becomes rather than simpleminded fodder for soap fans. This is due in part to the very strong performances particularly Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone as Kyle and Marylee Hadley the filthyrich but morally empty children of an oil tycoon who traipse about looking for thrills and challenges. Kyle finds one in straightlaced secretary Lucy Moore Lauren Bacall whom he eventually marries. Marylee has been attracted to Kyle's best friend Mitch Wayne the incomparable Rock Hudson all her life but cannot get past his wall of incredulity. In short none of these characters are truly happy or satisfied with their situations even after attempts to correct them. This may be Sirk's most devastating critique of all everyone despite their varied backgrounds remain unfulfilled and unwilling to settle for anything but what they feel is ultimate satisfaction.If nothing else this film is gorgeous to look at. Russell Metty Sirk's longtime cinematographer photographs Hollywood sets better than anyone. Perhaps its the color palate or Sirk's mise en scene whatever it is it is used brilliantly to reflect the characters and 1950s America's vapid soullessness. This combined with over the top acting and scenarios would seem to present itself as sheer stupidity and disregarded melodrama. Of course this being Douglas Sirk one must attempt to look closer for the signs of that most modern of ideas that people are strange and life is the most ironic of situations.".

However Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks' best friend Rock Hudson. And Stacks' nymphomaniac sister Dorothy Malone lusts after Rock. Throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control in a good way.Very glossy movie in beautiful Technicolor with jawdropping fashions and furnishings check out Bacall's hotel room at the beginning. Everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful formfitting clothes. Basically this is a soap opera with grade A production values. The story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top. The acting by Hudson Stack and Bacall isn't that good but seeing them so young and glamorous is great...especially Stack...when he smiled my knees went weak! Dorothy Malone on the other hand is fantasticshe deservedly won Best Supporting Actress for her role. She's sexy violent vicious and sympathetic...all convincingly. Fun glossy trash. Don't miss it!".

	onyx:emotionText "Rich alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy he stops drinking. However Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks' best friend Rock Hudson. And Stacks' nymphomaniac sister Dorothy Malone lusts after Rock. Throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control in a good way.Very glossy movie in beautiful Technicolor with jawdropping fashions and furnishings check out Bacall's hotel room at the beginning. Everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful formfitting clothes. Basically this is a soap opera with grade A production values. The story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top. The acting by Hudson Stack and Bacall isn't that good but seeing them so young and glamorous is great...especially Stack...when he smiled my knees went weak! Dorothy Malone on the other hand is fantasticshe deservedly won Best Supporting Actress for her role. She's sexy violent vicious and sympathetic...all convincingly. Fun glossy trash. Don't miss it!";

	schema:headline " Overthetop melodrama!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's the 1950's in the town of Hadley Texas and the town's namesake and resident oil baron Jasper Hadley Keith has about all he can handle with his business and two adult children Kyle Stack and Marylee Malone. Kyle has just met Lucy Moore Bacall an advertising executive's secretary who was introduced to him by his best friend Mitch Wayne Hudson after they had only just met themselves. Kyle sweeps Lucy off of her feet and after a oneday courtship end up eloping much to Mitch's chagrin since he's in love with Lucy himself. Meanwhile Marylee who is the resident town tramp is becoming increasingly aggressive in her pursuit of Mitch who wants nothing to do with her. When Marylee plants the idea in Kyle's head that Lucy and Mitch are having an affair at the time untrue in a sick attempt to break up the couple in order for her to have Mitch there for herself Kyle goes on a bender. Lucy meanwhile discovers from the doctor that she is pregnant the father definitely being Kyle. That night after Kyle returns home drunk she tells him the news and he hits her knocking her to the ground assuming that it is Mitch's and leaves the house after Mitch throws him out threatening to kill him if he returns. He of course does return and tries to shoot Mitch but Marylee sneaks up behind him and grabs the gun causing Kyle to shoot himself instead not before finding out that he indeed was the father of Lucy's baby which was of course miscarried.Written on the Wind was one heck of a movie. Directed by the great Douglas Sirk it is high melodrama and camp at its best. Worst depending on how much you like this kind of film. Lauren Bacall who has been quiet and dignified in every film I've seen her in carries that demeanor through to this film but it seems grossly out of place. Dorothy Malone an actress I have heard of but haven't seen in a film that I can recall is so tanned she is orange and has a bad brassy blonde dye job and practically spits out her lines she is so evil and childish. Rock Hudson stays pretty true to character playing the big lug who is generally a good guy and Robert Stack who I honestly only remember seeing in Unsolved Mysteries is a riot as a drunken playboy. The story is nothing better than your average nighttime soap opera fare and as stated earlier the ending is sewn up a little too nicely and easily to be believed.What the film does have however is style to spare. In classic Douglas Sirk fashion the vibrancy of the colors in the film is astounding and the lush scenery and costumes are beautiful. One scene in particular that actually left me kind of breathless was a pivotal scene in the film where the father Jasper dies. Marylee has just picked up another guy a gas station attendant this time and was brought home by the cops. After marching upstairs defiantly she puts on a Latinstyle chacha type album with screaming trumpets and turns it up very loudly while dancing around in her bedroom with this flowing dark pink nightgown on. We see the father walking up the stairs resolutely but weakly to confront her about it but when he reaches the top of the stairs he collapses and falls down the entire staircase. Meanwhile we still hear the music shrieking and the shots of the father are intercut with his daughter dancing furiously and kicking her legs around in this pink gown. It is a stunning scene that lasts for only about 20 seconds but was enough to make me sit up and take full notice. The melodrama factor in Written on the Wind is about as high as I've seen short of a Joan CrawfordBette Davis film and it is pretty delicious. Much like the great deer scene at the end of Magnificent Obsession Written on the Wind has its own overly done final scene. Marylee left alone in the family house now that Kyle and her father are both deceased watches Mitch and Lucy leave from her father's office window. She turns around and is wearing a prim suit first time we've seen something like that on her and as she sits at her father's desk she clutches a model of an oil tower mirroring the portrait of her father behind the desk. It is an absolute riot pure and simple.Written on the Wind begins with the film's near conclusion and the wind blows the pages of a day calendar back to show what happened in the preceding year leading up to the events. Unfortunately the characters in the film were so shallowly presented with little background that I didn't feel a whole lot for them. However that is not to say that the film is not well done or enjoyable. If anything Douglas Sirk shows that he can take bland fare and turn it into a film that is both wellpresented and easy to watch. It isn't remotely boring nor is it believable but it is great escapist cinema. Watching this film is like watching a good episode of Dynasty or in recent programming Desperate Housewives. I actually had a pretty low opinion of it on a surface level but after reconstructing it in my mind I could not deny that the film was exactly what it set out to be and that I had actually really enjoyed it for its extravagance. If you don't have an appetite or appreciation for this kind of drama don't bother with the film you'll hate it. If you do like and appreciate this type of film and subsequently the work of Douglas Sirk don't miss this one because it is actually a lot of fun. 610 Shelly".

Just look at the scenes that are supposed to take place in Manhattan or Miami or even the lake are one can see how the scenery is a painted backdrop. Mr. Sirk couldn't care less about realism as long as he could tell the story his own way.We recently caught a screening part of a revival of Mr. Sirk's work where people were laughing at some of the most dramatic moments especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson who plays the good Mitch Wayne appears. There is also something graphic in the way that both Robert Keith who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley and later on his own daughter the evil Marylee caress the oil derrick that adorns the elder man's desk a sort of phallic object d'art.Douglas Sirk probably wanted his cast to give over the top performances which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomaniac Marylee and to a certain degree Robert Stack who overacts as Kyle the tormented heir of the story. That would probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen. The only one that seems normal is Lauren Bacall who wasn't asked to make her Lucy Moore character appear to be anything but a grounded person caught hanging out with the wrong crowd.Together with his other Hollywood movies Written on the Wind shows the genius of a talented director who gave the public just what they wanted to see stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen".

	schema:headline " Top notch melodrama that engages despite existing in a sort of DallasDynasty reality";
	schema:reviewBody "Mitch Wayne comes from a working family but his childhood friendship with the children of oil magnate Hadley sees him continuing within the family and the family business as an adult. Kyle is his best friend but is a spoilt playboy as a result of his money and privilege. When the two meet Lucy they both fall for her but as usual it is Kyle that gets her attention and quickly marries her. Lucy joins the family home to find a spiteful and spoilt daughter Marylee who dislikes her but longs for the childish affection she still holds for Mitch. Against a background of money and privilege tensions and emotions build between the friends and family.Normally when I call something melodramatic it is a criticism but for those looking for melodrama that is well delivered then often Douglas Sirk is as good a place to look as any. This film is a fine example but I'll be the first to admit that the plot summary on paper does make it sound like the soapiest load of daytime TV filler ever! However the delivery is everything and the film succeeds in making the story and characters engaging. It is hard to describe well but the story doesn't really happen in reality but rather in a sort of melodrama world of high emotions and I didn't expect it to draw me in. Part of the reason it did was down to Sirk's writing and direction. He creates this convincing world where everyone fits in and it all seems real.Of course of the biggest factors is the cast for it is starry and impressive. I've never been that taken by Hudson but he is a sturdy and manly lead actor here even if he has the less showy material to work with. Bacall is strong and controls a great deal of the emotional core of the film. The main melodramatic flair comes from two other good performances. It was hard for me to get past the Stack I know from Airplane but he is very good here and descends well across the film. Likewise Malone plays her character well. As with many Sirk films the cinematography the look of the film is important and this one expertly captures the feel of the fifties but doesn't look dated in a bad way  it still feels quite fresh and lively.Overall this is a melodrama and if the very thought of that puts you off then you'd best avoid it. However it is a fine story that engages well even as it exists above reality. The cast are impressive with their material and are a big part of making it convincing and engaging.".

	onyx:emotionText "Mitch Wayne comes from a working family but his childhood friendship with the children of oil magnate Hadley sees him continuing within the family and the family business as an adult. Kyle is his best friend but is a spoilt playboy as a result of his money and privilege. When the two meet Lucy they both fall for her but as usual it is Kyle that gets her attention and quickly marries her. Lucy joins the family home to find a spiteful and spoilt daughter Marylee who dislikes her but longs for the childish affection she still holds for Mitch. Against a background of money and privilege tensions and emotions build between the friends and family.Normally when I call something melodramatic it is a criticism but for those looking for melodrama that is well delivered then often Douglas Sirk is as good a place to look as any. This film is a fine example but I'll be the first to admit that the plot summary on paper does make it sound like the soapiest load of daytime TV filler ever! However the delivery is everything and the film succeeds in making the story and characters engaging. It is hard to describe well but the story doesn't really happen in reality but rather in a sort of melodrama world of high emotions and I didn't expect it to draw me in. Part of the reason it did was down to Sirk's writing and direction. He creates this convincing world where everyone fits in and it all seems real.Of course of the biggest factors is the cast for it is starry and impressive. I've never been that taken by Hudson but he is a sturdy and manly lead actor here even if he has the less showy material to work with. Bacall is strong and controls a great deal of the emotional core of the film. The main melodramatic flair comes from two other good performances. It was hard for me to get past the Stack I know from Airplane but he is very good here and descends well across the film. Likewise Malone plays her character well. As with many Sirk films the cinematography the look of the film is important and this one expertly captures the feel of the fifties but doesn't look dated in a bad way  it still feels quite fresh and lively.Overall this is a melodrama and if the very thought of that puts you off then you'd best avoid it. However it is a fine story that engages well even as it exists above reality. The cast are impressive with their material and are a big part of making it convincing and engaging.";

	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of seeing this lurid chunk of celluloid camp on television last night.

Oddly enough both Bacall usually the epitome of strength and gravity and Rock Hudson are given fairly bland roles always remaining above the hideously dysfunctional quagmire that surrounds them. They're too good to be very interesting. The characters at the opposite end of the spectrum are what keep our attention. Once soaked in alcohol a preUnsolved Mysteries Robert Stack is immensely entertaining as tormented pistolwaving Kyle upset over his inability to conceive the children needed to complete the little American Nightmare in richpeople hell.

	schema:reviewBody "When I was studying English Literature as an undergraduate I read a play called The Octoroon by one Dion Boucicault spelling? an Irishman no kidding with a panache for melodrama. Well The Octoroon was perhaps the most reviling and offensive piece of literature I had ever read until I picked up Tropic of Cancer anyway. Nevertheless I absolutely loved the lurid story and the classic closing tableau of a silhouetted American Indian frozen hatchetbearing arm raised above the cowering badguy. It was brilliant trash really eliciting from me the reaction opposite my professor's expectations. I believe he said something about needing to be able to recognize worthless literature as well as wonderful. Well I thought the Octoroon in its own way was wonderful even if I thought it was racist sexist ist ist ist ad infinitum. I read another Boucicault play while in Ireland apparently he's considered one of their greatest dramatists over there and though not quite as good it was still rather wonderful melodrama. Boucicault's plays to be told are melodrama perfected and if you like your stories over the top and busting at the seams they're very enjoyable.Now that brings us to Douglas Sirk perfecter of the American melodrama in the 1950s. Unlike Boucicault I would never doubt Sirk's talent as his films reveal him as a true visionary artist who was able to transform soap operatic stories into sublime motion pictures.His best I believe is Written on the Wind. Not to diminish the quality of All that Heaven Allows or Magnificent Obsession but the story mise en scene and technicolor cinematography all come together so perfectly in Written that it's hard to argue against this film's placement at the top of Sirk's oeuvre.Written tells the tell of a thoroughly dysfunctional family of rich oil barons. Impotent sons unloving fathers and nymphomaniac daughters all make an appearance. People die go mad with unrequited love wind up in court smash cars lie drink heavily fight and on and on. The characters in this film do just about everything.As immensely entertaining as this story is the reason people remember it besides Robert Stack's wonderful performance as a raging drunk is Sirk's masterful direction. The scenes make perfect use of the widescreen format with painterly mise en scene. The colors are vibrant and lush. The cinematography  of both interiors and the flat landscape outdoors  is beautiful. Written on the Wind is simply gorgeous to look at. You could watch it without sound and still find it entertaining.Furthermore though it definitely contains typically 50s sensibilities it is a timeless story of unrequited love and jealousy that anyone can find at the very least entertaining if not brilliant.Watch this film you will not be bored.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I think of something trashy and good I'm thinking of something so bad it's good. Or maybe something that's trying really hard to please and is working even if it is kind of crappy maybe something like The Mummy Returns which truly did please me. I don't think melodrama is in its nature trashy. This past weekend I saw for the first time in my life Gone with the Wind and as God is my witness I'm never watching that clumsy piece of filmmaking again. It is a florid melodrama and so is Written on the Wind. But Written on the Wind handles itself so amazingly well. I almost wanted to clap when The End appeared on the screen. It is my personal Gone with the Wind about 10 times better than that supposed masterpiece.POSSIBLE SPOILERSAs for the writing the story and the dialogue it was all good. Maybe not the best in the world but still quite good. I did care about the characters a good and necessary sign for a drama. The only weak spot is the courtroom scene which is particularly bad even for this most cliched type of scene. But it also incorporates a lot of Freudian touches into the script so there is always more going on beneath the surface. Especially watch Marylee and the scenes involving her. Pay close attention to her final scene in the film where she has sole control of the Hadley oil industry. Look at what she is holding in her hand for instance and make sure to notice the painting of her father behind her in this same scene.The acting was quite high quality for the most part. Rock Hudson was good as the tough guy who has to try to keep the lid on his emotions. Robert Stack was excellent as a pathetic rich boy he also played drunk well which is very hard to do and Dorothy Malone is a standout as the nympho sister who works as a catalyst for the harrowing climax. The only weak point in this cast is Lauren Bacall who while not bad does not exhibit much depth in the role of the newcomer into the oil dynasty.The real point of light in the whole proceedings is Douglas Sirk. He is why I picked this film up. I had heard his name countless times in my readings and had always been interested. I mean go through any user comments on this site to any of his films. People will say how cheesy or soapoperalike his films are but they all still love his films I don't recall a single negative comment in all of those that I read and I read most of them. Any director who can do that heck any director who can be singled out as an auteur in the American studio system deserves recognition. And Written on the Wind has an amazing style when compared to other Hollywood features of the same period. The way he moves his camera is quite a feat at times. Watch the way the camera rolls from Stack's yellow car to the upstairs bedroom window in the prologueclimactic scene or how the camera follows the bartender through the beaded door allowing the beads to graze the lense most Hollywood films in the studio system would have done a lot to have avoided this but it adds a particular feeling to what is happening in that scene or my favorite scene watch both the camera placement actually here the decision NOT to move the camera and the editing of the sequence involving the father's death. Possibly the most noticeable technique that differentiates this film from other Hollywood films of the same era is the startling use of color. The production design is more reminiscent of an MGM musical than a melodrama. The way color is used is very painterly of the more modern art variety like Lichtenstein and Warhol. I don't know exactly what Sirk did all that for but it makes these color films much more impressive than the often boring realistic style used in most films of the same period. In fact I generally prefer black and white to color at this period because so many cinematographers were unskilled in the way of color yet. Watching Written on the Wind is something akin to a light acid trip and I'm sure Sirk regained popularity in the late 60s because of it.All in all Written on the Wind is quite spectacular. I can't wait to see more Sirk films. I just rented Imitation of Life and Magnificent Obsession so hopefully they live up to the high standard Written on the Wind has already set. 910.".

Well yes but it is a very glossy and pretty soaperthanks to director Douglas Sirk who made a name for himself by making what was essentially highquality trash. Films like Magnificent Obsession All That Heaven Allows and Imitation of Life were all about rich bored and screwed up pretty folks. In many ways these films are a lot like forerunners of shows like Dallas and Dynasty. In other words they appeal to a certain nicheand if you like this sort of thing Sirk was great in creating them. He did however make MANY films that did not fit this moldthough today he is most known for the soaps. As for me I am not a huge fans of soaps. This doesn't mean they are badjust not the sort of genre that usually appeals to me. Additionally there wasn't any subtlety about this film except in what I mention belowit was loud crass and bigger than life particularly in regard to Malone's character.

But in an odd way it IS entertaining...I will give it that!Oddly despite all this Sirk and his melodramas have been adored by the French New Wave writers and directorsand perhaps that is why the film has been released as part of the muchheralded Criterion Collection. For me I just cannot see what they see in thisit's just a soaper...and a rather trashy one at that for its time. Because it was the 1950s the script really didn't know what to do with Kyle. Sirk envisioned the man as a closeted homosexual. However they couldn't put that in American films at that time due to the Production Code so they talked about him having some 'problem' that prevented the couple from having kids. Talk about cryptic and silly! The viewers might have thought he was impotent or had poor sperm motility or was chronically constipated or had major Freudian issues or goodness knows what!! Having him being clearly gay would have improved the film tremendously and made sense of some of the plot.These were remakes and especially in the case of Imitation of Life the original was much better.

For one my brother had said You HAVE to see Dorothy Malone in this film. She's unbelievable. Then a bunch of classic film board posters had praised this film so my interest was there.Well one viewing was enough. I am just not a fan of soap operas and this is so soapy you could fill a tub big enough to wash you fill in the blank. I have no problem with the four main actors of this film  Robert Stack Rock Hudson Lauren Bacall and Dorothy Malone  having enjoyed all of them in other moviesTV shows. However the characters they played in this movie were unappealing. The only normal guy ironically turned out to be the one Rock Hudson played. Bacall's dialog at least early on was unrealistic Malone's looks turned me off I was spoiled having seen her look fantastic in other things here she was just cheaplooking  which was what they wanted and Stack well he was just plain superannoying. That's what soap fans want anyway annoying losertype people. Me I prefer some nice normal characters. So if you like whining drunks squabbling siblings stupid romances etc. this is your cup of tea. However one thing in here that was to interest was the color palate it's pretty wild. I'm sure this looked a lot better on DVD than on the tape I watched.To be fair the film is okay and the story is just fine for what it is a '50s melodrama. It's a good movie for those who like this genre. I'm just not a fan of these overwrought stories but I'll still rate the movie decently for what it presents good acting a somewhatinvolving story and interesting cinematography with a wild color scheme.".

Dorothy Malone won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her splendidly overthetop performance as Stack's sister who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will. A highlight of the film comes when this highspirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middleclass propriety. As so frequently happens in Sirk movies the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness.Sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films.

In other words the James Dean part without the James Dean racism from Giant. Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that Stack's Hadley Oil Company uses.

She marries Stack.And last but not least in the mix we have Dorothy Malone who's Stack's amoral sister who has a yen for Rock but Rock ain't about to get tangled up with this wild child. Dorothy Malone spent over 10 years in a whole bunch of colorless film heroine roles before landing this gem. She got a Best Supporting Actress Award for her part as Marilee Hadley and it was well deserved.If you like splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera than this is the film for you.".

One the recent Hamlet' is different. This comment covers the three traditional slashers.Each of the three slashers uses the inside film as a device for a relatively sophisticated distance for humor they try to scare using established formulae but at the same time poking fun at the genre the watchers and the scares themselves.Cut Urban and Hamlet are by firsttime directors and incidentally the characters are film students. The lead in Urban is made up to look like Julia Stiles the Ophelia in Hamlet. The lead in Cut is made up to look like Courtney Cox of Scream. Scream has the highest production values Urban the lowest.Cut is the deepest selfreferentially the monster is brought into the real world by the film  the magic is in the viewing which makes the audience cocreators of horror. The monster is destroyed when the film is. Plus Cut has Molly Ringwald playing Bette Midler. She probably knows she's being made fun of as a bag that once was fun just like the genre.Urban is the most schoolish in the number of films it references cinematically. Lots of Hitchcock here some too blatant to be honorable. It makes the most fun of the actors the bogus film within is really bad and the film crew are bozos but the real' film is worth killing for sort of a D.O.A' plot.  Scream has the dumbest story Urban and Scream have scoobydoo plot ends the bad guy in the costume really is just a bad guy in a costume and we get the detectivestorylike explanation.Scream uses the film within poorly. It is just a place of work the only clever device is that each real' character has a pretend one. But this isn't used at all except for a brief shadowing of Gale Weathers. Wes Craven knows better. He used this same notion in the last Nightmare movie where he played himself writing the film. Pretty good actually.Urban uses the film within only by reference along with all of the other films that are referenced. Instead the use has more to do with the making of the film and the trappings of filmmaking  except for the end where the film within merges with the real' action.Cut uses the film within more creatively. By placing the real people in the action of the old film thus bringing the killer of the old film to them.None of this stuff is scary any more. When you go you go for fun. If you were only going to see only one of these 3 films you should make it Cut.".

	schema:reviewBody "While filming an 80's horror movie called 'Hot Blooded' the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer. After all of this the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust. So a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film. From this it's labelled as a cursed production. Not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from Hollywood to reprise her role but not as the daughter but the mother. But again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer.Look what 'Scream' started! Hey I enjoy those films but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses. During this stage the subgenre came back with vengeance but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts where they followed the derivative pattern of the Scream franchise. 'Cut' which is an independent Australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick. But you know what I found it a cheesy delight. Yeah It's gawd awful and highly forgettable but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted. Although I did hate it when I originally came across it but the second time around I knew what I was getting myself into and it worked better for it. It was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again but this time it wasn't so sweet.The film came out around the same time as 'Scream 3' and 'Urban Legends The Final Cut' did which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie. 'Scream 3' is obviously the strongest of the three but I would actually watch this trash over Urban Legends The Final Cut. Though it did seem more of a throwback to the 80's slashers than that of one of Scream's bastard offspring. Pretty much the film is given bgrade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances. The dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense. While the performances are pure mockery and Molly Ringwald takes the crown for it. She plays the washup actress returning to finish the cursed flick and I had good fun with her laughably ridiculous sendup performance. She provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly. The rest were mostly recognizable Australian TV stars that's if you're an Australian with a ravishing Jessica Napier leading the cast with the likes of Stephen Curry and Frank Roberts. Also pop singer and supposed actress Kylie Minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up! Nice. These teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dimwitted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed. Sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue because they have no real substance to be there.The plot starts off rather interestingly then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up but then it makes a sudden uturn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre. Simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness I was kind of left thinking oh my. This when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner but sadly it falls along way. But don't you just love an opening ending. Also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential tongueincheek approach. Predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become overstated at times but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit. The atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added 'some' spookiness. The cinema scene is done rather nicely too.Now now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick but sadly there's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard if lacking but it's more then decent for such lowbudget flick. There are one or two creative deaths but the rest are systematic. The killer wasn't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it I thought well the smartass attitude didn't sit well with me. Another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cutaway editing outofplace soundtrack and Kimble Rendall's direction lacked execution and was pretty careless but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness.The imagination matches the budget that's for sure but heck this lousy slasher wasn't trying to be anything else. Pure schlock that's slightly amusing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Hmmm what can one say about the Aussie slasher flick Cut ?Being a total horror nut since I was a teenager I remember being so excited in the months leading up to the release of this film late in the year 2000 I could hardly stand the wait! I had a four page article about the film from Empire magazine and a visual teaser a photo of ex Echo Point defunct Aussie Soapie star Jessica Napier bruised and bloodied locked in battle with Scarman Frank Roberts surrounded by flames. It looked absolutely magical! Australia were making their very own Scream. I was SO excited!I saw it the very day it came out and left in such a weird state of mind. I WANTED so much to like it really I did but the truth is the film is SO BAD! So badly written so badly acted and just an absolute MESS in parts. I'm going to overlook some of the corny dialogue I'm not sure if it was the dialogue or the bad actors delivering it!!The acting by pretty much 75 of the cast is laughable however the two leads Molly Ringwald and Jessica Napier are convincing Jessica Napier in particular showing considerable talent in her acting ability.  Warning though the two police officers at the end could well be the WORST actors EVER to get a gig in a film. Then there is Sarah Kants who plays Hester. Terrible actress TERRIBLE TERRIBLE actress! And when her character suddenly out of the blue decides she's a lesbian and wants to snog Raffy what the hell was that about?? you just want her to get splattered.But then the most bizaar thing happens in her death scene. She suddenly turns in an Oscar winning performance! She runs she hides she cries she whimpers she falls she gets up she runs again she even attacks the villain with a pair of hedge shears shreiking a venemous Get away from me!!!. Sadly just as Sarah Kants is stealing the whole movie and you are too enthralled in her performance to remember how terrible she'd been for the 45 minutes prior she gets her head squashed in some kind of lathe type machine and carks it not before letting out one final breath taking shriek which any slasher flick actress would be proud to call her own!.I say put this girl in more horror films!! But keep her silent until her death scene and then just sit back and watch the magic! Truly one of the best performances I've seen from a slasher victim in the last 10 years or so!There are two other highlights the cameo by singer Kylie Minogue at the start is interesting she looks so tiny which she attempts to counteract by pouting and doing the 'Bossy domineering director' role before ticking off the murderer with her attitude and having her tongue cut out.The finale' is quite decent one part the shot where Scarface melts and turns into this horrid moaning creature laying on top of Jessica Napier trying to drive a knife into her chest before dissolving into a stream of what can only be described as 'goo' is quite cool and freaky. However Scarface is really not that scary once you hear him talk he's kind of a Freddy Kruger wanna be without the wit.The film is good for a laugh at times but that's a laugh at how terrible some of it is like when Scarman decides to try and hack off Molly Ringwald during a scene they're filming in the 'film within a film' Hot Blooded and they realise it's not an actor it's the killer! Eeeeek! They all kind of jog outside in this bored way which is quite amusing it looks like a practise run which got filmed and somehow ended up in the film. And of course Molly Ringwald holding a serving tray for use as a shield and a knife saying Let's kill the bastard is just laughable in it's delivery. Not to mention Raffy's professor who gets speared through the neck and 15 minutes later reappears to do the I'm not really dead! entrance THEN decides he might pull the spear out of his neck why didn't he do that 15 minutes prior???Anyways in truth the dialogue is terrible even thinking about it now I'm cringing but if you're the kind who has the patience to sit through even the worst of horror films and you've run out of slasher flicks to see give Cut a go just to see Kylie Minogue Sarah Kants death scene and of course Scarman melting all over the blonde heroine at the end.Aside from that do not expect anything even remotely original scary or worth remembering about this tragic failure of a film what went wrong? We did Razorback in the 80's and ended up with Cut in the year 2000!! But then again it WAS directed by an ex member of Aussie garage band the Hoodoo Gurus!!As you can see I still can't make my mind up about this film I so want to like it and some parts I do but also part of me wants it banished from video stores across the world for the shame of seeing what happens when you let ex one hit wonder band members behind a movie camera! It's sad to see from the special effects at the end that they did indeed have a bit of a budget by Australian standards and how the film could have been quite ok with a few changes ok wait ALOT of changes! If only we could turn back time fire most of the cast rewrite most of it and refilm it. So yes we tried to make an Aussie Slasher Flick and we failed. But we'll be back! We will match the brilliance of Picnic At Hanging Rock you'll see!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I think of the cheesiest guilty pleasuretype movies the first thing I think of are '80s slasher flicks.  Really bad slasher flicks.  The formulaic type of film where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made.Flash forward to the late '90searly '00s.  The slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996's Scream.  Like in the '80s these films were formulaic masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as hip tongueincheek parodies of the original slasher flicks.  Of this recent blend of hip parody neoslasher flicks the only one worth seeing is the lowbudget directtovideo Cut.Like most of the other new slasher flicks Cut relies on the production of a slasher flick in this case a fictional 1985 film Hot Blooded to make its commentary on the genre.  Hot Blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer Scarman a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark pupilless eyes.  Now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the vaults tap the original surviving actress and finish the film.  But every time the film is screened or a scene is shot Scarman returns and someone dies.  To quote the tagline will they finish the film before it finishes them?This all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick?.  There is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of Hot Blooded's original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet it's never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about.  The actors aren't great even by directtovideo standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who aren't it's inadvertent character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on Hot Blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play Scarman.  Cut's climax has no big who dunnit unmasking of the killer like in the Scream films.  It doesn't have the gimmick killings of the Urban Legend films.  What it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending.  But that's par for the course.By any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neoslasher flicks.".

Hot Blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer Scarman a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark pupilless eyes.  Now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the vaults tap the original surviving actress and finish the film.  But every time the film is screened or a scene is shot Scarman returns and someone dies.  To quote the tagline will they finish the film before it finishes them?This all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick?.  There is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of Hot Blooded's original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet it's never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about.  The actors aren't great even by directtovideo standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who aren't it's inadvertent character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on Hot Blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play Scarman.  Cut's climax has no big who dunnit unmasking of the killer like in the Scream films.  It doesn't have the gimmick killings of the Urban Legend films.  What it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending.  But that's par for the course.By any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neoslasher flicks.";

	schema:headline " Imaginative Silly Slasher Fun If Not Taken Seriously.";
	schema:reviewBody "Cut centers around an actress named Vanessa Turnbill played by '80s legend Molly Ringwald who began to act in a slasher film some ten years ago  unfortunately the director of the film was savagely murdered and production was stopped. Poor Vanessa manages to survive the attack and ends up killing the murderer. Then another director attempted to take over and was killed in a test screening of the film. Now a group of Australian filmmakers set out to finish the film titled 'Hot Blooded' and manage to get Vanessa Turnbill to resume her role ten years after she originally began making the film. But the movie seems to have a curse in which everyone who's attempted to complete it has died... and soon after production begins a psychotic killer begins slaughtering the cast and crew members one by one.A bit of a guilty pleasuretype film Cut is an entertaining little slasher movie from the land down under. By no means is it anything in terms of a classic but I found this to be a pretty fun movie. The story is semioriginal. The basis that the slasher premise circles around is a fairly original idea and something I haven't seen done before. No it's not entirely original and in many instances it's just as typical as any slasher movie out there but the premise of the moviewithinmovie thing was interesting and makes for some very fun viewing. It starts out as a fullblown slasher movie continues this theme then a little mystery is edged in and eventually it almost becomes a spoof of the horror genre but with subtlety. There are a few clever scenes that I really enjoyed but suspense is lacking not that slasher flicks usually tend to contain much suspense anyway. As in most slasher movies this one is pretty clichridden as well and horror fans will know what to expect quite a few times. Still this isn't necessarily bad because the film seems to spoof the genre anyway making fun of itself along the way. I thought the killer in the movie was great that mask sleek emotionless face mouth sewed up was the stuff nightmares are made of. His demeanor on screen was menacing and worked well.However creative this film is it does have some problems though. For one it's not long enough. It barely runs an hour and twenty minutes and the transitioning in some scenes was a little messy. It definitely could have used a few more scenes maybe character development longer conversation something. It just felt like it was over much too fast. There a few plot holes in this movie too some are a little ridiculous and I don't think anybody with half a brain can miss the one at the end. I think the writers could have worked around these but they were just kind of left in there. I liked the finale of the movie and it was very wellplayed but don't expect the murderer's explanation to be anything logical. It's a little out there and it's not realistic and his special effectsladen demise is a little on the campy side  but again I have to admit that it's quite imaginative and different so I'm not going to rag on it too much.The acting isn't bad as far as I'm concerned. Molly Ringwald is excellent playing a role that very obviously is making fun of herself. The no longer bigname Hollywood actress who is still very much a diva returns to acting in a slasher film she began when she was quite popular. The parallels between the character and Ringwald's film career are obvious and she plays the part perfectly. She's likable rude and funny  strange mix. The rest of the cast consists of Australian actors the most notable is Jessica Napier as our secondary heroine. Singer Kylie Minogue also has a small role in the beginning as the illfated director of 'Hot Blooded'. The performances overall weren't unbearable but Ringwald is the one who really shines here.Overall Cut is an entertaining and creative little slasher picture that doesn't aim to be a film classic. It's schlocky and campy and it's nowhere near perfect. But it's a selfaware horror movie that manages to balance an imaginative idea while making fun of itself all along the way like a throwback to '80s splatter movies. It's got enough positives and is definitely worth a watch for horror fans. Anyone else will likely be displeased with it but if you know slasher movies well this is a pretty entertaining flick. 610.".

There are a few flaws to this one mainly from the fact that this one's lowbudget roots come through quite clearly mostly with the crew for the movie shoot the general lack of extras or going around on different locations being forced at the house here for the whole film and the overall presentation throughout here. It's pretty difficult to look at this any other way due to how this looks and feels which gives this such a troubling facet that it really lowers this. As well there's also the rather complicated facets associated with the killer here as the origin is pretty off as he was originally an actor killed onset in the original setup yet is claimed to be a supernatural killer based on the people who're trying to film the movie which makes no sense at all. The only other factor against this one is the shortened length which really feels out of from what it could've been by really rushing through the main sections without really doing a whole lot about it while keeping the finale a bit constrained from what it could've been.

Somehow without giving much away a monster is born because it's created by the idea in the script...seems a bit out there for me. On the other hand the all original killer looked and acted great on screen. What they lacked in a plot or in Award winning acting is completely made up for as the body count grows height and the plot thickens. To be completely frank I started out watching what I thought was going to be a terrible old no budget throw away but by the end found myself on the edge of my seat actually enjoying myself.

It's like once the real film started the fun died.The aesthetics of the opening scene work well and the result is a terrific parody of mad slasher movies. The framing of the opening shots are so overwhelmingly yellow and Molly Ringwald's acting is so overthetop that the whole sequence is very funny on par with the Scream movies. Unfortunately the reminder of the movie did not have a fraction of inspiration or style.My big complaint about this movie is that the premise of the murders are set up to make you think that one of the young cast members is the killer. So as the movie progresses you're trying to deduce who it is which can be fun. Not that I would dream of revealing the outcome but suffice it to say that the explanation of who the killer is  in a word  sucks! And what should be an exciting climax is quite dull.I only have two requests of a movie in order to be entertained and that is that they a keep my attention and b arouse some emotion. Aside from boredom the only emotion I felt while watching this movie was sympathy for Molly Ringwald. Her talents are just plain wasted here. Hopefully being in this movie hasn't discouraged her from ever going back to Austraila".

The film has a curse on it because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But she's back because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately the curse is still there and people start dying on the set. Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern slasher but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact it rips half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Lots of filmworld namedropping a la Scream except it's Aussie namedroppingJane Campion...see how this isn't as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la New Nightmare. The editing is bad the music is annoying the effects are laughable almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately the film can have a sense of humor at one point a welldressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at Don't worry we'll treat your house as if it were our own to which he responds that doesn't mean anything to me you look like you live in a dump!

Now a couple of film students have decided to finish the film despite the fact that there's a rumor that the film is cursed. Well they're about to find out that some curses are real.When Scream was released every country seemed to want to cash in on its success even Australia. The concept which today has been done to death a slasher film within a slasher film was at the time relatively cool and original. This movie was released right before Urban Legends Final Cut and Scream 3 well not in the US but in Australia so it felt like the first movie with this concept. When Urban Legends 2 was released most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn't even good the movie flopped disastrously. Now Cut is not the best slasher flick ever and nor does it try to be. It knows that it's a ripoff and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of Neve Campbell in the starring role. But instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story they've decided to ripoff some 80s slasher flicks like Nightmare on Elm Street as well and surprisingly enough this actually works. The killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer! And instead of trying to scare the audience to death they've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie. There are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that I wasn't able to fully ignore the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie. Spoiler ahead I mean they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene? It makes no sense I tell you. End of spoilers. All in all Cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but I consider this to be one of the better Scream ripoffs that never made it big. I'm surprised that this one never got a sequel but I guess it simply came out too late. Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares. Cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and I will have to recommend this one even though I consider the story to be quite silly since it's completely ludicrous.".

The Day the Sky Exploded begins as if it is going to be a spaceflight adventure but instead treats the space flight in a realistic almost mundane manner before proceeding to reveal the real plot  concerning the meteors. The astronaut nicely played by Hubschmidt is forced to eject from the nuclear powered rocket and the rocket flies off to .... where? before you know it a cluster of meteors probably blown off of some planet or perhaps the moon is threatening to destroy the earth. Some of the 'scientists' allude to unknown religious beliefs and seem to think that some great big meanie out there has it in for us because we've ventured off our planet in a serious way for the first time like the perspective offered by Star Trek First Contact inverted. The plot begins with the rocket launch and a great feeling of optimism and then proceeds into panic and then a feeling of inevitable doom as nobody seems able to come up with an adequate solution.There are also some amusing but really unnecessary romantic elements and some decent character development which help to round the film out in a general way. The acting is generally good but there are a few really odd moments where people seem either too calm or absurdly evocative given the circumstances they are dealing with. There are also a couple of bad moments for the script which may be a result of translation problems from the film's native language.I have noticed a lot of people making fun of the special effects. Sure the dozens of stock footage clips of rockets being launched is overdone and yeah some of the scenes showing people and cars moving around in the parking lot of an unidentified building are kind of funny but I actually enjoyed the primitive but creatively filmed scenes of asteroids and explosions. They were at the very least more artistically designed than some of what appears in contemporary films with similarly low budgets.".

Interestingly the film's original Italian title LA MORTE VIENE DALLO SPAZIO translates to DEATH COMES FROM OUTER SPACE this was picked up and slightly altered a few years later by another Spaghetti scifi entry i.e. Antonio Margheriti's LA MORTE VIENE DAL PIANETA AYTIN aka THE SNOW DEVILS 1967 besides the film's English title was probably inspired by another contemporary scifi cheapie i.e. Fred F.

The film under review emerges as a reasonably enjoyable and aboveaverage entry but probably stemming from a very limited budget is bogged down by a talky script and much stock footage of rocket launchings and people rushing into underground shelters. The cast is also somewhat undernourished but does include Paul Fritz Lang's Indian EPIC diptych 195859 Hubschmid Ivo Bava's BLACK Sunday 1960 Garrani and Giacomo KILL BABYKILL!

A combined ItalianFrench effort this film was the basis for Meteor Deep Impact and Armageddon many years later. The special effects are very good for the era. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that it showed U.S.Russian cooperation for peaceful means at the hight of the cold war very different than most movies of the time. The other similar movie of the 1950's about a collision with Earth is When Worlds Collide. However even though When Worlds Collide is in color this is the better and more realistic of the two films. Also there is less damage to the Earth in this movie than in Meteor Deep Impact and especially When Worlds Collide where the earth gets completely destroyed. It is interesting to see primitive computers and airplanes of the time. If you like Deep Impact and Armageddon you need to see this film that those two movies were based on.".

First instead of subtitles it was dubbed into English. Some of the voices are just terrible such as the reporter and the whiny sounding kid and I always prefer subtitles. Additionally since this film is brought to us by Alpha Video you can safely assume the print will be terriblewhich it definitely is. While some of Alpha's films are great because they aren't available elsewhere too often they are grainy and never have captions. They are strictly a gradez producer of DVDsand this is no exception.In addition even if the film was subbed and a pristine copy it would still only perhaps merit a 5. Overall a forgettable film.".

	schema:headline " Decent nobudget apocalyptic thriller that pleased me more than modern bigbudget ripoffs!";
	schema:reviewBody "One problem that has long bothered most filmmakers since the dawn of cinema is the smokeandmirrors magic act itselfnamely getting big great creative ideas that movie watchers will be interested in and like while getting these ideas across in as budgetconscious a manner as possible. Take this film 'The Day the Sky Exploded' for instance but make sure you give it backI liked it LOL.

Usually in older films this isn't bothersome to me simply because it was so widespread and thus expected to a certain extent but that doesn't mean it was right. For example the only two principal women in the film are the wife of the main astronaut who basically is left to complaining that she doesn't get enough attention from him while the world is in chaos and a math expert considered 'cold' because she dares to simply think about her job who basically falls to pieces when the going gets tough though to her credit she comes to her senses. And playing the devil's advocate for a moment it was kind of crappy that it was a Russian who went crazy and made thinks difficult for the scientists who were binding together to try and save the world. But those are minor nitpickings.It made me very happy to watch this valiant cinematic attempt. It left me far more satisfied than later bigbudget efforts in the area such as 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. Some fanfare for the common man please! ".

My favorite footage were the crowd scenes. No matter where in the world they took place the sound man used the same 10second loop of some bizarre crowd noise almost like that of a circus audience going wild and which includes an abbreviated scream or shout that sounds like a macaw or parrot shrieking. I came to look forward to those crowd running wild segments and that repeated sound effect to keep from falling asleep. The acting isn't all that bad and the leading man a foreignborn Gordon Tarzan Scott lookalike is actually pretty good. About half the movie is composed of stock footage so be prepared. Only two or three babes in the entire movie and none is worth writing home about  which is really sad considering this was an Italian job from 1958 smack dab in the era of pointy bras and Gina Lollabrigida.

The characters are pure cardboard and character development is strictly by rote.And the whole thing is filmed in black and white.On the other hand if you view this 'naively' as if you hadn't already seen Meteor Deep Impact or Armaggeddeon it's possible to appreciate the abrupt change of the movie's story arc from exciting space adventure to End of the World Suspense Thriller as the seemingly happy escape of the astronaut from his malfunctioning atomic rocket leads to unexpected consequences. If you think about it that was a pretty creative conception for the time. The Eurocentric aspect of the production also gives the movie a somewhat unusual feel even if the romantic lead is supposed to be American actually he was Swiss! Most of the actors are pretty good at fleshing out their cardboard characters with one or two exceptions  for instance the little boy obviously had no idea of what he was doing.The direction is workmanlike and much of the live cinematography is really pretty good  moody lighting stark chiaroscuro outlines good compositions etc.And the editors do a much better job of integrating the stock footage into the movie than many other examples of the genre say the original Invasion USA  the movie doesn't feel nearly as disconnected and airless as it might have in less skillful hands. The Day... suffers a bit from a lessthanstellar dubbing into English  there are bits of awkward dialog and tineared readings that cost this movie at least one star in my judgment. But I've heard far worse and the problems here aren't enough to ruin the movie watching.I saw this movie as part of the Nightmare Worlds 50 movie compilation and I would say it is easily the best of the 10 movies I've found time to watch so far.".

Most of the actors are pretty good at fleshing out their cardboard characters with one or two exceptions  for instance the little boy obviously had no idea of what he was doing.The direction is workmanlike and much of the live cinematography is really pretty good  moody lighting stark chiaroscuro outlines good compositions etc.And the editors do a much better job of integrating the stock footage into the movie than many other examples of the genre say the original Invasion USA  the movie doesn't feel nearly as disconnected and airless as it might have in less skillful hands. The Day... suffers a bit from a lessthanstellar dubbing into English  there are bits of awkward dialog and tineared readings that cost this movie at least one star in my judgment. But I've heard far worse and the problems here aren't enough to ruin the movie watching.I saw this movie as part of the Nightmare Worlds 50 movie compilation and I would say it is easily the best of the 10 movies I've found time to watch so far.";

Welles is a master craftsman. He made great films period. In an interview he said that the studio cut out  a couple of reels that take place in South America at the beginning of the story that he felt was the best part of the movie. As a viewer I feel that the film is compact and taut. Adding more to it would not helpin my opinion. On the contrary I think adding more might make the film sluggish. As it stands the film remains dark. You feel that evil is present. You are just not sure what is going to happen next.The performances in this film are for the most part excellent. Edward G. Robinson is amazing. This could have been a cardboard thin goodguy part. Instead he turns the character of Wilson into a smart cunning hero. He is selfassured not obsessed. He understands what most people in the town don't Kindler is a monster who is capable of anything. To catch such a man you have to be several steps ahead of him. Also excellent is Konstantin Shayne as Meinike. You can see the fear and madness in his eyes as he repeats I am travelling for my health I am travelling for my health... before going through customs. Make no mistake this man is an obscenity that must be destroyed to quote Wilson. Just look at his scene with the photographer in South America. He is used to people following his orders. Welles is also very good as KindlerRankin. There are moments that you actually feel sympathy for him. His obsession with fixing the town clock is very significant. Here is a man who needs things to be precise and structured. He wants total control of his environmenta good example is how he treats his wife. Welles hints at this man's mania but keeps him human. Even though you want him to be caught you can't help wondering if he'll get away. Loretta Young is unfortunately just average in this film. She has some good moments especially in the final scene when she confronts RankinKindlerbut her hysterics are just too much. The scene where Wilson is showing her the Nazi atrocities is well played. She keeps a certain composure that works well.Overall a very well made thriller with top notch performances and solid direction by one of cinema's masters. I give it 8 clock towers out of 10.".

He is suppose to be the one who came up with the Nazi plan of mass annihilation. There is no evidence nor any photographs of Kindler. To find Franz Wilson releases Kindler's assistant Konrad. Konrad inadvertently leads Wilson to Harper Connecticut. Kindler is hiding out at an all boys school as a professor named Charles Rankin. Konrad arrives on Charles' wedding day. He is getting married to the daughter of a liberal Supreme Court justice.This movie is definitely film noir in the lighting and the grittiness of the events. It is also quite evident that this movie was directed by Welles himself. If you have seen any one of his movies you can see how he functions. The story is enjoyable if not slightly predictable especially if you have seen other film noir films or have listened to any golden age radio programs. Overall it is nice to see Edward G. Robinson playing the good guy for a change. I also thought Billy House had a standout performance as Mr. Potter the owner of the local general store. He provides most of the comedy relief.

	schema:headline " Fascinating Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The Stranger was directed by Orson Welles but he did not adapt it to the screen.  Although this is seen as a detraction from the whole by some who have seen it I believe that Welles' deft directing and penetrating acting is what makes this a Welles film for my taste.  He was never a facile actor  but he uses his usual wooden countenance here to the advantage of this role.Another thing that fascinates me is the underrated status of this engrossing thriller.  The action and suspense builds and builds to a peak of excitement that few movies can reach without lots of special effects and Foley work these days.  This movie fascinates at every turn without ever seeming as if we are watching art.  But art it was in Welles' direction and gentle handling of the unravelling.Edward G. Robinson is the subtle but welcome prize we receive from this outing.  The undercurrents of the horrors that have just come before this movie was made and its actions can be seen seething within his duty to find hidden Nazis.  He is methodical and intelligent it so difficult to see the difference between Robinson the man and Robinson the actor here.  He is such a talent that we often mistake his ease for something else but acting  and of acting he was a master.  Plainly seen here as a gift to all of us.What I like about this and many other good films is how facts are revealed slowly layer by layer.  Loretta Young was good as the innocent young girl who believes that marriage is a sacred institution that life has a course to follow which will not be derailed and finds it hard to accept the truth of the horrors behind her marriage.It was mildly amusing to see a very young Richard Long as the openminded young man with whom Robinson's character confides certain facts.I recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers mysteries and of course of Mr. Orson Welles.  So sad that the studio heads were such disingenuous towards this utter genius of a man who deserved more earnest accolades in his life.THE STRANGER is not glittering masterpiece but it's a hell of great story that I do not tire of watching...and seeing each piece of the puzzle fall into place.What MORE could an intelligent person want from a movie?".

The action and suspense builds and builds to a peak of excitement that few movies can reach without lots of special effects and Foley work these days.  This movie fascinates at every turn without ever seeming as if we are watching art.  But art it was in Welles' direction and gentle handling of the unravelling.Edward G. Robinson is the subtle but welcome prize we receive from this outing.  The undercurrents of the horrors that have just come before this movie was made and its actions can be seen seething within his duty to find hidden Nazis.  He is methodical and intelligent it so difficult to see the difference between Robinson the man and Robinson the actor here.  He is such a talent that we often mistake his ease for something else but acting  and of acting he was a master.  Plainly seen here as a gift to all of us.What I like about this and many other good films is how facts are revealed slowly layer by layer.  Loretta Young was good as the innocent young girl who believes that marriage is a sacred institution that life has a course to follow which will not be derailed and finds it hard to accept the truth of the horrors behind her marriage.It was mildly amusing to see a very young Richard Long as the openminded young man with whom Robinson's character confides certain facts.I recommend it to fans of psychological thrillers mysteries and of course of Mr. Orson Welles.  So sad that the studio heads were such disingenuous towards this utter genius of a man who deserved more earnest accolades in his life.THE STRANGER is not glittering masterpiece but it's a hell of great story that I do not tire of watching...and seeing each piece of the puzzle fall into place.What MORE could an intelligent person want from a movie?";

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Cowie's THE CINEMA OF ORSON WELLES does not say much in favor of this film. He felt it was a minor work and in a sense it is. Welles having failed in Hollywood terms to produce a blockbuster box office success with KANE AMBERSONS and IT'S ALL TRUE had demonstrated more success as a film actor JANE EYRE in the 1940s than as a director. He wanted to show he was able to create a successful film at the box office and so he agreed to direct this small thriller. But it lacks the depth of the major films of his career and so Cowie is correct to label it minor. That does not mean it isn't interesting. Welles was the one of the first directors to tackle the issue of missing Nazi war criminals. The same year as THE STRANGER Hitchcock was filming NOTORIOUS and Charles Vidor did GILDA. All three tackled the plight of fleeing Nazis. NOTORIOUS is about Nazi and Nazi sympathizers led by Claude Rains as Alex Sebastian in Rio De Janairo who are plotting some deviltry involving uranium Hitch's MacGuffin. GILDA's complicated plot deals with George Macready as Balin Munsen double crossing German industrialists who trusted him with contracts and papers giving the owner title to their tungsten interests in Argentina. THE STRANGER deals with the search by Wilson a government agent for one Franz Kindler a leading Nazi who has fled first to Latin America and then to the United States. It turns out that the devious and clever Kindler has wormed his way into a marriage to the daughter of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Longstreet. In each case as you see the fact that the Reich has fallen does not mean the danger is over  the Nazis are planning a comeback.It has been noted that Welles based Kindler on the character of Martin Bormann the missing deputy to Hitler and leading adviser in his inner circle. Bormann had back stabbed his way to power at the expense of his predecessor Rudolf Hess. Hess had been showing signs of cracking up by 1941that Bormann fully took advantage of and then flew to England in a mad attempt to settle the war there before the invasion of Russia. However Bormann unlike Kindler was not the creator of the final solution in the movie  that was Bormann's rival Reinhard Heydrich. Heydrich had been assassinated in 1942 so he was dead and buried years before the war's end and the Nuremburg Trials where Bormann was found guilty and condemned to death in absentia. I might add another missing Nazi leader is in everyone's mind  Welles has Konrad Meinike Kindler's assistant tell people he is on a mission from the all highest. The deranged Meinike means God but everyone including Kindler thinks he means the seemingly indestructible and missing Adolf Hitler. Details from Soviet archives proving Hitler's suicide were not published until the 1980s.The film follows the efforts of Wilson in tracking down the missing Kindler. He allows Meinike to get out of prison he was facing a death sentence to follow him. Meinike does lead Wilson through Latin America to a town in Connecticut where Kindler is hiding as Charles Rankin a history teacher in a prep school where the sons of the nation's elite are groomed for their paths to leadership. Although it is barely commented on in the movie KindlerRankin is in a lovely position to influence the future leaders of the country  to indoctrinate them into neoNazis theories. He is laying a groundwork to protect himself but to continue the Nazi theories. In one scene he mentions the need to destroy the Germans because of their habitual warlike natures. But he retains a dislike of Jews in the scene mentioned above he insists Karl Marx is a Jew not a German.The film has been cut by nearly half an hour. This was the start of the film which dealt with Meinike's escape and his journey followed by Wilson to and through Latin America. We see the conclusion when he confronts a photographer who knows where Kindler is hiding. But the missing footage would have been very good to watch  it was a double build up to revealing that the evil Kindler was still alive but also to lead to the irony of the insane Meinike's seeking out his missing boss to convert him to Christianity only to be murdered by him. The sequence of the killing of Meinike is a great set piece and one wishes the missing footage were still available because it would be a fine ironic conclusion. One can here as in the slashed up AMBERSONS see what Welles' concept was meant to be and what the audience was left with.The individual portions of the film are quite good in particular the bits with Billy House as Mr. Potter and the paper chase sequence. The finale is good too. Kindler is a fanatic about clocks repairing them whenever he needs recreation. The town's Gothic church has a broken medieval clock with figures. Kindler manages to repair it so the figures move. In the end of the film he is hiding in the tower and comments on watching the townspeople searching for him  they look like ants to him as he feels like God his conversation here sounds very like that of Welles' signature bad guy role Harry Lime in THE THIRD MAN made four years later  Lime also looks at the ants from the ferris wheel in Vienna. When confronted by Mary Longstreet Rankin Charles bewildered and angry wife played by Loretta Young and Wilson Rankin gets killed by the clock figures. It was to be expected and it is one bang  up conclusion to the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Stranger is a little slow to start. Edward G. Robinson playing a war crimes detective named Wilson lets loose one of the righthand men of an important Nazi war criminal named Franz Kindler Orson Welles who escaped prison and managed to erase his identity. He was the mastermind behind the concentration camps. No photographs exist of him and only this goon might know where he is. Wilson tracks the goon to a small town in Connecticut where Franz Kindler is posing as a history professor about to marry the daughter of an important politician. Immediately the goon disappears but the professor arouses Wilson's suspicion.After the setup is over The Stranger bolts ahead at a breathless pace. All the clues point to the professor though there is nothing definitive. When his wife Mary finds out played by Loretta Young she refuses to believe it. Kindler feeds her a nice lie explaining everything and she's desperate to believe it. He's not sure that he can trust her.Welles pulls a ton of suspense out of the situation. He's so good at creating points of tension out of both the simplest means like a group of college boys on a paper chase a dog who won't stop digging in the leaves or something much more gothic like the ancient brokendown clock in the church tower. Kindler was an expert on clocks which is one of the biggest clues and when he revives this old monster an iron angel with a sword chases away the devil and then rings the bell to the hour. To get to the top of the tower an extraordinarily tall ladder must be climbed. This leads to as much or more suspense as existed in the cognate scenes in Hitchcock's Vertigo. In fact I'm sure Hitchcock watched and liked this film. Everyone knows he admired Welles' later Touch of Evil which he mimicked in his own Psycho so why not this film?The acting is quite brilliant as well. We would expect it from Orson Welles of course. This is actually one of his very best roles. He is amazing at telling believable lies to his wife and friends but with the dramatic irony in which the audience is in possession we see the depth and the nervousness and the evil. Edward G. Robinson has a pretty thankless role for a long time but nearer the end he begins to expand. We cringe when he coldly suggests that Mary is in mortal danger. He is simply great in the climactic scene which I won't mention except to say that it is one of the best in film history although some might find it a bit silly. Loretta Young is also great as a naive wife who so desperately wants to be the perfect wife and believe everything her husband says. If this movie were to be remade today her character would have been developed further psychologically but what is here is good. She is also great in the climactic sequence.Welles' films often have thriller elements but this is his most thrilling. It's also probably his least philosophical and almost certainly his most conventional. He made the film as a concession. I think he was allowed to make The Lady of Shanghai in return which is an even better film than this. That is no matter though. It's a masterpiece anyway. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Orson Welles although he had to give in to studio demands in terms of casting still managed to direct himself and the rest of his players into a pretty good man hunt thriller in The Stranger. The cast change was to put Edward G. Robinson in the role of the hunter of fugitive Nazi Franz Kindler played by Welles. Originally Welles wanted one of his Mercury Theater players Agnes Moorehead in the part. At that time it would have been quite a blow for feminism and probably would have made The Stranger a feminist landmark. As it is Edward G. Robinson brings his own truth and conviction to the role.Orson Welles is the fugitive Kindler who is modeled upon the then at large Martin Bormann. We never learned that Bormann had in fact been killed by the Russians who just never bothered to tell us until the early seventies. Bormann in his time was the most wanted man at least in the capitalist world. Bormann did not originate the 'final solution' mass extermination policy for Jews and other undesirables but like Kindler in the film and unlike some of the others of Hitler's gang he did have a passion for anonymity. It made hunting for him that much the harder.Another one of the Nazi small fry Konstantin Shayne is allowed to escape jail and the hangman in the hopes that he'll lead the authorities to Welles. Shayne performs on schedule and Welles is forced to kill him in order to keep his his new identity as a teacher at an exclusive prep school for America's WASP elite. Welles has also married Loretta Young the daughter of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice to make his entry into the elite complete. Robinson had lost Shayne's trail before he was killed but knows his man is in that small New England town. Robinson settles down in the town posing as an antique dealer and fishes for information as to who his prey is posing as.Welles got a very good performance out of Loretta Young in the same year she won her Oscar for The Farmer's Daughter. It does slowly dawn on her but she refuses to believe the man she married only married her for a respectable identity. Her slow realization is what makes her performance a good one.Others noteworthy in the cast are a young Richard Long as Young's brother who Robinson takes into his confidence early and Billy House as the storekeepercheckers hustler. You can see traces of Welles's technique from such earlier work like Citizen Kane. One of my favorite shots reminiscent of the deep focus cinematography of Citizen Kane is when Welles is in House's store playing checkers. He's got a hobby clocks that is one key to his identity. He is fixing a clock tower in the town square and loosens the peg on a ladder needed to get to the clock. It was meant for Young who was supposed fall and break her neck but Robinson discovers it. As Welles is playing checkers with House you can see the tower between the two men through the window of House's store. Then the camera moves in closer as Welles's voice keeps talking at about the time he figured Young would be falling from the ladder. It was setting a careful alibi for a crime that had been foiled but of course Welles doesn't know that yet. Pure Citizen Kane.The Stranger doesn't compare either to Citizen Kane but it's still a much better than average noir thriller. And the ending is really outstanding. The sword of justice does indeed find its mark.".

Robinson settles down in the town posing as an antique dealer and fishes for information as to who his prey is posing as.Welles got a very good performance out of Loretta Young in the same year she won her Oscar for The Farmer's Daughter. It does slowly dawn on her but she refuses to believe the man she married only married her for a respectable identity. Her slow realization is what makes her performance a good one.Others noteworthy in the cast are a young Richard Long as Young's brother who Robinson takes into his confidence early and Billy House as the storekeepercheckers hustler. You can see traces of Welles's technique from such earlier work like Citizen Kane. One of my favorite shots reminiscent of the deep focus cinematography of Citizen Kane is when Welles is in House's store playing checkers. He's got a hobby clocks that is one key to his identity. He is fixing a clock tower in the town square and loosens the peg on a ladder needed to get to the clock. It was meant for Young who was supposed fall and break her neck but Robinson discovers it. As Welles is playing checkers with House you can see the tower between the two men through the window of House's store. Then the camera moves in closer as Welles's voice keeps talking at about the time he figured Young would be falling from the ladder. It was setting a careful alibi for a crime that had been foiled but of course Welles doesn't know that yet. Pure Citizen Kane.The Stranger doesn't compare either to Citizen Kane but it's still a much better than average noir thriller. And the ending is really outstanding. The sword of justice does indeed find its mark.";

The noir cinematography is tricky although quite extreme and selfconscious and the film has value as a period piece with lots of local color that makes it a travelogue into the past.Otherwise  hold your noses!".

Here he has imperfect momentssuch as the scene where his character is frantically and inexplicably trying to pick up pieces of paperbut everything else is splendid especially the climax.As an actor he's always compelling but I think he makes one bad choice here.

It makes us wonder why no one suspects him and it robs us of a dramatic contrast when he begins to realize he's in imminent danger.Loretta Young is generally a dull actress. She doesn't have enough skill to make an impression in the early scenes but once the part requires histrionics she performs her duties well enough. Certainly her character is morally dubious and therefore fascinating in itself.The best performance by far is Edward G. Robinson's.

I've given up trying to work out where the midwest is supposed to be. I've decided it must comprise everywhere in America except California and Florida.What is good about the movie?  Edward G.

The photography is usually good sometimes very good with some very nice composition and use of light and shadow but not much of it is exactly jawdropping. A few scenes contain nice little writerdirector touches and if you wanted to you could probably pick the film apart finding symbolism in the repeated motifs of clocks checkerboards and so on but again I didn't find that any of this particularly bowled me over.What was bad about it?  Welles is completely unconvincing as the Nazi and just looks overly dramatic and silly most of the time. Most of the rest of the cast are similarly unimpressive. The storyline is disappointingly predictable and what are I suppose meant to be plot twists usually fall flat.  Minor Spoilers For instance Robinson suddenly wakes up in the middle of the night after a dinner party because he's realised that Welles' comment about Jews not being Germans is the sort of thing a Nazi would say. You mean up till then he'd been suckered by that lame speech after formerly being convinced he had his man? Good God! I thought he'd just been playing along. And what about the scene where Robinson decides that Welles might try to kill his wife but this might be the only way to catch him so we'll have to just see what happens but he does tell the aged maid to keep an eye on her!

	schema:headline " Atmospheric but surprisingly superficial postwar Wellesian melodrama that simply lacks a convincing story line.";
	schema:reviewBody "A particular disappointment for those who recognize Orson Welles as a film innovator and genius.  Despite many critic's belief that The Stranger is a minor masterpiece the truth is that it's little more than a convoluted piece of propaganda intended to assuage the feelings of postwar audiences. On the plus side director Welles does manage to show a stylish touch here and there and the stark blackandwhite photography evokes a somber and appropriately eerie pall over the proceedings.  But nothing can overcome the banal increasingly preposterous story line which by some miracle received an Oscar nomination.Topbilled Edward G. Robinson plays a federal agent who has assigned himself the task of finding a heinous soughtafter Nazi war criminal who played a principal role in the operation of concentration camps.  By cleverly allowing the escape of a minor Nazi figure Robinson hopes that Nazi minor will lead him to the whereabouts of Nazi major.  As the action unfolds the trail quickly leads to a quaint quiet seemingly unaffected  Connecticut town.Welles' batting average at this point of his film career was poor.  He had struck out profitably with his prior three movies but producer Sam Spiegel gave Welles this final opportunity to prove he COULD churn out a movie on time and within the budget.  For Welles the result was remunerative and commercially successful.  But at such a cost!  While the studio was appreciative Welles himself called it the worst film of his career and I couldn't agree more.  It probably succeeded because the film's content struck a politically correct chord with its 1946 postwar audiences.  I can think of no other reason.Accenting this suspense melodrama with shadowy camera angles and wonderful portraitlike closeups of his stars Welles shows surprisingly little of the inventiveness he is known for.  Everything  seems rehashed including a strikingly reminiscent clock tower finale a la Alfred Hitchcock.  Moreover Welles dilutes most of the film's suspense with stale ineptly drawn poorly motivated characters  most of them sacked with implausible dialogue and situations.  Even the musical score is obtrusive and obvious.Wisely understated Robinson comes off best here as the dogged agent whose instincts do not fail him as he ferrets out his suspect.  His character's tone seems balanced direct and realistic which is truly welcomed for he is surrounded by a cast of overemoters.Welles the director comes off marginally better than Welles the actor.  He plays the smalltown professorturnedsuspect as if he were Macbeth in a production of Our Town.  His classical demeanor just doesn't jell.  At least his Nazi isn't a caricature but his intense incessant brooding here quickly turns mechanical registering every sinister act and intention with a wide fixated stony gaze.  One of his few good moments occurs at a dinner table sequence when he is allowed to expound on everything from Marxism to the mental restoration of postwar Germans. Loretta Young is the chief violator of most of the film's acting problems. As the unsuspecting wife of Welles' character who refuses to see the obvious she is simply unconvincing in her many scenes unleashing a plethora of emotions none of them coming from anywhere real.  Her reactions are overbaked and at times unintentionally amusing as she feigns shock disbelief false bravado and everything else under the sun.  The dialogue served on her certainly doesn't help either. But the most frustrating aspect of this film is that Welles in order to advance the plot allows his characters to do such silly unsubtle nimbleminded things.  Neither Robinson's methods of tracking down his man nor Welles' ability to elude the ever tightening dragnet are done with much intelligence.  One wonders how they ever achieved their stations in life. And poor Loretta!  She is practically offered up as a sacrificial lamb just to expose her husband's true identity when other methods could have utilized just as well!  While The Stranger cannot seriously damage Orson Welles' reputation as a masterful but frustrated filmmaker it certainly does nothing to enhance it.".

He had struck out profitably with his prior three movies but producer Sam Spiegel gave Welles this final opportunity to prove he COULD churn out a movie on time and within the budget.  For Welles the result was remunerative and commercially successful.  But at such a cost!  While the studio was appreciative Welles himself called it the worst film of his career and I couldn't agree more.  It probably succeeded because the film's content struck a politically correct chord with its 1946 postwar audiences.  I can think of no other reason.Accenting this suspense melodrama with shadowy camera angles and wonderful portraitlike closeups of his stars Welles shows surprisingly little of the inventiveness he is known for.  Everything  seems rehashed including a strikingly reminiscent clock tower finale a la Alfred Hitchcock.  Moreover Welles dilutes most of the film's suspense with stale ineptly drawn poorly motivated characters  most of them sacked with implausible dialogue and situations.  Even the musical score is obtrusive and obvious.Wisely understated Robinson comes off best here as the dogged agent whose instincts do not fail him as he ferrets out his suspect.  His character's tone seems balanced direct and realistic which is truly welcomed for he is surrounded by a cast of overemoters.Welles the director comes off marginally better than Welles the actor.  He plays the smalltown professorturnedsuspect as if he were Macbeth in a production of Our Town.  His classical demeanor just doesn't jell.  At least his Nazi isn't a caricature but his intense incessant brooding here quickly turns mechanical registering every sinister act and intention with a wide fixated stony gaze.  One of his few good moments occurs at a dinner table sequence when he is allowed to expound on everything from Marxism to the mental restoration of postwar Germans. Loretta Young is the chief violator of most of the film's acting problems. As the unsuspecting wife of Welles' character who refuses to see the obvious she is simply unconvincing in her many scenes unleashing a plethora of emotions none of them coming from anywhere real.  Her reactions are overbaked and at times unintentionally amusing as she feigns shock disbelief false bravado and everything else under the sun.  The dialogue served on her certainly doesn't help either. But the most frustrating aspect of this film is that Welles in order to advance the plot allows his characters to do such silly unsubtle nimbleminded things.  Neither Robinson's methods of tracking down his man nor Welles' ability to elude the ever tightening dragnet are done with much intelligence.  One wonders how they ever achieved their stations in life. And poor Loretta!  She is practically offered up as a sacrificial lamb just to expose her husband's true identity when other methods could have utilized just as well!  While The Stranger cannot seriously damage Orson Welles' reputation as a masterful but frustrated filmmaker it certainly does nothing to enhance it.";

It's a pleasure to see a work of art like this film which displays skillful attention to detail in every frame. I know there are those who would argue that this is a hack piece for the great Welles but the stylish look of it is beautiful and while there may be a few plot flaws who cares? There's murder political intrigue suspense a little gore and a wronged woman not to mention a few cutesy downhome characters to boot. What more d'ya want from a thriller?Mr. Welles functions impressively in his dual capacity as director while acting the title role a character who is also playing a dual role come to think of it giving a nuanced performance as escaped Naziinhiding Franz Kindler mastermind of the genocidal Final Solution all the while applying his directorial genius to the piece. Edward G. Robinson is wonderfully restrained as the infinitely patient and unflappable Mr. Wilson a Gman devoted to his job of hunting down and delivering WWII criminals to justice. Viewers are led along with Mr. Wilson to find the evil Herr Kindler living incognito in a small town in New England having insinuated himself into the lives of the unsuspecting townsfolk most notably the beautiful and sweet but none too bright Mary played by Loretta Young. Imagine this fiend lurking in an idyllic Connecticut hamlet waiting for the day when the Reich will rise again while in the meantime having the brass to enhance his cover by marrying the innocent young daughter of a Supreme Court Justice! The centerpiece of the town and the film is the clock tower at the Harper School for Boys where Kindler has assumed the guise of Professor Charles Rankin. The clock tower offers a thrilling cinematic focus as we often find ourselves in and around it never venturing far from it beginning with the first moment when we see it on a picture postcard right up to the exciting conclusion when the clock itself takes on an integral anthropomorphic role in the administration of justice. Of course the image of the clock tower and its dizzying visual and symbolic possibilities has since been employed in different ways by many a filmmaker from Hitchcock on down though not often on a par with Welles' diabolical vision. OK maybe not Citizen Kane maybe not Orson Welles' proudest moment but GREAT STUFF.".

This story by director Pappi Corsicato is loosely based on the novel The Marquise of O by Heinrich von Kleist with screenplay by Corsicato is about the beautiful Veronica Caterina Murino who owns an upscale women's clothing boutique in Naples and has a handsome but faithless husband Mario Alessandro Gassman who is a fertilizer salesman. The irony being that a fertilizer salesman is himself infertile and the couple is childless. Veronica runs the shop with assistant Nike Martina Stella who moonlights as an exotic dancer. A constant admirer of both Nike and Veronica is the building security guard Gabriele Michele Venitucci. Not knowing that Mario is unable to conceive Veronica's mother Valeria Fabrizi is constantly pressuring Veronica to make her a grandmother. One night on her way home from work Veronica is assaulted by two thugs. Gabriele to the apparent rescue chases them off. Soon after Mario learns he is sterile and Veronica learns she is pregnant. I don't know how a comedy that revolves around a rape is supposed to be funny but that's the premise here. the film looks good thanks to distinguished veteran cinematographer Ennio Guarnieri but the supposed comedy is about as forced as the assault. Overall a bad script bad dialog nonessential characters come in and out and a silly ending. I would give this a 5.0 out of 10 and would not recommend it.".

One night Veronica's monotone life turns into a bizarre twist after being assaulted in an alley on her way home and left unconscious being aided only by a security guard Michele Venitucci who beyond his good Samaritan speech is secretly in love of her but the weirdest consequence will surface weeks after the incident as she realizes she's pregnant... despite her husband's infertility driving her to follow any evidence able to lead her to identify the unknown perpetrator who raped and impregnated her.This movie is in fact a dramedy that relies on a tradition of spicy Italian comedies but without their festive eroticism. Quite the opposite there is something profoundly degrading in the story which also is the most interesting part however and paradoxically it never takes off because of the poorly acted onedimensional characters. Caterina Murino shines like a top model going through the catwalk but her acting is as abysmal as the way her character behaves. She does not have what it takes to portray such a complex role and that's precisely the reason why the whole scheme fails It never decides whether being a light moral tale or a sordid take on a bourgeoisie nightmare. The humor is not as dark and corrosive as its needed nor the dramatic elements are strong enough to feel involved with. The movie even deals with controversial themes like abortion and features some of the most shallow commentaries about real rape victims ever heard on film something as outrageous as the story itself.Screened at Venice Film Festival in 2008 this interesting story notsointerestingly crafted and developed into a disappointing movie has not better quality than any mediocre madeforTV prime time drama although it still remains as a film to be seen with ingredients worth to watch.".

Though after i saw the movie i was amazed at how well the writers and the director pulled it off.It is often said that horror is the most delicate type of movie because there is only a slight difference between scary and ridiculous. but this doesn't concern Dark Floors because it is not atleast in my mind a full blooded horror movie. The movie has many horror elements but doesn't still come off as horrorish. That doesn't make it bad it just means that you can't go in to the theater wishing that you will be scared out of your nickers.The visual and audio feel of the movie was excellent all the way and there is nothing anyone can say about that. The plot did leave a annoying amount of plot holes and the ending didn't really clear any of them up and the viewer was just left to quess what the plot was all about. Still it didn't bother half as much as the under use of the Lordi band members. I have never liked Lordi and never listened to them but while watching this movie i became interested in the different monsters they play. Sadly the plot did hardly nothing at all to use the unique backgrounds and looks of the different ghoul part from the different superpowers they all demonstrated. What i am saying is that i would have liked this movie to be more about the monsters than the victims... really who gave a goddamn thing for what happened to the all knowing copper or the businessman type. The only character i got even a bit curious was the weird hobo with superpowers and a weird telepathic relationship with the girl but he is never explained in any waya big mistake.In retrospect i think they could have done a lot more better but i also think that there is a lot of good in this film also and i hope it will be a success financially. There is just one thing Finns can't tolerate a successful Finnish movie if it is not a drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the Eurovision Song Contest with a notsoheavy metal song called Hard Rock Hallelujah and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters. But let's face it their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents. The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly  because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event. The absolute last thing Lordi's first and hopefully last horror film brings is change and ingenuity. Dark Floors based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichs. The immense budget Dark Floors supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive makeup art but what's the point where there's no story that is worth telling? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown. When the doors open again the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already. Trying to reach the exit the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles like eyeless corpses screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors. The only three points I'm handing out to Dark Floors are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film. For as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation the atmosphere is quite creepy but as soon as you realize the explanation will a be very stupid or b never come the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards. Lordi's costumes never really were scary to begin with except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans and in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghosthorror they just look downright pathetic and misfit. With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations I personally always presumed Finland  The Land of a Thousand Lakes  would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales but I guess that's another disillusion on my account.".

Audio was good too I thought.The story was pretty interesting and I didn't find it boring at any point. I think the introduction part of the movie could've been longer as we now almost instantly get thrown into the action. I'm sure many disagree with this but personally I thought the movie could've been a little longer and thereby a little slower paced at times.I have to admit I don't think I entirely understood the film and its ending which left me a little confused. Some story related things in the film were really cool like the time stopping and the people shooting at themselves. At this point I was expecting a little more of the movie and where it was heading and I was slightly disappointed in the end.The biggest problem for me watching the movie was that the monsters are indeed the members of Lordi and no matter how good they look I can't really be scared of them since I'm familiar with them. Not only that but also I found it a little weird how monsters that different from each other kept randomly showing up. I think it would've been a cooler movie or a few to only have one or two of these characters in a movie. I especially enjoyed Ox he looked really bad ass. Omen was also cool. No offense Mr Lordi but with him being the big boss at the end I can't say I was impressed. The other characters looked pretty sweet but him I found least scary. Of course this might be because I've seen him the most.I can't say for sure if I would've found the movie more scary if I didn't know the characters but I definitely think so.The actors did a good job I thought. No complaints there I bought it.Overall I did not expect too much of the movie. I saw a short trailer once I try to avoid trailers and reading too much up front to give me a totally fresh nothingknowing movie experience and it was pretty cool though I was afraid the characters might screw it up.I thought it was really stylish and the story had lots of potential. Maybe I'll understand it entirely some day when you guys comment on it. I will say though that I'm seeing too many horror movies concentrated on children and their drawings.  I feel like I forgot to comment on something but I guess I'll just stop here. I'll try to answer possible questions you may have.Ken".

Remember Cube? Even that film knew more about itself. I've consumed a lot of 80's horror  gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films. But a lot of important things are missing. We really know nothing about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines over and over again. The story isn't really developing  it never goes anywhere. Bacting is OK in this type of horror films but there's not much to act in the script. We don't care about the characters. There's nothing to remember about them. There's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly  no thrills no chills.You only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre. They show the Lordi monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story.I honestly believe that this amount of story character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment. Oh yeah film makers used to do that  and more  some 20 years ago! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended. Too bad really.".

And on second thought  who on earth gets scared nowadays by a stupid screaming ghost or a ghoul with too many teeth... Luckily for this movie  the monster apparitions are pretty rare and leave room for the rest of the things that make the movie actually good. Exquisite dark atmosphere reminding of Silent Hill creepy deserted hospital halls with bodies laying around but not too bloody lurking shadows all these keep you wandering what's going to happen next. The creepy little girl with long dark hair adds some spice on several occasions The Ring surly influenced a lot of movies... and the timespace distortionsreminding me of Hypercube are like topping on an icecream. You don't actually need more of a background story  it's the atmosphere and the suspense that drive the movie and the ending  while not giving any explanation it delivers the needed comfort. No ending in the to be continued style like 90 of today's horrors no useless gore with some psycho killer chopping body parts from stupid teenagers just one good fantasy horrorthriller. The only thing that messes the movie it's the Lordi  and if they would have created better monsers13 Ghosts would be an example with no rock band connection  this movie would have been much more appreciated.".

	schema:reviewBody "My expectations of this picture were admittedly pretty low but actually elements of it were not too bad and it at least requires the viewer to think about the possible meaning of what they are watching. While the script was lame in places on the whole it was acceptable and the acting was pretty solid allround as in not obviously awful!. The worst aspect of the film for me was not the lack of explanation as to what was going on  something that I know annoyed a lot of people  but rather the fact that the monsters ghosts etc were representations of the members of the band Lordi. I know this was a Lordi film and it's pretty obvious why this was done but it made the film a lot less creepy than it could otherwise have been. The end of the film was slightly disappointing for me not because of what happened but because it's attempt at an explanation of the previous events was weak and halfhearted. If you're going to end a film in that way at least do it with some conviction and a little more clarity than was offered here! Anyway many seem to have struggled to understand this film and as much as I have tried to understand it it doesn't actually make a great deal of sense to me either but for what it's worth here is my interpretationBear with me!The girl dies twice. The first time is in the machine at hospital. She then somehow returns to life and comes out of the machine in a critical condition albeit unknown to the hospital staff. Her cries for the 'red crayon' represent her fear of death and the sense of danger and confusion which she feels. Her father later tucks her into a hospital bed with no nurses present?! at which point she dies again shortly afterwards. The following events take place in my opinion inside the girls head at the points between her two deaths although triggered by her ultimate second death. Before her second and final death she is spoken to by Tobias although we cannot hear what he says to her. Tobias is also about to die an event which she senses due I suppose to her first brush with death. Confusing eh... The death of Tobias is imagined by the girl in her own deathstateinside the elevator which stops at the limbo point between floors 6 and 7. 6 representing Hell and 7 being Heaven. Time seems to stop at this point too although it would make more sense if time stopped at the point before the girls death as she lay in the hospital bed. Anyway upon exiting the elevator they head down the stairs and effectively descend throughout the film lower into the depths of Hell although the girl keeps breaking away from the crowd as she tries to lead them upwards rather down only her own fear and confusion all the while is not enough to convince the others that she knows the way  I think! Anyway Tobias is dead yet alive which explains his link to the girl who is in a similar situation  both of them kind of in limbo at this point I suppose. Events now overlap each other because in effect time has stopped and things are unfolding outside of time. The Lordi Monsters are demons who attempt to take the girls soul for their own and keep her in Hell. They try to trick the father into thinking he must let her go but in the end the fact that he never gives up on her is what saves her. In the finale he leaves her in a safe place and goes to fight the huge demon in an attempt to save his daughter. As it turns out he never has to face the demon the fact that he sacrificed himself for her is enough to save her  it is this act of love which gives her the strength to resist the clutches of Hell and escape the demon. She then enters life again at the point of her awakening from her first death. She now has conquered her fear and confusion of her impending death comforted by the love she feels from her father and his selfless act of sacrifice  hence the 'blue crayon'. Blue of course representing calm and tranquility. We now hear what Tobias says to her  that he no longer feels cold  his way of telling her not to be scared. What I presume follows is that she again dies her second and final death in the hospital bed only now she will make it to heaven. Her calmness will also put her father at ease after her death and make him feel she was at peace.Well that's about the closest I can get to making sense out of it anyway! Hope you followed my logic  however tenuous it may have been at times. I would have given Dark Floors a higher rating if it hadn't been for the lame monsters and also if it had been made slightly less difficult to make sense out of as I think it would have been to the films credit to so. While it is great to let the audience think for themselves and not spell everything out for them I feel a film of this type really needs to meet it's audience halfway as the consequence of not doing so gives the appearance of a somewhat senseless and mangled piece of work. I'm just not sure one should have to work quite so hard to find the meaning in a movie of this nature.".

This is basically her telling him that she was angry that he was making her do all of these tests even though he knew she didn't like it.Then it goes into flashback mode showing her holding a blue crayon instead of the red crayon at the start of the movie. This part is what puzzled me though after I watched the beginning over again I caught on. She was stating over and over while holding the red crayon that she wanted the red crayon. When they show the flash back in the end with her holding the blue crayon what I assume is that she saw the blue crayon not a red crayon in her hand.I also infer that while she was in the machine she had witnessed everything that was about to happen and the old man must've as well and informed her that he wasn't cold anymore meaning he knew that he was going to die and that it made him happy.".

I mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of stolen themes from that movie in here.. All in all i would say watch silent hill instead of this one its better its more scary it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better.. And best of all you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one.. This just seems to be one of those i like that movie so I'm gonna remake it in my own really bad version kinda movie.. Oh and one more thing... Lordi.. in a horror movie... thats like trying to scare a kid with a care bear who has hug me and i will love you forever written on the stomach of it..".

	schema:reviewBody "I was a little worried about this movie. The ratings here at IMDb were rather negative and the movie seemed to be more like an expensive Lordi commercial. I had no big expectations but ultimately was curious enough to watch. And now I'm rather glad I did. I... liked it.The plot is quite simple a father and his disabled daughter and a handful of other people take the elevator in a hospital. Suddenly the elevator stops between two floors for a while and finally continues to the 6th floor. The people on the elevator find the hospital completely deserted. They notice that time seems to have stopped and they are being chased by monsters and it seems the monsters are after the little girl. It is pretty much a basic horror movie scenario Group of people trying to escape a scary place where a killermonster chases them so it's not very original but the movie worked better than many other horrorfilms with the same basic plot line.The monsters weren't too scary. Maybe they would have been scarier if they weren't familiar from the band. Althou they looked a lot more realistic with some computer enhancement they didn't scare me at all because I knew them beforehand. To me they weren't scary monsters they were a rockband. The movie might have worked better with new never before seen monsters but it was still entertaining.The actors weren't the best out there and the movie suffered from a common horror movie problem The survivors don't seem too shaken about the deaths of their friends. That doesn't bother me too much in this case since they just met that day so there was no emotional bond between anybody but the father and his daughter plus one of them was an idiot so I understand why nobody cared about his death.The movie ends with nothing explained or concluded which suggests there is a sequel coming and this was just the introduction. Usually I hate this kind of endings but surprisingly this time I wasn't too bothered by that.So all in all this was a rather good horror film and definitely a lot better than people say. Dark Floors was a lot better than Silent Hill or Resident Evil. Some people are going to rip me apart for saying that but hey it's true! I give this movie 710. If there is no sequel it's not a huge loss but if there is I'm watching it.".

Some say since it was a band that made the movie and named the main monster after it...that it was just shameful advertising but I didn't have any urges to buy someones CD at the end. I never knew it had anything to do with a band until I read about it later. I say give it a chance and you might just like it. If you don't enjoy or know how to enjoy should I say Bmovies...then I would say walk away. This movie was not intended to be the next blockbuster.

Well apart from some 80's throwback rubbermask monsters. I'll say now that before watching this I had never seen the band Lordi nor knew anything about them bar that they won Eurovision. Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band pretty much in their stage personas. Whatever. Anyway I didn't know this while watching. I just thought the monstersdemons were mostly passable. Just about.I'm almost sure there is a semicoherent explanation behind what we see onscreen but it may actually be better not to know it. It probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it. The action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly.I gave it a four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing. Must have been the mood I was in but I found that hella funny for some reason. Then I look up the movie on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it's supposed to be about. That amused me further and raised my score an extra half point to a 410.It's not scary or particularly coherent but it's pretty nice visually and sonically. Overall far from essential but watchable. Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood.".

SarahSkye Bennettis an autistic girl whose worried father BenNoah Huntleywishes to find her proper help. The hospital have been futilely attempting various methods to cure her but it seems that Sarah remains in her present condition never to change. Equipped with a crayon and sketchbook Sarah creates hellish portraits which explain a lot about what will soon take place. Ben decides to take his girl out of the hospital to seek other help while her nurse EmilyDominique McElligottattempts to change his mind. They enter an elevator along with a disgruntled visitor JonWilliam Hope hospital security guard RickLeon Herbert and nutty unkempt patient TobiasRonald Pickup. Tobias nearly dies after the elevator mysteriously stops with Emily resuscitating him. When the elevator door opens the floor seems completely empty prompting them to investigate. What they'll soon discover are unthinkable ghouls and demons patrolling the hospital floor to floor with fewer places to run and hide as individuals fall prey to the supernatural stalkers. Tobias slips information to the group that Sarah might be the catalyst for the dangers they face and Jon desperately wanting to get out of the hospital by any means necessary will wait for a chance to serve her up to the ghastly apparitions. The film follows the transpiring events as they unfold how time seems to have stopped how the further the group searches out the hospital it appears more in disrepair with bloody corpses lying about the corridors darker and more threatening.I don't know much about the stage act performed by the group Lordi but I guess their fans will understand this film's premise more than the typical horror fan. I guess the nightmarish realm those of the movie find themselves is like a hellish limbo with the creatures merely present to terrorize them. I'm not sure if these beings are soulseekers or what but it seems Sarah is their desired target..and she along with Tobias know what the other members of the group do not know. Perhaps like Silent Hill those who can not accept death..I kind of believe they're all dead and until they can face this they'll never escape this place they find themselves inremain trapped in a neverending set of circumstances. Perhaps the main demon Lordi and his minions wish for them never to leave which is why they pursue these people to begin with enjoying the terror they inflict. Tobias an obvious vagrant that society could give a rat's ass about understands their present state and desires to die..he wasn't happy with Emily who saved his life from certain death. At any rate I'm not sure of what I watched because the film presents a series of bizarre sequences where these humans run for their lives as the ghouls chase after them. The slowly decaying hospital setting is appropriately spooky and Lordi  company make for some creepy predators but the almost incomprehensible plot challenges the viewer's patience..or it did mine. For those who can get a grasp of this material hats off to you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Max Ophuls was an exceptionally good director best recalled for Le Ronde The Earings of Madame D Lola Montez and this film  his best Hollywood movie. He could capture the charm of the Europe of the 19th Century but he was realistic enough to admit two things the social system was hardly fair with it's layers of classes and their appointed rankings and love was glorious but ephemeral. It is hard to select his best movie but once you see any you can't forget them. I personally like Letter From An Unknown Woman more than Le Ronde and Lola Montez but I feel that both of the others are certainly worth watching and watching again.The film follows Louis Jourdan's last night alive. You don't realize this while the film goes on but it is centered on that. A philanderer who has wasted a promising career as a concert pianist he is an unsuccessful version of Franz Liszt who also had many love affairs  including one with Lola Montez he has received a challenge to a duel from the husband of one. Actually it turns out this is the Austrian Baron Marcel Journet who was married to Joan Fontaine and although it does not immediately register the husband and his second are seen at the start of the film watching Jourdan's apartment. Jourdan has returned home to quickly pack a bag in order to flee the outraged husband  as he has probably has done many times  but he would not have had a real chance.Jourdan is interrupted by his silent servant Art Smith who hands him a letter. It is the last letter ever written by Fontaine and it details her lifelong adoration and love for Jourdan which was met by him only once or twice in all these years  once when they spent the night together in an amusement park and once when they met years later when she had gotten married. Jourdan was always charming and intense but he was always looking for the immediate gratification of his sexual desires. Fontaine of course hoped for a lifetime's satisfaction. She has had a son by Jourdan and it led to some economic difficulties but Journet whom she knew as a military cadet has always loved her and is willing to accept her and the boy as his own. Part of the tragedy of the story is that the Austrian Baron's decency can't make headway against Fontaine's fatal fascination with this pianist. The boy dies from an illness he accidentally gets on a railway trip. Fontaine dies from the same illness while trying to care for the boy but lives long enough to write her letter. With full irony after the shattering experience of learning he was this loved and had a son and had thoughtlessly thrown both away Jordan still does not know Fontaine's name. Art Smith's character the loyal servant has no lines. This may be due to his pronounced American voice see his performances in In A Lonely Place and Ride The Pink Horse to hear his voice but it makes his quiet kindly role all the more effective as a representative of either conscience or humanity. Jordan asks what Fontaine's name was and Smith writes it down and gives it to him. It is now daybreak and Jordan can turn coward and run supposedly  don't forget Journet is downstairs watching or bravely go to the field of honor and die. He chooses the latter to be united with his family.It is a wonderful film with lovely touches the fake railway journey in the amusement park and the musician's coffee club in Vienna are two of them. It is a lovely film and one of the most tragic to watch. I can easily recommend it.".

I have never seen a film celebrate love in quite this way. It reminds me of one of the most beautiful lines in cinema from Altman's Gosford Park when Sophie Thompson says I believe in love. Not just getting it... giving it. I think as long as you can love somebody whether or not they love you then it's worth it. Ophuls' entire film plays with this very notion.

It is the intoxicatingly bittersweet tale of the obsessive love a young girl Joan Fontaine develops for a rougish pianist Louis Jordan that remains throughout each charcters life long after most schoolgirl crushes have faded away. Fontaine charcter is so convincingly and sympathetically drawn that we are pulled into her desire for this rather selfpossessed artist against our own rational thoughts. And as the film progresses Fontaine's attraction to the artist begins to deepen and humanize the audiences response to him. This film is deeply concerned with a woman's role under patriarchy and the limitations of romantic love as a form of fulfillment.

In it she plays a woman who sees a lot more in the character of the man of her dreams than he really possesses. The object of her affection is Louis Jourdan a womanizing concert pianist who when the film opens up is about to flee the scene rather than face an irate husband in a duel. Just as he's ready to take it on the lam Jourdan receives a Letter From An Unknown Woman one of many he's known in his life. He reads and the story in flashback begins.Like in her performance in The Constant Nymph Joan starts her performance as a child. When and widowed mother Mady Christians were living in Vienna Jourdan was learning his craft and the sound of his playing gave her romantic fantasies.Later on when they meet as an adult they do have a brief affair which leaves her with child. True to his nature he leaves her and pursues his career and his romantic avocations. She was barely a blip on his radar.During the course of Fontaine's off screen narration of her letter the tragedy of her life unfolds and the causes are a combination of her romantic fantasies and his lack of character. I can't say more but the end is truly heartbreaking.Letter From An Unknown Woman was a nice and truly original idea. It starts slowly but you really get drawn into the story by Fontaine's off screen narration and on screen performance. Jourdan too is fascinating as a man who is less than the sum of his parts.A really great choice of roles for Joan Fontaine.".

The movie was almost  certainly not as Ophuls would ideally have wished due to the notorious  Hays Code. His next two Hollywood movies were films noirs and he moved  back to more congenial Europe for the cynical La Ronde which he almost  certainly could not have made in the US.   We're also entitled to raise an eyebrow at the movie's usual  categorisation as a tear jerker and woman's picture. No doubt when  it was released and even today many women and some men would  unquestioningly identify with Lisa Berndl Joan Fontaine who  maintains a deep love from girlhood through to early middle age for  the handsome pianist Stefan Brand Louis Jourdan who increasingly  shows himself to be a shallow selfish philanderer like her they  would fantasise about how they could change his ways and help him  return to the concert stage and they would weep at the tragic end to  Lisa's and their dreams.   But one of the brilliant aspects of this film lies in the way Ophuls  maintains enough distance from his characters and situations to allow  us if we wish to view the movie with a more sardonic eye to see Lisa   whether due to mental or moral weakness  as failing to grow up to  have no illusions about Stefan's failings as a man or a pianist and to  see his impending death in the duel as a joke played on him by Lisa  from her grave  because had her letter not been so long he would have  had time to flee Vienna as he originally intended!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Letter from an Unknown Woman 1948' signals a tragedy from its earliest moments. The film's carefullyconstructed narrative structure with the entire story unfolding through flashbacks narrated by a dying woman's final letter prematurely reveals a romance doomed from the outset. Whatever meetings take place whatever promises are made whatever hope is afforded us we are always fully exposed to the knowledge that misfortune is only just around the corner. As such a blanket of melancholy has descended upon every scene in the film and all emotions seem stifled and distant not through any fault of the filmmakers but rather through the audiences' individual empathy for the heroine's illfated affection towards a charming womaniser who can't even recall her name. This was undoubtedly the tone for which director Max Ophls was striving if you're looking for an uplifting romance to conclude a bright and happy day this isn't it. However there's a certain sedateness that the film struggles to overcome the hollow feeling of a story not going anywhere a train having already arrived at its destination.Not surprisingly given the director's nationality 'Letter from an Unknown Woman 1948' has the feel of a European film. It's a bit difficult to put my finger on exactly why this is but the Viennese setting probably contributed. Additionally American romances  both of that time and today  usually seem so anxious to please doling out hope with every new meeting and typically ending with the heroine carried off into the sunset in her eternal lover's arms. It's for its acknowledgement of the hopelessness of love that Ophls' film and others such as Lean's Britishmade 'Brief Encounter 1945' are regarded above most romantic pictures after all is there any love more poignant and memorable than unrequited love? Joan Fontaine a favourite actress of mine is as delicate as a flower a quality that Hitchcock notably exploited twice in both 'Rebecca 1940' and 'Suspicion 1941.' Her love for the dashing French pianist Stefan Brand Louis Jourdan is so incredibly passive that you already know that she's going to lose him.Throughout the film Lisa Berndle watches her lover from afar she listens to his music through the physical barrier of a door she quickly comes to know him but only later comes to meet him. Fontaine's character is simply too weak to succeed in love and only in her dying moments does she realise that her strength of will was required to bridge the gap between herself and the womanising forgetful Stefan who probably loved Lisa but never realised it. Though Ophls' narrative framing device suggests the intervention of fate  that faceless indifferent force to which most failed cinematic romances are attributed  into the couple's doomed romance the blame instead falls to the two lovers. Their personal failings not only denied them love but ultimately granted them death. That we are alerted to these inevitable eventualities in advance both through the framing device and a coldlybrutal sequence that indifferently alerts us but not Lisa to a typhis outbreak makes it all the more difficult to bear.".

	schema:headline " A Posthumous Appeal for a Life's Acknowledgement";
	schema:reviewBody "Early on Fontaine speaks of being born twice once when you come into the world once when you consciously actualize the beginning of your journey. I'm totally paraphrasing but that's the gist. I was intrigued by this theoretical little idealistic theme. Director Max Ophuls deemed love as much a blight as a miracle and this syrupy but highly sophisticated drama is one of the finest expressions of his refined aesthetic balance. It's composed of three extended episodes each from another time in the heroine's life. This gives it a format resembling Ophuls' great Le Plaisir.By the time you read this letter I may be dead. If this reaches you you will know how I became yours when you didn't know who I was or even that I existed. As follows the letter that gives this most famous of Ophuls' American films its title. Joan Fontaine's words come to us from the brink of death. The letter's receiver is Louis Jourdan the object of Lisa's failing affection a man who has been blind to her passion and whom this letter wishes both to alleviate from this state plus to blame him for it. Simultaneously the letter is also conveyed to us as Jourdan's reading of it instigates a single flashback whereby we follow the content as narrative images that seem to spring from Fontaine's perspective abbreviated periodically by her voiceover which preoccupies the screen. In jeopardy here is only one thing her existence has been unrecognized a truth that rather literally kills her. This is why she returns to haunt the screen her posthumous appeal for acknowledgement.Fontaine overdramatically combines the intensity of her daydream with her feeling of reality As hard as it may be for you to realize from that moment on I was in love with you. Quite consciously I began to prepare myself for you. There are few characters in film history who so thoroughly exemplify the thrust of melodrama. This film consequently appears to stem its genre less from formula than from Lisa's actual core hazarded not unlike that of the unfortunate leading ladies of opera on curtains that rise and fall until they don't rise anymore. Film naturally unlike opera is a form of renaissance where images can return to preoccupy us from a farflung past. The melodrama of this film makes the most of this.Staircases. Sets on multiple levels. Episodic and sectional construction of stories. Historical recreations of continental eras and societies. Entertainment spectacles the carriage ride with unrolling pictures. Scenes at opera houses. The presence of tradesmen and servants as supporting players in camera movements. Irony. Ophuls' signature panning shots are much more flexible in this film. Ophuls' characters frequently go up or down staircases. The pans can quietly tilt upward or down keeping the character in the focal point of the composition while crossing the staircase. The staircases here are merely series of short steps leading from one floor to another. The transitions and pans are likewise minute and elegant. Characters also often move around within a location such as the businessman incessantly fussing around the train station. Ophuls' camera pans from side to side with this man as he moves impatiently through the crowd. Fontaine's dreamscape is exposed for us developed into the geographic web of a city where the sole bystander that matters is Jourdan.".

	schema:headline " Typus Strikes Back";
	schema:reviewBody "Letter from an Unknown Woman is another tragic love story by director Max Ophuls. The plot? Lisa Joan Fontaine falls in love with Stefan Louis Jourdan a famous concert pianist. She admires him from afar listening to his music and fantasizing about one day meeting him. Years go by the couple never meeting. Stefan lives a playboy lifestyle courting women and dining with the wealthy whilst Lisa shuts herself away avoiding men and thinking only of Stefan.Finally the couple meet and share a wonderful few days together. They talk and walk visiting restaurants ballrooms and carousels until news arrives that Stefan must leave the country for a concert performance in Milan. They separate at which point Lisa realises she's pregnant.Rather than burden Stefan with this news Lisa goes into hiding for ten years. She marries a wealthy officer has Stefan's child and moves on with her life. Lisa is content until one day she meets Stefan at an opera house. His career is washed up and she blames herself for this. Determined to set things right Lisa leaves her husband abandons her child and hooks back up with Stefan. Unfortunately she realises that Stefan doesn't actually remember who she is. What was a long romantic obsession for Lisa was just another faceless woman conquered to Stefan. Poor girl.Lisa then leaves Stefan learns that her son has died of typhus and then inexplicably dies herself of some disease. The moral of the story stop fantasising about famous playboys and get yourself a real man who loves you! Or more importantly wishfulfilment becomes selfdefeat a masochism which we inflict on ourselves unless we take the basic steps necessary to achieve our dreams. Stefan could have had a happy relationship and great career if he respected Lisa and Lisa could have lived out her Cinderella lovestory if she weren't so shy and submissive.So this is really a simple but tragic tale of blind devotion. What elevates the rather melodramatic material is director Max Ophuls' style. Ophuls' lyrical gliding camera movements his long tracking shots and beautiful Viennese architecture the snow capped buildings the gorgeous cobblestones and lamp posts give the film a rich atmosphere. The cast is also wonderful. Yes Lisa's character is bit of an obsessive fantasist but actress Joan Fontaine so great in Hitchcock's Suspicion and Rebecca plays the part wonderfully. She's shy and vulnerable and obviously deeply smitten by Stefan.Note too the countless visual parallels Ophuls weaves into the story. Settings symbols angels and movements are often recreated from one scene to the next with a single important change. For example in one scene Lisa watches as Stefan escorts one of his many conquests to his upstairs apartment. In a later scene the point of view is preserved only this time Stefan escorts Lisa in the same manner. The single change from Lisaaswitness to Lisaasobject dramatizes one of the film's many ironies. In her desire for Stefan Lisa has become no more than another in a long line of his romantic liaisons.But what's really interesting is the film's ending. Stefan attempts to avoid a pistol duel and were it not for the arrival of a letter by Lisa would have certainly escaped and avoided death. Yet in staying and reading her letter in cherishing her memory Stefan accepts death and achieves a sort of redemption.810  A weepy melodrama lifted by great direction some emotional visuals consider one heartbreaking scene where Stefan turns to see the ghostly image of Lisa as a child waiting outside his gate and great acting. Ophuls would visit similar themes in Caught and The Reckless Moment.Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a well directed film from a director who appears to know what he needs from his actors and camera operators. He especially manages to portray the lead character Lisa played by the great Joan Fontaine very well. And Fontaine gives this renowned director what he wants. She plays both the vulnerable and later the hardened Lisa in her mature role adeptly. The very handsome Louis Jourdan and the Vienna setting are turned into props by the director to exaggerate Lisa's vulnerability.It is within Lisa's vulnerability that the audience can see how the concept of romantic love has been used to make women emotionally needy which can then be taken advantage of by the likes of Jourdan's character Stefan. In the real world romantic love becomes a commodity for transacting a deal which secures relationships. Therefore women play up to the idea of romantic love rather than succumb to it and use it as a meal ticket for their security in a man's world. This is illustrated in the film by Lisa who later marries a man for financial security as well as respectability as opposed to love.After several viewings of this film I have to say it's one of the best around!".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine yourself in 1900s Vienna among the glamour the ritz and sweet seductive Viennese street tunes. Picture yourself falling in love with Joan Fontaine and Louis Jourdan careening along the cobbled streets under a sparkling moonlit sky.Ophuls' dreamlike fantasy into young love and heartache melts your heart and tantalises the most romantic in each us. The story is told in flashback by Fontaine and covers her accession from lust the true love then longing and regret. The events of the story are unfolded to us through Fontaine's final letter written to Jourdan. We discover how the lovely couple met and what resulted in them breaking away and returning to love.The film takes us through the opulence of the rich elegant society parties family dynamics and the adversities of fame and married life. The story is basically a set a flashbacks of their love together their defining moments and their crises.Ophuls moves the piece along in a gliding swooning fashion. There are many wonderful shots and movements between the glistening Viennese apartments and their opulent decorations. A lot of the film is very dark set during twilight and after midnight and Ophuls frames each scene perfectly with the intimate symmetry of light and shadows. He is outstanding with the interiors and glass reflections the shine of street lamps and candlelight to create a truly romantic dreamworld.Both Fontaine and Jourdan are excellent. Together they are romantic suave and mystical. Fontaine in particular was radiant and youthful. She shines in each scene among the darkness and sumptuous sets. The story begins with her as a coy and bashful young woman. She develops into a girl longing for love in a state of dreamy affection to a stunningly elegant and always struggling against her desires and duties. As a avid lover of fine music I loved the sensual score and scenes of Jourdan rippling over the piano producing a dreamlike flowing theme. The scene at the opera was also a real treat and heartbreaking to see the principals recapturing long lost love and idealistic memories.This is a superb melodrama about lost love and admitting that when the right love comes we can only be so naive and captivated by the beauty of it. It was lovely to fall in and out of love with Fontaine and Jourdan remembering that love is a desire worth waiting on.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful Tragedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Letter from an Unknown Woman is directed by Max Ophuls who also co adapts the screenplay with Howard Koch from the novella written by Stefan Zweig. It stars Joan Fontaine Louis Jordan Mady Christians Art Smith and Howard Freeman. Music is by Daniele Amfitheatrof and cinematography by Franz Planer. Masterpiece the very definition of classic cinema is right here a film that is both beautiful and tragic a piece of cinema that's crafted with such great skill by all involved it's hard to believe some critics turned their noses up at it back on its original release. Story is set in Vienna at the turn of the century and finds Lisa Berndle Fontaine as a teenager who has a crush on one of the neighbours in her apartment complex. That neighbour is concert pianist Stefan Brand Jourdan but Lisa will not get to know Stefan until some years later and then only briefly yet true love never dies does it? The scene is set right from the off the superb set designs of period Vienna come lurching out of the screen. Jordan stands straight backed and handsome and then Fontaine a picture of angelic beauty. Ophuls brings his euro eye for details and flair to the party his camera work fluid yet compact personal but still a distant and caustic observer to the corruptible folly of romantic obsession. And Planer mists up the photogenics as Amfitheatrof drifts delicate and dramatic sounds across the unfolding drama. Narratively most of the picture is played out in the past showing how Stefan Brand came to be reading a heart aching letter from a woman who loved and adored him. Not that he would know such was his life of womanising and narcissistic leanings. Oh he could romance the best of them charm a snake out of the basket but quite frankly he's a cad and a coward to boot. Maybe this letter from the unknown woman will shake him out of his self centred world? Give him a chance at redemption? Or maybe not... The characterisation of Lisa Berndle Fontaine simply magnificent is stunning in its coldness. This is a woman who for the briefest of moments in her life derails her shot at potential happiness and the stability afforded her son in the belief that Stefan Brand is the destined love of her life that love will find a way. Her foolish obsession borders on insanity she's so driven by a selfdestructive persona she can't see this is no fairytale. There is much beauty on show but the devilish hand of fate and some tragic realisations wait for the principal players here Ophuls brilliantly blowing a blackened cloud over the culmination of tale. Grand and opulent heartbreaking and sad Letter from an Unknown Woman is pure cinema its narrative strength lies in the realisation that the vagaries of love has to be a two way thing. Brilliant film making. 1010".

This is the kind of portrayal which served her so well in Rebecca and Suspicion.She gains confidence and poise as the story progresses but the reticence remains. Therein lies the story's drama.At her height of prosperity she dons a fur coat of purest white as white as the helping of Schlagobers which accompanies a Viennese cup of Schokolade.

Franz Kafka was beginning to write at about this time in the Cisleithanian city of Prague to the north he clearly understood the symbolism implicit in fur. Joan's security is undermined by the illicit secret from her past.Stefan Brand's dumb manservant is an enigmatic figure.

It is not only the leading pair who serves as a good example of cowards and vulnerable people. There are also some secondary characters who provide fitting description to words such as coward and vulnerable. The names of the woman's mother and her husband come to mind to provide a suitable description. In 'Letter from an unknown woman' Max Ophuls celebrates the immense power of a letter to convey feelings of disappointment arising out of a failed love affair. The letter in question is quite a long one. It was drafted by a woman to tell her doomed life to her lover. Ophuls depicts all the troubles which a woman is compelled to take in order to get love. It would not be wrong to state that love is out of fashion in current times. It has been replaced by something which resembles love but has a certain amount of physical force. There were times in the past when intense feelings of love were appreciated.

In fact the production contains a number of noirish earmarks. Consider the foreboding nighttime atmosphere of so many scenes also the heavy sense of doom surrounding Lisa's obsession then there's Stefan's seductive charm a kind of spiderman in reverse. And while there's no crime in the legal sense Stefan does commit a moral crime that leaves Lisa emotionally destitute. Nothing significant hangs on this classification but it is a way of likening Lisa's predicament to noir's typically doomed characters and the dark universe they inhabit.Noir or not the movie bears the clear stamp of an artistic sensibility thanks to director Ophuls along with expert art design set design and cinematography. It's these formal qualities that lift the material above conventional soap opera. And though the screenplay seems pretty implausible at times the device of the letter and Stefan's response to it create a beautifully rounded morality tale. Of course having a 30year old Fontaine play a teenager in the opening scenes is a stretch however Ophuls manages to finesse using long and medium shots instead of revealing closeups. Despite the difficult challenge Fontaine manages to bring off her evolving role in persuasive fashion.All in all the movie remains an exquisite combination of European sensibility and Hollywood professionalism. Together they produce an unforgettable visual and emotional experience that successfully challenges the condescending label of a woman's picture.".

Louis Jourdan is excellent as the shallow pianist who does not remember the woman who loved him so deeply until he reads her letter written shortly before her death from typhoid. An atmospheric romantic yarn with Vienna recreated amid lush settings and period costumes. Both stars were at their physical peak and make an attractive love team. Fontaine's voice is used to narrate much of the film and is quietly effective in evoking the right emotions. If you like tales of bittersweet love put this one on your must see list.

Maybe only real gadabouts can certify such occasion. But that is exactly where the story takes a leap of faith to accentuate the psychological disparity between man and woman one is forever enticed by new possibility and ensconced in that livingforthe moment benevolence while the other more often than not caves in her chimera of reaching for the stars when this occurs thence tragedy ensues maybe one should coin it as fatal romanticism. Under Ophls' impeccable aesthetics the film evinces great melancholy from its findesicle setting and punctilious guidelines the swooning camerawork at hand swirls with its own propulsive vitality and takes no sideon glance at the periphery homing in on its subjects crystallizing every emotional pulsating to the fore of plenary niceties.Joan Fontaine scarcely credible to pass off as a teenager in the start she was roughly 30 at that time bides her time when her Lisa reaches adulthood and buckles down henceforth no matter what she never loses her glamour and moderation even in those pulverizing scenes of that twice happened two weeks curses she is Hollywood Golden Age's screen goddess of profound implosion an effort nonetoo elemental but totally falls in with Ophls' softcentred temperament. Louis Jourdan kicks off his inchoate Tinseltown career with a character considerably shows his chops although he is a few years junior to Fontaine he tosses off the daunting job of acting well above his real age without visible hiccups a continent fop debonair talented and charmingly ingenuous naturally women fall for him and his downfall is that he can never be wisely selective too many interludes but no symphony. Music plays a heavy part to accompany the narrative flashback solemn stentorian and plaintive Daniele Amfitheatrof's score cogently speaks volumes of our protagonists' inward feelings and once more we are convinced that Max Ophls absolutely knows how to chisel out something intrinsically dramatic and transmute it into a magnificent and endearing heartstring tugger.".

Louis Jourdan kicks off his inchoate Tinseltown career with a character considerably shows his chops although he is a few years junior to Fontaine he tosses off the daunting job of acting well above his real age without visible hiccups a continent fop debonair talented and charmingly ingenuous naturally women fall for him and his downfall is that he can never be wisely selective too many interludes but no symphony. Music plays a heavy part to accompany the narrative flashback solemn stentorian and plaintive Daniele Amfitheatrof's score cogently speaks volumes of our protagonists' inward feelings and once more we are convinced that Max Ophls absolutely knows how to chisel out something intrinsically dramatic and transmute it into a magnificent and endearing heartstring tugger.";

	schema:headline " One of the best Italian films of the decade";
	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of Teorema in a wordless sepiatinged montage we are introduced to almost all the main characters in Pasolini's film. It's a clever device almost Hitchcockian and it could be the beginning of a thriller though being a Pasolini film we know this won't be a thriller. The character who doesn't appear in this montage is played by Terence Stamp but suddenly there he is right in the middle of things and his affect on everyone is profound. Who is he and why is he here? It's never made clear of course. Although a very physical presence his role is allegorical. Is he an angel there is a strong religious element in the picture or a devil or simply a seducer since he does seem to have sex with everyone in the family male and female including the maid who ends up levitating and performing miracles. He certainly affords everyone a form of release turning their lives upside down and with it their bourgeoisie pretensions. If we are going to tear down the bourgeoisie we may as well do it with sex it's a lot more fun than beating them to death.Stamp of course remains the most beautiful thing on screen though Silvana Mangano as the mother gives him a run for his money. Noone really has to act all they simply have to do is respond to Pasolini's camera and with no real narrative structure that's fairly easy. Sex may be Pasolin's weapon of choice but the film is quite clearly a Marxist 'fantasy' and is also very obviously the work of a gay director. I'm not so sure anymore if it's the masterpiece I thought it was all those years ago bu it stands up remarkably well and remains one of the great Italian films of its decade.".

At least that's how I see it  which I wouldn't dare to claim as an ultimate view on it. As enigmatic and haunting the images in Teorema are they ask for repeated viewings. And just the fact that they give you enough interest for a second look it's quite a feat. An interesting cerebral cinematic exercise to say the least. 8.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pier Paolo Pasolini is one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century. He is not generally recognized as such but he ought to be and hopefully will be someday. At least in the world of cinema he should have an equal position to any of the great masters.Teorema is just one reason why. It's not my personal favorite Pasolini film but it's easily one of the best films I've ever seen. Unlike my favorites Mamma Roma The Decameron and Arabian Nights Teorema is a highly abstract film imbued in symbolism. Not that there isn't symbolism in those other films. The difference is that in Teorema the human element is reduced. The characters in the film are symbolic members of a typical bourgois family the mother father son and daughter and maid. One day a young man arrives at their home. Apparently they know him. They received a letter that he would be there and they didn't think twice about it. This man played by Terence Stamp arrives during a party. When a friend asks the daughter who that boy is she replies Just a boy.Over the next few days this boy seduces every member of the family. He seems angelic offering help selflessly whenever anyone feels hurt or isolated or sick. He speaks little  indeed there is hardly any dialogue in the entire film  but is always there for the needy. The film begins with a quotation from the Bible meant to compare the bourgeosie to the Jews wandering lost in the desert after they escaped from Egypt. The mysterious boy is he God?Or conversely is he a golden calf? Or is he the devil himself? I was unsure of whether Stamp could play the character when I first read up on the film I had read the first bit of the novel written concurrently with the film by Pasolini before I watched the film but as Teorema progressed I realized that he was perfect. Stamp has a face hanging uniquely between evil and kindhearted. His eyes are cherubic but his grin is diabolical. What exactly is this young man here to do?Well I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it plus I think I've gone on enough. Suffice it to say that the revelations and effects that are brought out by the boy's presence are profound and quite brilliant. Anyone interested in European art films of the era owes it to themselves to see Teorema. If you are more into realism especially if you didn't like Teorema move onto Mamma Roma The Gospel According to Matthew and the Trilogy of Life The Decameron The Canterbury Tales and Arabian Nights.".

From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema 1968 is a fable that tells how a handsome young man extremely attractive Terrence Stamp with the eyes of an angel and the grin of the devil stays as a guest in the house of a wealthy factory owner and seduces one after another all members of the household  the maid the teenagers son and daughter the wife and the father in this order. When released in 1968 the film had divided believers and atheists as much as critics. Some of Pasolini's comradesMarxists were also infuriated by this attack on their ideology. Many viewers were disturbed by its removing sexual taboos even though sex is handled very tastefully. It is more a symbol of connection and closeness to God or it could be to Devil we may only guess. Made almost forty years ago Teorema seems to be simple and puzzling at the same time. It reminded me Ingmar Bergman's movies from his Trilogy of Faith which sums up Bergman's own philosophy regarding religion and God  God has never spoken because He does not exist. In Bergman's world where God does not exist communication and understanding are not possible and everyone is locked in their loneliness like in a cage. In Pasolini's film God sends his angel to a chosen family. He has spoken to them and known them but then he left them. Did they become happier?

I watched Teorema for the first time few weeks ago but I still think about it trying to understand what theorem Pasolini tried to prove? I also was thinking about the films that were inspired by or reminded me a lot about Teorema. I've mentioned Bergman already. Luis Bunuel with Nazarin Viridiana Belle de jour 1967  the mother's transformation in Teorema reminds about the film immediately and Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie1972 come to mind. I was also reminded of Andrei Tarkovsky. The visual style camera work and the use of music in Teorema seem similar with Russian Master's. His last film Sacrifice may be the one closest to Pasolini's film.I would never say that everyone must watch Teorema. It is a very unusual film that could be easily dismissed as ridiculous and dated or it would be thought of as absolutely brilliant and mysterious. I have not decided yet but I can't forget it.P.S. November 29 2006  It's been several months since I saw Teorema and now I believe that it is brilliant and belongs to the the best films ever made. One can meditate forever on its depths and mystery and that's the sign of a great work of Art for me.".

It's Pasolini's most politically biting film by far most on the line most provocative. All out directness no compromising. The assault on the refreshing for a Pasolini film depiction of modern life takes place with an arresting synthesis of ultra left wing demands for total revolution alongside Pasolini's preoccupations with the mysterious insides of religion. The enigmastranger is said to be the symbolic Christ not the devil as the previous commenter thinks. This is what gives the film it's bite as the whole complexity of Christian revelation  conversion is extraordinarily concocted into this figure who transforms all he touches provoking collapse and crisis in all and everyone. The anatomy of the failure of the bourgeoisie entity is total. There is no escape from the social contradiction of the condition  Pasolini points to all the usual routes of escape and follows the logic to it's inevitable failure in each case. he knows his stuff.  The film came out in 1968 and for me very much belongs to that white hot moment when Euopean artistic dissenters demanded absolute social change. It sits along side films like Goddard's Le Chiniose. It's message still resonates today in our landscape of spectral and banished Marx. Interstingly this film was nominated for some award from the Vatican when it came out which is amusing because Pasolini spent much time being condemned by them. It also touches on the interesting game Pasolini played when tackling the social politics of his Italy. By playing with religious ideas Pasolini could court the Vatican's responses but he also smuggles in hidden and ambiguous meanings which are reminiscent of the sort of game playing that went on between film makers and Communist governments in the old Eastern Block. For me that game playing is at Pasolini's best in this film where the enigma Christ is a sexual seducer of men women and adolescent boys and girls. Sex madness and the Christian mystery as Marxist revolution its a bomb! Be blown away........".

	schema:headline " The Stranger Who Came to Our House";
	schema:reviewBody "Writing about this strange film is going to be for me the equivalent of walking a tightrope 1000 feet above the ground with no rope to secure me if and once I fall. I can't place Pasolini's TEOREMA because I'm not quite sure what it's trying to tell me. It's the same reaction albeit different I got from watching Bergman's PERSONA the first time  it left me with a feeling of being suspended in thin air over a field of terrifying white extending itself out into infinity I had nothing to hold on to nothing to help me stand on firm defined ground and a universe of blankness just there indifferent as to what I felt or thought or knew or ignored.Pasolini is one of the most difficult directors the history of cinema has created. His infamy after having produced SALO is on a global level anyone who mentions this movie will create a quiet sense of panic due to the unflinching nature of Sade's story of torture and extreme capitalism devouring humankind.The following review will apply only to my first view of the film When an irresistible force comes to visit a community  in this case a family  of people whose lives are mundane in the extreme nothing wrong with that of course the effect is of a total surrender. Terence Stamp is this enigmatic person a young man who looks like any other young man of his time he might as well be going to college since he has this look about him that implies as such.

	onyx:emotionText "Writing about this strange film is going to be for me the equivalent of walking a tightrope 1000 feet above the ground with no rope to secure me if and once I fall. I can't place Pasolini's TEOREMA because I'm not quite sure what it's trying to tell me. It's the same reaction albeit different I got from watching Bergman's PERSONA the first time  it left me with a feeling of being suspended in thin air over a field of terrifying white extending itself out into infinity I had nothing to hold on to nothing to help me stand on firm defined ground and a universe of blankness just there indifferent as to what I felt or thought or knew or ignored.Pasolini is one of the most difficult directors the history of cinema has created. His infamy after having produced SALO is on a global level anyone who mentions this movie will create a quiet sense of panic due to the unflinching nature of Sade's story of torture and extreme capitalism devouring humankind.The following review will apply only to my first view of the film When an irresistible force comes to visit a community  in this case a family  of people whose lives are mundane in the extreme nothing wrong with that of course the effect is of a total surrender. Terence Stamp is this enigmatic person a young man who looks like any other young man of his time he might as well be going to college since he has this look about him that implies as such. But his presence his stare that seems not from this world at times since it looks right into you causes the housekeeper to be the first one to give into him even as she tries to kill herself. Why would she do such a thing? The movie doesn't address this issue  maybe as he looked into her he took something indelible from her conscience something that she still held on to.

It is politically charged in every way investigating Pasolinis own background as a member of the Italian bourgeoisie. The stranger is a kind of modern diabolical creature  extremely polite attractive and silent and seemingly intellectually superior to the members of the family. One by one they fall prey to him as he challenges the sexually repressive environment in which they live. I would not recommend this movie as a starter if you haven't seen any of his movies you should probably start with his Lifetrilogy i.e. Canterbury Tales Decamerone or Arabian Nights.

When The Visitor shows the family another truth and then abandons them they are left in dispair and are unable to return to their former way of living. I think the family represents people living in a capitalist system. Pasolini was a Marxist and he directed this film in 1968 a revolutionary year in which the youth of Western Europe and a part of Eastern Europe revolted against their governments and wanted to build a society based on new principles.

	schema:reviewBody "Teorema directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini is a an obscure film that will not gratify the casual viewer because the use of symbolism in the narrative. This film is problematic but we are given clues at the beginning of it so it makes a bit of a difference putting all the elements together to come to a conclusion.It was significant this film was made in 1968 at the height of the students' unrest in Paris and other places. Pasolini was influenced by what was happening as he makes a stand about what he perceived what was the evil in the society in which he lived. The film begins with a discussion about the role of the bourgeoisie and how it affected the workers. We also observe an industrial complex in Northern Italy that is empty of all activity. Like most Italian film makers Pasolini's leanings were left of center and the communist emblem is clearly visible in the movie.The scene changes to Lucia and Paolo's villa. They are having a party in which the young man or the visitor is seen lounging among the guests. This man a handsome stranger is seen in later scenes as having sexual relations with all the members of the wealthy family including the maid. It's evident the father realizes what's going on between the visitor and his wife as well as with the son and the daughter because he himself is involved with the young man.When the visitor announces suddenly his departure the family falls apart. One of the most affected is the maid who goes back to a place in the country where she sits for a quite some time before levitating above the house creating a religious event in which she is probably seen as a saint or at least miraculous. Emilia is taken to a place where she is being buried alive and her tears form a puddle on the ground.Back in the house everyone else is affected in a different fashion. Odetta is perhaps the one suffering the most because she falls into a comatose state clenching her fist around an object that appears to have been given to her by the visitor. Lucia the mother goes out in her car looking for boys for casual sex and the father also is seen at Milan's main railway station stripping bare after he has been seen cruising a male hustler only to be seen later on running naked through a sort of barren field.Pasolini works as a minimalist in this story that seems to be saying the evil in that society is the rampant materialism. Only by shedding one's own accumulated wealth can one achieve salvation as is the case with Paolo the father. Or maybe being humiliated like Lucia is also a way of redemption. All these ideas float throughout the film with the music of Mozart's Requiem and the interesting cinematography of Giuseppe Rizzolini who shot the film in long takes.Terence Stamp made an interesting appearance as the visitorangel who knows all the people in the villa intimately. Silvana Mangano gives an excellent reading of her Lucia a rich Italian woman. Massimo Girotti a handsome actor makes an excellent contribution with his Paolo and Laura Betti is equally effective as the mysterious Emilia.Although this is not one of Pasolini's most approachable film it's worth a look. It's easy to dismiss Pasolini and Teorema but this film is not a failure.".

	schema:headline " How Pasolini Explained the Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing this movie I was very confused until I read an interview with Pasolini from 1969. In it he said I leave it to the spectatoris the visitor God or is he the Devil? He is not Christ. The important thing is that he is sacred a supernatural being. He is something from beyond. When asked if the members of the family were in some way improved by their encounter with the visitor he said Only in the sense that a man in a crisis is always better than a man who does not have a problem with his conscience. However the conclusion of the story is negative because the characters live the experience but are not capable of understanding and resolving it. This is the 'lesson' of the movie  the bourgeoisie have lost the sense of the sacred and so they cannot solve their own lives in a religious way. But the servant is a peasant really a person from another era a preindustrial era. That is why she is the only one who recognizes the visitor as God why she alone does not rebuke him when he must leave. When I say God Pasolini quickly adds I do not mean a Catholic God. He could belong to any religion a peasant religion. All religions are really peasant religions. That is why religion is in crisis today. We are passing from a peasant world to an industrial world. But a world does not die so the peasant civilization lives within us buried within us. It is buried along with the sense of the sacred within the factory owner and his family in 'Teorema.' ... The father almost does learn from his truly religious experience. He takes off his clothes and like Saint Francis leaves all material things behind. When he reaches the desert which represents the ascetic life he has been trying to gain he is not capable of living a mystical experience as Saint Francis was because he is historically made in another manner. He arrives almost to the limit of being saved but he doesn't make it. It's very important that the middleclass sees its own errors and suffers for them.I would have to say that the movie is a failure since I think it would be pretty much impossible for a viewer to grasp that interpretation after seeing the movie once without exposure to Pasolini's thought. However it has some beautiful and haunting passages and the movie stays in your mind for a long time after you see it.".

	schema:headline " surprisingly trite";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Pasolini's primary antibourgeoisie film and is sort of a complementary companion of Luis Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. While Bunuel's film attacks the European postwar middle class slightly different from America's middle class though just as apathetic and selfish with mockery humiliation and eventually destruction Pasolini takes a more soulful route revealing the hidden desires of a class stifled by social dogma and propriety. Rather than turn them into effigy he allows them to have epiphanies realizing their inner hollowness and taking different paths to selffulfillment. Teorema means theorem and in this case the mysterious beautiful stranger embodied by Terrence Stamp offers proof of a certain Italian bourgeois family's misgivings. Pasolini here offers a lucid statement less political than Bunuel but just as poetic. His execution however is dry and hokey as Stamp encounters each family member almost mathematically. While the actors provide genuine emotion particuarly in facial expressions which Pasolini in his entire body of work has shown overwhelming appreciation for the structure of the film is so tight that he almost sucks the life right out of his message. It's a curious film though not completely lacking in entertainment value. In a way it plays out like a sonnet or other tightly structured poem type. Recommended is Porcile made by Pasolini with similar themes but presented more organically.".

While Bunuel's film attacks the European postwar middle class slightly different from America's middle class though just as apathetic and selfish with mockery humiliation and eventually destruction Pasolini takes a more soulful route revealing the hidden desires of a class stifled by social dogma and propriety. Rather than turn them into effigy he allows them to have epiphanies realizing their inner hollowness and taking different paths to selffulfillment. Teorema means theorem and in this case the mysterious beautiful stranger embodied by Terrence Stamp offers proof of a certain Italian bourgeois family's misgivings. Pasolini here offers a lucid statement less political than Bunuel but just as poetic. His execution however is dry and hokey as Stamp encounters each family member almost mathematically. While the actors provide genuine emotion particuarly in facial expressions which Pasolini in his entire body of work has shown overwhelming appreciation for the structure of the film is so tight that he almost sucks the life right out of his message. It's a curious film though not completely lacking in entertainment value. In a way it plays out like a sonnet or other tightly structured poem type. Recommended is Porcile made by Pasolini with similar themes but presented more organically.";

Pasolini never had much sense of structure at least not in any conventional way but this didn't matter as long as he was being primal Teorema alas has little of the primitivistic pull of Oedipus Rex or Porcile or the masterful Gospel According to St. Matthew. Its story of an enigmatic sexually magnetic entity  you don't know whether he's human or a ghost or Satan or what the hell  breaking up the harmony of a bourgeois household feels except for the odd bit of naughtiness like the stuff of dull highclass European cinema the kind of artfilm that appeals to librarians. Normally it wouldn't matter that Pasolini does a miserable job of establishing any sense of milieu or giving us any background on his characters  he was never the kind of director who depended on normal narrative technique  but Teorema feels so sloppy so unconcerned with helping the viewer get their bearings that it actually becomes annoying one might be tempted to restart the movie just to make sure their DVD player didn't accidentally skip a scene like the one where the director clues us in on what the hell he's trying to do. The mystery of movies like Oedipus Rex and The Gospel depends largely upon their setting the uncanny talent Pasolini has for making us feel like we're witnessing some alien world but Teorema being set entirely in modern times has no such quality and just feels kind of distant and unengaged. The neorealist grit of Accattone has been replaced by this dreamy abstract quality which is meant apparently to convey the hermetic nature of bourgeois life to counterpoise the sudden irrational actions of the characters after they've been infected with the ghostdevilgod's sexual craziness but a better idea might have been to make a film about the bourgeois where the tone is NOT what you would expect where the primal energies of the filmmaking act as counterpoint to the emotionally desolate lives of the characters. Pasolini reining himself in is not what we want  we want the mockcinemaverite strangeness of The Gospel the psychological rawness of Oedipus Rex the cruddy realism of Accattone the downtoearth bawdiness of The Decameron. No filmmaker depended more on his ability to churn up the inexpressible than Pasolini but in Teorema he's trying deliberately not to churn anything up and the result is something so bereft of character of lifeessence that it barely seems to exist.".

In their big wealthy Milanese house they're all wandering without a meaning of existence. The son has no talent for the art of painting he wants to follow the daughter has no love to stand upon the mother the same. Dressed with high fashion clothes and hairstyled the same she passes all time wandering in the big garden with no real feelings deep inside her. Her husband spends all time at his industry not paying any real attention to his family. Their maid as she represents the opposite to bourgeoisie class stays always silent serving them the dinner  a figure representing New Testament's Happy those who have no mind. She is the one who can be saved as she returns to her village staying silent all day with no food or water. As the stranger arrives all are astonished by his beauty His eyes his smile signs for the promised paradise they couldn't attend on this earth. But are they really attracted to his beauty or in the notion of salvation he carries? With this prophetic film PierPaolo Pasolini shows that there is no salvation in that chosen road surrounding landscape is cold and desert if it is without the human joy of life. Where that joy is hidden? In the blue eyes of the visitor in the open air smile and joy he carries with him. But as he has to leave the house all again is getting more and more obscure. The boy's paintings a mess on the walls of his room girl's pessimism in not finding affection hidden in the old family's photo albums drives her to complete paranoia. Same for the father who wants to get rid of the factory offering it to the laborworkers drives him to madness in Milan's railway station by getting rid of all his clothes. Same for the wife who is searching for love affairs in the streets with passing by strangers. The only one who can be saved is maid's returning to her village gifted with miracle's power to cure diseases. Last scene with her body except the head in the ground an allegory of the lamb carrying all human sins. There is no way of salvation no matter if you are lamb or wolf. For the first the mud of this world for the second the madness. Mud madness is the crowing of that postwar industrial society Pasolini says. Contrary to Trilogy of Life looking at as an Ode to Life this film is an Ode to Death. If you want something to be changed to that structure you find yourself powerless and mad to the end. Why this terrifying Teorema is in front us?

The building you construct has no strong basis it's going to fall he says to us. Finally a bell is ringing? An SOS bell. A pessimistic sound for society we all live.

The first half of the movie is every bit as boring pretentious and dreadful as Ta'm e guilass also known as Taste of Cherry  and it doesn't improve much. Yes Terence Stamp is compelling as the visitor who stirs up the bourgeois family.

Many Buuel films go in the same direction but are leagues ahead of Teorema  Cet obscur objet du dsir or the brilliant Belle du jour come to mind.Is Teorema controversial? Perhaps if you're a stuckup conservative. Otherwise there's not much controversy in this movie. After the stranger leaves the family falls apart and does all sorts of weird things  but they're neither shocking nor thoughtful nor clever. A woman starts flying a man runs naked into a desert a girl falls into a trance a mother becomes a prostitute. Big deal. Try Ozons witty Sitcom 1998 if you want to see a family falling apart  or even Takashi Miikes sick Visitor Q but stay away of Teorema.Well Pasolini was a poet so you might ask whether there's some poetry visually or dialoguewise in the movie. Not much I have to say. Visually I liked the one shot of the father in the desert holding out his arms and shouting I was prepared to do that too if the film would have run for another minute. That shot was neat the rest didn't move me at all. To sum things up Teorema is as overrated as movies can be. I'd say it's as overrated as the oevre of Theo Angelopoulos or the aforementioned Taste of Cherry. Boring pretentious stuff of an egomaniac film maker. Yes it might be deeply personal  but so are someone's photos from hisher last trip to Greece.Rating 310".

The mother would discover what she has never experienced and she would become an insatiable love seeking we mean of course sex chasing woman picking young students in the streets male of course to have a quick experience no matter where no matter how provided it is quick and complete.The daughter would just get catatonic after the discovery of that physical love she did not know before and she can't imagine with anyone else after having had that relation with the angel of love the archangel Gabriel of course. She will end up being taken away to some institution.The son will have discovered the love he was looking for but that makes him different and he does not want to be different so he will just promote his difference to the status of art and he will start painting beautiful abstract things with no resemblance to anything at all in one word his own desire for the forbidden in society but a dream that is allowed by that angel of love the archangel Gabriel of course.The maid will start eating stinging nettles and making miracles floating in mid air over the roof and being worshipped as a saint able to deliver the cure to all evils. And that will have to stop one day and on that day she will have herself buried in some kind of building site to disappear in her own tears under tower blocks.Finally the father will be the one who shows the way to salvation. He will get rid of his factory and will give it to the workers. The class struggle will win and the workers will be able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat a hammer and a sickle or vice versa in Italy. And then he will be able to answer the call of some young male well endowed angel and to undress in Milano's main train station get rid of all superficial appearances and finally follow his angel of love into the desert yes the desert because that's all there is for the bourgeoisie and then he will realize his mistake he will realize one must never yield to class struggle because it is an impasse but all the same the command of Jesus to the rich to get rid of their riches and distribute them to the poor and then follow him is a blind alley an alley for the blind an alley that leads nowhere at all except perdition.Just like Jesus brought love to Jerusalem and ended up on the cross betrayed by his own disciple capitalism is an impasse but negating capitalism is another impasse. There is no way out of that vision of society cut in too without any love.And that's why the film has aged tremendously. Class struggle or even social war liberation wars that end up in pure terrorism the belief that the world can be cut in two antagonistic halves lead to nowhere. It is a myth it is a dream not even a utopia because it does not bring liberation but it brings totalitarianism dictatorship terrorism including the civilized terrorism of that new age theory that society is a set of interconnected networks and it is enough to drop a stone or a bomb in one nodal point to paralyze the whole system like blocking the flow of gas and diesel to bring society dons on its knees in about four weeks.The four weeks that are supposed to shake the world and end up in failure and blood or frustration like with the Tamil Tigers the FARCs Ben Laden the ETA in Basque country and all other pirates in the world.

	schema:reviewBody "This Letters from a Dead Man simply has got to be hands down one of the top three most depressing and pessimistic movies I ever encountered in my life. Of all SciFi films dealing with remnants of life after the apocalypse  and believe me they are quite numerous  this Soviet Union produced sleeper upraises the most nightmarishly realistic and harrowing atmosphere ever. Even in your worst imaginable nightmares and premonitions the postnuclear existence probably still doesn't look as decayed and melancholic as illustrated here in this film. Survivors are forced to live underground in the caves and catacombs of destroyed buildings and have little else to do but watch each other fading away emotionally as well as physically. They can't go the surface without wearing special outfits and gas masks but even then there's nothing else to do but stroll around between ruins car wrecks and rotting corpses. With monotonous photography and the exclusive use of a yellowtinted picture director Konstantin Lopushansky an acolyte of the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky fabricates the ideally lugubrious ambiance and he can also rely on the devoted cast and bleakly void screenplay to assist.The story revolves on Rolan Bykov as a scientist  former Nobel Price winner even  who entrenched himself underneath the remnants of a library building along with his wife and a handful of coworkers. The titular letters are addressed to his son whom the scientist hasn't seen or heard from since the catastrophe. The letters and above all the hope his son is still alive somewhere is what keeps the poor man going but how long can you hold on to hope when you see everything and everyone around you dying? Letters from a Dead Man is a difficult but ultimately very rewarding cinematic experience to endure. Difficult of course because of the emotionally devastating imagery and atmosphere and because there's actually very little substantial content. We literally stare at a handful of people languishing and eventually dying with only a small hint at hope near the end. And rewarding because of the depiction of genuine humane sentiments and the thoughtprovoking messages. It's also highly remarkable how Letters from a Dead Man remains continuously vague regarding the cause of the apocalypse and eventually even searches the guilt in the own heart. In a time where movies released on the other side of the Iron Curtain in Europe and particularly the USA routinely blamed Russia for the potentially upcoming apocalypse this tale suggests the root cause of the catastrophe lies in a human error during the launch of a space shuttle. The entire cast gives away tremendous performances. I don't know if these people are veteran actors and actresses in their home countries but their grimaces and catatonic behavior suggest that they were selected especially for this type of discouraging parable. Fantastic film though obviously not fit for all occasions andor audiences.".

	schema:headline " Very Soviet and very shocking";
	schema:reviewBody "To fully understand this movie you should understand the mindset and milieu of the Eastern Bloc  preferably the Soviet Union  of the 1980s in the height of the Cold War. This movie is radically different from Western postapocalyptic movies like 'The Day After' or 'Threads' which deal with the very materialistic side of a nuclear holocaust like the effects of bombs and life after the war. This Soviet movie is not a spectacle and its aim is far from simply entertaining or scaring. It ponders on the philosophic and moral side of a nuclear war a suicide of mankind and whether it's inevitable or not.There is barely any storyline. The main character is an unnamed scientist who lives in a makeshift shelter under a museum among saved relics from all eras of history and some of his surviving colleagues. Being all scientists they are trying to grapple the whole point of what happened. There are no names except for the wife and son of this scientist Anna and Eric. Eric is presumably dead as he was outside when the bombs exploded. Nevertheless the scientist keeps writing letters to him in a form of a diary which is more to save his last thoughts of the world than actually meant to be delivered someday.The pace of this film is just as slow and time would be in such a situation. Soviet art movies were not bound by economic constraints so it did not matter to their makers whether the tickets will sell well or not. Modern moviegoers would find the entire thing profoundly boring and even the most dedicated movie hipster would look at the clock time to time. Being this slow is part of the image the movie builds. Just like the characters the viewer is also immersed in an endless waiting never to know whether something is going to change or happen. You actually have to watch it to the very end to see. Don't expect rich experiences. In such a dull and dead world it's a rare gift to see anything happen.Interestingly the makers took great care to emphasize that this is not happening in the Soviet Union. Or more exactly it could happen but this particular place is not a Soviet city. There is not a single object in the background with Cyrillic letters on it but there are a lot of things with English labels some are even consumer goods rare behind the Iron Curtain at that time. German beer cans float in the water  canned beer was a curiosity that time  and a bottle of Jagermeister is seen on a desk. Canned foods are also foreign with English labels. Even the soldiers carry weapons that look like a crossbreed of American M16 and M1 rifles. It's a small detail but back then every ablebodied Soviet men were familiar with Soviet military equipment having spent years as a conscript and this clue is giving away that the scene takes place in a foreign country. Even the military vehicles were selected to keep this illusion. The helicopter is a Ka26 which was never used by the military in the Soviet Union at least the large truck is a MAZ missile trailer but there was also a civilian version of it. The then futuristic hovercraft that appears for no apparent reason was an experimental vehicle at the time but such vehicles were already operating as ferries on the English Channel and were praised as a great technical advancement of the time.I'd generally recommend this movie for those who are desperate enough to take a plunge into a strange lost civilization's vision of the violent end of the world. Not a date movie except if your date is a hardcore movie culture fanatic or grew up in the Soviet Union.".

The main character is an unnamed scientist who lives in a makeshift shelter under a museum among saved relics from all eras of history and some of his surviving colleagues. Being all scientists they are trying to grapple the whole point of what happened. There are no names except for the wife and son of this scientist Anna and Eric. Eric is presumably dead as he was outside when the bombs exploded. Nevertheless the scientist keeps writing letters to him in a form of a diary which is more to save his last thoughts of the world than actually meant to be delivered someday.The pace of this film is just as slow and time would be in such a situation. Soviet art movies were not bound by economic constraints so it did not matter to their makers whether the tickets will sell well or not. Modern moviegoers would find the entire thing profoundly boring and even the most dedicated movie hipster would look at the clock time to time. Being this slow is part of the image the movie builds. Just like the characters the viewer is also immersed in an endless waiting never to know whether something is going to change or happen. You actually have to watch it to the very end to see. Don't expect rich experiences. In such a dull and dead world it's a rare gift to see anything happen.Interestingly the makers took great care to emphasize that this is not happening in the Soviet Union. Or more exactly it could happen but this particular place is not a Soviet city. There is not a single object in the background with Cyrillic letters on it but there are a lot of things with English labels some are even consumer goods rare behind the Iron Curtain at that time. German beer cans float in the water  canned beer was a curiosity that time  and a bottle of Jagermeister is seen on a desk. Canned foods are also foreign with English labels. Even the soldiers carry weapons that look like a crossbreed of American M16 and M1 rifles. It's a small detail but back then every ablebodied Soviet men were familiar with Soviet military equipment having spent years as a conscript and this clue is giving away that the scene takes place in a foreign country. Even the military vehicles were selected to keep this illusion. The helicopter is a Ka26 which was never used by the military in the Soviet Union at least the large truck is a MAZ missile trailer but there was also a civilian version of it. The then futuristic hovercraft that appears for no apparent reason was an experimental vehicle at the time but such vehicles were already operating as ferries on the English Channel and were praised as a great technical advancement of the time.I'd generally recommend this movie for those who are desperate enough to take a plunge into a strange lost civilization's vision of the violent end of the world. Not a date movie except if your date is a hardcore movie culture fanatic or grew up in the Soviet Union.";

	schema:headline " Depressive postapocalyptic film that expresses hope";
	schema:reviewBody "Depressive in tone but with a hopeful optimism at its end this film explores how human beings might survive the immediate aftermath of a nuclear bomb explosion that wipes out entire cities and all life above ground and renders the physical environment sterile and toxic. In such a setting people live without hope and watch one another disintegrate emotionally and mentally as well as physically. The bare and patchy plot centres around a physicist huddled with a few other survivors in a bunker beneath a museum after such a wipeout. The physicist tends to his wife dying from radiation sickness and composes letters to their young son who was separated from them during the explosion and the chaos that followed and is now missing. One day while searching for the boy and other survivors the physicist meets a group of orphaned children all traumatised by the explosion and arranges for them all to go to a socalled Central Bunker where they might be cared for by government doctors. Martial law and a strict curfew have been imposed across the country and the physicist risks his life to get medicine for his wife while he's gone the wife dies. The remaining survivors in the museum bunker ponder their circumstances and try to cope with various rationalisation strategies. Eventually they're all ordered to go to the Central Bunker but the physicist elects to remain and moreover takes in the orphans when the Central Bunker rejects them for being sick.The plot depends heavily on the actors and their environment to convey its message and ideas. The actors have worn sometimes craggy faces which portray hope despair anger and resignation in turns. The interior settings are dark and look cramped with primitive living conditions exterior settings are dominated by roaring winds the wreckage of buildings cars and machines puddles of toxic water and undecayed bodies. An air of oppression reinforced by helicopter and tank patrols and periodic megaphone announcements adds to the overall feeling of despair and hopelessness. Use of sepia tones in the filmstock emphasises the desolation and wretchedness of life and accentuates the strains of care and surviving on the actors' faces. Viewers see the details of soil texture of water that looks like mercury and in a flooded university library of the wet pulp of paper and sodden towers of books. One scene in the film appears in shades of blue that highlight the secret and possibly illegal or dangerous work being done by two characters.The cinematography captures perfectly the small scale of human life in an extraordinary and extreme environment. It reaches its peak of morose and pessimistic expression in a Christmas scene in which the physicist and his orphans build a Christmas tree out of wire and industrial scrap and light candles on the tree. The camera draws back to show the scene in full stark in its loneliness but beautiful all the same. It's like a small beacon of light in a neverending black night. Viewers sense that the plot has reached its lowest point and from here on hope may arise it harks back to the pagan origin of Christmas as a midwinter festival in which people celebrated the death of the old year and the birth of the new year. What happens to the physicist and the children next underlines this passingofthetorch motif.There are other moments of great beauty in the film the nuclear disaster itself with its montage of cities on fire and being blown down by huge winds over which a soprano sings and a child babbles in the background is a memorable sight and the orphaned children venturing out into the barren landscape and over the horizon beneath an overcast sky through which thin rays of sun shine is a very beautiful and moving scene. Even the sepia tones themselves lend a kind of golden aura over the actors and the sets as they bring out the harshness and desolation of the lives the characters lead.A few survivors declaim on the purpose and nature of humanity on Earth and where and how humanity went wrong somewhere so that the nuclear calamity was made possible. People were ambitious and greedy they reached out and made things they didn't fully understand they tried to know too much but lacked the wisdom and insight to control their knowledge and what they did with it  the physicist himself realises the calamity occurred accidentally in a way that's noone's fault. Here is a message about the absurdity and fragility of existence and how one seemingly trivial yet universal event can set off a chain reaction that results in a nationwide if not global tragedy. One survivor expounds his view that a new dogeatdog world without compassion will be built on the remains of the old one. Another survivor praises the achievements of the human species and then commits suicide. At one point in the film the physicist expresses guilt that his work might have contributed to the nuclear disaster.In the end hope is all the physicist has to sustain him hope that his son is still alive hope that his wife might survive long enough to see their son hope that the orphaned children will also survive and help create a new world with new values that won't end in nuclear catastrophe. The children carry his hope as they trudge away from the museum bunker.This is a thoughtful film with scenes of great beauty and sadness.".

Letters from a Dead Man could be interpreted as a response to the Chernobyl disaster which took place a few months prior to the film's release. It could also be viewed as a response to the AmericanUK films about the frequent nuclear disaster and possible outcome of atomic bombs being dropped to a nation. Director Konstantin Lopushanskiy's first feature film obviously couldn't been an attack to the Soviets their delay in spreading the news to the world and the way they dealt with the whole situation. Instead he creates an apocalyptical world postnuclear attack and how people survive in shelters and watered pits trying to live with their best means they can while men women and children keep on dying or having to face strict control by their own people  for instance when the kids aren't allowed to enter a more safer place. Doctors keep on doing their job but it's all hopeless and no one can get out to the surface to see what's left after the blast a world turned into a red dust shattered and with some military forces telling us that people aren't allowed to go outside unless they have a pass.  The film's point of view is from a scientist who reflects about not only his conflicts about a major part in creating the technology that caused the world's collapse and killed humanity or reduced it to a future death sentence but he also ponders about in letters to his missing son  who is probably dead  and reminds of how their life used to be. Simple yet frank letters yet they don't carry a higher sense of usefulness or in this case I deeply wanted a sort of sentimentality. To me those letters were just a nostalgia that led to nowhere. I cared more for the character when he despertaly tried to get out of the pit and try to look for his son then just keep reminiscing about a life that is no longer there. The Stalker like visuals are cool but they're empty and void without the master's visual touch and sublime poetry. Konstantin makes a noble and valuable effort a direct message to the Cold War world and its constant paranoia of bombing each other with threats more real year went bybut there's something missing it's heartless a snooze fest that fails to convince and to make us immersed in its calamity the tragedy.1980's. In the wake of similar themed works such as The Day After Special Report Testament When the Wind Blows and Threads yet to be seen by me despite hearing about this one being the most horrific and realistic of them all the forementioned films this artistic Soviet response was bureacratic just as was the treatment given to the Chernoby disaster  in fact this film comes as reply to the events that shook Ukraine on the same year and that's why it's so important to at least get a glimpse to this film. But the director's presentation is faulty beyond claustrophobic and hard to make your heart pulse. Sure The Day After contained some of those depressive qualities and we wonder if the world was going to end or continue after a nuclear fallout. But I was confused with Letters... for what I gathered it was an human error that detonated a nuclear device that turned everything into dust and radiation was spread and government still found ways to control people with curfews passes and contained people underground  pretty much what USSR would actually do in such scenario. I disagree about the artist quote about art being uselesspointless  in the film context it sort of works that way but thinking a little deeper art would probably be the only source of comfort for those in better shapehealth. Imagination is what keeps us alive. Lopushanskiy had a few of it but not strong enough to create a shock to the senses a catalyst for a deeper reflection despite the several thoughts shared by the characters about life and what's left of it after a disaster. I felt tired depressed beyond my usual ways and didn't find any of those letters to Erick compelling hearted or with some deep meaning.For the most of it I think most people are seeing way too much about the film's message. It's there but it's too convoluted and almost inaccessible to most audiences. And I film like that should have been a little more down to audiences's earth. Like I said it could be a minor masterpiece to make us reflect about mankind the powers of be and how Chernobyl though not being a nuclear attack of a nation against the other made a whole shift in the gear when it comes to what nuclear energy was helpful in some ways but a disastrous and terrible thing for the environment and its people. In some brief moments the story went quite well in dealing with such notion but it's just half way doesn't go the extra mile needed for a higher discussion. 510".

I disagree about the artist quote about art being uselesspointless  in the film context it sort of works that way but thinking a little deeper art would probably be the only source of comfort for those in better shapehealth. Imagination is what keeps us alive. Lopushanskiy had a few of it but not strong enough to create a shock to the senses a catalyst for a deeper reflection despite the several thoughts shared by the characters about life and what's left of it after a disaster. I felt tired depressed beyond my usual ways and didn't find any of those letters to Erick compelling hearted or with some deep meaning.For the most of it I think most people are seeing way too much about the film's message. It's there but it's too convoluted and almost inaccessible to most audiences. And I film like that should have been a little more down to audiences's earth. Like I said it could be a minor masterpiece to make us reflect about mankind the powers of be and how Chernobyl though not being a nuclear attack of a nation against the other made a whole shift in the gear when it comes to what nuclear energy was helpful in some ways but a disastrous and terrible thing for the environment and its people. In some brief moments the story went quite well in dealing with such notion but it's just half way doesn't go the extra mile needed for a higher discussion. 510";

It's a workable premise and the actors make the most of the stock soap opera characters they play. David Rasche Emma Samms Raymond Burr et al were wellchosen for their parts. Bit parts by Robert Wagner and Marvin Kaplan the voice of ChooChoo on TOP CAT are also memorable. Mariel Hemingway takes some flak on this comment board for her part but she seemed suited for the role and moved smoothly from her gawky character to the soap opera devil woman. This is a pleasant comedy but not as consistently funny as SOAPDISH. The script by veteran writers of Gilligan's Island and Bewitched suffers from a lot of unnecessary language for what could otherwise be a family film but moves along at a brisk pace except for the longish horseriding scenes.".

There's good girl Mariel Hemingway who is auditioning in real life for a part on Candy's soap opera and she shows up in the fantasy as well. I have to give special kudos to Raymond Burr who plays the family patriarch of this soap opera with tongue firmly in cheek. Burr's occasionally flashes a twinkle which you have to be sure to catch just to let you know how much he's enjoying this.

	schema:reviewBody "This John Candy movie had potential to be a really funny comedy perhaps one of his best movies where he is the lead star and there is not a Steve Martin or Dan Aykroyd to back him up. However the film just is not funny enough in areas of this film and it can not seem to build up any steam so I have to say this one pales to another purely John Candy film Who's Harry Crumb as that one may have been sort of a Fletch copycat still maintained the laughs all the way through the film while this one just loses its luster by having one to many unfunny scenes. The story is about a writer on a soap opera who is obsessed a bit with one of the star attractions going on a trip with said star. She is basically playing him because at this point he is the only real reason she is still on the show as the makers of the soap wanted her killed off long ago for being so difficult. Well an accident happens and when Candy's character comes to he is actually in the soap opera he writes for which makes for some funny stuff. Unfortunately the character he yearns for is seemingly headed for death but Candy's character quickly realizes that with a typewriter he can make things happen to his liking in this strange world he has entered. Like I said at times this movie is really funny and it is nice to watch Raymond Burr in one of his final roles but to many times this film is just not all that funny.".

The cable gag is really dated I haven't had black bar issues in about 15 yearsas is other parts of the film but it still works.Raymond Burr does a great deadpan job in his final theatrical performance. Muriel Hemmingway really stinks it up the rest of the cast is made up of soap actors who do a nice job of spoofing their own genre.Another good flick that spoofs soaps is Soapdish does not have the fantasy piece of Delirious but is also very funny.".

Unlike movies with good scripts and single stars Groundhog Day and Uncle Buck there was nothing to be done with this premise. For other movies with missed potential one needs look no farther than movies like Godfather 3 Bram Stokers Dracula Waterworld The Fan etc. The difference between those movies and this one is that the star had nothing to do with any of the films perceived problems. If you like John Candy and if you don't you are an idiot this is a great flick. His other movies that are worth an evening doesn't matter which evening they are worth showing up late for work are Uncle Buck The Great Outdoors Plains Trains and Automobiles Once Upon a Crime Brewster's Millions Spaceballs Stripes Nothing but Trouble and Who's Harry Crumb. They are all a little zany except for Planes Trains and Automobiles which is still one of the only movies that will make me cry no matter when how or who I see it with. Want proof that Candy can act watch Planes he plays such a sad and honest character that there is no doubt that he has what it takes. John Candy is one of the Great comedic actors of the second golden age of American cinema he is set apart from other notables by his lack of personal problems his candor and zest for life. We should all be as fortunate as he for the blessings he was given. Mr. Candy you are and will be missed and for as long as there are roofs there will be those of us who shout your name from atop them.Long Live SCTV John Candy and the best Julia Child I have ever seen.".

After receiving a bump on the head he awakens to find himself caught in the script he has been writing. He is now one of his own characters and has to endeavor to find his way back to this alternate reality or so it would seem.This premise is done well here but was done far better and darker in In the Mouth of Madness the horror production featuring Sam Neill.While I found this movie to be fun as I said it is not the best of Candy's films.I highly suggest The Great Outdoors  Uncle Buck. Summer Rental wasn't bad either. One of Candy's least known yet better films in my opinion.This movie rates a 5.810 from...the Fiend .".

	schema:headline " A Game Cast Keeps This Screwball Sex Comedy Afloat and Then Some";
	schema:reviewBody "I actually find this scatterbrained 1964 comedy a surprisingly amusing screwball farce all these years later despite its titillating title. So apparently does director Peyton Reed since he based most of his 2004 comic pastiche Down with Love on the storyline of this movie and less so on any of the Doris DayRock Hudson romps of the same era. Regardless they all have the same brew of conjugal misunderstandings mistaken identities and leering though never explicit sexuality because those were the days when a woman's virtue would never be compromised for anyone but the right man. Directed by the heavyhanded Richard Quine Paris When It Sizzles and written by Joseph Heller later the author of Catch22 and David R. Schwartz this ridiculous comedy benefits from a game cast headed by Tony Curtis still riding high from Some Like It Hot which is referred to for easy laughs in the story and Natalie Wood who shows her comedy chops with dexterity here.Curtis plays Bob Weston a sleazy magazine writer for a men's magazine whose editors are intent on exposing Dr. Helen Gurley Brown as a fraud as a sex expert. Author of the bestselling Sex and the Single Girl Brown is not at all the clenchjawed celebrity author who wrote the real book and appeared on The Tonight Show constantly. Instead she is a gorgeous intellectually prodigious 23yearold who extols female empowerment in the bedroom. Showing off his moral depravity Weston steals the marital woes of her nextdoor neighbors pantyhose magnate Frank Broderick and his acerbic wife Sylvia and comes to see Dr. Brown as a patient. The rest is predictable but still a good amount of fun. Curtis was still at the top of his game here showing how he can easily elicit laughs from such a vile manipulator but it's Wood who surprises as Brown. Displaying a nervous but infectious energy that feeds nicely into the two sides of the doctor she is funny and sexy in a way that she could never quite balance as well again in her career. Witness the hilariously conflicted drunken scene in her apartment for evidence of her talent.Quine was smart to cast three sharp stars in the key supporting roles  Henry Fonda as the putupon Frank browbeaten into a sad man by Lauren Bacall pulling all the stops as the shrewish basket case Sylvia is and Mel Ferrer as Brown's somewhat ambiguous colleague. Add a sultry Fran Jeffries who performs two numbers including the title tune for no apparent reason except to sell records an even sexier Leslie Parrish The Manchurian Candidate as Weston's secretary and a genuinely funny extended car chase scene and you have the makings of an underappreciated sex comedy. The 2009 DVD part of the sixdisc The Natalie Wood Collection includes a Warner Brothers cartoon Nelly's Folly and the original theatrical trailer.".

So I have been seeing some of her old movies here and there. This one has been released on DVD and it is a very nice one.Tony Curtis stars as Bob Weston the most sleazy writer for the magazine STOP that prides itself in sleazy reporting. He has done an article on 23yearold single therapist Natalie Wood as Helen Gurley Brown who wrote the book Sex and the Single Girl. The article went on to ridicule the young therapist by saying a young single virgin could not be a very credible sex therapist. Quickly she found her appointments being canceled because of the article.But Bob Weston has an even grander plan he will romance the young doctor and get enough inside information to write an even harderhitting expose'.Bob's neighbor and friend is ladies hosiery manufacturer and sales manager Henry Fonda as Frank Broderick. Frank's wife is Lauren Bacall as Sylvia.As soon as Bob realizes that Helen knows who he is and will not let him even in the same room he hatches a plan he will pretend to be his neighbor Frank and ask for help with relationship issues between himself and his wife. But Frank and Sylvia know nothing about this.The interplay between Curtis and Wood is great and many very funny situations result. When Helen eventually finds out what is really going on she decides to skip out to Fiji with an admiring coworker but Bob Frank and Sylvia all end up in a madcap chase scene on the Los Angeles freeway system that also involves a cab driver an ice cream vendor and a motorcycle cop. It is madcap and it is funny.Nothing in the story is plausible but it doesn't have to be. It is just a funny story with funny characters. A classic from the 1960s.".

	schema:headline " Stars sex and fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Sex comedies from the sixties may seem a trifle dated now it's a long way since Rock Hudson and Doris Day made their way through the seduction game. But what it loses in accuracy if it was ever accurate it wins back in appealing innocent charm. This one was made in 1964 and follows the regular storyline a guy who's strongly described as a womanizer decides to make love to an inexperienced young woman but she confuses him with someone else and the two fall in love in the process. This time the guy is a newspaper man from a tabloid directed by Edward Everett Horton who hasn't changed a bit since Fred Astaire and the girl a psychiatrist loosely based on the journalist Helen Gurley Brown in fact that's her name but the rest is fiction. There's also a shade of The Moon Is Blue with everyone wondering if Helen is or not a virgin.The film itself is not very long and you have sometimes the feeling it lasts forever and sometimes you wish it could. In the pivotal part Natalie Wood is plain exquisite. She seemed to have grown more and more beautiful with each film she made and it's no exception. She also manages to be terribly funny without turning ridiculous childlike and touching yet never losing her sophisticated seduction. Wood was about 26 then and to me that makes the film work much better than the DayHudson comedies. Who could believe a thirtyish attractive woman with an interesting job and an independent mind wouldn't meet any man before Rock decides to come along? As for Tony Curtis he's very fine as the seducer. He has the chance to play a few wacky comedy scenes as well jumping in the river with Natalie in his arms and dressing as a woman to get out of her building a Some Like it Hot joke he even explains to the audience. There's no Tony Randall here but Henry Fonda is the best friend a fussy middleaged depressed lingerie manufacturer who can't seem to make things right with his wife blas Lauren Bacall. The real magic of the film is anytime Wood and Curtis interact flirt and seduce each other but the two older stars make for a very enjoyable counterpart. Fonda claiming he will never laugh again then giggling over a racy tabloid is priceless. So is Bacall opening her door to Natalie an early morning with her legend husky voice. We've also got Mel Ferrer in a highly unexpected turn as the lighthearted and prodancer psychiatrist Rudy and Fran Meglio Stasera Jeffries has a small part as Tony's casual girlfriend and of course getting to sing the title song. Richard Quine gave a less dynamic direction than usual but his emphasis on the easy life of the early 60's welloffs is still pretty funny to watch the buildings dresses dances dates come all from better days probably idealized even then by the gentle eye of Cinemascope. The car chase near the end is uneven as well with dragging bits against genuine laughter. Another pleasant point still is the very breezy music written by Neal Hefti the man responsible for The Odd Couple and Barefoot in the Park. A short piece devoted to accompany the two young leads 'romance The Game is probably the sweetest Hefti ever get. Don't forget to check the injokes Quine makes repeated allusions to one of his favorite actors Jack Lemmon who would a year after costar with both Curtis and Wood in comedy masterpiece The Great Race. When you smile like that you do look a lot like Jack Lemmon remarks a smitten Natalie through midfilm. He does not by the way but who cares ? Lemmon's subtle yet persistent shadow on the film is another little thing that makes Sex and the Single Girl very lovable indeed.".

It boils down to a choice between a sleazy columnist concealing himself as a married man Tony Curtis or a confidant who is merely seeking a stilted arrangement Mel Ferrar Your clothes are from Bonwit Teller which insinuates that you are masquerading a pretense of sophistication and elusive composure!! Such a wardrobe suggests a disconcerting demeanor about Being Above Reproach So!! as a result sex with whom you think is a married man Tony Curtis is just not in your cosmopolitan repertoire..but then again he does that Thing with the Ear...We are not talking about putting his mouth over it like a pet terrier or a grandparent or something we are talking about a penetrating slither... Lauren Bacall and Henry Fonda's marital problems are what instigate the plot in this movie!! Tony Curtis pretends to be Frank BroderickHenry Fonda's character with ulterior motives to unearth a gossip ridden story about a prominent therapist's Natalie Wood virginity status!! An oversexed male who delves into the recreation of sexual depravity is callous in his rudimentary pursuit of basic needs. These urges are best paralleled with feeding time at the zoo!! While you are at the zoo you might want to check up on how this evolutionary ladder thing is progressing!! Cleverly receiving an invitation to her apartment she Natalie Wood thinks this for purposes of acting as a therapist and assuming a surrogate role anything to help right? How foolish!! Tony Curtis winds up wearing an upper middle class woman's bathrobe fondly reminiscing about the days of Some like it Hot and now!! it is time to get down to business!! The bottom of the earlobe is everyone's nemesis and not just a sexual deviate's!! Heavy breathing on your ear especially after a couple of martinis gives your professional resolve all the longevity of a Popsicle on a hot July afternoon!! Your befuddled verbosity which contains an onslaught of analytical euphemisms is a subterfuge for your maverick curiosity and that pejorative confusion inevitably translates to your desire for Sex!! Everyone lights a cigarette while they have another cigarette going already!! This precarious mannerism purports a potpourri of falsehoods everybody seems comfortable with!! Lying about things has now become second nature to people as a matter of fact it is kind of fun!! This allegedly married man you are cavorting with has a good head on his shoulders but he is not thinking with his head...What he is thinking with is not very swift at all!! BELIEVE ME!! Such a lewd fiasco comprises the aggregate compendium of you as the prototype for woman's liberation in the 1960's!! Finally recrimination has evoked a bittersweet awakening to you!! It is now become very obvious to you that first hand consequences are dreadfully different from that article you read in Reader's Digest on THE DON JUAN COMPLEX To top it all off you fall in love!! Natalie Wood is sensational in this role...Originally known as the adorable little girl on Miracle on 34th St not much has changed since then!! She may still believe in Santa Claus because he is the only man who keeps his promises!!The movie Sex and the Single Girl has an amazing array of talent Natalie Wood Tony Curtis Lauren Bacall Henry Fonda Mel Ferrar and a whole list of others!!

Body parts like knees and ear lobes are vulnerabilities for the consummate carnal's doubleentendre!! This film amusingly resonates itself to a common sixties style movie and winds up having a matchmaker's version of a happy ending!! Most significantly everybody has flippantly and metaphorically acknowledged that Eve ate the apple. the Greeks were indeed perverted and a person by the name of Sigmund Freud did actually exist!! Funny movie!!! Why? It is a comically realistic illustration of men's over active hormones that are incorporated into a screwball comedy!!...I liked this movie!!".

I should only have said something that brilliant. Watching Fonda I did see traces of the slow burn and Bacall is certainly more chic than Dot Farley.

	schema:reviewBody "Innameonly movieversion of Helen Gurley Brown's book a glossy but fairly unamusing comedy which begins as a semisophisticated battleofthesexes eventually becoming a ditsy slapstick outing which treats its characters as overage juveniles.

It is a tongueincheek attempt at humor that in the end is nothing more than a series of gags. Unfortunately most of what is intended as humor is rather lame and not worthy of an issue of Mad Magazine. These gags are more appropriate for an episode of The Carol Burnett Show and would have been performed better there.There's a flat joke about automats and the automation of America. A man in a frilly woman's robe. Fonda and Bacall twisting to a song that is not appropriate for twisting. Water coming out of the mouth of someone who was dunked in the ocean. The only gag that works is about two men in golfcarts chasing their balls.Accompanying this annoying attempt at humor is an insipid soundtrack replete with rimshots and silly sound effects.This film has nothing to say. And the characters are just silly caricatures so you can't really care about what happens to them. SATSG has a wonderful cast totally misspent. Every actor has many quality films to his credit except Larry Storch so it's painful to see them in this shallow unfunny vehicle. Consider Tony Curtis Natalie Wood Henry Fonda Lauren Bacall and Mel Ferrer.There is a nostalgic joy in seeing any of these actors in a film but that was the extent of my interest in this film.

Although I imagine after this a movie having with Sex in a movie's title wasn't such a big deal but here they sure take advantage of it with the animated opening which puts a lot of emphasis on the word 'SEX' in big capital letters. Perhaps the movie may have something interesting to say on its subject with Natalie Wood playing a psychologist who is a 23 old virgin which characters in the film viewed as a compliment or something about sleazy journalism but the movie becomes too dull to bother deciphering.From what I've seen I get the impression that Richard Quine is a lousy director. He's done a number of movies with great casts and interesting premises but are let down by flat uninspired direction. The opening scene of Sex and the Single Girl is a gem with 1930's comedy actor Edward Everett Horton giving a speech on how proud he is of his publication becoming the filthy rag it is today. Sadly it goes downhill from there. Even with the movie's madcap finale it is hard to care what's going on.Henry Fonda was ashamed of this movie stating in an interview that he agreed to star in the film as a comprise to do a box office picture so he could indulge in doing movies which interested him such as 12 Angry Men and The OxBow Incident. There are worse movies you can do but why did he hate it so much? I doubt he would have an issue with appearing in a sex comedy as he himself starred in the sexually charged comedy The Lady Eve years earlier or is it because of the movie's sleaze factor? Who knows...Although I would be lying if I didn't say I still got some superficial enjoyment out of the film. I am a sucker for the 60's aesthetic with the bright colourful sets the stocking factory is very amusing and the cool breezy music by Neal Hefti. Likewise I do like the contrast between two generations present between Tony Curtis  Natalie Wood and Henry Fonda  Lauren Bacall. Sex and the Single Girl could have been a neoscrewball gem. In the end it's a movie which looks appealing from the outside but is hollow on the inside.".

In the first place girls do NOT have PhD's. Secondly a book of demographic information and dating tips could have been abridged into an 114minute onscreen dramatic reading and been far more entertaining that the lame plot on exhibition here.

It was not something that was intended initially but actually it has proven to be a generally worthwhile experience even with a couple of missteps. While there were and are better actors about and he didn't always look comfortable in his early films Curtis was always immensely likeable and had a charming charisma with many good and more performances under his belt. The cover was also appetising the cast it's hard to go wrong with Henry Fonda Mel Ferrer Edward Everett Horton and especially Lauren Bacall on their own and seeing them in the same film is a treat and the story while unoriginal seemed really interesting. So there were all the ingredients here for it to work and really wanted to like it.Ended up however not really caring for this. Not a waste of time or terrible but considering the premise and the talent in front of the camera the execution should have been much better.Although they have all been better and have been better served the cast are the best thing about it. In particular Natalie Wood having seen her in 'The Great Race' and found her annoying and out of her depth in that film which gave the impression of struggling in comedy. Seeing her here changed my perception here she is more than at ease in the comedy and is very funny while also being likeable and luminous. Tony Curtis has always been at home in comedy and shows great comic timing and charismatic charm. The romantic element is sweet.Henry Fonda certainly doesn't flounder and his lack of interest in the film didn't show to me. Lauren Bacall is even better being suitably shrewish and she is a lot of fun to watch. Likewise with Edward Everett Horton in a role that suits him perfectly. One similarly can say that too for Mel Ferrer and Fran Jeffries and Leslie Parrish are sultry additions. Production values are slick and stylish glossy but colourful and beautifully shot. The music is infectious with a memorable title song. On the other hand the script lets things down. It's thankfully not smutty but it is also very 60s and goes well overboard on the silliness furthermore it's very bland with nowhere near enough sauciness or wit. While not inept as such the direction is not very distinguished and it is very uninspired getting the job done without getting egg on his face but the personality is too safe and not there. Larry Storch's cameo is more an annoying caricature than anything else. The story is very contrived can be very sluggish in pace which is the opposite of the energy displayed by the more than game cast and struggles to fit enough content for a running time that could have been trimmed. Something that would have been solved by making the climactic car chase much shorter or excising it completely and providing something else here the climax goes on for far too long it is not exciting feels too stretched out felt shoehorned in and tacked on and would have been more at home in an overthetop cartoon that's how cartoonish it was.Concluding not bad but a disappointment. 510 Bethany Cox".

All of the credit in the world goes to John Wayne for making this film.

It is one of the few Hollywood films to try to show the Second World War from the German point of view. Karl Ehrlich Wayne is a man torn between his love for his country and his personal hatred for the ideals of Hitler. He is an officer of the old school Prussian monarchy still loyal to the Kaiser who does not like the new regime. As Jeff Napier David Farrar notices he flies the swastika outside on his ship but still has the old imperial battle flag hanging in his cabin. He must decide whether to allow his ship to be taken or defy the entire British Navy and try to bring the Ergenstrasse back safely to the Fatherland. The flag he flies during the final battle is a telling sign of where his loyalty lies and in my opinion is Ehrlich's explanation for his actions.

	schema:headline " No Sparks between Luscious Lana and Stoic Duke on the High Seas";
	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne as the captain of a German ship during the early days of World War II? The same John Wayne who rode tall in the saddle saved a doomed airliner and led the Green Berets? All right he does not support German policies but nevertheless casting Wayne in the part of Captain Karl Ehrlich was a bizarre choice. The Duke does not even attempt a German accent and he actually mispronounces the only German words that he utters Auf Wiedersehn. Perhaps the lure of starring opposite the luscious if decidedly petite next to Wayne Lana Turner was reason enough to ignore the mediocre script and listless direction by John Farrow.Whatever Wayne's motives for appearing in The Sea Chase he plays John Wayne relatively well and outmaneuvers the pursuing British in the grand heroic style he pioneered. Of course why the audience should be pulling for the Germans to escape the British during World War II is a moral dilemma with which to wrestle. However somewhat akin to Das Boot only one dastardly German serves among the otherwise apolitical crew and a Nazi flag only appears once and briefly.As Ehrlich Wayne sails from Sydney just after hostilities begin in Europe and with a British ship in pursuit which is captained by an officer that Wayne managed to insult over a woman the glowing Ms. Turner Wayne maneuvers his ship through the South Pacific towards safety in Valparaiso. Just before leaving Sydney the German counsel tells Captain Ehrlich that he will be carrying a passenger a spy who also seeks refuge in Valparaiso. Of course the increasingly stunning Lana Turner is the passenger who has managed to escape Sydney with only one bag. And what a bag that must have been because throughout the voyage she has endless changes from one glamorous costume to another. Her makeup is never less than perfect and the hairspray alone to keep her immaculately coiffed must have weighed a ton. How she maintained the perfection of her platinum blonde hair without a dye specialist on board remains a mystery. Of course The Sea Chase is pure Hollywood hokum and such questions of logic should never be asked.Unfortunately for the film and perhaps for Wayne there appears to be little chemistry between the Duke and Turner. In the one kissing scene Wayne seems to be biting Turner's jugular while holding his breath rather than exuding any passion. Turner does not turn up the heat either.

The decidedly nonTeutonic actors in the supposedly German crew include such familiar faces as James Arness Tab Hunter Claude Akins Paul Fix and Alan Hale and each is decidedly superior to the lines they are forced to recite.Although the film is a supposedly a chase there is a shortage of action and the film plods along with little suspense other than that provided by Turner's wardrobe changes.

	onyx:emotionText "John Wayne as the captain of a German ship during the early days of World War II? The same John Wayne who rode tall in the saddle saved a doomed airliner and led the Green Berets? All right he does not support German policies but nevertheless casting Wayne in the part of Captain Karl Ehrlich was a bizarre choice. The Duke does not even attempt a German accent and he actually mispronounces the only German words that he utters Auf Wiedersehn. Perhaps the lure of starring opposite the luscious if decidedly petite next to Wayne Lana Turner was reason enough to ignore the mediocre script and listless direction by John Farrow.Whatever Wayne's motives for appearing in The Sea Chase he plays John Wayne relatively well and outmaneuvers the pursuing British in the grand heroic style he pioneered. Of course why the audience should be pulling for the Germans to escape the British during World War II is a moral dilemma with which to wrestle. However somewhat akin to Das Boot only one dastardly German serves among the otherwise apolitical crew and a Nazi flag only appears once and briefly.As Ehrlich Wayne sails from Sydney just after hostilities begin in Europe and with a British ship in pursuit which is captained by an officer that Wayne managed to insult over a woman the glowing Ms. Turner Wayne maneuvers his ship through the South Pacific towards safety in Valparaiso. Just before leaving Sydney the German counsel tells Captain Ehrlich that he will be carrying a passenger a spy who also seeks refuge in Valparaiso. Of course the increasingly stunning Lana Turner is the passenger who has managed to escape Sydney with only one bag. And what a bag that must have been because throughout the voyage she has endless changes from one glamorous costume to another. Her makeup is never less than perfect and the hairspray alone to keep her immaculately coiffed must have weighed a ton. How she maintained the perfection of her platinum blonde hair without a dye specialist on board remains a mystery. Of course The Sea Chase is pure Hollywood hokum and such questions of logic should never be asked.Unfortunately for the film and perhaps for Wayne there appears to be little chemistry between the Duke and Turner. In the one kissing scene Wayne seems to be biting Turner's jugular while holding his breath rather than exuding any passion. Turner does not turn up the heat either. In spite of her famous looks and figure Lana exudes a chill towards most of the men in the film although she tempts the sexstarved crew with tightly filled sweaters from her private deck. The decidedly nonTeutonic actors in the supposedly German crew include such familiar faces as James Arness Tab Hunter Claude Akins Paul Fix and Alan Hale and each is decidedly superior to the lines they are forced to recite.Although the film is a supposedly a chase there is a shortage of action and the film plods along with little suspense other than that provided by Turner's wardrobe changes.

Still navysea warfare buffs will enjoy the story of the pursuit by a British destroyer of a German merchant ship across several oceans. The cast is soso but with the Duke John Wayne in the lead role the story manages to limp along with some degree of success. The destroyer used in the film is in fact HMCS New Glasgow a frigate then in service with the Royal Canadian Navy. I saw the movie shortly after it's release in 1955 while in my midteens a number of years later I served on New Glasgow and recalled the part played by the ship and crew in the film. Shows how Hollywood will use any prop available to fill in scenes. The crew never did get any extra pay for their appearance nor did the shipbut at least they have the satisfaction of knowing the true identity of the destroyer. Despite all the above the film is good viewing and will be of interest to many.".

Right around the same time there were players like Curt Jurgens or the newly arrived in Hollywood Yul Brynner who would have been far better and believable in the role of freighter captain Karl Ehrlich. Brynner in fact later on did quite well in the film Morituri playing a German freighter captain. James Mason would have done well also. What was the Duke thinking.Offhand I can only think of three films in which he played a nonAmerican this one The Long Voyage Home and The Conqueror. Of course The Conqueror was one of the biggest flops in film history with Wayne as Genghis Khan. He did all right in The Long Voyage Home but it's a small part in an ensemble production. John Ford must have been very patient with him getting that proper Swedish accent there. Wayne did not have Robert Mitchum's ear for dialect. In fact Mitchum might have been able to play Karl Ehrlich.The story starts in Sydney harbor right before the Nazis march into Poland. With war talk in the air Captain David Farrar visits his old friend Wayne on his tramp steamer and he brings his new fianc Lana Turner. Wayne knows her to be an adventuress and probably an agent for the Nazis. He tells her to leave Farrar while the leaving is good little dreaming he'd be asked by the German consul to transport Turner back to Germany.Wayne sneaks his ship out of Sydney Harbor and the Royal Navy gives chase. While stopping at an island for supplies second officer Lyle Bettger a hardened Nazi murders the survivors of a fishing vessel who were stranded there. Of course the atrocity redounds to Wayne's ship and gives the Royal Navy real reason to pursue.David Farrar is a fine British sea captain in the best stiff upper lip tradition. Of course Lyle Bettger adds to that wonderful group psychotics he developed a patent on during the fifties. Lana Turner is well cast in her role as femme fatale.A whole lot of young players are in the crew of Wayne's ship like James Arness Tab Hunter Richard Davalos and Alan Hale Jr. When the ship stops and makes some repairs and provisions the crew is put to work cutting down trees. Lots of topless beefcake for the audience there.In addition Richard Davalos has a very touching death scene probably the acting highlight of the film.It's not the worst film John Wayne ever did but fans of the eternal Duke will find his playing a German incongruous to say the least.".

	schema:headline " Vigorous as well as odd war drama set at the outbreak of WWII and with an unusual role by the Duke Wayne";
	schema:reviewBody "Exciting flick on the danger waters of the Pacific with Wayne as a seasoned Captain undertaking several adventures and risks . As the Second World War breaks out  1939 German freighter captain Karl Ehrlich John Wayne is about to leave Sydney  Australia  with his his boat  the Ergenstrasse it was portrayed by the real HMCS New Glascow  a Prestonianclass frigate  as he is determined to steer his vessel back to Germany . But a suspicious beauty is aboard as the British Commander Jeff Napier's David Farrar who narrates the tale by voiceinoff girlfriend  she's called Elsa Keller Lana Turner . As Elsa  a mysterious woman  is on board  that's why Ehrlich has been ordered to return to Germany safely along with whatever secrets she carries . Then the brave skipper sails despite an English blockade  being pursued by British and German navies as he abandons Down Under . As Karl must smuggle throughout enemy Oceans plenty of warships and cruisers . When Ehrlich's fiercely Nazi chief officer Kirchner Lyle Bettger commits an atrocity  the British chase becomes deadly . As Ehrlich tries to get his ship back to Germany across the Pacific  Atlantic Oceans and through a gauntlet of Allied warships .This enjoyable picture packs thrills  drama  action  sea pursuits  it results to be pretty entertaining and appear as supporting players a lot of prestigious actors  however  being overlong . John Wayne's good vehicle  though miscast as an obstinate Prussian skipper . The plot is plain and simple  as World War II begins  at its violent outbreak  a renegade as well as stubborn German freighter captain named Karl Ehrlich escapes from Sidney and must transport a mysterious passenger and arrive in his destination  Germany . Interesting and stirring script from James Warner Bella  John Ford's regular screenwriter  and John Twist based on a novel written by Andrew Geer . This Sea chase or La Cacera bears certain resemblance with Blood Alley 55 by William A. Wellman  also with a skipper Wayne  along with Lauren Bacall  pursued and surrounded by enemy ships and attempting to escape . The WayneTurner combination ignite the sparks you'd expect .

As the Second World War breaks out  1939 German freighter captain Karl Ehrlich John Wayne is about to leave Sydney  Australia  with his his boat  the Ergenstrasse it was portrayed by the real HMCS New Glascow  a Prestonianclass frigate  as he is determined to steer his vessel back to Germany . But a suspicious beauty is aboard as the British Commander Jeff Napier's David Farrar who narrates the tale by voiceinoff girlfriend  she's called Elsa Keller Lana Turner . As Elsa  a mysterious woman  is on board  that's why Ehrlich has been ordered to return to Germany safely along with whatever secrets she carries . Then the brave skipper sails despite an English blockade  being pursued by British and German navies as he abandons Down Under . As Karl must smuggle throughout enemy Oceans plenty of warships and cruisers . When Ehrlich's fiercely Nazi chief officer Kirchner Lyle Bettger commits an atrocity  the British chase becomes deadly . As Ehrlich tries to get his ship back to Germany across the Pacific  Atlantic Oceans and through a gauntlet of Allied warships .This enjoyable picture packs thrills  drama  action  sea pursuits  it results to be pretty entertaining and appear as supporting players a lot of prestigious actors  however  being overlong . John Wayne's good vehicle  though miscast as an obstinate Prussian skipper . The plot is plain and simple  as World War II begins  at its violent outbreak  a renegade as well as stubborn German freighter captain named Karl Ehrlich escapes from Sidney and must transport a mysterious passenger and arrive in his destination  Germany . Interesting and stirring script from James Warner Bella  John Ford's regular screenwriter  and John Twist based on a novel written by Andrew Geer . This Sea chase or La Cacera bears certain resemblance with Blood Alley 55 by William A. Wellman  also with a skipper Wayne  along with Lauren Bacall  pursued and surrounded by enemy ships and attempting to escape . The WayneTurner combination ignite the sparks you'd expect . Nice acting by the great John Wayne  here he takes an unusual character as Ehrlich  an antiNazi but proud German who hopes to outrun or outmaneuver the British warship pursuing him .

	schema:reviewBody "John Wayne is monumentally miscast as the captain of a German boat during World War 2. John Wayne pretty much plays the part as he plays all of his parts  simply as 'John Wayne'. He saunters through his role not really acting but just being there however he does have a great screen presence. He's not a German though and his strong American accent does him no favours in the believability stakes and the fact that all of the crew speak English make this a film that obviously doesn't care whether or not the audience will believe it. Of course this is 1950's Hollywood so we can't expect the crew speak German with subtitles or anything like that but having a German crew speak fluent English doesn't really work.Despite it's relative silliness however this film is decent throwaway entertainment. The plot follows the escapades of John Wayne...I mean Karl Ehrlich a German freighter captain who must take his ship from Sydney Australia to it's homeland of Germany. However things are never that simple as hot on his heels are the British Navy and as we all know Britannia rules the waves so John...I mean Karl has a job on his hands. A chase is always exciting to see in a film and it is exciting here.... sometimes. The film never reaches the dizzy highs of other action adventure films but it holds it's own in the entertainment department. There are several good sequences such as a shark attack several scenes of rough sea and a near mutiny among other things.Lana Turner stars opposite John Wayne as the standard 'love interest'. Lana's performance isn't bad and she looks nice but the love part of the film seems very much like it was tacked on in order to get more people to go and see it. I know that this obviously isn't what happened as all love interests in films like this are very much needed so that the story can progress and have nothing to do with getting more people into the cinema. Oh wait. Anyway despite this needless element The sea Chase is mostly well paced and it doesn't get boring often and when it does it's not for long so I recommend the film to anyone that just wants something mindless to watch for a couple of hours like I did when I watched it.".

	schema:reviewBody "What was with John Wayne in the 1950s?! Perhaps it was because he often produced his own films or had great star power but whatever the reason he chose some of the weirdest parts to play. Think about it...during this era he played Genghis Khan a diplomat to Japan an Air Force pilot this isn't so weird but his counterpart was Janet Leigh as a Russian pilot!! and here he plays a German ship's captain during WWII!! At least here he is a German who dislikes the Nazis....but still...Wayne fighting for Germany during the war?! That's so surreal! The film begins just days before WWII begins. Wayne is having a conversation with an old friend who is a captain in the British Navy. This officer is trying to convince Wayne to leave his boat and come with him as he knows that Wayne hates Hitler and the Nazis. However Wayne's sense of duty and loyalty to his country prevent him from doing anything other than command his ship.When the war begins Wayne is concerned to first evade his friend's warship as well as avoid being captured once they are underway. So it's a neverending battle to take this merchant vessel to small ports where they can get food and fueland somehow possibly make it back to port at Valparaiso and eventually back to Germany.What Wayne doesn't know is that his overzealous Nazi of a first officer murders two innocent fishermen when they stop to get provisions. Later when the British Navy discovers this atrocity Wayne's old friend is determined to destroy the merchant ship and make Wayne pay.During all this time there inexplicably is a woman aboard. Apparently she Lana Turner is a spy who needs to get away as soon as possible or she'll be captured. Once on board she generally is a nuisance as she seems petulant and nasty for no particular reason. Later naturally sparks fly between Turner and Waynethough the reason for this seemed a bit forced and illogical.Let's talk more about Wayne and Turner. Although casting Wayne was odd he handled the job well provided you were able to believe he was German. He did a good job and his character was particularly written well. As for Turner she seemed like a giant walking clich. She was moody and curt but over time she became enamored with Wayne. This turnaround was really too much as she seemed all emotions and ficklenessa truly shallow and silly character Turner by the way was good at these sort of roles. Late in the film off the coast of Norway the dialog particularly hers is really really badvery sticky and dumb.Overall a pretty interesting tale that didn't really need Lana Turner's character. She was a diversion in an otherwise engaging tale.".

On board he has a sexy spy played by Lana Turner. This is an odd role for Duke that I'm surprised he took. His character is antiNazi but still he's playing a German fleeing the British and trying to take his ship back to Nazi Germany. And he does have at least one Nazi on board. Perhaps he really wanted to work with Lana Turner. Can't say I blame any man for that. But that part of the film falls flat as the two have poor chemistry. Lana's beautiful though with her platinum blonde hair looking perfect at all times. The supporting cast is full of familiar faces with Paul Fix and Dick Davalos giving standout performances. The biggest flaw is that it's not a terribly exciting film. For a movie centered around a chase it's awfully slow.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's the outbreak of World War II and John Wayne plays a German ! freighter captain trying to get his ship from Australia back to Germany with the British in pursuit. On board he has a sexy spy played by Lana Turner. This is an odd role for Duke that I'm surprised he took. His character is antiNazi but still he's playing a German fleeing the British and trying to take his ship back to Nazi Germany. And he does have at least one Nazi on board. Perhaps he really wanted to work with Lana Turner. Can't say I blame any man for that. But that part of the film falls flat as the two have poor chemistry. Lana's beautiful though with her platinum blonde hair looking perfect at all times. The supporting cast is full of familiar faces with Paul Fix and Dick Davalos giving standout performances. The biggest flaw is that it's not a terribly exciting film. For a movie centered around a chase it's awfully slow.";

You can't get much MORE American so he never convinces as a German for a second.Aside from the miscasting THE SEA CHASE tells an interesting seabound tale that occasionally reminded me of the Jack Higgins novel STORM WARNING albeit with less tension. And that's the problem with this lengthy film there's no suspense even though there are some good setpieces including the occasional shock here and there. The story just sort of plods along while the Lana Turner characters adds extra clich and slows things down even more.There's never a sense of pursuit or real menace here or even survival against the odds. Instead the writers go through the motions putting all of that effort into setting the scene and location and then not doing much with it. The ensemble cast members are fine but nothing much really happens and I was twiddling my thumbs at times. And the end looks like they ran out of money it's so cheaply achieved.".

His little ship might just as easily be a floating Alamo with a German flag.He slips his moorings at night in the fog in order to escape internment. On board is a German kissntell agent played by busty Lana Turner. She in turn is the formerly betrothed mistress to a British navel captain played by David Farrer. Farrer also provides the intermittent narrative voiceover.There's plenty of familiar faces in the crew. Not least is Lyle Bettger who should have done what Wayne did and invent himself a more memorable name. He plays his ruthless and vicious first officer.

David Farrer's Captain doesn't much care for losing his woman or the fact that she was a spy. But the case is compounded when the first officer murders some marooned sailors blackballing Wayne and his vessel.There's lots of adventures along the way as a catandmouse pursuit pitches the British navy against our elusive trampsteamer. Ms Turner's character has to learn that there's actually more to men than her mammaryglands can gratify. Farrer is frequently outfoxed. Qualen keeps the engine running. There are several interesting dynamics with the rest of the crew  especially when it comes to using lifeboats as fuel.The ending is a bit flimsy. After such sterling and steadfast characters have been developed throughout the movie the ambiguous melting away of the stars isn't very satisfying.But it's a good old 1950's adventure with all of the standard features of the period.

In my opinion Dante's Peak does a good job of developing the characters Dalton R. Wando the volcano as a character even the townsfolk giving convincing backstory as to how volcanos behave compared to scientists' expectations making us care about the characters building tension through conflict between Dreyfus and Dalton and using effects to ramp up the intensity of the action scenes.Yes there were things in the script and the story which seemed a little contrived and strained believability. The attitudes and behavior of the USGS team were a little too informal and hip to seem real. The drivingthroughtheriver and drivingthroughthelava scenes were really too far out to be believed. Ruth's selfishness and patent stubbornness were unbelievable but understandable. The scene where the pyroclastic cloud chases them into the mine is pure hollywood fluff but still livable mainly because WE CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. I found the character of Dr. Paul Dreyfuss to be right on. He explained the dilemma well during the city council meeting scene. All of the characters are believable at least convincing at most.I think the chemistry between Dalton and Wando is believable  Here you have a scientist who is analytical and professional but who is still in touch with the lives of laypeople and has a tender side. He has loved and lost before and he senses that this new volcanic threat is akin to the last one which took his love away. This reenforces the precept that THIS TIME HE WON'T LET THE VOLCANO HURT THE ONES HE LOVES. Wando is the warm slightly ditsy mayor of Dante's Peak who displays the identifiable traits and values of a northwesterner. She feels slightly overwhelmed by her mayoral duties raising her kids properly and running her coffeeshop. She's had a previous marriage to a deadbeat who left her at a vulnerable point. The arrival of Dalton is very catalytic in her life. She's met the only man who has the right answer about the volcano likes her kids likes her is intriguing and is everything her ex wasn't. THIS IS THE MAKINGS OF A ROMANCE...DUH.I'm really impressed that the filmmakers were able to pack this much character development backstory romance suspense personal conflict with an intense endsequence in under 1 12 hours! Volcano is a film with a similar premise thatIMHO doesn't even come close to Dante's Peak. While this film is not deserving of an Oscar IT IS A SOLID FILM HAVING BEEN WELLCONCEIVED WELLDIRECTED FAIRLY WELLACTED AND AS SUCH IS SUBSEQUENTLY WELLDESERVING OF SOME CRITICAL ACCLAIM rather than getting a baseless pummeling from reviewers who obviously expect to see a 5star gem everytime they go to the movies.".

The movie has action love despair and redemption. I gave this movie a 10 and I'm sticking with it! Linda has been one of the most talented actresses around for a while. I was very upset that she did not get a golden globe or academy award nomination for T2Judgement Day. She know what to bring to her roles and how to use them. Mr. Prosnan is a excellent actor. But he is better in this film than in most of the Bond films he has been in. The special effects were awesome and inspiring. Can anyone outrun a paraclastic cloud in a beat up and burned pickup that just drove over redhot lava? The answer is yes but just barely. Dedication means that you stay with the truck and the NASA signal device for at least 2 or 3 days until someone can drag you out and also get the family you were trying to save. Then you can go sea fishing after your compound fracture heals. This is a great movie.".

After the success of Twister and ID4 films like Hard Rain Titanic Armageddon and Deep Impact followed in its wake. Like the two competing asteroid movies Dante's Peak was in competition with the imaginatively named Volcano as THE Lava flow of 1997. Which one is better? Well comparing the two is like comparing an atomic blast to a popping pimple.Pierce Brosnan is Harry Dalton a Vulcanologist or James Bond in disguise if you want who predicts a major eruption in the quaint PacificNorthwestern town of Dante's Peak. No one wants to listen to him since the town has just been named the 2nd most desirable place to live in America and is in the early stages of a thriving economy. It's the politics from Jaws all over again. Despite being shouted down by his superiors Harry sticks around to keep his eye on the imposing mountain and woo Mayor Wando Linda Hamilton who is the only one who believes the 4000year dormant volcano might blow its top.If you've seen one disaster movie you've seen 'em all in terms of character importance. Yes it's bloody obvious who is going to die some of these people might as well have a death clock counting down stuck on their foreheads. And the panicking idiot mobs don't deserve anything less firey. When will nameless extras learn that following the crowd isn't the best way? I guess this is the weakest part of Dante's Peak it never really distances itself from that single eternal clich of disaster films.But the film is really nothing but a showcase for special effects and it does them surprisingly well. Made before the extreme popularity of CGI Dante's Peak has a lot of reallife destruction incamera effects and stuntwork. Yes there is a fair bit of CGI and for a 10yearold film they still hold up really well. All Volano Zzzz... had to offer was a very very slight lava flow and an unintentionally hilarious scene with a melting man but with Dante's Peak we get earthquakes boiled skinny dippers lakes of acid ash blizzards that create a unique atmosphere thunder and lightning red hot boulders raining down from the sky mudslides lava of course a massive pyroclastic cloud and lots of deep deep bass sound effects.It's not a lifechanging film by any means but as disaster movies go it's one of the best has an occasionally spooky score and entertains really well despite Brosnan taking it all so seriously. I would have given it a higher rating if they killed the dog more original and deleted the annoying Grant Heslov's utterly pointless character.".

I saw it again and thought it not very good at all and now having seen it recently I not bad but not great either. It's a well done disaster movie with one challenge after another to survive being thrown at the main characters. This roller coaster ride really pulled me in and even reminded me of the very well done remake of The Fugitive starring Harrison Ford. I'll admit some of the situations are a little hard to believe but at least they keep the film from being boring.The chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton while not incredible is still there. Also enjoyable was how the film makes use of its small town setting including in the casting characters you'd expect to find in a small town the female gossip the gruff but dedicated sheriff and the more businessminded don'trocktheboat councilman. Finally Harry Brosnan and Paul Dreyfus's band of colleagues also prevent the movie from being flat but are a little too reminiscent of the characters from Twister to really leave their own mark.Also what impressed me was some of the camera work which I think isn't given enough credit. There are a number of composite shots of the erupting volcano with the reflection probably understood to be from a truck's window of Rachel Hamilton looking back in horror that are quite well done. And the digital editing in of the volcano is also well done as well as some of the panoramas.A smaller problem I had with the movie is the development of Harry and Rachel's relationship. Initially their flirtations and the initial getting to know each other are quite cute. But I can't help but think why Rachel who has been a smalltown girl her whole life would be interested in someone like Harry who clearly states a that his job isn't exactly conducive to settling down. Sure Harry is everything her exhusband isn't and it's obvious that the both of them are lonely to a degree but it doesn't seem to me that a woman as sensible and who feels as great a responsibility as Rachel to her kids to the town to her business would find that to be enough. Also Harry seems to get over the touchy subject of his dear departed Marianne to start making passes at Rachel in her kitchen quite quickly.My biggest problem with the movie is the writing which is so bad in some places that it really brings down the parts in the movie where it is good. Harry's line about sex being like riding a bicycle because once you learn you never forget is laughable. Some of the Wando children's lines I found to be lacking in substance too and almost condescending to the viewer. But as I said not all the writing is bad an example is the excellent delivery of a reference to Pompei by one of Harry and Paul's colleagues and another's excitement over Rachel's regular coffee deliveries.In the end when this movie is bad it's bad but in general it's good.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a formula for disaster movies and books. An insightful scientist sees The Bad Thing is going to happen various foils keep him from warning people often with sillier motivation than in this film we get to know a bunch of average Joe characters who survive or do not survive the disaster. Earthquake movies movies about madeup natural disasters that cannot happen asteroid movies even some nuclear holocaust films like The Day After unique in how many survive. It's a hackneyed formula but it also works and nothing else really does work as well for disaster plots. It was followed here.The special effects were terrific in the day and they still hold up very very well in 2012.For a Hollywood film the science was pretty good. I actually cringed back at the shots of Hawaii type basalt floes just...no and the ashfall cleared up nicely whenever they wanted a wide shot which anyone in Yakima could tell you it really doesn't do and the boat and driveoverlava scenes were silly and if you paddle a boat through acid or not with one hand it's not going to go straight and our heroes didn't need to cover their mouths in ashfall meaning IRL the ash would turn to concrete in their lungs and they'd suffocate. However all that having been complained about much else was very accurate what gets tested for by volcanologists what monitoring stations of the day looked like what some of the warning signs of a coming eruption might be. Most Hollywood film reviews by me on sciencebased movies are nothing but a list of what they did wrong with no however of accurate bits to follow that list so kudos for doing it more than half right.A pleasant diversion very pretty to look at.".

An insightful scientist sees The Bad Thing is going to happen various foils keep him from warning people often with sillier motivation than in this film we get to know a bunch of average Joe characters who survive or do not survive the disaster. Earthquake movies movies about madeup natural disasters that cannot happen asteroid movies even some nuclear holocaust films like The Day After unique in how many survive. It's a hackneyed formula but it also works and nothing else really does work as well for disaster plots. It was followed here.The special effects were terrific in the day and they still hold up very very well in 2012.For a Hollywood film the science was pretty good. I actually cringed back at the shots of Hawaii type basalt floes just...no and the ashfall cleared up nicely whenever they wanted a wide shot which anyone in Yakima could tell you it really doesn't do and the boat and driveoverlava scenes were silly and if you paddle a boat through acid or not with one hand it's not going to go straight and our heroes didn't need to cover their mouths in ashfall meaning IRL the ash would turn to concrete in their lungs and they'd suffocate. However all that having been complained about much else was very accurate what gets tested for by volcanologists what monitoring stations of the day looked like what some of the warning signs of a coming eruption might be. Most Hollywood film reviews by me on sciencebased movies are nothing but a list of what they did wrong with no however of accurate bits to follow that list so kudos for doing it more than half right.A pleasant diversion very pretty to look at.";

He does exactly what it says on the tin and here he plays the man against the world very well. He's supported very nicely by Linda Terminator Hamilton and some pretty impressive child actors but none of them can hold a candle to the special effects. I'm a sucker for authentic or well designed effects and the earthquake and eruption scenes here are the best I've ever seen. It doesn't matter that the story is a pretty lame attempt to do for volcanoes what Twister did for tornados the brooding shots of the mountain that cut into most of the scenes are enough to keep you trying to guess not if but when the whole damn thing is going to explodeThere's a very surreal scene where Pierce and fellow escapees are caught in a powerless boat on a lake that has been made toxic by lava flow singing Row Row Your Boat while floating on an acidic deathbed  a nicely observed momentWith a neat score by John Frizzel and solid direction by Roger Cocktail and Species Donaldson you could do a hell of a lot worse than spend a couple of hours with Dante's Peak".

This film shows how people might actually act and think in a volcano situation. The art direction was great as they showed the sky and ash beautifully. The scenery of the town is very nice and the whole town seems very quiet and peaceful. I would have wanted to live there. This is the best volcano movie ever. No volcano movie will ever surpass this one. The cinematography is great also. Roger Donaldson did a great job of direction and the score by James Newton Howard is beautiful.

Although the film has a slow first half this is well worth sitting through as the incredible action climax has it all lakes full of acid flowing lava falling ash and a huge destructive pyroclastic cloud.Okay so I could have done without the incredibly annoying children in the film who repeatedly do stupid things and have to get rescued. I could do without the sickly sentimentalism which fills many scenes and the boring needless character development. I could do without the stupid old woman who thankfully gets fatally injured but then takes about a year to die. I could do without Linda Hamilton's nonacting of a onedimensional town mayor who is forever in peril. Come to think of it I could do without all of the expository prologue in which we get to know the characters one long film of Brosnan escaping from various hazards would have done me just fine.Sadly this is not the case and it seems like an age for the action to really begin. But when it does it really hits home thanks to some really stunning CGI work which flawlessly recreates rivers of molten lava and huge ash clouds which demolish buildings in an instant. The film manages to evoke a whole load of tense moments when Brosnan's car gets stuck in the lava when a van tries to escape from a broken bridge and when survivors escape over an acid lake while their boat gradually dissolves around them. The pace starts off slow but builds up to the topnotch finale.If you're looking for a dumb mindless actionfilled extravaganza then you've come to the right place. Despite ripping off other films like TWISTER this manages to be better than many an effectled blockbuster thanks to a high mortality rate and plenty of edgeofyourseat moments. Do yourself a favour settle back one evening rent this and switch off your brain.".

Dante's Peak is very dramatic and has a mild dose of sentimentality that fits seamlessly into the story.Make no mistake this movie is really well made and is very enjoyable to watch but be warned if you like your disaster movies done gungho style it may disappoint you.710".

The second half is the chaos.For people who like action films Dante's Peak is a fairly good choice. The visuals the sound and the special effects are reasonably engaging. There's lots of exciting drama and the film's second half is fast paced.But if you are looking for a credible story go elsewhere. The formulaic screenplay is bland and unimaginative and it is full of cinematic clichs. Of course that is a problem with most films in the disaster genre. The stories and plot elements are basically the same just different disaster tornado burning skyscraper sinking ship earthquake or in this case volcano.

	schema:reviewBody "Recently in class we watched Dante's Peak as part of our year 10 topic Earthquakes and Volcanoes. I really enjoyed this film some parts were unrealistic and other parts were unrealistic. The main characters were Pierce Brosnan as Harry and Linda Hamilton as Rachael. Harry worked as a vulcanologist and Rachael was the Mayor of the town and she owned a coffee shop. Rachael had two children called Graeme and Lauren. Four years earlier Harry's girlfriend was killed by a pyroclast from an active volcano. Paul who worked for the U.S.G.S. was Harry's boss and he sent him to Dante's peak as there was live activity. Harry found several signs such as squirrels and trees dying. They also found two dead bodies in boiling springs. He tested the water and it was acidic. Harry wanted the whole town alerted. The water supply for the town was contaminated and it had turned an orangy colour. A town meeting was called and during it  the volcano erupted. It was complete mayhem! They went to the kids' granny's cabin but the lava had destroyed it. Luckily granny had got out in time and so had the dog. There was a lake which they had to cross in a boat but the motor broke and they had to paddle across. The water was extremely acidic and very dangerous. I don't think this was realistic because it wouldn't contaminate as quickly as that. Granny jumped into the contaminated water to push the boat the rest of the way in order to save everyone. The bottom half of granny's body disintegrated and unfortunately she died. Harry and the others stole a truck and they drove over lava. I think this part was very unrealistic because the tyres would probably have melted. E.L.F. was in the back of the truck which is a tracking device that can send signals to N.A.S.A. They then rammed the truck into a mine. The roof of the mine collapsed in but they all got out safely even the dog Ruffy. I think the geography side of the film is quite realistic especially the eruption with the pyroclast falling and the debris ash and rock. They measured how much activity was happening with a seismometer which is what they use in real life. Overall I thought this movie was great and I would recommend it.".

A potentially important plot line of an escaped rapistkiller makes a cursory appearance and two homicides only to be ended before it affects the main storyline in any real way.

This is a combination of the bad writing and mostly poor acting but especially the writing. For instance a buff whitepower twentysomething seems almost polite for the majority of the film even towards Ty the requisite black character.Finally this film commits the cardinal sin of horror movies it was boring. At a scant 91 minutes including credits it should move pretty briskly but the opening drags on treating us to not one not two but three introductions to the characters including a totally unnecessary cut to their mugshots.

	schema:reviewBody "Finally I acquired an opportunity to dig my teeth into the anticipated DVD release of Grizzly Park which I grabbed in a local video store without reservations after having read a couple of positive reviews on an advanced screening of this latest monster flick.As I expected the film is packed with many obligatory elements and features that make up for a good horror movie gorgeous scenery murderer on the loose deadly giant bear severed heads and limbs and of course a handful of screaming hot chicks.The acting is decent with not so many annoyingly stupid dialogs often expected from independent shoestring budget slashers. I was impressed with strong and forcible performance of the leading man Glenn Morshower assuming the role of Ranger Bob a man who was assigned to guide a bunch of kids sentenced to community service in a remote ranch forest under a correctional program for young offenders.Visual effects although not abound and could hardly be regarded as awesome are quite plausible anyway.To my disappointment a serial killer subplot is underdeveloped and very little contributes to the entire context of the film and building of tension. After stabbing a couple of insignificant characters the killer saunters meaninglessly between different locations of the woods only to disappear without a trace fairly early in the movie.Also shamefully adorable Brody that has landed a role of the protagonist Grizzly Bear was offered too little screen time to stretch his undeniable acting talents.Yet the relationship between the Ranger and the Bear as well as the context of Bebe's last phone conversation is beyond my apprehension. The idea is either too complex and not very obvious or otherwise too simple to be easily overlooked and maybe requires a second viewing.But all these minor shortcomings become unimportant when you realize that the main riddle and intrigue of the film unveiled towards the end in pretty inventive if somewhat obnoxious manner is whether mother nature bestowed Emily Foxler Bebe with a pair of authentic tits or are they just regular silicon sillywhat? fakes? The temptation to find out the truth was so alluring that one especially curious lad stopped at nothing even in the paws of death to complete his research. I don't want to ruin the surprise ending by delving into further details watch closely for the final Grizzly attack.Allinall a passable start for the first time director and mostly lesserknown cast and not bad for a brainless Friday night timekiller.".

	schema:reviewBody "The excellent Glenn Morshower was my main reason for watching this film. Over the past few years he's cornered he market on stoic dependable downhome authoritymilitary types with his performance as Secret Service Agent Aaron Pierce on 24 being the pinnacle of that particular type and a true highlight of that series. Therefore I was naturally excited to see that he had finally been given the lead role in a movie as opposed to standing behind the lead usually in a military uniform.It would seem at first glance those doing the casting had a keen sense of humour having Glenn doing his stoic bit as a park ranger to a bunch of Community Service teens being stalked by a grizzly in the wilds providing a funny dynamic in a well worn horror staple. How wrong I was.The film itself suffers from a terminal case of slowness with scenes that should move along with pace as should the whole film being bogged down with performances where everyone....pauses...before....saying....their...lines in response to another characters remarks almost like the editor just couldn't quite bear to part with those few seconds between the director calling Action and the actor remembering their lines. As a result already stilted performances are made even worse by long bouts of silence. Endless scenes of walking through the woods before we actually get to any action doesn't help either.The cast of young actors are also undermined by the list of stereotypical characters they are given. Granted this is a horror movie they deal in stereotypes but in this case it just comes across as incredibly lazy and tired. Making them Young Offenders in an effort to add depth to the proceedings is a total waste of time as nothing is made of it. It literally doesn't matter. As does the subplot of the Escaped Maniac. Quite why he's in there I have no idea. Reading the synopsis it would seem to be to add another element of danger to the story If the bear doesn't get them the killer will! but the fact that he is eaten pretty much straight away kind of undermines that attempt at tension. He could quite easily have been the Corrections Officer whose identity he steals in the first place and in a totally logic defying decision whose job collecting a bunch of kids from the local cops who one would presume are all looking for him he decides to carry on with and it would make no difference to the story.When the bear finally does arrive the level of the effects just makes the whole thing even more laughable with paws that don't look all that more convincing than those on Trickster's bear costume which must have had some kind of inflatable head given the size of it in comparison to the backpack he's carried for the rest of the film dragging poor teens through cabin windows.In the end it's only Glenn who comes out of this whole thing with any kind of dignity intact putting in a performance worthy of a far better film. Reading the trivia section for this film on IMDb I see that the director got his break by thrusting his home made movie into the arms of the producer and it endeared it to them so much they gave him his shot. Perhaps next time the producer could just smack him over the head with it and tell him to go practise some more before letting him loose on another movie.".

Instead this bunch of petty criminals is pursued by a bear that behaves unlike any bear I've ever heard of stalking people while they sit in a large group and ripping a building apart not a tent people to get to the people inside. All those Hollywood roars just made it even sillier and since when do wolves go after humans especially a human whose not even injured? I'm surprised there weren't evil squirrels bent on infecting these idiots with ypestis. None of the characters were likable especially Bebe who was so dumb I wanted her to die a gruesome death immediately. I was disappointed to see Glenn Morshower who I've always liked as Aaron Pierce on 24 starring in this garbage. The dialogue can only be described as wooden. You would think that with a bunch of criminals out in a beautiful setting like this that the screenwriter would have included the characters involved in some self reflection. But you'd be wrong. All of these people were basically soulless in a group like this in real life I'd expect some would feel no remorse for what they did but certainly some of them would have felt bad about it. So I didn't care when any of them died all in ways that were over the top gruesome which is I believe the only reason this film was made. And if you were hoping for some beautiful shots of the woods a la A River Runs Through It forget it imagination in the cinematography department is as lacking as it is in the screen writing department. The conclusion was a bit clevera very tiny bitbut other than that this movie amounted to what a bear does in the woods.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title hoping that the whole 'ignorance is bliss' clich would work out. To be honest. . . it kind of did. Not knowing the plot or reviews of others does help.The story opens on a park ranger station preparing to shut down Grizzly Park once home to more grizzlies than anywhere in the world but the last grizzly was shot in 1922 because of the raging wildfires in southern California. If the fires weren't bad enough a serial killer charged with the rape and murder of 11 women escaped from police custody. On the run the killer finds a corrections officer on the side of the road repairing a tire and after a quick slice takes his identity and proceeds to pick up a group of lightweight criminals on their way to a cleanup program at where else. . . Grizzly Park.The film itself is pretty enjoyable and a nottooshabby animal attack horror. Even with the early murder however the film takes its time getting going and there are long periods of time where nothing at all really happens but somehow it kept my attention. Also you really don't get any good gore or violence until the last halfhour or so. It actually seems like they didn't have the budget to get use any of the gore effects until the last chunk of the flick and that definitely hurt the quality. To be honest you could probably fast forward to that point and still get the best experience from this movie as possible.The acting wasn't awful and bordering on good for a couple of the actors but the dialogue was poorly written and very clichd. The characters were essentially walking stereotypes. Well other than the least believable NeoNazi in history complete with the obviously fake Swastika and 'White Power' tats if you look closely you can see the Swastika smudge at one point. . . no joke. The soundtrack got repetitive and boring which kind of affected the mood negatively. But I'll admit. . . the ending is kind of hilarious and gave me the chance to say 'I so knew it!'Even with the flaws the film itself is actually very watchable. Keep with it for the first half or twothirds and you actually might enjoy yourself. You could do worse.Final Verdict 510.AP3".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh my god!!! Where do I start?This has to be one of the most poorly made movies I have ever seen. Dire acting with the exception of Ranger Bob who at least tries a script that is well I can't do it justice as to just how bad it is in mere words. EG A bear attacks and kills 2 of the 5 cast members the other 3 lock themselves in an old barn with 10 inch gaps inbetween the wooden panels which it never occurs to them to look through before attempting to go outside. The bear walks round the barn sniffing at the 3 geeks. 10 seconds later it all goes quiet and one of the geeks is told to 'check outside to see if it safe' 10 whole seconds and so he opens the door instead of simply looking through the gaps and says the age old done to death line 'it looks safe were in the clear' just before the bear drags him outside screaming YAWN!!Every character in this movie is clich'd to death and poorly done at that. 4 guys 4 gals all the guys have 6 packs and all the gals have perfect bodies and huge fun bags so they can all pair up like a nice jigsaw puzzle YAWN!! Don't average people or fat people or even everyday type people exist in these movies?? They always have to be glamour models it's pathetic beyond belief.The bear suit that one of the guys apparently carried up the mountain in his backpack to scare the babes didn't anyone realise that the bear suit head alone was bigger than the backpack let alone the whole suit? There's no way it would have fit inside the pack.The effects while 1 or 2 of them are imaginative enough they are so poorly done that any effect they might have had is wasted.Excitement factor there isn't any the whole movie is slow and boring with the exception of a few of Ranger Bob's dry sarcastic one liners nothing really happens until the last 10 minutes it's basically watching a bunch of obnoxious teens hiking up a mountain for 80 minutes. If Tom Skull ever gets another budget to make a movie then whoever sanctions it deserves burning at the stake. Dull boring poorly done in every way possible and even Ranger Bob who surely deserves better can't save this huge Christmas turkey.Oh one last gripe what the hell was that bloody song in aid of?? I saw a bear I saw a bear a great big bear a great big bear oh way up there....WHAT????? It sounds like a pre school early morning hymn totally out of place in a supposed horror flick and only serves to add to the movies tedium factor.DREADFUL!!! Give yourself an extra 90 minutes of life on earth don't watch this.".

	schema:reviewBody "2008's Grizzly Park piqued my interest because I liked the trailer see it on IMDb and it was shot near the Mt. Rogers region in SW Virginia  NE Tennessee Marion VA and Backbone Rock Recreation Area TN which is one of the places I vacationed last summer.THE PLOT Eight delinquent youths from the city are assigned community service at Grizzly Park CA chaperoned by nononsense Ranger Bob. What they don't know is that there's an escaped killer on the loose as well as a killer grizzly!The movie starts out great with a quote of 2 Kings 22325 which refers to the occasion where a bunch of youths jeered the prophet Elisha and his baldness. When he couldn't take it any more Elisha cursed them and two bears came out of the forest mauling 42 kids. The following opening credits sequence is creative and well done the music too. At this point I was wondering if I may have stumbled upon a hidden gem like Sasquatch Mountain and much less so Flu Birds entertaining GradeB creaturefeatures that shoot for more depth than the norm see my review of each. From there however the film derails into serious CGrade territory with bad dialogue a mildly campy approach lousy pacing and no suspense. Fortunately the film makes up for it in the last act the final 30 minutes or so which is a killer grizzly gorefest but you have to slog through a semiuneventful first hour to get there.Despite the negative comments there are a handful of positive pointsGorgeous late Summerearly Fall locations in SW Virginia  NE Tennessee although the story takes place in California.  A good cast of women a brunette a blond a Hispanic and an Asian. The brunette Bebe Emily Foxler struck me as a likable character who unlocked my compassion and favor despite being a seemingly total airhead until the end that is which ruined it you'll know what I mean when you see it. The Hispanic girl Lola Zulay Henao is the real beauty here and the viewer is treated to some quality eyecandy.  One white dude Scab Randy Wayne turns out to be slightly likable even though he's supposedly a hardcore white power racist. His indoctrination is shattered however when he discovers himself falling for the Hispanic Lola which gives indication that he's actually a very smart young man. This leads to a beautiful and touching scene between the two. I wasn't expecting this in a GradeC campy gorefest.  There's no CGI. The bear is real except for a couple parts where there's a human standin.  Like I said the last act features some hardcore gore like one of the girls being bit in half with her entrails laying loose heads getting bit in half etc. I don't watch these types of movies for the gore but some like it. The only thing is although the gore is very extreme in the last 25 minutes I didn't find it shocking or scary at all in fact sometimes I just busted out laughing but that's mainly because of the campy tone more than anything. In other words since the filmmakers deliver the goods in a semiserious thisisallajoke manner I couldn't very well take the shocks  gore serious. Yet this doesn't mean it's not entertaining.  The old campfire classic I Met a Bear is utilized a couple times during the movie and fully during the end credits performed here by Twin Sisters .For those who argue that the murderer subplot seemed totally pointless It's more than just a red herring and ties into the media's theory for the socalled murders revealed at the end a doofy bear costume being a chief piece of evidence.The DVD features a handful of making of extras with cast and crew including the 1300 lb. bear Brody each one is only a few minutes in length. You'll marvel at how close the trainer and other crewmembers get to the bear. I'm glad each segment is short because I only prefer the gist of it I don't care to see a friggin' movie on the making of the movie if you know what I mean unless of course it's something like Apocalypse Now.BOTTOM LINE Despite being a semicampy GradeC film with a fairly uneventful first hour and some bad writing pacing etc. Grizzly Park possesses a curious 'cult' ambiance highlighted by a great opening credits sequence big deal huh? and a violently gory climax. I like the women Lola! the real bear no CGI the campfire classic I Met a Bear and the gorgeous Eastern locations plus there's at least one touching nigh reverent romantic scene no kidding.Part of me wants to rate this 610 Stars since in many ways Grizzly Park delivers the goods but I'd feel too guilty because this isn't really a good movie. It's equal parts boring dumb eccentric fun inept impressive and fascinating. A guilty pleasure that will likely develop a small cult following who'll openly admit it's not good but like it anyway sort of.GRADE C".

	schema:reviewBody "Grizzly Park is a fun but somewhat flawed killer bear film.SPOILERSOut on a special mission youths Bebe Emily Foxler Ryan Forbes Kavan Reece Ty Brown Shedrack Anderson III Lola Sanchez Zulay Henao Candy Reece Julie Skon Kiki Saito Jelynn Rodriguez Scab Randy Wayne and Trickster Trevor Peterson are lead by Ranger Bob Glenn Morshower out into the wilderness to do their community service by cleaning up the state park. All trying to get along together they begin to hike into the forest to the cabin where they will undergo their treatment and after experiencing a few sideadventures they make it to the cabin. After settling in they realize that several of them have gone missing along the way and it soon dawns on them that a killer bear has been stalking them the entire time and attacking the stragglers forcing them to try to get out of the park alive and away from the bear.The Good News There was some good stuff when it really got going. The fact that when the bear does attack it usually results in positive attack scenes is a great move allowing for some good stuff here and there. The first one on the human killer incredibly early on in the film is really good with the darkness the stalking camera and growling sounds from the bear as well as the creature stumbling out after him to brawl around the campground before a brutal blow is quite enjoyable and a later attack on stranded campers is just glorious. From the ensnaring foottrap and the encroaching darkness as well as them being lost in the wilderness and the wolves appearing at the foot of the trap before they attack it creates a fantastic setup that is admirably played off with the arrival of the creature and the resulting mayhem it unleashes. The main campground attack is just spectacular pretty much containing nothing of fault and is overall the film's best feature. From the initial ambush of the stoner which is the cruel punchline to a joke setup slightly earlier that is just played off nicely with the colors of the air and the pawing at the head before the attack and eventual realization make for a classic scene and once it gets to the others around the fire it's just as much fun. With the atmosphere coming on strong with the fog rolling in the antics of the individual in the bear suit from the humorous to the serious and finally the bear attack leaving several wounded before it starts off stalking the escapees in the logcabin hideout is just a lot of fun. The suspense of waiting for an attack to happen that is bound to happen and checking for the appearance as well as the ultrabrutal attack and the aftermath to the twist in the finale where the appearances from the beginning are duped quite nicely and the final attack is another punchline to an earliersetup this whole part of the film is just too good and features nothing really wrong with it. The film does contain a few other good parts namely the suspenseful trailofcorpsesintheforest that is found with the severed fingers being devoured by the local animals the pile of uneaten meat on the ground and the severed leg and face found the result is an insanely creepy moment that is nicely utilized here. The last part is the gore from the bear attacks which are pretty brutal. From being chomped in the face to having their chest scratched open in one slice arms scratched and torn off bitten in half at the waist and a decapitation it provides the gory goods. These here are the positives.The Bad News There was some pretty big problems to this one that held it down. One of the biggest and most obvious one as well is that the film is just way to slow in the first half to really get going at all taking way too much time to finally get to the main bear attacks. The fact that there's four different times in which the people in here decide to go hiking around as we go from the ranger station where they start off at to the resting spot then they go marching through the woods to a waterfall in order to cope with events that transpired there then off to the main cabin where they then realize the missing couple who themselves have a hiking through the forest segment that's prominently featured. All of these are pretty pointless just them going in a straightline occasionally picking up a piece of trash but mostly talking amongst themselves about the torture of their assignment and none of that translates into fun viewing and the repetition of these scenes is pretty off. There's also bits that don't really belong there such as the inclusion of the skunk and that subplot which is the reason for two more marchingthroughthewoods scenes and the removal of that eliminates a bit more time that is freed up later along with the killer's inclusion the scenes of the group playing pranks on the ranger and him playing sympathetic with the one camper so that the main flaw is then fixed. That is that the bear is barely in the film until the ending which really can't happen all that much and keep the villain effective. That is what happens here and it causes the film to suffer through the continued use of keeping the main point offscreen as long as it does. These here are the film's flaws.The Final Verdict While not overly problematic there's enough good stuff here to overcome the flaws and become a relatively enjoyable killer bear film. Recommended to giant animal creature feature enthusiasts those interested or lovers of cheesy horror films while those looking for more serious fare should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting much when I rented Grizzly Park. I'm not a fan of horror movies and only rented this due to the presence of Glenn Morshower as Ranger Bob. After reading a lot of reviews I was expecting a total mess of a film it wasn't quite that bad.The idea of characters getting killed as punishment for their misdeeds isn't a new one in horror or even in mystery see And Then There Were None but I liked the idea of this group of offenders being given a chance to repent their misdeeds. Needless to say they don't. Grizzly Park is also beautiful to look at as it was filmed on location in a couple of state parks quibble the movie is supposed to be set in a California state park but the vegetation is clearly Eastern witness all the deciduous trees changing color. It obviously isn't California. Some horror film aficionados may have downgraded the film due to its lack of sex and minimal violence  for a horror film. There are a couple of fairly graphic deaths for those who enjoy that sort of thing.Glenn Morshower turns in a great performance and I think his presence is reason enough to rent the film. It actually would have benefited from being longer as we really don't get to know the characters very well. One of the extras on the disc includes interviews with the actors describing their characters as deep and troubled. I'd call them sketchy myself.The socalled twist ending really didn't come as a surprise but it was very rushed not enough time was spent on it for it to be believable and it really felt tacked on. A couple more minutes would have been better here. Overall if you're a fan of Mr Morshower and cheesy movies I think this is worth your time on a slow evening. I've certainly seen worse.".

One of the extras on the disc includes interviews with the actors describing their characters as deep and troubled. I'd call them sketchy myself.The socalled twist ending really didn't come as a surprise but it was very rushed not enough time was spent on it for it to be believable and it really felt tacked on. A couple more minutes would have been better here. Overall if you're a fan of Mr Morshower and cheesy movies I think this is worth your time on a slow evening. I've certainly seen worse.";

Butch had already murdered and dismembered 11 women over the last two years. Now looking for new victims to add to his list Butch decides to go into the Northern Californian forests and knock of a number of hikers who unlucky for them he happens to run into.

You've got to say one thing in favor for Butch he's got's guts. Being either drunk or on drugs Butch takes the 1200 pound Brody on with only a pocket knife. In the end Butch's show of brainless bravado ended up with his guts being splattered all over the forest floor.The young hikers who think that their walk in the woods is a joke find nothing funny when their later attacked not only by Brody but one of his fellow furry forest friends a big white wolf. The big bad wolf does in two of the hikers Kiki and Ty Jelywn Rodriguez and Shednack Anderson III when they tried to get cute and leave the hiking party.

Kiki who tried to poison her mom because she disapproved in her spending her social security money to buy expensive clothes is the lucky one of the two getting mauled and eaten by the less dangerous compared to Brody the Bear white wolf. The helpless Ty is not only left hanging from a wolf trap for hours almost bleeding to death but is later ripped apart by Brody who had him almost dead from loss of blood for an evening snack.The remainder of the movie has Body track down the surviving hikers and in no time at all making mince meat of them. Only one of the hikers gets away from Brody guess which one together with the always absent during all the bloody carnage Ranger Bob thus being the only two in making it through the night.SPOILER ALERTIt's then when we get to see just what the picture is in all this killing and who's the one besides Brody and his wolf friend who's really behind all this outdoor horror. You've got to stay with the movie since it at first doesn't seem to make any sense in what's the purpose behind this hike in the woods by a bunch of what at first seemed like goofy and happy going petty criminals and their leader the totally detached from reality Ranger Bob. It's only at the very end of the movie that were given the truth and it's what at least makes all the what seems like disjointed actions in the film Grizzly Park finally make sense.".

A film where the token black guy is called Mr. Brown and the fascist Nazi is called Mr. White. It's subtlety like that you just got to love.

	schema:reviewBody "Sorry a few spoilers here!The Enforcer is a surprisingly great movie esp. by Hong Kong standards. It deals with Jet Li being a deep undercover policeman from Beijing who despite a sick wife and a son that needs him keeps being sent on long undercover missions. Here he's sent to Hong Kong to infiltrate a crime syndicate. While helping them he is caught on a photo by the Hong Kong police who doesn't know him and Anita Mui a highly placed Hong Kong police lieutenant goes to Beijing to find out who he is. She finds his wife and son and realizes that the crook she came to find may not in fact be a crook. Soon the wife gets sicker and eventually dies. The lieutenant then takes care of the son and they go to Hong Kong to find the undercover cop. That's just half the movie. The other half involves the kid being in danger and even being beaten by his dad because the father has to act coldblooded in front of the mafia guys. Then there's some very good chemistry between Jet Li and Anita Mui's characters and the final battle with the bad guys is good and rewarding.All in all this movie is told incredibly well and everything in it rings true and is very very moving. Great story very good acting lots of cool kung fu also from surprisingly supple Anita Mui! and lots of great action scenes in general. Never a dull moment.The only thing wrong with the movie is that we're never really told who Jet Li's character really is. We know he's a good guy and that he works for a police chief but this chief denies knowing him as anything other than a crook even when the Hong Kong police lieutenant shows up to inquire about him. But this is a minor thing that I am more than willing to ignore. This is a very satisfying movie in all ways.9 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sorry a few spoilers here!The Enforcer is a surprisingly great movie esp. by Hong Kong standards. It deals with Jet Li being a deep undercover policeman from Beijing who despite a sick wife and a son that needs him keeps being sent on long undercover missions. Here he's sent to Hong Kong to infiltrate a crime syndicate. While helping them he is caught on a photo by the Hong Kong police who doesn't know him and Anita Mui a highly placed Hong Kong police lieutenant goes to Beijing to find out who he is. She finds his wife and son and realizes that the crook she came to find may not in fact be a crook. Soon the wife gets sicker and eventually dies. The lieutenant then takes care of the son and they go to Hong Kong to find the undercover cop. That's just half the movie. The other half involves the kid being in danger and even being beaten by his dad because the father has to act coldblooded in front of the mafia guys. Then there's some very good chemistry between Jet Li and Anita Mui's characters and the final battle with the bad guys is good and rewarding.All in all this movie is told incredibly well and everything in it rings true and is very very moving. Great story very good acting lots of cool kung fu also from surprisingly supple Anita Mui! and lots of great action scenes in general.

	schema:headline " Typical 1990s Hong Kong martial arts action  and a lot of fun";
	schema:reviewBody "MY FATHER IS A HERO is a collaboration between director Corey Yuen and star Jet Li that feels virtually identical to one of their previous pictures together BODYGUARD FROM BEIJING. The two films are interchangeable in terms of look feel and fight action so they'd made a fine double bill for martial arts fans. This one has some touching scenes between Li and Xia Miao who plays his son. Usually I don't like kids in action or suspense film they're invariably whiny they cry a lot and they get in the way. Not Miao. He's a tough asskicking boy who takes no crap whether it's from the bullies at his school or the thugs his dad's involved with. Miao's acting is strong and he's definitely the best child actor I've seen in an action film yet.The film ticks all the boxes without really breaking anything in the way of new ground most Hong Kong crime thrillers of the 1990s were like this with ultracool and slick criminal gangs and plenty of tension when the hero gets involved with them. The family scenes and the touches of romance in this one aren't as out of place as they sometimes can be and it helps that there's a high calibre of acting talent throughout. The late Anita Mui is particularly good as the tough cop on Li's tail.Li himself is once again excellent showing off his skills in both the acting stakes and the action parts and with Corey Yuen at the helm the fights in this are superb. The shootout at the shopping mall is great stuff and of course the majority of the fun is saved for the extended climax. Here we get Li tackling three top villains on a bombladen boat. The bad guys are Rongguang Yu the sunglasseswearing ultra slick chief villain who's one of the slimiest I've seen  he almost drips oil and grease Collin Chou who was the main villain in BODYGUARD FROM BEIJING and Ken Lo the highkicking guy who Jackie Chan fought at the end of DRUNKEN MASTER II. The ensuing action is thoroughly entertaining especially when Li ties his son to the end of a rope and proceeds to use him as a human yoyo thwarting the villains by tossing him through the air at them! All in all a lot of fun as long as you're not expecting a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kung Wei Li is a loving husband and father but has to spend a lot of time away from his family because he has a rapport with these underworld types and is now deep deep undercover in an attempt to stop the gang of Po Kwong Yu a criminal mastermind with an army of thugs. Wei has an especially strong bond with his young son Johnny Tse who like a pintsized version of his father is a Martial Arts expert. When Wei's wife becomes sick the pressure on him becomes even greater while he's away from his family and Johnny strikes up a friendship with a female cop named Fong Mui. While Wei is undercover in Hong Kong Fong and Johnny follow him there from mainland China. Then the stage is set for the ultimate confrontation who will be victorious? Find out today...Moodily directed by Corey Yuen a man whose career as an actor director and stuntman is simply amazing and who has been kicking all our butts since Above the Law 1986 he seems to be going for more of a balance between emotional drama and action. While nothing seems out of place as might be expected the highlights of this movie are the fightaction scenes. There are some really impressive moments and when the energy is there it's amazing to watch but there are certainly some peaks and valleys we as viewers must go through. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing in fact it may make the action scenes stand out all the more.Thankfully this movie does have a blonde meathead screaming while shooting a machine gun. So yes it is truly a work of dramatic art. You know Po Kwong is a villain because he wears his sunglasses at night and at all other times too and he and his gang of baddies really put the tot Johnny through hell. Johnny has to go through all manner of trials and tribulations perhaps even more so than his father does. Many of those things wouldn't fly in America even in a movie they'd be considered politicallyincorrect child abuse. There's even a scene of Johnny being bullied at school apparently Johnny is a big ant aficionado and can even train his ants to spell words like mom! When some bullies try to break up his ant party he stops them in the only way that works fight back! So there are some good lessons here too.The Dragon Dynasty DVD is typically excellent with many features and a crisp clear transfer. One of Wei's underworld contacts is subtitled as GDawg so perhaps there were some concessions to the American market ???  but at least there aren't any misplaced musical cues like in the U.S. DVD version of the Jet Li outing Contract Killer 1998. In the end fans should appreciate the killer fight scenes action moments and stunt work while nonaction buffs may appreciate the dramatic content. So the appeal here is pretty wide.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was entertained when I saw this Jet Li film in a second hand theater. The story is a little melodramatic but the fight scenes are outstanding. Gei Ba Ba De XinMy Father is a Hero1995 was the first Jet Li movie that I ever saw.  One of his last films from Hong Kong before heading for Hollywood.

The fatherson combo of Jet Li and Tsu Miu works remarkably well the 2nd time these two have been paired up. Anita Mui stars as a HK cop trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Throw in an overacting but still funny villain who incidentally played Iron Monkey and we have an actionpacked thriller to the end.The emotional parts of the film may drag a bit but it's not too excessive. Jet Li especially succeeds in this role... we can see the internal conflict and pains of emotion within. The scene where the villain tries to get his son to ID his undercover dad is very notable.There may not be as much kung fu as most fans would like but we  do get to see Li wield a new type of weapon. Generally the kung fu serves to move the plot along not to be specifically highlighted as the main attraction. That's okay considering the movie is so well done....".

The drama is so not convincing and it's rather pathetic. I didn't care at all about the dying wife and the neglected brat. I did however like Jet Li's character and the main villain is wonderfully malignant. This movie is somewhat one of those so bad it's good type of films. Why? It mostly points towards the kid and some of the goofy action sequences. The scene when the main antagonist threw the kids face into a glass table and punched him in the face in bloody like fashion was hilarious. Plus the fight scene when these guys were trying to chop the kid with cleavers were funny. It's like Jesus what is wrong with these people? The action is where this movie shines. The action choreography is great but sometimes it's completely illogical and corny. But hey it's what makes HK action movies great.In conclusion The drama was lame and not convincing but the action and the acting performance of Jet Li and some of the absurd crap in this movie is what keeps it from sucking hard.".

And there's the warm family touch. Johnny is quite a young lad in this film his fighting and courage choreography being I guess topnotch. I don't know filmmaking from experience so based on this I think this youth is amazing. At one point he's attacked by bully kids at his school and he pins the main bully to a wall with his leg nicely lifted up so that his foot is pressing against the bottom of the chin of the main bully. I don't have such flexibility. If I tried anything of the like then I'd surely be leaning the back backwards a lot more than Johnny did for he was almost perfectly upright except for the leg used to pin the main bully against the wall. I don't have that kind of flexibility and imagine that this Johnny lad does choreographed or not.With that said I think that anyone who likes martial arts films that have good morals against criminal ones plus a touch of love well it's a worthwhile film.It's interesting is thriller for sure well choreographed and action plus the touch of love.Why this film has only 6.610 for average IMDb user rating is a little beyond me. I'll give it 810 and am not sure that it shouldn't be more but 810 seems at least reasonable for a start given that I'm not a film expert. One thing for sure is that I'd recommend this film to anyone I know to like martial arts with moral values and a touch of love or if you prefer romance.As I said at the start I won't get into details meaning technical kind. This review is just a general kind or a rough overview say. Were any mistakes made in any parts of the film?

This is one of the reasons that I generally like Hong Kong movies  not only do they have great fight scenes but they also like to delve into human struggles which is what American movies rarely do at least on more than a superficial level.The focus of this movie is a deep undercover cop in China. He has a family and he tries to be a good father but his work forces him to be very secretive. At first we think that he is a criminal but the back cover of the video tells us that he is not. We soon learn that he is a Chinese cop but nobody else really knows that.The problem arises when his wife dies of some disease and his son must go to Hong Kong with a Hong Kong police officer to try and find him. As such his son who happens to be a martial arts expert must brave the underlife of Hong Kong and the police to find his father. Not only that but back at home he has to handle to taunts of his peers who all believe his father to be a criminal.The child is the real star of this movie as it focuses on his struggles in not only finding out the truth about his father but also trying to find him. He is lost in a world were strangers claim to be relatives and where his father at times must deny him to protect himself. Yet deep down the child knows that his father loves him and the struggle to show his love to his child is one of the most tortuous parts of this movie.There are two great fight scenes in this movie. The first is the shootup in the restaurant. I will not go into deep detail without saying that it is phenomenal and is what one should expect from the action capital of the world. If there is one thing the Chinese know how to do that is to make a really good action movie that leaves its Hollywood counterparts for dead.The second cool action sequence is the end sequence where the father uses his kid as a weapon against the bad guys. We have seen previously how this kid is a really good martial artist but we also know that together both of them make an almost unbeatable team. In fact not only is the kid good at martial arts be is also very cunning.I guess the title tells us everything  the kid learns that his father is a hero. This is not clear at the beginning and everything seems to tell us that his father is a crook. The truth is that he is not. His father is out there to destroy the power of the cartels and he is willing to put himself into danger to stop the criminals.It is surprising that so much comes out of this movie where as a typical Jackie Chan movie is generally quite shallow. But then we really don't watch a Jackie Chan movie for indepth character development  we watch them to see Jackie Chan do absolutely stupid stunts so that he can maintain his fan base. Hey he enjoys it so who am I to critise him.".

Well yes and no. There is action but not enough for an action fan and when the climax finally arrives it is too reliant on explosives and the kung fu standard is not nearly as good as half a dozen other Jet Li flicks.The plot is too convoluted and made little sense the fact that his doting dying wife still believed he was a criminal  and that Kung Wei made no attempt to explain otherwise  made no sense to this little black duck especially when everyone else seemed to know including his kid.To recap drama without any real drama action without substance and major character decisions without credibility. To top all this off my DVD copy which shares the same cover as the poster here and the IMDb film page so I think it's real has some of the cheesiest subtitles in cinematic history.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers contained herein my reviews are meant for connoisseurs of Jet Li films.  Jet Li's Enforcer' is a average film in every aspect of the word.  Jet Li plays Kung Wei an uncover cop sent to infiltrate a triad gang.   Herein lies the problem weather it is the fault of the script the fault of the dubbing or the fault of Jet Li's acting his character is SO far undercover the viewer forgets that he is a cop.  The plot is not set up very well we're not told WHY his cover has to be kept to such a high and extreme level.  Wei's contact in the Triad gang MR. G I forget the character's real name is also a mystery.  I have seen this film three times and I still have yet to determine if Mr. G was also an undercover cop or just a well intentioned thug in the gang.  The plot has more holes than swiss cheese especially early on which makes it hard to follow important key concepts such as the ones mentioned above.The movie is not without its charm however.  While Wei is infiltrating the triad in Hong Kong his wife back on the mainland dies leaving his son an orphan for all intents and purposes.  Anita Mui who you may remember from Jackie Chan films such as Rumble in the Bronx' and Legend of Drunken Master' plays Hong Kong Police Detective Anna Fong.  She's hot on Wei's trail for his criminal acts unknowing committed undercover back in Hong Kong.   While tracking Wei she goes to his home in the mainland and befriends Wei's wife and son more or less adopting the son after the mother's death.  The two end up tracking Wei back to Hong Kong and discovering the truth about his undercover status.The Kung Fu scenes in this movie are nothing spectacular.  The most impressive kung fu is demonstrated by Wei's son when his must defend the reputation of his father against a school full of bullies.  He also demonstrates some good fundamentals in the Wushu demonstration scene.  As for Jet Li he's capable of much more artful and complex kung fu than he displays in this movie.  The head triad villain is the stereotypical Chinese 1990s bad guy.  If you've seen Legend of Drunken Master' or similar films you know what I'm talking about the buzz cut sunglasses the Armani suit the white magician looking gloves and an aura of evil about him.  His goal as a villain in this movie is to hijack an auction taking place on a boat and make off with the goods and the customer's money.  The fight scene at the end is anticlimatic. This evil badass who tears through people throughout the movie hardly puts up much if any of a fight at the end.  Sure there's some good improvisation of the Kung Fu Rope technique but that's what keeps this film on its average level and keeps it from sinking to the depths of a bad film.If you're looking for a typical hong Kong action genre film along the lines of Hard Boiled killers you might like this film.  If you're looking for Jet Li's mastery of the martial arts this film will disappoint you.  As an action film and a film itself it rates very bland and average 49 stars.".

Wei makes progress in the gang but changes in his family situation see his son Johnny put in danger.As Jet Li's fame grew he started doing more films with modern heroes as opposed to those of Once Upon A Time In China Fist of Legend Twin Warriors etc and this film is one of those. As is too often the case with action movies all over the world the plot is pretty weak with some plot twists being poorly delivered devices just to get the characters where they need to be certainly anyone looking for strong characters or sensitive writing will be left wondering why they bothered but then this is an action movie so why be surprised? The plot contrives to bring Anna Fong into the film in place of Wei's wife and it feels cruel and cold the way it is done once it is done of course it more or less works for the rest of the film but it just makes the whole film feel forced for about 30 minutes or so.Jet Li does well in the lead and he is a good enough actor to try and provide emotion where the script gives him none and the film has no patience to allow him much time to let his character feel anything other than bad guy's kicks. He is physically impressive but he also shows a good range here in limited opportunities. The role of Johnny could have been an annoying kid role and in a way it is but the casting of little Miu Tse at least makes the role one that contributes to the action. The kid they had dubbing him in the version I saw turned his dialogue into a typically Hollywood cutesy role but Tse himself is very impressive in his action scenes and makes up for the rest of his character's failing. Anita Mui is also physically very impressive and has some good action scenes and it is not her fault that her character is rather shoehorned into the film at the expensive of logic and emotional involvement.Overall this is an OK film but some will dislike the rather shoddy plot and the way it doesn't really deliver the emotions that the plot events suggest that it should. However what it does do is action and there are many good fights here involving all the main cast with only one or two moments where I felt the wirework was badly done.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review I quite enjoyed this movie. I really liked the little boy who played Jet Li's son and there chemistry and fighting skills was a joy to watch. The storyline was well put together and Jet Li proved that he can act as well as kick butt. Basically Jet Li plays an undercover cop trying to take down a crime boss but while he's on the job his wife dies and his son goes to live with a cop whose trying to work out Jet Li's true identity. The fighting scenes were quite good especially when his son is using his martial arts skills to help take down the baddies and the showdown at the end was worth waiting for. In all it's an entertaining film with enough material to keep you interested throughout. Enjoyable!RoundUp This film also has intense drama and you feel for Jet Li who can't reveal his undercover status to his family. After earning the trust from the baddies he's unable to go back home because it might break his cover so his only communication with his loved ones is through a pager and phone calls to his son. I was really impressed with his sons acting skills and he really did show true emotion for such a young boy. The director didn't go overboard with the string action so the fight scenes looked realistic and well choreographed. Anyway if your into your martial arts movies this is definitely worth a watch.Budget NA Worldwide Gross HK15.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a undercover cop fighting against a crime boss with the help of his young son. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Brieftrger Mller or Mailman Mller is a German color film from 1953 so this one will have its 65th anniversary soon being from less than a decade after World War II. It was the best period probably in terms of roles and performance by popular German actor Heinz Rhmann. And the title already gives away what kind of character he plays in this 90minute film. Taking a very basic look at it it is once again Rhmann's usual mix of comedy and drama and a good message. You could argue that he may not have the greatest range but even if that was true then he makes up for it with his mesmerizing screen presence and immense charisma. Lets just agree that he made good choices in terms of the characters he played. In this film here we also get the rare honor of seeing him as a director. And that was not the film's problem at least not the major problem. The major problem for me was that I just did not find the story interesting at all or that I cared a lot about the mailman's rose to wealth and what happened to him until he decided to go back to his roots. I still believe Rhmann elevated the material a lot and it would have been much more uninteresting and dragging with most other actors playing the title character. Nonetheless the bad outweighs the good and I give this movie a thumbsdown. Nowhere near Rhmann's best from the 1950s. Thumbs down.".

When all of them get invited to see their auntie Anna in Italy they travel there by bicycle. It soon becomes clear that wealthy old Anna has invited no less than 132 members of the Muller family to her enormous mansion to find out which one of them is best suited to look after her dog. All of them line up in a degrading line so this nasty Queen Elizabeth II lookalike can dismiss them one by one. I bet you can guess which family she picks or else the movie would be over pretty soon.When they finally sign the contract the soundtrack score blazes like some kind of biblical epic. Obviously money is holy to these people. The dog sets it's paw print and the family moves into the mansion. Some time later and for no good reason at all the old bankers sing a song for Titus and after this Dick van Dyke routine Heinz Ruhmann gets to do his Chaplin imitation once again when he stumbles home drunk. Now a national hero women start throwing themselves at Titus feet but he remains true to his Kaninchen as he calls his wife. Unfortunately when one of their own little Opie's accuses him of infidelity his 'bunny' sides with the kid. Actually the dog is the frisky one in this family after a romp in a haystack with another canine thankfully only implied this spoiled rich pup goes home closes the door behind him ! and leaves another knocked up girlfriend standing on the porch. A depressed Titus gets drunk again but less amusingly so and wakes up next to Miss Belle the cabaret star. From there on it is all downhill for Herr Muller because the usual message in these comedies of inheritance is a simple hard working life is better than a stack full of money. The exception is if you use your wealth for one good deed early on in the picture then everything will turn out alright. 3 out of 10".

From there on it is all downhill for Herr Muller because the usual message in these comedies of inheritance is a simple hard working life is better than a stack full of money. The exception is if you use your wealth for one good deed early on in the picture then everything will turn out alright. 3 out of 10";

I was born in Russia and speak the language fluently which has to be the reason I understood and enjoyed the movie so much. Despite all that I've had many nonRussian speaking friends who understood the concept and meaning of the movie fully. Sidorov captured the lifestyle of the Russian mafia very accurately. The movie spans the life of 4 friends over a period of 10 years going from innocent young men who wanted to be tough guys to being big time crime leaders after being left with no choice of other lifestyles. The best part about everything was how Sidorov showed his audience the changing mentalities in the 4 characters before and after the Soviet Union broke up. He made it very clear that many crime bosses came into power and became politicians and people who influence Russia with an iron fist. The movie also shows a lot of dedication. After watching the special features DVD and looking at all the behind the scenes footage I realized the actors poured their hearts and souls into portraying these 4 characters properly. For one they spent 2 years of their lives while production was running having their friends and family call them by their character names. Some of the actors like Sergei Bezrukov had to adjust their acting style. He went from being Russia's Golden Boy who played innocent boyish roles to proving to the Russian community that he has a wide range in his acting skills. I give this movie my full 5 stars and recommend it to everyone.".

There was a user of IMDb who said that the subs were not very good. It's because there are jokes and phrases that aren't understandable to others except eastEuropean countries. It's better to read something about the Russian mafia before you watch the series  that will help you understand th1077 film better.

	schema:reviewBody "I have never watched Russian TV series before as I expected them to be stupid and boring. But 'Brigada' was so extremely popular among my friends and so much talked about in the newspapers and magazines so I decided not to miss it. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Many people said that 'Brigada' makes youngsters like criminals and gangsters and fight against the militia. They said that in this series militia men look much more criminal than the criminals themselves! But unfortunately it is the regrettable truth of Russian life nowadays. That's why audience didn't judge the guys  Sasha Phyl Kosmos and Pchela  too harshly. They were the victims of the circumstances. About the movie itself. I liked the soundtrack very much. 'Brigada' ringtone was extremely popular among the people of all ages. The actors' performance was great sometimes brilliant. I especially liked Sergey Bezrukov and Vladimir Vdovichenkov. Dmitry Dyuzhev was excellent but on my opinion he's doing his best job acting in 'Twelfth Night'  the play by Shakespeare staged in Pushkin's theatre. His performance is so funny and wonderful that everybody can't help laughing. Katya Guseva is the most beautiful woman on the screen. Andrey Panin is a splendid villain! His character is so disgusting that I wanted to throw something heavy at his head every time I saw him. To sum up the movie is wellwritten welldirected and wellplayed. I'm very surprised and pleased that not only in Russia people watch and like it. Hope some new great movies and TVseries will come soon. For instance 'Zvezdochet' Astrologer starring the same Vdovichenkov and handsome Strahov. Looking forward to watching it! 9 out of 10  and my applause  to 'Brigada'.".

But 'Brigada' was so extremely popular among my friends and so much talked about in the newspapers and magazines so I decided not to miss it. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Many people said that 'Brigada' makes youngsters like criminals and gangsters and fight against the militia. They said that in this series militia men look much more criminal than the criminals themselves! But unfortunately it is the regrettable truth of Russian life nowadays. That's why audience didn't judge the guys  Sasha Phyl Kosmos and Pchela  too harshly. They were the victims of the circumstances. About the movie itself. I liked the soundtrack very much. 'Brigada' ringtone was extremely popular among the people of all ages. The actors' performance was great sometimes brilliant. I especially liked Sergey Bezrukov and Vladimir Vdovichenkov. Dmitry Dyuzhev was excellent but on my opinion he's doing his best job acting in 'Twelfth Night'  the play by Shakespeare staged in Pushkin's theatre. His performance is so funny and wonderful that everybody can't help laughing. Katya Guseva is the most beautiful woman on the screen. Andrey Panin is a splendid villain! His character is so disgusting that I wanted to throw something heavy at his head every time I saw him. To sum up the movie is wellwritten welldirected and wellplayed. I'm very surprised and pleased that not only in Russia people watch and like it. Hope some new great movies and TVseries will come soon. For instance 'Zvezdochet' Astrologer starring the same Vdovichenkov and handsome Strahov. Looking forward to watching it! 9 out of 10  and my applause  to 'Brigada'.";

All this Russian mafia brutality numerous crimes really took place when the era of Soviet Union was coming to its final.

Anybody who lived in Russia in the 1990s will tell you that this movie brilliantly reflects the social reality of that time period. At the same time the movie has an exciting and gripping plot that literally glues you to the television in a way few movies ever do. You are literally sitting at the edge of of your seat throughout the entire film. Personally I think this movie is even better than the Godfather series.All the negative comments speak about how this movie is immoral and give that as THE reason for giving the movie a low score. But this is simply not true! Yes the protagonists of the movie are mafiosos. But they are no more romanticized then the protagonists of Godfather were. No one gives the Godfather series a low rating just on those grounds? I think it's just that because this movie was so popular in Russia and a lot of kidsteenagers watched it and started fantasizing about becoming mafia gangsters. And some parents got very upset about it. That is the only reason for giving a lower rating to this movie! Those parents just needed to keep the children away from the TV. This movie is not for kids anyway.".

Please read my remark watch movie again and maybe you will see it totally different.For those who didn't like wife to Belyi who mean she didn't open character enough and you didn't really got know her. Well wife to mafia is kind of unknown they supposed to be on the background without being noticed too much. However I did understood what kind of person she was from early in the series. Rewatch first 23 episodes and maybe you will understand it as well.For those who didn't like other characters and mean they underplayed or overplayed. Totally rubbish! IMO they did perfect. As I said this movie is tru life story. They wasn't supposed to play someone they was supposed to create 4 characters by they own and give their hearts and souls to them what they successfully did.I can see that many of our English friend can understand that. In this story they wasn't supposed to play some one special they was supposed to show story that happened to thousands of young guys. They did it 100!And at the end I feel some of you had problems to understands part of the film. You say this movie about how great mafia are they are heroes who selling narcotics and weapon? Watch this movie again! Sacha didn't wanted to join mafia he was forced to it by police. Same with selling narcotics. He was forced to open those canals for transport. Same with weapon to Tjetjenia. Government gave him ultimatum. Do it or die. And from the day he got son he tried to quit his band and star legal but it was impossible.I want to say it again. Its not a movie that people in USA and Europe are used to where you just fantasies a plot and actors play their characters. Thise one is real story from mother watching news about soldier been killed in Afghanistan and crying cause her boy got back in life. Till how people try to come back on right way but its impossible and it don't matter that you have millions of dollars to to so.But most of all this movie is about friendship. I have lived in 5 different countries so far both soviet and Western and never seen this kind of friendship in western culture. But it how its is in Russia. You give everything for your best friends even your life if its needed. You have something to learn here... no offense".

Don't need to forget that your enemies always try to sink you so you have to be very careful and don't trust anyone too quickly.Moreover Brigada shows how people respect you and what you can do when you have a lot of money.

Although they were bad and did kill many people it made me cry to watch them die especially the way that they died betrayed by a loyal man. It broke my heart to see Belov so sad and this also proves how good the movie is I never really care about the characters in the movies I watch sometimes I even find it funny how they die. But every time that I watch Brigada I cry at Belov's pain In a way I share it with him. Aleksei Sidorov did a great job and by the end of the movie I felt like i knew Sasha Phil Pchelka and Kosmos... I felt like I was one of them. This is truly a great movie if you haven't already seen it then I really recommend it to all.

Some say it romanticizes the criminals perhaps... others respond it showed the truth may be so....In any case the movie is done in an absolutely brilliant fashion it took two years to film amazing casting especially Bezrukov Duzhev Guseva and Panin incredible beyond any words! soundtrack whose melodies went to almost every Russian cell phone and last but not least a completed scenario with a rather hollywodized ending but still very impressive ending.I would highly recommend this movie but in my opinion it would be hard to understand for a foreigner who did not live in the 80s and 90s in Russia and can't really relate to the events depicted on the screen. Those people that have lived through that time myself included can feel anything from nostalgia to anger those that haven't can enjoy the plot effects and romantic story there aren't too many love scenes but the sexual energy of Guseva and their alliance with Bezrukov just flows from the screen and completely blows you awayp.s.

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent script and great acting. The plot is very catching and humane. One sees this and can understand that youths in Russia are just the same as any youth anywhere else. Mafia stories like this are very catching because they show how normal people in extreme circumstances becoming part of a power struggle where some come to be criminals whereas others that act in the same sense and do the same or worse evils do so from within the system being part of government or state... When the system is in turmoil anything goes and its almost a gamble to come at any end of the struggle. Then criminal or not they all go into politics because they have been part of what has been going on maybe not being very aware of it. In this sense the plot is Shakespearian.

	onyx:emotionText "Excellent script and great acting. The plot is very catching and humane. One sees this and can understand that youths in Russia are just the same as any youth anywhere else. Mafia stories like this are very catching because they show how normal people in extreme circumstances becoming part of a power struggle where some come to be criminals whereas others that act in the same sense and do the same or worse evils do so from within the system being part of government or state... When the system is in turmoil anything goes and its almost a gamble to come at any end of the struggle. Then criminal or not they all go into politics because they have been part of what has been going on maybe not being very aware of it. In this sense the plot is Shakespearian. At the end everyone is plainly human making mistakes and acting on revenge ambition passion obsession and hate or mere convenience but also on deep love and unconditional friendship all at the same time be it fate or will or a mixture of both as life usually is.";

	schema:reviewBody "This minie series could be a big hit in Canada if total dvd would have done better job of the english subtitles. Well I was glad that there were english subtitles at all because I love russian cinema. Just to say that I'm grateful for subtitles in english or german. Because that is the only way I can truly enjoy most russian movies nowada ys. It seems that a lot of the new russian productions don't want to pay the extra chum  change for  english subtitles. But I can assure them that there is a growing community of english speaking canadian fans that in fact relly enjoy russian movies. And that they would get their money back  if they do so. Because most canadian distributers like VIDEO ONE  do not market the wide range of russian movies I often have to order my russian movies directly from russia or from New York. There only a fraction of the titles offer english subtitles. The other problem is that the russian websides have very little english navigation. They should become more user friendly ! DON'T THEY WANT TO MAKE ANY MONEY ? The russian companies should also make a better effort to link their movies for sale to the IDMB database. The sales would go up ! Russia has an enourmous archive of great movies and a resurging movie industrie with a potential to give hollywood a run for it's money The magic words are  MARKETING MARKETING AND MARKETING ! The americans sell a lot of movie garbage like that. Russia's movie industrie has a talent for doing excellent historical masterpieces and modern crime dramas. Please proceed in this fashion  but with better marketing. I believe that is all what it takes. Now back to the movie The acting was very good I'm becoming a fan of Ekaterina Guseva. She's radiant and refreshing. The story was very suspensefull right after the conflict with the orientals. Than the story was a little stale. The sequence where the gang decided to go into politics a little too long. But the anti climactic end of the movie did justify going through this slacking part. I also was a little disturbed about the directors  gloryfying crime scenes. I believe criminals should be portrayed without it. There is simply no glory in crime ! What about the victims of their crimes ? Too little was seen about themin this movie. Nevertheless I truly enjoyed this movie. I rated it a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Unusual free Adaptation of Romeo  Juliet";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not the first time that a drama of Shakespeare or another classical is adapted and free interpreted for a Spaghetti Western. The story is about the war between two rancher families Monter and the Campos. In the Shakespeare Drama the two are named Montague and Capulet. The son of the Monter who is named Johnny not Romeo has not many experiences with Guns and Women. Fortunately he got a teacher an old outlaw called Lefty and he meets Guiletta Campos the daughter of the Campos Chief. She is espoused to another man but fells in Love with the son of her father's enemy. The cast of the two lovers are Peter Lee Lawrence and Cristina Galb. It's interesting that both became a couple during making FURY OF JOHNNY KID and married few years later. There is obviously good chemistry between them. Nevertheless the movie is more a spaghetti western as a romantic drama with typical violent scenes a revenge story and a buddy next to the hero. The typical Buddy story it's about an old outlaw is teaching a young fellow. The Buddy Andrs Mejuto is called Lefty and he has only one hand left. All actors are pretty good and the movie is without strange overacting you see in so many contributions of this genre. Somehow it's like an Adult Western without childish elements you'll find in most western from Italy.Next to these normal western stories there are some extraordinary scenes. I didn't expect the end and Yes that's what I would call a weird movie. FURY OF JOHNNY KID is the only western directed by Gianni Puccini who is better known for his work on more sophisticated Movies. He did quiet a good job as also the composer Gino Peguri and the cinematography by Mario Monturi have done.FURY OF JOHNNY KID was a big surprise for me. It's a weird Spaghetti Western for Adults with good Acting Directing and a fine score. I enjoyed this unusual Movie with a suspenseful story and many interesting scenes and at least some connection to the great Drama of Shakespeare.".

He did quiet a good job as also the composer Gino Peguri and the cinematography by Mario Monturi have done.FURY OF JOHNNY KID was a big surprise for me. It's a weird Spaghetti Western for Adults with good Acting Directing and a fine score. I enjoyed this unusual Movie with a suspenseful story and many interesting scenes and at least some connection to the great Drama of Shakespeare.";

	schema:reviewBody "BRIGHTON ROCK is a British remake of the 1947 brilliant film noir based on the novel by Graham Greene an adapted for the screen by Graham Greene and Terrance Rattigan. This BRIGHTON ROCK has been updated from the original 1930s setting to the 1960s and the screenplay is by Rowan Joffe who also directs  tough competition with the original writers! The result is a dark film that relies on performances by some actors who are not up to the task and makes them seem even more weak by the presence of such brilliant actors in smaller roles as Helen Mirren John Hurt Philip Davis and Andrea Riseborough. The story takes place in 1964 in Brighton once a quiet seaside town is suddenly overrun by gangs of sharp suited Mods and greasy Rockers looking for a riot. Looking to be the top Mod gangster Pinkie Brown Sam Riley will stop at nothing to be the biggest name in the crime world  bigger than the competitor Colleoni Andy Serkis. Pinkie witnesses the vicious death of fellow Mod Kite Goeff Bell and is determined to kill the perpetrator Hale Sean Harris. Pinkie's ruthless and violent ambition takes over his mission and when he discovers that a waitress named Rose Andrea Riseborough who works at Snows a caf run by Ida Helen Mirren is involved tangentially in the murders Pinkie decides to court the plain Jane Rose knowing that if he marries her she cannot testify against him should she discover Pinkie's guilt in the murders. Ida had a 'connection' with Hale and sees through the veils of deceit Pinkie is placing on the innocent Rose and she and her longtime friend Phil John Hurt undermine Pinkie's plans. Pinkie marries Rose  a gesture that secures Rose's fascination and new love for Pinkie  to keep her from testifying against him. As factors around the conflicts between the two gangs tighten and Pinkie fears for his end he convinces his new bride to take part in a mutual suicide an act that has a surprising end. What is missing in this updated adaptation is Graham Greene's important emphasis on the theme of sin guilt and Catholicism there are attempts to bring these concepts into the script but they become of lesser importance than the action and dark evocation of a period piece. There mood is well described by the cinematography of John Mathieson but the single most effective aspect of this film is the brilliant music score by the gifted British composer Martin Phipps godson of Benjamin Britten. Were there not an original film for comparison the film would likely be better accepted. But for those who are ardent fans of the novels of Graham Greene this film adaptation will likely disappoint. It is currently available On Demand and simultaneously in theaters before the DVD is released here. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "The main character of this movie is Pinkie Brown a smalltime thug in Brighton England in the 1960s. Pinkie's true evil nature comes out when he tries to take over a small gang of criminals after their leader had been killed by a rival gang. As played here Pinkie is in his 20s and as brash and amoral as he is he and his mediocre cohorts are no match for the rival gang that basically runs underground crime in Brighton. The action is sordid and ugly but the glossy color photography works at cross purposes to conveying that mood. Much of the photography is more appropriate for an art film than for this downanddirty fare making me think that maybe black and white would have been a more appropriate choice. As Pinkie I found Sam Riley just a little too handsome for the parthe does not exude the menace and harsh personality that is Pinkie's nature.I found the initial setup scenes rapidpaced and confusing requiring close attention if you don't follow what has happened early on you will be at a loss to fully understand what happens later. An additional complication to my following the opening scenes was the fact that I am not a Brit and didn't always follow the cadences and clipped manner of speaking. I confess to starting the movie over after about fifteen minutes with English subtitles turned on. That was a great help.The score that often seems to aspire to the transcendent seems greatly out of place.I wish I had seen this movie before having read the book since having some of the images in mind would have been good. Never having been to Brighton my mental picture of it would have been greatly enhanced by what is well captured here. While the movie strips from the book much of the depth of the themes of sexuality morality loyalty and sin there are things in the movie that I found improved upon the book. I liked Helen Mirren's portrayal of Ida as a more centered person than the blithe Ida of the book and John Hurt fleshed out Ida's friend Phil better than what I got from the book. And there are a lot of little things. For example I pictured the candy Brighton rock as being something like a candy cane rather than the weighty rod seen in the movie. I regret that Pinkie's lawyer Prewitt was deletedhe was a truly Dickensian character in the book. And why the great ending in the book was changed is beyond me.".

She and I were both disappointed.I was actually really rather bored for the first half and wanted to run out of the cinema screaming. It seemed to take for ever to get going.There were no characters I could empathise with. Rose who falls for bad boy Pinkie seemed too dim and snivelling to care about and Pinkie had so little charm I couldn't care less what happened to him. The actor Sam Riley's maturity around 30was against him playing the role of Pinkie who I realised long into the film was meant to be in his teens.I thought that perhaps the story wasn't for me.... My mum kept on that it wasn't as good as the classic original. So I thought I'd find out for myself and got hold of a DVD. Was she right? Yes. Although by no means perfect it had a robust sense of what it was a British noir gangster film. Set in 1940s shot in stark black and white it was gritty and hard and menacing.Whereas the look and feel of this version seemed to be at odds with the subject matter. In it's attempt to be lavish this production updated to the 60s seemed at times too clean and shiny. On the other hand at other times it was unrealistically grubby  Rose's home  a 60s socail housing tower block which would in reality have been spanking new was dressed down to look disgustingly filthy and run down. These kinds of inconsitencies popped up not just in the design but throughout the music the camerawork and the diercting of the actors. The pacing of seemed to jump from set piece to set piece without a sense of flow or overall tone. The separate elements of the film didn't gel. The best description I can come up with is clonky. In fact I'd go further and say it is a ham fisted mishmash.Sorry to the filmmakers I think you wasted a lot of effort on this. which is a shame.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a Brighton resident I had to see this but also probably spent more time looking at the locations and more critically than a normal viewer. On the plus side there is excellent cinematography and the film creates an atmospheric mid 60's version of Brighton that might be convincing to anyone too young to remember that time but which contained too many jarring anachronisms for me. For example Rose lives in a tower block which could have existed in 1964 and would have still been soulless and depressing but would also have been practically brand spanking new not run down and shabby with 20 years of neglect. This highlights another failing of the film the clichd exaggerated unrelenting squalor that all the criminals live in which again is untrue to the period twitching net curtains and keeping up often threadbare appearances was how things worked then in working class neighbourhoods especially. You could create an oppressive atmosphere from these real elements and the culture clash of the pre and post war worlds perhaps more easily than from this invented total squalor.So if the world the film creates is a Hollywood version of 1960's Brighton do the characters engage you? Well I loved Helen Mirren and John Hurt they brought a touch of class whenever they appeared and Phil Davis is another very fine actor who is always watchable. Sadly the two main characters don't quite pull it off and if I have to lay the blame it is chiefly with Sam Riley's Pinkie. If he could have alternated his cold unsmiling thuggishness with some charm shown Rose a little tenderness some vulnerability even that would have made her falling for him and her naive notion that she could save him more convincing and maybe made his cruelty and occasional physical violence toward her more shocking. Andrea Riseborough as Rose gives a fair performance given that she does not have much to work with.I'm sorry if this review makes the film sound worse than it is because truth be told despite its failings it is consistently watchable and still managed to engage me. An interesting failure.".

Sadly the two main characters don't quite pull it off and if I have to lay the blame it is chiefly with Sam Riley's Pinkie. If he could have alternated his cold unsmiling thuggishness with some charm shown Rose a little tenderness some vulnerability even that would have made her falling for him and her naive notion that she could save him more convincing and maybe made his cruelty and occasional physical violence toward her more shocking. Andrea Riseborough as Rose gives a fair performance given that she does not have much to work with.I'm sorry if this review makes the film sound worse than it is because truth be told despite its failings it is consistently watchable and still managed to engage me. An interesting failure.";

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this film with some trepidation. The original Graham Greene novel is very good and one of my favourites. The original film from 1947 was also extremely good with Richard Attenborough as an unlikely but splendid villain. However this version was excellent. The fact that it had been updated to the 60s which had worried me a little worked well. Of course it did not have the period feel but the aggression violence and fighting for territory of the Mods and Rockers which I remember well echoed beautifully the behaviour of the gangsters and gave the opportunity for some very effective scenes visually. The acting I found completely plausible with Phill Davies John Hurt Sam Riley and Andrea Riseborough all giving authentic portrayals. Helen Mirren perhaps looked a little too glamorous physically but her acting was fine. Brighton itself was a wonderful additional character in all this. The contrast between the somewhat mindless hedonism of the holiday makers and the violent and ugly activities of the underworld was extremely effective and the use of the landscape beautiful and horrific in equal measure. The theme of sin guilt and Catholicism was probably not dealt with as interestingly as in the novel but that is a frequent limitation of the medium of film. Why on earth the makers of the film felt that they were entitled to improve on Graham Greene's ending I do not know. But it did not spoil my overall judgement that this was a very good film. I hope it will inspire those who have not already done so to read the novel.".

	schema:headline " The filmmaking does not match the thin plot";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something off about Brighton Rock. The atmosphere and mood surrounding the action does not match what is going on. Based on a Graham Greene novel Brighton Rock follows a low level gangster's attempt to avenge his father figure stake a claim to the top spot and run the mob racket in Brighton England in 1964. Encasing this formulaic plot is a soaring orchestral score shots of the waves crashing on the rocky beach and dialogue which seems deliberately pieced together from 1930s and 40s gangster pictures.Pinkie Brown Sam Riley witnesses a rival gang member murder his mentormob boss in the film's opening scene. Pinkie learned everything from this man including intimidation tactics how to handle a knife and presumably how to convincingly wear a menacing sneer. Riley plays Pinkie as a guy you do not want to mess with let alone have a conversation with. Unfortunately poor and innocent Rose Andrea Riseborough witnesses a key segment of the revenge attack and becomes connected with Pinkie who needs to keep close tabs on her. Mistaking his attention as romantic interest Rose almost becomes comic. No matter how lonely the girl I cannot believe any female would be flattered by Pinkie Brown. He is overtly mean sarcastic and threatening to this girl he is trying to convince he has feelings for. Rounding out the ensemble is a miscast Helen Mirren as a meddling interloper and John Hurt who acts as a sort of Greek Chorus commenting on the plot from aside.The miseenscene however is quite convincing. Brighton is shot as cold bleak and gray adjectives which aptly describe that city in the winter time. There seems to be nowhere else to go or spend time other than the Brighton Pier which is true. Brighton Rock desperately wants to be an epic with its serious moments on the Dover cliffs brutal knife fights under the pier and its dangerous love story. The plot is so thin and trivial though that it cannot match but only hinder the help all the other film components are trying to give it such as the score costumes and set design.Do not waste your time with Brighton Rock. The writer who adapted this novel to the screen is Rowan Joffe who also wrote the screenplay for 2010's The American. If you have not had the pleasure of that film yet see it instead.".

	schema:headline " Rowan Joffe's dark suspenseful but fatally flawed remake of Brighton Rock.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hearing the news that John Boulting's classic 1946 adaptation of Graham Greene's novel Brighton Rock was to be remade filled with me trepidation. The current spate of mostly inferior remakes are one thing but meddling with the perfection of this archetypical gangster film is another. How can any updated version possibly replace the indelible image of the 23 year old Richard Attenborough as the flick knife wielding baby faced assassin Pinkie Brown? As filming began and rumours of a 1960s Mods and Rockers setting emerged I began to have serious doubts if this remake was really going to be a good idea! Thankfully fears that Rowan Joffe's Brighton Rock is a sanitised version of the story are quickly allayed. The relocation of Brighton Rock to the 1960s does not mean that we are entering into the trendy youth culture of the era or being taken on an adolescent search for identity. The sharpsuited posers and greasy leather clad Rockers are merely a backdrop to a much darker reality as we are taken into a terrifying world of crime guilt and innertorment.Brighton Rock is concerned with the concepts of good versus evil sin and redemption they were present in Greene's novel the 1946 adaptation and once again are central in Rowan Joffe's remake. However additional scenes and alterations to the 2010 update mean that Pinkie's progressively violent behaviour is almost justified. In the exhilarating opening sequence Pinkie witnesses the brutal murder of the gang's original leader Kite when Fred Hale slashes his throat. When Pinkie sees one of the few role models in his life burbling and drowning in his own blood revenge it seems is not only on the cards but unavoidable. This kind of black and white eye for an eye morality detracts from the original story where Pinkie Brown's vicious streak appeared to be innate and a product of original sin. The character of Ida Arnold Dame Helen Mirren also has undergone a significant adjustment. In opposition to the Catholicism of Pinkie and Rose the pleasure seeking Ida was concerned only with the here and now. Mirren's portrayal plays these aspects down resulting in a more serious role and a lessening of the story's theological study.As with Attenborough before him Sam Riley's Pinkie is intense dangerous and teeters on the edge of sanity. If anything in Joffe's adaptation Pinkie Brown undergoes a broader transformation than before as greater emphasis being placed upon his journey from a nervous lackey to maniacal gang leader. Unfortunately the 30 year old Riley he does not resemble a juvenile delinquent. Therefore the shy adolescent awkwardness that Pinkie displays towards adulthood and in particular his relationship with Rose conveyed so expertly by Attenborough is absent.Andrea Riseborough gives an outstanding performance as Rose she too goes on a psychological journey from being a naive and mousey youngster to an assertive young woman attracted to Pinkie's confidence and menace. The scene in which Pinkie in effect buys Rose from her abusive father for 150 adds a social realist dimension to the film uncovering the lack of options available to a young workingclass woman in 'sixties Britain. The squalid surroundings of Pinkie and Rose's flat complete with peeling wallpaper scuffed furniture and squeaky floorboards are also reminiscent of a Kitchen Sink drama. There is some impressive cinematography by John Mathieson as the camera pans from the threatening crashing waves on Brighton Beach to the scenic seaside cafs foreshadowing the storm that is building. The swelling orchestral soundtrack also adds to the heightened sense of panic and drama. The tea rooms arcades and dancehalls of 1960s Brighton are also accurately recreated as are the neglected interiors of the boarding houses. And yet There is something oddly unreal about Joffe's Brighton Rock partly down to the unnecessary time shift which does nothing but confuse the audience. The film's characters seem stuck in the wrong era originating as they do from austere postwar Britain both in appearance and behaviour. Using the Mods and Rockers backdrop and casting of Philip Davis who appeared in Quadrophenia as Spicer turns the movie into a pastiche of sorts leaving us with a soupedup hyperreality. This is Brighton as seen through the eyes of the cinema goer not the world of Graham Greene's novel. Dark menacing and suspenseful Rowan Joffe's Brighton Rock is well worth seeing it is just unfortunate that the film is not as good as the sum of its parts.".

Don't forget in 1964 we were four years into the sixties we were in the height of Beatlemania The Stones and the most significant fashion change since the start of the century.Sam Riley was like a dummy out of Montague Burton's window utterly unconvincing as an up and coming gangster. Helen Mirren and John Hurt should seriously think about retirement. This poor remake is badly written badly researched badly acted and very badly directed...it should go straight to the 1 DVD basket. This version of Brighton Rock could have been made by students it is dreadful do not waste your money on this piece of rubbish.".

I was in Brighton as a mod in 1964 and this movie got the period all wrong. Sure the mod extras were dressed 1964 and were riding vespas and lambrettas but everything else was 1954. Don't forget in 1964 we were four years into the sixties we were in the height of Beatlemania The Stones and the most significant fashion change since the start of the century.Sam Riley was like a dummy out of Montague Burton's window utterly unconvincing as an up and coming gangster. Helen Mirren and John Hurt should seriously think about retirement. This poor remake is badly written badly researched badly acted and very badly directed...it should go straight to the 1 DVD basket. This version of Brighton Rock could have been made by students it is dreadful do not waste your money on this piece of rubbish.";

There was nothing of significance that wasn't in the 1947 film. They even borrowed the copout ending with the record.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the perils of remaking a classic film is that your version will be compared unfavourably with the original. Of course there have always been filmmakers who have dared to brave this peril and it is as well that there have been otherwise we would have been deprived of for example Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of Henry V which spoke to the eighties just as Laurence Olivier's had spoken to the forties.Graham Greene's novel Brighton Rock was famously adapted for the screen by the Boulting brothers in 1947 and their version is widely regarded as one of the greatest films from the Golden Age of the British cinema during the forties and fifties. Rowan Joff's recent remake has not been universally wellreceived particularly by those who believe that nothing can ever compete with its illustrious predecessor. Much as I admire the Boultings' film however I have to admit that the newcomer has many virtues of its own.The main character is Pinkie Brown the youthful leader of a gang of thugs whose principal activity is protection racketeering. Early in the film Pinkie murders Hale a member of a rival gang in revenge for the murder by Hale of Pinkie's colleague Kite. In the original novel and the 1947 film Hale was a journalist who had been investigating the gang's activities. Another change is the date at which the story takes place although the novel and original film are both set in the 1930s this adaptation is set during the Mods and Rockers era of the 1960s.Pinkie tries to cover his tracks by creating a false alibi for himself which leads to the commission of further crimes and to Pinkie's marriage to Rose a young waitress who he believes might be in possession of evidence which could send him to the gallows. Pinkie is not in love with Rose but marries her because at the time the film is set there was a rule of English law that a wife could not give evidence against her husband. The ending is closer to the one Greene wrote in his novel although Joff keeps the famous twist which the writer introduced when he produced the 1947 screenplay.Joffe said that he made the film because on reading the novel he fell absolutely in love with the character of Rose and the treatment of this character is in my view the one area in which the modern film is better than the earlier one. Andrea Riseborough's interpretation of the character downbeat dowdy bespectacled and needy seems just right for the role. Rose responds to Pinkie's overtures because he is the only person to have shown her any affection and she is nave enough to overlook his obvious criminality and not to realise that his affection for her is feigned. Carol Marsh's Rose however was rather too glamorous it was difficult to imagine her as someone lacking in male admirers.There are also good performances from two veterans of the British cinema John Hurt and Helen Mirren. Hurt plays the bookmaker Phil Corkery who has a more important role in this adaptation than he does in the book. Mirren plays Ida Arnold the woman whose determination to get at the truth results in Pinkie's downfall. In the 1947 Ida was played by Hermione Baddeley as a blowsy ageing showgirl and a casual acquaintance of Hale here she becomes the manageress of the caf where Rose works and a close friend of the murdered man.I was less impressed by Sam Riley who as Pinkie lacked the sense of menace and evil which Richard Attenborough brought to the role. At 30 moreover Riley seemed too old to play a teenager. Attenborough would have been 24 in 1947 and looked younger. Also I couldn't see the point of setting the story in the 1960s as the Mods and Rockers element added little or nothing to Greene's story. Pinkie's gang and the rival Colleoni gang were both part of Brighton's own criminal underworld whereas the Mods and Rockers were drawn from all over the country especially London and merely chose Brighton and other seaside resorts as convenient places for their battles.Joff has also discarded a lot of the religious content of the original novel. Greene made Ida an atheist whose system of values was based upon secular ideas of right and wrong as opposed to Pinkie and Rose both believing Catholics who believed firmly in good and evil. This opposition between two contrasting attitudes to morality was an important theme of the novel but it is not something dwelt on at length in either film. The 1947 version downplayed Pinkie's religious beliefs possibly as a concession to Catholics unhappy with the idea of one of their flock being portrayed as a violent criminal although it did concentrate on Rose's spiritual development. The modern film acknowledges that both Pinkie and Rose are Romans but for the most part avoids theological issues and turns Greene's story into the basis for a grim grey neonoir type crime thriller. The 1947 film was set during a sunny summer Bank Holiday this version appears to have been shot in winter with Brighton largely deserted by holidaymakers. It is up to the viewer to decide which approach he or she prefers. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "A really big step in the career of Richard Attenborough came when he starred in the first film of Graham Greene's novel Brighton Rock. It was so good you'd think no one would try and top it but in 2010 the story was filmed again and the time of the story updated from post war Great Britain to the swinging sixties and the riots between the Mod and Rocker teens. That is the background for young Sam Riley to try and take a really big step in the rackets.Which are pretty much the same as they are here although it is rare that guns are used as per the culture. Sam Riley in the lead role that helped give a boost to Richard Attenborough's career is an amoral young man who gets involved in a homicide. A revenge killing really but a young woman who works in Helen Mirren's store can finger him for the crime.What to do but woo Andrea Riseborough and marry her so she can't testify against him. But when Riley's crew leans on Mirren's friend John Hurt at his place of business and the guy that Riley killed was Mirren's boyfriend she'll do what it takes to take Riley down.Some nice shots of Brighton which is like Atlantic City here a rather run down resort area or at least Atlantic City was before the casinos arrived. Riley Riseborough Mirren and Hurt do quite well by their roles.There is a really nice performance by Andy Serkis as a rather flamboyant gay gangster who is head of the other mob. He checks out Riley like a slab of beef on the rack at the butcher shop but he doesn't let his lust get in the way of squelching a rival.There's also a little more of the Catholicism of Graham Greene in the plot than there was in the first film. Even as amoral a young man as Riley does get guilt tripped quite a bit for the advantage he takes of Riseborough.Not a bad film but not up to what Richard Attenborough starred in.".

The cinematography is grainy and atmospheric The sound track has a strange almost religious feel to it which adds to the sense of unease as you struggle to come to terms with the evil that can exist in fellow human beings.

Can a film that boasts some excellent character actors really be that dodgy? They answer to both of these questions is Yes it can be THAT bad and Yes even with a good cast it can be dodgy. There is something here and I can't quite put my finger on it that brought back memories of some English film making from the 1980s films that weren't that great to begin with and now are almost unwatchable. It is a particular style that screams SURFACE Post modernity has a lot to answer for and this does.Look I realise that comparing a remake with an original film or a book to a film for that matter is a pointless exercise. From my perspective they are different texts which should be judged on their own merits HOWEVER it would be remiss of me not to suggest getting a copy of the original 'Brighton Rock'  Hell! Pardon the pun Get the Book! Then you will know just how much depth this film chose to omit. For some reason the entire story has been set in 1964  and for no reason whatsoever we get to watch lots of extras dressed as Mods and Rockers although why they bothered when a cut and paste job from Quadrophenia would have done nicely. I was looking out for the Ace Face as the 'Bell Boy' outside the posh Hotel. .....and it is 1960s done very Austin Powers to boot. As I said post modern surfaces keep bouncing anything that matters off the screen. Why this was not set in the immediate Post World War 2 era is odd. The characters the story line all inhabit this earlier period none of it 'fits' in the 1960s theme park on offer here. Another reviewer here was spot on with a glaring historical inaccuracy as well Where Rose lives in the council flat is made to look rundown and shabby those flats were BRAND NEW at the time the film is set. In fact most of the high rise flats were not built until later in the 1960s. Do a quick Google search and you will find that people were invariably impressed with the shining new kitchens and bathrooms in the council flats when they were first built. Also at the end when Rose is in the unmarried mothers home  yes I know these places were not nice in England at the time but they were not the Magdalene laundries of Ireland which is what the film makers seem to be alluding to. I did manage to get through it but did press the fast forward button on several occasions. It managed to be boring seriously boring. A good rule of thumb in a film is to see how much direction the Extras got. Watch out for Pinkie grabbing Rose and yanking her down the Pier. Extras do not even look  and people would look glance or maybe even stare. But no! They just carry on with their 'rhubarb rhubarb' chattiness. It might sound like a minor thing but it is these 'little things' which contribute to the shallowness of the entire film. Usually I remember cinematography  there is always something that is amazing well usually. But I've drawn a blank. Odd film. Not in a good way.".

Helen Mirren and Sam Riley gave amazing performances and owned the film while Andrea Riseborough gave a great performance as the annoying and needy Rose. The performances and cast make up for the lack of excitement. There are a few twist within and some action scenes that make the film that bit more interesting.

It seemed different to other films and in a genre of it's own. It was not a bad film but at the same time it wasn't the bestI would say stick to the novel and original. The start was very slow. Helen Mirren and Sam Riley gave amazing performances and owned the film while Andrea Riseborough gave a great performance as the annoying and needy Rose. The performances and cast make up for the lack of excitement. There are a few twist within and some action scenes that make the film that bit more interesting. It's a rememberable film but I wouldn't plan on watching it again.";

It's a sour onenote performance unrelieved by moments of humanity that might have made him in other hands a little bit endearing. His Pinkie spends virtually the entire film glowering menacingly at everyone including Rose. He even glowers when he's staring into space.Richard Attenborough in the much more satisfying 1947 version was of course menacing as well  Pinkie is after all a killer  but at least Attenborough was much smaller physically as well as younger and more openfaced and displayed an occasional touch of boyish vulnerability that made Rose's falling for him fairly believable. In this bleakly charmless remake Riley stalks through the city like a character in an Edward Gor ey cartoon looking so grim so downright homicidal and malevolent that anyone of any sense would cross the street to avoid him. And he speaks in such a hoarse croaking snarl that when he informs Rose he was once a choirboy you feel like laughing.Which makes it all the more improbable that Rose would fall in love with him so quickly the fact that she does so makes her seem  in contrast to the touching naive Rose of the 1947 version  almost pathological and frankly retarded. She reminded me of the serial killer's mentally challenged girlfriend played by Juliette Lewis in Kalifornia. And that Rose would actually brandish a knife at Helen Mirren's Ida and speak to her with such hostility and that Ida would nonetheless repeatedly risk her own life on Rose's behalf... well it all seems pretty unlikely.Also unlikely John Hurt as the frail and elderly Corkery talking back to Pinkie and his thug sidekick when they come for their protection money getting  not surprisingly  slashed and threatened for his attitude and yet later speaking dismissively and indeed jocularly about the young man. Pinkie is an obvious psychopath a known killer and makes no attempt to hide it  in fact he all but advertises it it's the role he wants to play  yet the lawabiding characters while they disapprove of him seem to regard him without a trace of fear.The Philip Davis character Spicer also seems weirdly improbably oblivious to the danger which is why predictably he winds up dead. Spicer's supposed to be a lifelong career criminal yet he acts like a dimwitted and trusting comicbook victim who all but colludes in his own death even returning to the gang's flat despite the fact that hours earlier Pinkie has rather obviously set him up and tried to have him murdered. I just don't get it.In a series of interviews on the DVD various cast members and the writerdirector spoke of their hope indeed their fond belief that Graham Greene would have liked this new version of his novel. I can't agree I think it's just as well Greene was spared having to watch it.".

I was still waiting for someone to produce a true SHART! It was a bit more cerebral than that however but I think a Shart could have been thrown in tactfully.It seems that ten lines of text will be difficult to produce here without throwing in a spoiler. I guess commenting more on the director is in order. This is the second film I have seen from the same director and definitely much more my favorite. The Hindu films are interesting to watch in the fact that production differs so greatly from films produced in the United States.

	schema:headline " Remarkable piece of cinematic history";
	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock's Blackmail might have been a total train wreck in the hands of a lesser talent. Instead it is a remarkable piece of cinematic history and still tremendously entertaining after 78 years. The film was partly shot when Hitchcock learned that he would have access to sound equipment. His female lead was a talented German silent picture actress whose accent was too heavy for sound so an offcamera reader had to be used plus a decent amount of expensive film had already been used and had to be integrated into the 'talkie' as well.All considered the movie is probably the best example of the transition from these two cinematic paradigms that can be found.The silent portion of the film establishes John Longden's character as a hardnosed young Scotland Yard detective. Anny Ondra plays the lovely young lady who is engaged to himand who soon becomes the center of our attention. One night after they argue over some petty matters they part company and Anny meets up with a male artist friend who unbeknownst to her is interested in more than just pleasant conversation. Frank Longden spots them leaving the restaurant and follows them for a while. The artist coaxes Alice Ondra up to his flat and things take a sinister turn in short order.Over the second half of the film the plots unfolds and the emotions and consciences of the protagonists are sorely tried.What immediately blew my mind was what a great silent director Hitchcock was. Shouldn't have been too surprising since Hitchcock has always struck me as a master cinematographer. The first 20 minutes of the film are completely silentand there are no interruptions from distracting story boards. Nevertheless through incredible use of lighting camera work and evocative acting you understand everything that is going on clearly and are drawn straight into the edgy atmosphere so familiar to those who appreciate the work of this great director.The acting is mostly very good. Only Longden sometimes seems to over or underact his part and Ondra is really wonderful all the way through. I was not surprised to learn of her lengthy and productive career both before and after this film and will now look for more of her work.It is also interesting to see how the actors adapted so readily to the new medium. Although some have said that the sound portion of this film seemed overacted because the actors were still clinging to silent film conventions I really can not agree. Some of the characters Alice for example required very evocative rather physical performances and I can't imagine how she could have done better.Highly recommended for the amazing photography exceptionally professional though very early use of sound and the typically perfect pace.".

	schema:headline " All Things Considered Quite Extraordinary";
	schema:reviewBody "Considering the technical limitations confronting Hitchcock the partsoundpartsilent format the bulky graceless early sound camera a leading lady who barely spoke English etc. Blackmail remains one of the director's most impressive productions. The visual and sound quality is excellent especially for a 1929 film and already Hitchcock is using distinctive camera angles to create memorable effects. Notice the shadowy interior of the Artist's loft and the way Hitchcock swoops the camera about to convey Alice's disorientation after the murder. I also love the way Hitchcock depicts the Blackmailer's flight after his climactic confrontation with Alice and the Detective. We never see the Blackmailer at all  the camera remains frozen on the face of the Detective who reacts to what is going on. At the moment the Blackmailer shatters the window the Detective lets out a shout and the camera  as if startled by the commotion  dollies backward. We immediately cut to the busted window with a posse of lawmen rushing toward it. It's a wonderful device what other director in 1929 would have approached the scene in this way I wonder?. The performances in Blackmail are remarkable and eccentric in the best sense of the word. Donald Calthrop and Cyril Ritchard playing the disheveled blackmailer and the lecherous artist etch themselves in your memory. Anny Ondra is fine as Alice gamely committing herself to the role even though she was pantomiming lines. Her dazed reactions at the climax of the murder sequence are shocking. She's like a demented robot yet the behavior rings true for me. Lastly let me say I admire John Longden's performance most of all. His role as Frank the detective is in no sense that of a traditional film hero. He often bullies Alice turns moody and childish during arguments and is willing to pin murder on an innocent albeit not very nice man. Longden realizes all the not very appealing attributes of Frank's behavior how he sneers when the tables finally turn on Calthrop but he also makes clear that he loves Alice and is trying to protect her. He is clearly devastated as he talks with Alice in the phone booth and realizes she is indeed guilty. In summary few of Hitchcock's 1930 British films are on a par with Blackmail.  The depth of its characterizations will remain unmatched until Rebecca a decade later. Reflect on how Blackmail compares  technically  with America's first sound film and you start to see the true measure of Hitchcock's genius.".

	schema:reviewBody "While remembered as the first sound picture made by Alfred Hitchcock or anyone else in Britain there is much more to Blackmail than merely historical interest.  It reveals the director's subtle creativity with a carefully structured story that also produces some real suspense with one of Hitchcock's best cameos and an entertaining chase sequence as bonuses. The movie has a unique feel as Hitchcock was still using many silent film techniques at the same time that he was experimenting with sound.  Not all of this works perfectly but it does not detract from the film's many positive features.Alice White Anny Ondra voice dubbed by Joan Barry goes out for the evening with her boyfriend who is a police detective John Longden.  When they have a series of minor quarrels Alice decides to go her own way and meets an artist friend.  The artist's intentions are obvious but Alice is innocently unaware.  When he brings her to his studio there is soon an unpleasant confrontation that sets in motion a turbulent series of events.The story is carefully constructed not just to produce suspense but also to raise interesting questions in the viewer's mind.  Alice feels a terrible sense of guilt and fear over what has happened  communicated to the viewer in a variety of creative ways  but of what is she really guilty?  The behavior of the detective boyfriend is partly wellintentioned but he certainly is not faultless.  The moral ambiguity is often subtle because it takes a back seat to the suspense and it takes a couple of viewings to appreciate all that is going on.There is a particularly nice symmetry to the beginning and ending pointing to the greater significance of the action in between.  The opening sequence filmed in silent movie style shows the detective and his partner dealing with a suspect in a routine way not caring about him as a person.  In the final scenes when the detective must help Alice make a final report on everything that has happened he sees his job in a far different perspective.Blackmail is of the darker type of Hitchcock like Notorious or Vertigo.  While clearly made in a different era it has the same kind of depth and craftsmanship that distinguished those later more wellknown masterpieces.".

	schema:reviewBody "....knife....knife...knife....etc. this is probably the most celebrated line of dialog from early Hitchcock.  In 1929 Alfred Hitchcock was halfway thru production of Blackmail a silent film when the studio told him to remake the film at once as a talkie.  He did and it became the first films to boldly experiment with the art of talking pictures.The plot is so simple it's almost boring a detective and his girlfriend Alice argue during a dinner date and go separate ways.  She goes off with an artist to his loft where he tries to rape her.  In self defense she stabs the artist to death.  A local neerdowell Donald Calthrop in a fine sleazy performance! goes to blackmail her and her cop boyfriend.  The police accidently blame the blackmailer for the murder. After a chase thru the British Museum the blackmailer falls to his death. The police close the case and the girl and her boyfriend have to live the feelings of guilt. Blackmail abounds with the Hitchcock touch.  It begins with a silent detailed study of a typical arrest letting us know Scotland Yard is a fearful force not to be messed with.  When Alice leaves the artist's corpse in his loft the streets are filled with gruesome reminders of the crime. In her eyes a neon advertisment showing a cocktail shaker becomes a hand holding a dagger whenever anyone extends a hand in the street it reminds her of her victim's extended dead hand and there's the most famous scene from this film a neighbor gabs on and on about the murder repeating the word knife.  Hitchcock had the entire gabbing reduced to a low mutter except for the oft repeated word knife which is made louder. The chase thru the British Museum seems to be an early rehearsal for all the other Hitchcock films where somebody is chased thru a famous landmark. Blackmail is credited as the first British talkie.  It solidified for the then 30 year old Alfred Hitchcock that thrillers were his territory.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's an art film by todays standards. But it's also classic Hitchcock. Not only does it build suspense which for a film of this time seems hard to do through the typical camera distance and theatrical acting which this film has plenty of but still Hitchcock does it and does it well. It begins as a silent film as we watch an arrest take place. This arrest feels out of place because it doesn't tie into the story. But it leads into an atmosphere of conviction and guilt. This is the films opening. The first dialogue scene occurs in a stylized way by todays standards as we follow two detectives walking one Frank Webber as they joke around. There are many shots where the camera sits static displaying a nice composition as action happens dialogue and story unfold. And in between these shots are shots of faces reacting which incites more psychological participation in the viewer a very Hitchcock device. The characters feelings uneasiness a general tension become more subjective not just something we figure we are suppose to get. We actually feel it. Actually I was very surprised to hear Blackmail is from 1929. Sure it has many technical errors jump cuts sounds glitches and lighting changes overplayed acting yet all this aside the story progresses very realistically and sadistically on the part of the guilty lead actress and her mate which in the end feels all very current. I figured this film was from the late 30's if not 40's. The film ends with a kind of uneasiness as we are left with two guilty characters more so the female lead who we can imagine will have trouble coping with her conscience. And that is the irony because after all they are free and convicted of nothing. But in this case free to dwell in their quiet guilt seems a very harsh punishment filled with more suffering than any jail could provide. In all a great film to see.".

	schema:headline " Not a disappointment at all";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen most of Alfred Hitchcock's films silent and talking and was saving this one for a special occasion. It was really quite good and although overrated despite being cited so often along with Mamoulian's Applause as a successful example of the transition between the silents and talkies in all the references I've consulted it still has some distinct good qualities of its own. Annie Ondra is an excellent silent actress and this among several other films proves it. Her accent was very strong of course and employing Joan Barry to lipsynch was genial. Francois Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock about working with Ms Ondra were enough to stimulate anyone's appetite to see her and to hear Joan Barry at work. The music  at least in the beginning  is excessively burdensome and busy and frankly irritating. However when the characters finally began dialogue it calmed down considerably and actually worked out well until the ending. We're seeing a hybrid here a talkie and a parttalkie. When the talking itself finally happens the characters aren't even facing the camera but are photographed from behind! This is the famous Hitchcock we know and love in the heat of action. The view of the staircase is very Hitchockian as in Vertigo or Psycho as well as the chase in a public monument North by Northwest comes to mind. Yes the director made the move to talking pictures quite fluently and fluidly. One should keep in mind too that the film had already been completed as a silent before being converted into a talkie! All the more to admire...Curtis Stotlar".

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen most of Alfred Hitchcock's films silent and talking and was saving this one for a special occasion. It was really quite good and although overrated despite being cited so often along with Mamoulian's Applause as a successful example of the transition between the silents and talkies in all the references I've consulted it still has some distinct good qualities of its own. Annie Ondra is an excellent silent actress and this among several other films proves it. Her accent was very strong of course and employing Joan Barry to lipsynch was genial. Francois Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock about working with Ms Ondra were enough to stimulate anyone's appetite to see her and to hear Joan Barry at work. The music  at least in the beginning  is excessively burdensome and busy and frankly irritating.

	schema:reviewBody "It's not the crime itself but the coverup that entraps two lovers in this cleverly sinewy suspense film shot by Alfred Hitchcock early in his career.How early? Apparently the sound era arrives about ten minutes in as the opening reel is shot entirely as a silent movie minus quote cards before switching to audible dialogue. Yet like many seemingly creaky elements of Blackmail this is something that actually works to the film's benefit and gives it a stylistic uniqueness that helps it stand out today.Alice Anny Ondra steps out on her police detective boyfriend Frank John Longden to have fun with an artist she fancies named Crewe Cyril Ritchard. A crime is committed instead and she finds herself back in Frank's arms seeking his protection. Unfortunately for both of them a sponger lowlife named Tracy Donald Calthrop knows what's doing and pressures the pair for his silence.To really appreciate Blackmail's skewed perspective it's important to understand Hitchcock's complex view of the law. By all accounts a lawabiding socially upright man he nevertheless nursed an extreme dread of John Law dating back to a childhood episode when he was locked in a cell to be taught a lesson. As a director Hitchcock presented authority figures as vaguely menacing while reserving his greatest sympathy for outsiders who found themselves rightly or wrongly on the run.The first image of Blackmail is the spinning tire of a police quickresponse van or is it a roulette wheel? The capricious nature of law enforcement is always on view whether it's a bobby sauntering outside an apartment window while Alice screams for help inside or Frank using his authority to subvert a murder investigation.This is the rare Hitchcock film that features fine acting bottomtotop but Calthrop stands out best as Tracy the personification of the core ambiguity of this film. Described as kind of mousy given to smirking while pleading for help and whistling when he thinks he has the upper hand Tracy seems easy to hate at first glance but isn't not as Calthrop imbues him with a vulnerability anyone can relate to cutting across the staginess around him with a dynamic performance that anticipates how cinema liberated the actor from hidebound stagecraft.One's got to live you know! he says but the people he says this to act as if this is yet another of Tracy's unreasonable demands. We end the film pulling for him with as much passion as we pulled away from him at first encounter.Subtle directorial touches abound like Alice holds her face in an expression we see mirrored in a cutto scene of Tracy fleeing through the British Museum while an impassive giant mask looks on. There's also clever use of the new sound medium the knife one's not subtle but a lot of fun and knowing humor like a conversation about a new crime film. Frank being from Scotland Yard scoffs at such fiction but Alice thinks it has merit I heard they got a real criminal to direct it just to be on the safe side.About the only negatives are the static compositions and bad audio problems of the period and not of the film. Blackmail even has a terrific final shot which Hitchcock never topped until his final film Family Plot. It's another rueful note on the hitormiss quality of law enforcement one that stays with you after the laughter fades.".

The whole story after all hinges on an implicit assumption  if she had not killed the rapist and had the rape become known the society in which she lives would have held her accountable for the rape  the crime for which the victim rather than the perpetrator was considered guilty and still is unfortunately in many regions. This is of course the real reason she covers up the killing since she has good reason to believe the authorities would not recognize a claim of selfdefense against rape and she would be held doubly responsible  for 'enticing' the man then killing him for acting out his 'understandable' sexual urges that she 'aroused.'So she remains in a state of unredeemable guilt  guilty of murder guilty of having been the victim of rape guilty of having been too beautiful guilty of loving a man who could at any time betray her  indeed guilty of being innocent. Guilty in short  of being a woman.While Hitchcock's filmmaking savvy is everywhere in evidence and the pace is fairly swift this is one of the master's heaviest darkest most depressing films.

There are scenes where people are speaking to each other though no word screens appear and this viewer was left wondering if the description on the slip cover of my DVD was in error. However after reading other reviews of the film it now makes sense that the film was originally commissioned as a silent but was then given the go ahead as a talkie. Elements of the silent film style abound and not just in the opening scenes. Prominent are the full screen facial closeups of the principal characters and the wide eyed demureness of leading lady Anny Ondra.Ondra portrays Alice White daughter of a shopkeeper and keeping company with Detective Frank Webber John Longden. An admiring artist who's hand written note requests her presence at a local restaurant leaves Alice searching for ways to break off her date with Frank. I was rather amused by Crewe's Cyril Ritchard attempt to entice Alice with his etchings I always thought that was a lame pick up line and here it's being used in 1929.What begins innocently enough quickly spirals into disaster as Alice must fend off Crewe's advances and with a knife at arm's reach her defense causes Crewe's death. Shades of Psycho the scene is conveyed off screen as an earlier silhouette shows the couple struggling wildly. That's only one of the Hitchcockian conventions used here there's also the repeated use of a long stairway it's downward view a precursor to what we'll see again in Vertigo. Getting back to the knife though perhaps it might have been too shocking for film audiences to accept back then but after the struggle Alice clearly displays the weapon which has no blood on it! Also she was wearing only a light colored slip and there was no indication of a struggle or bloodstains to add grimace to the proceedings.Donald Calthrop is convincing as the blackmailing schemer Tracy whose bold plan is to extort both Alice and Frank who has been put on the case. The detective already knows who the killer is his conflicted willingness to help Alice receives an unwitting boost when Tracy is fingered as a possible suspect in the artist's death. Taken into custody by Scotland Yard one has to do a double take when the police van has to make a stop and Tracy simply gets out and runs away! He receives his due though as he meets his end falling through a skylight at the British Museum.Loose ended plot points notwithstanding I found Blackmail to be an intriguing film and a worthwhile effort from Alfred Hitchcock. It's not well known and that's unfortunate as this early look at his directing style is peppered with elements for which he would later become famous not the least of which is Hitchcock's own cameo on a train in the early part of the story. It's also educational for example I learned that in England a police lineup is called an Identification Parade!".

A wonderfully mobile camera perhaps imitating similar shots in 'Seventh Heaven' 1927 Borzage or 'The Cameraman 1928 Sedgwick' follows the characters up a double flight of stairs. A disorientating highangle shot of the heroine descending a spiral stairway is uncannily similar to the belltower shots in 'Vertigo 1958.'The film's plot concerns Alice Anny Ondra who is cheating on her detective boyfriend Frank John Longden with a sleazy artist Cyril Ritchard. During a struggle in which the artist tries to rape her Alice sticks a kitchen knife into him and flees the scene of the murder. Frank finds the evidence linking her to the crime and is determined to cover it up but the situation is complicated by a twobit criminal Donald Calthrop who knows what's up and sees dollar signs. Everyone in the film is convincing particularly Calthrop as the shifty blackmailer who you wouldn't trust as far as you could throw him. The ending too is a welcome break from the Production Codeenforced contrivances that would later overwhelm Hollywood. Alice escapes all culpability for her crimes but the accusative laughing face of a painted jester suggests that the crime will always prey on her thoughts.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was Hitchcock's  and the British film industry's  first fulllength sound feature. While his earlier silent picture The Lodger is most often cited as the first example of what came to be known as Hitchcockian Blackmail really looks like the first time he consolidated his style and knew exactly what he wanted to achieve.Blackmail is not literally alltalking  the first six or seven minutes are made up of an introductory silent sequence in which a criminal is hunted down and this is in fact very well done utilising all the techniques of tension and visual attentiongrabbing that Hitch had perfected in his halfdozen or so preceding silent pictures. In fact it would become a semiregular feature throughout the rest of Hitch's career to begin with a little dialoguefree sequence to set the scene  for example the lengthy camera pans at the start of Rear Window 1954 which introduce all the other apartments and provide Jimmy Stewart's character's backstory.Blackmail is noted for its creative use of sound although perhaps it was circumstance more than anything else which encouraged Hitchcock to be experimental. The production was begun as a silent but Hitch suspected it would later be upgraded to a talkie so he began by shooting around the dialogue scenes and shot a few with the actors backs to the camera so their voices could be dubbed in later. Also Anny Ondra's thick accent meant she had to mime to Joan Barry who was reading her lines off set. All this must have given Hitchcock ideas for expressive sound design and offscreen sounds using sound as a technique in itself rather than as a whole new format.It was probably with this film  and his next talkie Murder!  that Hitchcock realised that crime and suspense were his forte. He appears to be having great fun building up the suspense and stringing out tense situations as far as they will go. It's one of the earliest Hitchcock pictures to really delve into a character's guilt and paranoia. Also very clear is the grisly delight he takes the subject matter. Typical Hitchcockian characters crop up for the first time. There is the sleazy blackmailer who is not appalled by the crime he has witnessed but simply sees it as a chance to profit. Then there's the murderobsessed gossip who seems to be a notsodistant relative of Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn in Shadow of a Doubt 1943 or the housekeeper from Rear Window.Even more perverse than all this gallows humour is Hitchcock's linking of sex and murder in that first pivotal scene which really shows off the Hitchcock psychology. Crewe plays an elaborate game in order to get to see Alice in her underwear  but the way Hitchcock has placed the camera the audience can see her all along! At the end of this scene in her distraught state Alice still goes behind the screen to get changed even though she is now alone but Hitchcock makes a mockery of her idea of privacy by placing the camera on her side of the screen. As well as being one of the most telling example of Hitchcock's disrespectful attitude towards his female victims it hammers home perhaps the most fundamental idea in his approach to filmmaking  that there are three players involved here  the killer the victim and the audience.The story builds up to a tense and satisfying finale which established yet another Hitchcock first  a chase scene featuring a famous landmark in this case the British museum  an idea suggested by the future director Michael Powell. Although it wouldn't be applied to him for some years yet this is perhaps the first film where Hitchcock could have earned his nickname The Master of Suspense. Blackmail does suffer from some of the problems of an early talkie in particular the dialogue scenes are stilted and longwinded. Overall though it's a good solid effort a significant Hitchcock and a promise of greater things to come.".

Crewe plays an elaborate game in order to get to see Alice in her underwear  but the way Hitchcock has placed the camera the audience can see her all along! At the end of this scene in her distraught state Alice still goes behind the screen to get changed even though she is now alone but Hitchcock makes a mockery of her idea of privacy by placing the camera on her side of the screen. As well as being one of the most telling example of Hitchcock's disrespectful attitude towards his female victims it hammers home perhaps the most fundamental idea in his approach to filmmaking  that there are three players involved here  the killer the victim and the audience.The story builds up to a tense and satisfying finale which established yet another Hitchcock first  a chase scene featuring a famous landmark in this case the British museum  an idea suggested by the future director Michael Powell. Although it wouldn't be applied to him for some years yet this is perhaps the first film where Hitchcock could have earned his nickname The Master of Suspense. Blackmail does suffer from some of the problems of an early talkie in particular the dialogue scenes are stilted and longwinded. Overall though it's a good solid effort a significant Hitchcock and a promise of greater things to come.";

For 1929 Hitchcock shows the world with the film that he's a talented film maker. A risky scene the audience gets to watch the main actress of the film undress behind her curtains. While the murder is never seen the provocative and private scene of her undressing is present. Another interesting note the main character of the film is the murderer! Throughout the film the audience judges whether or not she is an innocent murderer or a killer.

However recently I bought a DVD of 18 of his British films. Among them is Blackmail from 1929.Blackmail may have a few flaws. Oddly enough the first few minutes are silent which confused me since it was supposed to be sound. Lips move but there's nothing to be heard until later. Still it doesn't do that much damage to the plot in which our heroine Alice kills a wouldbe rapist in selfdefence. She then tries to cover it up although today that would seem needless another reviewer writes this reflects the bad old days when the attitude was to blame the victim.Either way she's traumatized by the incident as many girls today would be. This is depicted well and she's a sympathetic character. A sleazy guy attempts to blackmail her and her detective boyfriend thus giving the movie its title. One of the more interesting things about this is that little is going on sometimes long pauses a guy buying and then smoking a cigar a family dinner but we can still see the drama unfolding underneath. Hitchcock may have entered his golden age in the '40s and '50s but this is definitely a watchable early effort.".

Afterwards a criminal who pieces it together blackmails her and her detective boyfriend.A little creaky but that's to be expected under the circumstances. The film started out being made as a silent before it was decided to turn it into a sound picture. In spots it reverts back to a silent without intertitles. This actually works in the film's favor. There are some really nicely done lengthy sequences with no dialogue such as her walk home after she's killed the guy punctuated by a scream. Good acting all around. Nice direction from Hitch. The museum climax is excellent an early example of the defining set pieces that would become a Hitchcock trademark. Definitely worth a look if you're a fan.

Alice did her best to cover up the crime and of course Frank is the one investigating the murder and he is shocked to find the only piece of incriminating evidence one of his girlfriend's gloves which he hides from the other detectives. He goes to Alice to tell her what he knows about this situation but they are interrupted by the appearance of petty thief Tracy Donald Calthrop who saw her at the artist's flat the night of the murder. The crook is blackmailing them to give him some cash otherwise he will go to the police and tell them both the identity of the murder and the information Frank is hiding. Of course things go the opposite direction for Tracy when he is chosen as the key suspect for the murder and being chased by the police through the British Museum he falls to his death through a glass window to the ground. Alice is suffering in her mind thinking about what she has done and almost being pressured to tell the truth and she does go to Scotland Yard to confess but Frank escorts her out and that is when the film ends.

You can tell in many moments that this film started out as silent including the dubbing of actress Ondra and the moments without sound effects or dialogue but it actually works to some effect for the better. Of course the sound use is very stylised as well I was particularly impressed with the torturous repetition of the word knife and there are some good gripping moments so it's certainly a worthwhile classic thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "Britain's first talkie the 1929 Blackmail is directed by Alfred Hitchock and even back then it has many of his touches. The stars are Anny Ondra Cyril Ritchard John Longden and Sara Allgood.A young woman Ondra twotimes her Scotland Yard inspector boyfriend Longden and goes out with an artist Ritchard. Things get rough in his apartment and he forces himself on her. She kills him a la Dial M for Murder. Her boyfriend finds her glove in the apartment and realizes she did it the other glove was found by a criminal hanging around the artist's apartment building and he decides to blackmail the inspector.Hitchcock more than appears in this film he has a bit with a little boy on a subway. The film is strange in that the beginning is silent with no title cards. Then suddenly there is sound. It moves quite slowly with not much in the way of action. The story builds slowly and the scene in the artist's apartment is quite long before anything happens.Nevertheless the Hitchcock touches are there.

	onyx:emotionText "Britain's first talkie the 1929 Blackmail is directed by Alfred Hitchock and even back then it has many of his touches. The stars are Anny Ondra Cyril Ritchard John Longden and Sara Allgood.A young woman Ondra twotimes her Scotland Yard inspector boyfriend Longden and goes out with an artist Ritchard. Things get rough in his apartment and he forces himself on her. She kills him a la Dial M for Murder. Her boyfriend finds her glove in the apartment and realizes she did it the other glove was found by a criminal hanging around the artist's apartment building and he decides to blackmail the inspector.Hitchcock more than appears in this film he has a bit with a little boy on a subway. The film is strange in that the beginning is silent with no title cards. Then suddenly there is sound. It moves quite slowly with not much in the way of action. The story builds slowly and the scene in the artist's apartment is quite long before anything happens.Nevertheless the Hitchcock touches are there. A pivotal scene happens at the British Museum  Hitchcock's upheaval in familiar places. And in the jail scene there's a sound the director often described as being terrifying in his childhood when his father had the local police teach him a lesson  the jail door closing.The very pretty Ondra wife of boxer Max Schmelling is dubbed here.

Now of course who is assigned the case? None other than detective Webber! Of course things get well let?s say more than just a little complicated when seedy blackmailer gets involved claiming that he had seen Alice enter the artists quarters.One of the major issues in the works of Alfred Hitchcock is the disparity between appearance and reality. For example judgments about what one might consider true and good and the prestige accorded to authorities. One of the clearest examples of this theme is that the figures of law and order are themselves eminently corruptible. I?m not going to spoil what detective Webber does but lets just say appearances must not be confused with what's really happening.Blackmail is a film full of dynamic and inventive imagery The most talked about sequence from this film is probably the breakfast on the morning after the murder. A scene in which Alice is asked to cut the bread she picks up the knife while her neighbor babbles on about the murder using the word ? knife? all the time. The neighbors words become softer and softer but the word knife? stays loud so when Alice hears knifethe knife jumps out of her hand! And quite typical of Hitchcock Alice's father replies Ere!

	schema:reviewBody "In my perverse desire to see every film in the bottom 100 I thought I could not go far wrong with a rental of this classic POS. Mariah Carey's first and so far only feature film is an example of how the combined MPAA and RIAA attempts to shovel garbage at us are starting to backfire. Sales of Mariah's recordings once one of the highlights of an otherwise dreary RIAA mainstream catalogue have slumped. It's all because of this film. Don't let the blind Mariah fans fool you  it is just as bad as critics say and deserving of its bottom 100 status.Where to begin when pulling apart this cinematic abortion? For me the first major problem was the cinematography. If the viewer is not clued in on the fact that Vondie CurtisHall has only directed television before this film as it starts the flat DaysOfOurLivesstyle shots will soon make it clear enough. Directors who put one or two actors three tops in a 2.351 frame are a dime a dozen. On the other hand directors who cannot even differentiate these actors' spacing from the camera truly stand out and not in a good way.The story has been described as being syrupy enough to kill anyone who suffers from diabetes or doesn't and I am not going to contest that. It's a variation upon the classic rags to riches theme specifically tailored towards Mariah. Mariah essentially plays herself in the guise of a young vocalist who starts singing backup for a considerably less talented vocalist. As she crosses the paths of more people eventually said people twig to the fact that she can vocalise with the best of them. One DJ eventually picks her up manages her through a record deal and promises her that one day she will play in Madison Square Garden or something along those lines.This kind of story has been done before with such reallife examples as the Jacksons providing source material for one excellent miniseries of the theme. The problem here is that we've heard this story a million times before. Another significant problem is that while Mariah has a voice many would kill for there is absolutely nothing that stands out even slightly about her material. As an old girlfriend of mine once said the longer it takes the RIAA to twig to the fact that being female doesn't mandate wanting to hear this formulaic ballad crap the more business they are going to lose to independents who support bands like Opera IX. I think the fact that Mariah's last album disappeared without trace in spite of having millions of dollars spent on its promotion proves her right.Mariah's story is also incredibly bland to say the least. So her junkie mother gave her up when she was young. Oh boo hoo. It happens and you're probably better off for it get over it already. The previouslymentioned Jacksons could run rings around the likes of Mariah Carey for sob stories and their reluctance to deal with the media at large is a telling thing. So in the end we are simply left with another example of the mainstream trying to seem alternative and failing.I gave Glitter a one out of ten. I don't think I am being too harsh. I think it is so amazingly bad that it becomes comedic at least on the first viewing. I suspect that repeated viewings will simply become boring.".

Unlike the similarlypanned Showgirls Glitter doesn't go far enough over the top to be of any interest and it takes itself way too seriously. Showgirls made me feel giddy while I was watching it. Glitter made me feel as if I had been poisoned.What an unfortunate misstep for star Mariah Carey who gets sucked up into the vacuum of this movie like a dust bunny under the Hoover. It's not that Mariah is terrible exactly. She doesn't seem like much of an actress and she definitely doesn't have much screen presence. But the real problem is that she doesn't really do much except smile sing and look pretty. She simply exists. Perhaps since Glitter is touted as a semiautobiographical film like Purple Rain the producers thought being Mariah Carey would be enough to carry the film. Her role is shallow and onedimensional despite the fact that the script tries to give her some depth by piling on the ageold wayward childhood clich. The problem is we've seen all of this so often that it's very silly.It only gets worse as the movie progresses. After Mariah's character Billie grows up she meets an obnoxious club DJ who much to our horror turns out to be the movie's other main character. Carey and her costar Max Beesley have next to zero screen chemistry but for some reasons she falls in love with him.The director throws in a bunch of gimmicky techniques like speeding up the film as well as a hilariously awful cut that goes from Mariah's face to fireworks exploding. There is also a laughoutloud moment where the actress who plays the young Billie Frank joins her mother onstage and when she opens her mouth to sing it is Mariah Carey's voice that comes out of herpitched up until she sounds a little like Minnie Mouse. No wonder Mariah collapsed after this was released.There are some absurd and awful moments in the film that have nothing to do with Mariah most notably her two obnoxious friends who are directed as complete caricatures and seem to be intended for some sort of comic relief there's plenty of that in other places all of it unintentional.Beesley is supposed to be a bigtime club DJ yet he plays more like a kid at a highschool dance. The role is all wrong for him. For some inexplicable reason the film is set in the early 80s yet more often than not it looks suspiciously like the early 00's especially the furniture. The dialog is unmemorable and nobody has any real acting to do in this film except for one or two emotional moments. The drama is uninvolving and it doesn't really spiral out of control until the conclusion of the movie where it soars so far into the absurd that we finally get some good bad movie stuff a big fight a beating a murder a campy moment of triumph onstage. It's too little too late though.The one thing that Glitter manages to carry off is a clich but somewhat engaging scene where Billie finally meets up her longlost mother. Unfortunately it is the final scene of the movie and the camera sails right up into the sky just when we get to the one moment in the film that works.".

Not great but not terrible. I think the greatest flaw in the film that there has not been that was not enough time dedicated to explaining certain aspects of Billie's emotions. There should have been more about her father and how that reflected her relationship with Dice. But when it comes to plot it is fairly predictable but there is a reason why there are so many films that share this plot line about fame A Star Is Born Dreamgirls etc. it is a part of fame. The main problem is the script without a good script the true potential for acting is limited. Now when it comes to the acting I'll admit it is not great but no means it is terrible. Terrible acting is Jessica Simpson in The Dukes of Hazzard and Blonde Ambition. I think it is time for people to stop treating this film as if it is the worst film to grace the screen there are far worse films and this film while not the greatest should get the benefit of a doubt.".

The only element of this movie that satisfies my sobadit'sgood criteria is the character of Mariah's boyfriend.

Now I'm not saying that this review is completely unbiased after all I'd been brought up on a healthy diet of Mariah Carey but I did rent this movie a few weeks ago it being not released to cinema due to pure curiosity.The multioctave songbird's film vehicle originally titled 'All That Glitters... a much better name I think opens with in the early 1960's in an allblack bar with a woman Valarie Pettiford singing a jazzblues number before introducing her young daughter Billie Frank Isobel Gomes to the semiinterested audience and the two launch into a duet which wows the crowd. Cut to the next few shots where Billie's mother tries to get money from Billie's father before giving her up to an adoption agency.Fastfoward to the bright and bouncy 1980's where allgrownup Billie the aforementioned Carey is dancing in a club with her two best friends Louise and Roxy Da Brat and Tia Texada who are soon offered as backup singing gig for notalent goodlooking upandcomer Sylk. Needing the money the 3 take the job and the producer finds Mariah's... er... Billie's voice completely spellbinding  and chooses to use her voice instead of the Godawful voice that the main singer is belting out.A recording of a song entitled All My Life is handed to a Club DJ  DJ Dice to be exact British actor Max Beesley who puts on a 'wigga' accent  sometimes really good other times really bad who plays it and instantly falls in love with the vocals. Upon discovering that the vocal used is in fact Billie's he instantly wants to be her producer of course her beautiful looks have nothing to do with it!. So makes a deal with her old producer Timothy Terrence Howard to take the gorgeous Billie and her backup singing loudmouthed friends and take them under his wing  for the reasonable ! price of ONLY 100000! So the Dice  Billie end up becoming good friends and record a song I Didn't Mean To Turn You On and it is played for music executives and before you can change the butt groove in your seat Billie is signed to a major record label.Of course the road to musical superstardom is not an easy one and Billie has several troubles  the video director for her first single Loverboy wants her to parade around in nothing but a piece of string Billie minds Mariah wouldn't and there's also the little problem of her undeniable attraction to Dice. The two become an item and she even moves into Dice's modern typically New York apartment. Billie's first single unsurprisingly tops the U.S. chart  for ten weeks at which point the record company are eager to release her first album which they want full control over  ping off both Billie and Dice.Our starcrossed 80's lovers start fighting as her career begins to blossom. She's invited to all the right parties and invited to guest on all the right talk shows  a dream she's had for many years but amist all of the amazing goingson her two best friends are seeing less and less of her and Dice is becoming a drag  she even has to bail him out of jail before an appearance on a show. The two have a massive fight leading Billie to move out and Girl Powerly slap his face. Her attempts at tracking down her addicted biological mother fail as the adoption agency have lost contact with her. Also during this time she records a single with pop singer Rafael Halle Berry's musician hubby Eric Bent. The duet titled Want You is another number one for Billie and her biggest dream is about to come true  she's about to play at Madison Square Garden.The day of the concert arrives and Billie returns to Dice's apartment to find him not there. Unfortunately Billie's day won't exactly go as planned  it seems achieving your dreams sometimes means that you'll lose the ones you love. And with that I won't go into the final minutes' in detail but I'll just say that is very emotional.So that's the story but were the performances any good? Well yes and no. Mariah Carey although despite what you've no doubt heard is a promising actress. Her acting isn't brilliant yet  there are times when you feel she goes overboard especially in the emotional bits. I've found that her most convincing scenes and therefore best ones are where she gets angry. Her stereotypical best friends are good too and add a needed comical element. Beesley as DJ Dice is good although he sometimes seems very fake. Anyone else worth noticing is probably OK.The soundtrack is brilliant. Carey's 9th studio album is a poprb LP with great recordings. From the pumping 80's tracks Last Night A DJ Saved My Life Didn't Mean To Turn You On All My Life to the gorgeous Mariahlike ballads Lead The Way Reflections and especially Never Too Far plus the Eric duet 'Want You' and the Ja Rule infected 'If We'  it's just as good as her previous efforts.Overall 'Glitter' IS a film that the troubled songbird should be proud of. It is a drama though  and watch that don't think it'll be laughaminute. It's emotional passionate and with Carey in the lead  it's one rollercoaster ride you'll like at the time and will leave you wanting more. Recommended definetely... Go Mariah!".

Now I'm not saying that this review is completely unbiased after all I'd been brought up on a healthy diet of Mariah Carey but I did rent this movie a few weeks ago it being not released to cinema due to pure curiosity.The multioctave songbird's film vehicle originally titled 'All That Glitters... a much better name I think opens with in the early 1960's in an allblack bar with a woman Valarie Pettiford singing a jazzblues number before introducing her young daughter Billie Frank Isobel Gomes to the semiinterested audience and the two launch into a duet which wows the crowd.

Given nothing but a bareboned outline of a plot to work with Ms. Carey explodes across the screen with a depth and complexity of character unseen since Vivian Leigh's multifaceted Scarlet O'Hara in Gone with the Wind back in 1939. Every colour of the rainbow and some even out of the range of the known colour scheme are clearly and sharply delineated by Mariah in every frame of this masterpiece every subtle shade and nuance of Billie Frank is drawn with precision sharpness and crystal clarity.  It is said that the ultimate sign of true artistry in film is when one can look at any single frame of a motion picture and instantly know what is going on just from the facial expressions and body language of the actors within.  Glitter certainly exemplifies this theory.  At any given moment one can look at Mariah's Billie Frank and instantly see every idiosyncrasy of the woman inside.  The relationships she has with and her feelings towards every character she interacts with in the film is beautifully fleshedout and drawn with a broad brush.  Each and every word Mariah speaks in Glitter was meticulously delivered by her and obviously carefully studied during perusal of the script.     Mariah delivers infinitely more than the onedimensional Billie other reviews have led us to expect.  Her transitions from despondency to loneliness to anger to triumph...all brought forth with a crispness and clarity unknown to this age of the cinematic experience.  And the ease with which she presents all these ranges of emotion draws you into the character of Billie to the point where you hang breathlessly on Mariah's next word. She has such a natural talent such an incredible comfort in front of the camera that you instantly forget you are watching an actress playing Billie you believe she really is Billie.    This can only be the smallest taste of what is to come from this future screen legend.  Mariah has made her mark on the film industry and now can and must move on to deeper more complex roles...she must rightfully stake her claim as one of the greatest screen presences in cinema history.  How marvelous it would be to see her take on some of the great female characters of literary classics so in vogue today.  A Jane Eyre for example or Lizzy in Pride and Prejudice.  Many of Shakespeare's greatest works have remained uncommitted to celluloid what greater compliment to the works of the master himself than to have them graced by Mariah Carey?     Please do yourself a favour you must see this movie and see it with an open mind.  Those who scoff are simply those who had already decided that Mariah would be a failure in the crossover from music to film.  They cannot admit they were wrong for unlike Barbra Streisand and Madonna before her embarrassments both Mariah Carey is a fabulous fantastic brilliant actress.  Again look at everything she was able to do with this meagre script!!!       Mariah Carey is the most stunningly beautiful breathtaking sexy sensuous heartstopping woman ever to appear on the stage or screen.  So many times during this movie I realized that I was so captivated by her beauty that I wasn't even breathing my heart was pounding so fiercely at the sight of her I though it would burst.       Believe me Mariah...keep acting...keep singing...you will always be remembered as a priceless legend.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstlet me start by confessing something I freely admit. I am 100 a fan of Mariah Carey....as a singer. It's almost like what the girls in the '60s probably had when they looked at the Beatles. Whenever she's on TV or I listen to her musicI just naturally feel good. Howeverwhen it comes to Glitteryes Ilike mostwas really let down. I wont even go into the plot since it's a moot point at this time. 5 years or 100 will not change or make this film any better. Even though I'm a fanI'm not so one sided in thought that I'd just accept it all. This film was a mistake from the beginning. Even the soundtrack is not all that as they say. Although I do like the song Never Too Far  Loverboy . That's why I gave 2 stars.I heard about this film going into production back in 1998. Nowwhen a film takes nearly 3 years to makethat's the very first warning sign that it's not going to work. Not to mention some publicized production problems I read about. Mariah herself stated recently on Oprah that she just wasn't good at saying no during the dizzying pace of her career in the 90's. I'm sure this was just something she contractually said yes to and moved on. Thenas happens with all superstars I hate that term the low came after 11 years of riding high. There wasn't anything wrong with her musicshe'd just been working too hardtoo long and that's what led to this embarrassing moment and the one in 2002 on Total Request Live aka TRL. She has of course rebounded from all thisher songWe Belong Together spent 14 weeks at 1 last summer and the CD Emancipation of Mimi has sold millions. She can now do what she wants at her own pace. In closingtoday is March 27th. Happy birthday Mariahas far as I'm concerned you at least deserve one review that isn't filled with venom. Keep on singing. END".

	onyx:emotionText "Firstlet me start by confessing something I freely admit. I am 100 a fan of Mariah Carey....as a singer. It's almost like what the girls in the '60s probably had when they looked at the Beatles. Whenever she's on TV or I listen to her musicI just naturally feel good. Howeverwhen it comes to Glitteryes Ilike mostwas really let down. I wont even go into the plot since it's a moot point at this time. 5 years or 100 will not change or make this film any better. Even though I'm a fanI'm not so one sided in thought that I'd just accept it all. This film was a mistake from the beginning. Even the soundtrack is not all that as they say. Although I do like the song Never Too Far  Loverboy . That's why I gave 2 stars.I heard about this film going into production back in 1998. Nowwhen a film takes nearly 3 years to makethat's the very first warning sign that it's not going to work. Not to mention some publicized production problems I read about. Mariah herself stated recently on Oprah that she just wasn't good at saying no during the dizzying pace of her career in the 90's. I'm sure this was just something she contractually said yes to and moved on. Thenas happens with all superstars I hate that term the low came after 11 years of riding high. There wasn't anything wrong with her musicshe'd just been working too hardtoo long and that's what led to this embarrassing moment and the one in 2002 on Total Request Live aka TRL. She has of course rebounded from all thisher songWe Belong Together spent 14 weeks at 1 last summer and the CD Emancipation of Mimi has sold millions. She can now do what she wants at her own pace. In closingtoday is March 27th. Happy birthday Mariahas far as I'm concerned you at least deserve one review that isn't filled with venom. Keep on singing. END";

That is literally the scene and actually probably doesn't even last twenty seconds. There is no extra dialogue or any other action  walk in you got the contract I'll drink to that scenes over.

The ability to connect emotionally with her songs also doesn't translate in the acting she looks stiff and bored throughout here.Unfortunately the songs here do nothing for her vocal talents either. She sings them very well indeed but there are far more memorable and emotionally powerful songs from her out there that also display her unique vocal gifts much more. They're not awful just bland. The rest of the acting is also poor with Max Beesley being equally lousy and not sounding sure what accent to pull off while with the characters Carey's is shallow onedimensional and very difficult to relate to which is a huge dividend considering the type of story it is and the rest are annoying caricatures a couple even irrelevant to the story.Even for a film set in the 80s 'Glitter' does much less than glitter and looks firmly stuck in the 80s. It looks gaudy and too much of the camera work is too gimmicky and amateurish.

	schema:reviewBody "Glitter 2001 out of 4Mariah Carey pretty much plays herself in the story of a poor girl who grew up without her parents only to work really hard and eventually make it to the top. GLITTER is considered one of the worst movies ever made. Is it? I really don't think so but at the same time there's no question that it's really bad but I think with a little common sense the thing could have worked. There are way too many problems going on here which could have been corrected and we can start with the screenplay. I'm guessing people just watched every risetofame story out there gathered all the clich moments and threw them into this. There's really nothing that happens here that the viewer won't see coming from a mile away and worse of all is that none of the clichs are even given little pinches of something fresh or original. Even worse is the fact that there's really no one here to root for. The Carey character is pretty bland boring and there's never a single second where we feel bad for her. I'm guess that Carey and company just figured since people knew it was based on her that we'd immediately have a connection with her. It doesn't work this way. You're still playing a character. You still need to bring some life to that character. The screenplay still needs to give that character something to do and the viewer something to feel for. Another major problem is that the new music here is just downright bad and it's certainly nothing you'll enjoy listening to. This here could have been corrected had the film just used Carey's previous hits but I guess they didn't want to pay the extra money that it would have cost to use them. Finally Carey herself is just downright awful here. No matter if she's happy sad angry and calm she has the exact same reaction all the time. She really doesn't bring this character to life and never is she believable in the part. When you can't get any form of emotion across it's hard to make an emotional story work. Max Beesley and Terrence Howard are both good in their roles but their talents are sadly wasted. GLITTER is a really bad movie but everything wrong with it could have easily been fixed. Sadly in the end the producers just took a cheap and easy fix and the viewers had to suffer for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen was known for many things action films fast cars motorcycles a charismatic presence on screen and off and his true tough guy' persona.  But with this film another description moves to the top of that list  Actor.  Anyone who doubts what a great actor McQueen was need only watch this film because his performance here as Jake Holman is simply as good as it gets.  The Sand Pebbles  directed by Robert Wise is the story of Holman a sailor assigned to the U.S. Gunboat San Pablo' stationed on the Yangtze River in China in 1926 the sailors aboard are known as sand pebbles'.  It's primary function is to patrol the river and thereby establish an American presence in China a country currently experiencing a period of political unrest and impending upheaval.  It's a new assignment for Holman and it suits him just fine his job is to keep the ship's engines up and running and because of the size of the ship he's the only engineer it's just Jake and his engine.  And that's the way he likes it.  Holman is a loner by nature and something of an iconoclast.  At one point when he is asked his opinion of American Foreign Policy and their presence in China he simply says I don't mess with it.  It's all lookseepidgin somethin' for the officers.'Eventually however Holman is nevertheless drawn into the conflict through a series of events that impact him beyond all personal resistance the most significant being when American lives are threatened throughout China and Holman and a landing party are sent ashore to protect and escort some missionaries back to the safety of the San Pablo.  But at the mission Holman discovers a way of life the likes of which he's never known and for the first time ever he realizes a sense of belonging.  And he likes it. For Holman however it may be too late the political turmoil throughout the country has put the lives of everyone at the mission in peril including a young missionary named Shirley Eckert Candice Bergen with whom Holman has made a connection he simply cannot dispel for in Shirley he discerns an innocence and a goodness that compels him and in which he finds a welcome sense of fulfillment.  So what began as a routine mission becomes a salient point in Holman's life and he is faced with the most important decision he's ever had to make.This is the one for which McQueen should have won an Oscar.  As Holman he demonstrates an emotional range and depth that runs the gamut from almost boyish naivete to a world weary veteran of life who has seen and heard it all.  Utterly convincing he can say more with a slight incline of his head a slow blink or shifting of his eyes than most actors could say with reams of dialogue at their disposal.  He communicates with so much more than words and there's meaning in everything he says and does he never wastes a line or a single moment.  What he does with this role is magnificent it's the definitive McQueen performance.  His Holman is the personification of the loner and in creating him he delivers something few actors could ever equal  He's tough convincing and charming all at the same time.  And he should've taken home The Statue for it.As Collins the Captain of the San Pablo Richard Crenna gives one of his finest performances as well and it cemented his transition from television actor to a career on the big screen.  After this there was no going back. His portrayal of the somber introspective Captain is riveting and in him you readily perceive Collins' sense of duty and honor as well as his overwhelming sense of futility and failure.  And the urgency with which he grasps his chance for redemption even in the face of insurmountable odds is entirely believable as it is consistent with the character he has created.The superlative supporting cast includes Richard Attenborough Frenchy Emmanuelle Arsan Maily Mako Pohan Larry Gates Jameson Charles Robinson Bordelles Simon Oakland Stawski Ford Rainey Harris Joe Turkel Bronson and Gavin MacLeod Crosley.  A powerful drama extremely well crafted and presented by Wise The Sand Pebbles' is a great and memorable film that will forever stand as the pinnacle of McQueen's successful career.  Jake Holman is a character you will never forget because there is something of him that wistful longing to belong perhaps in all of us.  A timeless classic among classics this is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and is by definition the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.".

A timeless classic among classics this is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time and is by definition the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am watching the DVD of The Sand Pebbles for the first time. I originally saw this film as a child during its theatrical run. Even though I have watched the PS VHS tape many times the DVD takes me back to that unforgettable first viewing so many years ago. This film is the definitive example of how pan and scan laughably called fullscreen is nothing less than a desecration of the work of those who make movies. Thank goodness there is finally a faithful transfer of this unforgettable story.I love movies some much more than others. Even in the films that I love the most the ones I consider the best I can always find flaws or weaknesses. I can not find a single thing to criticize in The Sand Pebbles. The cinematography as many others have noted is exceptional. The detail of the sets the ship the costumes the panoramic vistas all are very convincing. As Crenna points out in the DVD commentary there is no visual trickery everything on the screen is real and threedimensional. I have not read the source novel and I am woefully ignorant of the political realities in China in this period although I understand that the book was based on real incidents. The fact is the story told here is compelling and it does not matter to me how true to history it is the world depicted in The Sand Pebbles is real and believable. Robert Anderson's script provides sufficient grounding in the political events to keep the audience engaged without becoming all awkward exposition or political treatise. Of course the characters express certain strong views and therein the conflict arises.Robert Wise is a firstrank director West Side Story The Haunting The Sound of Music and his work here is superlative. This film is a blend of epicscale scenes and intimate poignant moments of emotional realism. The camera placement the use of extras and props the blocking of the actors the use of natural light the tracking shots of the boat all are in service of the story. Wise lets that story breathe and the characters emerge and the result is a threehour movie. How ironic that the main criticism leveled at The Sand Pebbles is that it is slow and boring. Excuse me but this is called character development and it sets compelling moviemaking apart from the mediocre variety. The pacing is what draws you in to this world where the actors can give their characters life and create empathy in the audience. I can only feel sadness for the modern ADDafflicted viewer who is trained to respond to manipulative tricks and can not appreciate a realistic depiction of human behavior.Much has been said in these comments about the acting and I agree with those who feel McQueen and Crenna stand out. The character of the captain could have been a rigid cliche but Crenna gives us a person a man to whom duty and service is everything yet who is keenly aware of the needs and temperament of his crew and who yearns to leave his mark in history. As for McQueen...his physical presence dominates the film. His understated style is perfect for Holman a man who only wants to be left alone to do his work and yet who will fight against injustices done to others. His facial expressions especially in his eyes allow us to share his thoughts and feelings throughout the movie. The most memorable element in The Sand Pebbles for me is the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. Alternately stirring and heartrending it complements each scene absolutely brilliantly and is the most evocative score of any motion picture I have ever seen. Unfortunately the 1966 Oscar went to Born Free a mediocre picture whose title song was a hugely popular hit.I feel privileged that I was able to see The Sand Pebbles in a theatre where it is meant to be seen. This DVD version finally does justice to what I regard as an unparalleled achievement in filmmaking. There are other films that I have a stronger attachment to for various reasons but none of them hit a home run in every department the way that The Sand Pebbles does.Water belong dead stim all same dead stim".

	schema:headline " The Sand Pebbles  a powerful and human antiwar film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sand Pebbles' has been one of my favourite films since I first saw it on television in 1976. The widescreen version does justice not just to the sweeping panoramas of the quite breathtaking Chinese scenery but also to the sweeping events and themes of the story. It is in every way a big' film dealing with political and military intervention clear parallels with Vietnam at the time of release nationalism racism and the horrors of war. Yet for all its heavy themes it is most successful in the depiction of its very human characters. These characters are not just the means of conveying the messages' of the film or fodder for the gripping and wellstaged action scenes. They are individuals in their own right involved in something far greater than their own destinies. Some are unpleasant and ignorant while others are honourable but lost in the sea of historic events surrounding them. Some like Jake Holman Steve McQueen demand sympathy and respect as they struggle to come to terms with their personal challenges brought to the fore by these historically significant and politically dangerous events.Inevitably there are slow and confusing passages as the political implications are expounded but these are more than compensated for by our emotional engagement as we become involved in the stories of the people caught up in the political fallout. Robert Wise's direction is strong and emotionally charged complemented perfectly by Jerry Goldsmith's wonderfully haunting and ominous music. Steve McQueen gives what was probably the performance of his career receiving his only Academy Award nomination and he is supported by a wonderful cast including Richard Attenborough Richard Crenna Candice Bergen aged just 19 and especially Mako. But it is really McQueen's film. His very presence lifts scenes and he manages to convey authenticity and gain the sympathy of the viewer with consummate ease. Apparently misunderstood by some critics on its release it is a powerful and intrinsically human antiwar film. It is not a happy film but it is totally absorbing and thought provoking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen felt an affinity for this role like few others in his career.In this compelling war drama set in China in 1926 he plays American sailor Jake Holman a man who's bonded to machinery more than people yet is imbued with a powerful sense of right and wrong. It's a part that plays perfectly to McQueen's strengths as an actor and his lifelong quest to hone performance into character while jettisoning all but essential dialogue. All his emoting comes subtly slight shifts of gaze the way he cocks his head to listen his complete stillness before action. In 1966 it also brought him his only Academy Award nomination for Best Actor but won that year by Paul Scofield for A Man For All Seasons.Scripter Robert Anderson had a tough job distilling Richard McKenna's sprawling novel of U.S. Navy gunboat 'San Pablo' hence her sailors called themselves 'Sand Pebbles' at the start of the revolution that would tear China asunder and ultimately transform it into the postWWII behemoth we know today. Luckily he and director Robert Wise knew to keep the plot's underpinnings solidly on the central irony of McKenna's story that it is Jake's very alienation from his fellows that leads him inevitably to sacrifice and redemption. The ending is shocking and powerful a reminder of better more mature days in American film.Wise directed on locations in Hong Kong and Taiwan with his customary mastery of both intense personal confrontation and epic sweep. In excellent support are Richard Attenborough Richard Crenna and Mako. The film also features one of Jerry Goldsmith's most memorable scores.I must again mention McKenna's novel. It is superb sadly the only fulllength work he finished before his untimely death. It may be out of print but is well worth an online used book search.".

Poor Candice Bergen She comes across as simultaneously grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this film and embarrassed that  as a 19yearold with little acting experience  she didn't make a better job of it.She should have credited Wise with seeing her possibilities a little better than she could. Bergen's gawky shyness is a pretty good fit with her role as a virginal idealistic missionary newly arrived in China. Her often tentative body language works beautifully as a counterpoint to McQueen's assured and seemingly effortless performance giving their doomed love affair great believability and poignancy.This is an example of 60s' epic filmmaking at its best.".

If a current movie is three hours long you can bet it's because the director has fallen in love with himself not because the material merits it. THE SAND PEBBLES succeeds on just about every level It is a compelling and complex story it is beautifully filmed the acting is mostly excellent and there is a tremendous score. Can you imagine a film today having an overture? Rampant adult ADD prohibits it. The three hours gives you time to get to know the characters sink into the Chinese setting and become involved in the story. Just a little thing to notice right at the start Watch how McQueen fiddles with his napkin in the formal dining room. He's out of place and doesn't know what to do with it it's the kind of physical bit that McQueen does so well to elaborate his character. Credit must also be given to the late Richard Crenna. His captain of the San Pablo is a complex and conflicted character and Crenna while carrying off a largely formal role delivers a very nuanced and moving performance. THE SAND PEBBLES is a movie for grownups largely forgotten today but well worth your time.".

	schema:headline " Strong Epic Film Which Got Shafted At Oscar Night";
	schema:reviewBody "What a powerful story! It's hard to believe this epic movie  three hours in length  was nominated for eight Academy Awards and came away with nothing. It seems unjust. Well not everything is just in this dramatic story either. Good people die bad people live. Incredible joy and sorrow are but a few minutes away. The story is welltold and thus keeps your attention is wellacted and is nicely filmed.My only complaint was the last 13 minutes when the film got a little too political and of course tilted to the Left as films tend to do. Otherwise I throughly enjoyed the experience of watching this long movie and sorry I didn't watch this years ago. Well better late than never is all I can say. This movie is worthy of any serious film collector's attention.Robert Wise directed and he did a fabulous job. I just love some of the shots and camera angles in this widescreen production which was done justice in a recentlyreleased two disc DVD. The cinematography was by Joseph MacDonald. I'm sorry he didn't win an Oscar.The story has something for everyone several action scenes two romances a little humor some flag waving and flag disparaging and a lot of drama and intrigue. I also found two interesting character studies Jake Holman by lead actor Steve McQueen and Captain Collins with Richard Crenna. Both men delivered numerous surprises.There also is a lot of hostility by the Chinese toward the invaders the Americans. China's revolution during the period this story takes place md '20s had two factions the Nationalists led by Chiang Kaishek and the Communists. The former was generally a peaceful organization the latter pretty violent. Neither one wanted outsiders running their country any longer.The cast  wellknown and notso wellknown was solid from McQueen on down. I think it was odd to hear Richard Attenborugh with an American accent but he did a nice job with it. Crenna played the most interesting character in my opinion as captain hard to figure. As for the supporting actors Simon Oakland Stawski and Mako Pohan stood out to me.I'm not going get into the story as enough reviewers have already done that. Photograhywise it was nice to see most of this shot outdoors not on some studio lot or soundstage. I enjoyed all of the shots of the ship the San Pablo. Having just bought 7510 the BluRay edition of this film I'm anxious to see it in this format now. It promises to be a treat.Overall a memorable story and highlyrecommended.".

	schema:headline " Hello engine I'm Jake Holman.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sand Pebbles is the film that cemented Steve McQueen's status as a leading man in Hollywood one in which his character is the embodiment of a loner a rebel at odds with himself and his environment. His portrayal is so effective because it's grounded in his own upbringing. Abandoned by a self absorbed father at the age of four months and with an alcoholic mother who had little time for him McQueen was raised by a succession of relatives and eventually wound up in a reform school. His early bitterness with the world is reflected in his performance as Jake Holman more at home with inanimate objects than with human beings. He finds comfort in the machine room of the San Pablo a naval gunboat patrolling the Yangtze River in 1926 China.There's a telling moment in the movie that's quite bittersweet it's when Holman buys a caged bird from a street vendor for missionary Shirley Eckert Candice Bergen. Holman explains that the bird is meant to be freed from it's cage. As Miss Eckert opens the door of the cage releasing the bird it's gone in an instant and the viewer is visually confronted with the notion of freedom and what it might mean to the population of 1920's China a country of factions in a period of upheaval trying to find a way to unite.Through it all the mission of the San Pablo is to remain neutral under the supervision of Captain Collins Richard Crenna a no nonsense commander who takes his duty seriously and experiences a moment of personal crisis after he faces down both his own men and Chinese nationalists who demand that he turn Holman over to them following an incident on the mainland. It's at this point in the film that motivations and actions of the crew become a bit muddled to my thinking as the crew of the San Pablo in turn defy the Captain and then completely submit to his authority without further consequence. This was a confusing aspect of the story for me.Shot entirely in Taiwan the making of the film was plagued with problems related to weather and equipment loss extending the original eighty day filming schedule to seven months. The recreation of the San Pablo into a 1920's era gunboat cost two hundred fifty thousand dollars and what's fascinating to me was the way it was made to look as a worn out dilapidated rust bucket. The Sand Pebbles went on to garner a fist full of Oscar nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for McQueen who lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man For All Seasons. It's one of those pictures that when viewed today in relation to it's peers of the day it becomes apparent that the major Academy Awards for that year went to the wrong movies.".

The United States controlled no territory outright as other powers did but we did insist on extraterritoriality involving our citizens doing business there. What that meant was that our citizens were not subject to Chinese laws civil or criminal matters involving them went to American courts.

He's a very knowledgeable man quite versed on the current political situation in China. Yet he's absolutely blind to the fact that he's in grave danger. It's a peculiar thing about some liberal types they have great insight into the terrible wrongs done in the past. But at a certain point when guns start firing buildings start toppling we can't worry about political economic and social abuses of the past. You have to defend yourself and as vigorously as possible. Still it's McQueen's film. As I said he's a rebel hero but the military doesn't exactly favor individualism. His captain Richard Crenna is a by the book sailor who also doesn't understand the forces of resentment around him but will not see his ship disgraced in any way. He and McQueen don't hit it off from the start.There's a touching side story involving Richard Attenborough and a Chinese woman Marryat Andriane who do the unthinkable and get married.

Unfortunately this was McQueen's only Oscar nomination and The Sand Pebbles had the misfortune to be up against A Man for All Seasons.

The other crew members do not accept Jake believing he brings badluck to the vessel. On land Frenchy and Jake meet the Chinese woman Maily Marayat Andriane working in a brothel and Frenchy falls in love with her and tries to get US 20000 to buy her debts with the owner of the house of prostitution.

What I have missed along this year! This movie is a wonderful adventure having a magnificent cast and direction. I do not know the accuracy of the historical events but as a movie it is a masterpiece. It has drama romance action war and although having 182 minutes running time in the Brazilian DVD the viewer never gets tired of watching it.

This is the second role of the most beautiful American actress of the end of the 60s Candice Bergen performing a very sweet character.

	schema:headline " Great Movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen is usually associated with action movies. This movie has action too but also offers a complex and compelling story about a sailor who finds himself trying to survive in a situation marked by tremendous and sweeping change. For the movie takes place in China at a time of political turmoil and unrest when China is beginning to assert its independence from the West. The result is a clash of cultures as the representatives and symbols of Western Imperialist power and influence struggle to preserve and defend their presence in a country that is becoming openly hostile to anything Western.

	onyx:emotionText "Steve McQueen is usually associated with action movies. This movie has action too but also offers a complex and compelling story about a sailor who finds himself trying to survive in a situation marked by tremendous and sweeping change. For the movie takes place in China at a time of political turmoil and unrest when China is beginning to assert its independence from the West. The result is a clash of cultures as the representatives and symbols of Western Imperialist power and influence struggle to preserve and defend their presence in a country that is becoming openly hostile to anything Western. The Chinese want the Westerners to leave ... just leave. The Chinese wave their flags and anyone who cooperates with the Imperialists are treated as traitors and punished accordingly.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was a great success for a number of reasons. First the story is beautifully written it is superbly executed and perfectly cast. The Director Robert Wise was fresh off his triumph called The Sound of Music. Steve McQueen positively steals the show from everyone else in this film in his portrayal of an American Navy Engineman aboard a US gunboat in China in the mid 20's. He fell into the role so well that it's hard to imagine that he could have been anyone but Jake Holman. Right on his heels in the acting department however is the always gorgeous Candice Bergen who as one would expect falls for McQueens character. There is a hot and cold relationship between the Chinese and the Americans. McQueen's character can't believe the system that has been devised to divide the labor between the Chinese and the Americans aboard the gunboat. Then of course the Chinese decide to revolt. This was a period of great unrest in China just a few years before the Japanese invaded. In truth one of the Japanese excuses for their invasion of China was this revolution to restore order so the Japanese said. Naturally the US gunboat is charged with protecting American lives in the affected area. I won't spoil the film by saying anymore about the plot. This film is well worth a watch. It is one of the better films of the 60's. Special effects are minimal so that's not an issue either. This film wouldn't feel dated now at all. Great work!".

	schema:reviewBody "Steve McQueen did a breathtaking job bringing Jake Holman to life. For such a taciturn character he was incredibly expressive and multidimensional singular while not trying to make himself stand out simple in motivation but had great capacity for tolerating complexity unsocial but capable of deep loyalty to the people he connected with but most of all superbly cool and selfcontained while intimately involved uncontaminated by disdain and indifference. It is not everyday one sees a Hollywood flick with that level of character understanding and finely honed execution. As a whole I thought McQueen's character almost single handedly held the film together and kept audience interest going through several bad stretches. The film could have used some inspired editing and the direction dragged precisely in places where briskness and suspense was called for. Nonetheless it was a thoughtful treatment of the morass countries races individuals find themselves in when reality falls prey to politics when battle lines get drawn whether participants were willing or not. But do please ignore the simplification of the social and international context of China in 1929 in this film. That context alone would have taken a few more films if justice were to be done.The film touched on the perennial lessons on international exploitation and identity politics in which fear becomes the social currency. The characters and events illustrated the moral slipperiness of race and identity the falseness of political positions the dangers of pressing selfindulgent social justifications even when rightfully justified and ultimately the uselessness to which moral judgment can be rendered once power play encourage violence to escalate. Jake Holman's last words capped it all.What the hell happened? Indeed! Violence and exploitation has a way of creating mob mentality which strip nations and individuals of sense of discernment of ability to evaluate complexity and steering the masses into arbitrary and false positions regardless of the facts regardless of what most people actually think and feel. Reduced to this game of extreme the ruling mentality becomes kill or be killed. McQueen embodied thoughtfully this dismay and ambivalence. Take heed warmongers and pacifists alike.".

I had read the book at the age of 15 when it was serialized in the Saturday Evening post and loved it. The movie script is not an exact transcript of the book but is a faithful interpretation of it I recently reread it. The male ensemble cast is a big reason that this film works. Several of Holman's shipmates are played by men who were stars in their own right and having that foundation added great depth to the film. The coarse humor and grabass behavior are VERY true to life as is the depiction of sailors on liberty. It must be remembered that the 1920's were not a time when men enlisted in the service to earn money for college or to learn a trade. The enlisted ranks were made up of men for whom life in the service was an improvement upon the standard of living from which they'd come and they were almost all lifers. The Army Navy or jail choice given Jake Holman motivated many an enlistment as recently as the 1960's and may still. The music in this film is another big reason that it works. The hauntingly beautiful main theme grabs me every time I hear it and adds to the telling of the story. This is one of my alltime favorite films and every adult should see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "China 1926...Ravaged from within by corrupt warlords...oppressed from without by the great world powers who had beaten China to her knees a century before...China...a country of factions trying to unite to become a nation...through revolution.....The Sand Pebbles is a multi stranded panoramic story. It tells of China lifting itself off her knees and of the Americans who were caught in the giant's bloody rousing. It tells of crewmen Frenchy Richard Attenborough  Jake Holman Steve McQueen from the U.S.S. San Pablo two men whose lives are to be severely altered here on the banks of the Yangtze River. It tells of the San Pablo's Captain Collins Richard Crenna as he tries to negotiate tricky political waters. And also of the missionaries Larry Gates  Candice Bergen who in turn are resentful and bewildered by the US involvement in China. All molded together brilliantly by Robert Wise in this stirring drama that's flecked with romance and explosive action.Tho the film has undertaken a number of edits since its original release ranging from 170 minutes to 195 in any form the piece proves to be a lesson in character involvement. Adapted by Robert Anderson from the novel written by Richard McKenna the film unfolds precision like its intensity bubbling away until we reach the highly emotive conclusion. The film has often been placed as a parallel to the Vietnam conflict something that is in truth hard to ignore. The Sand Pebbles shows the Americans meddling in affairs they don't understand. They act arrogantly towards the Chinese they dismiss them and call them derogatory names. To them the Chinese are an inferior race. But Frenchy  Jake are cut from different cloth with the latter showing a cynicism and mistrust of authority that was felt by many young Americans towards their government for getting them involved in the civil war of Vietnam. Wise may be guilty of being heavy handed with his antiwar message the aside at Imperialism boldly timed in 1966. But it does work and impacts hard because the writing and the acting is so good. As is the many other technical aspects that are needed to tell such a vast story.It was nominated for 8 Academy Awards but incredibly it won none. It was McQueen's only nomination in his career that in itself is arguably unfair Papillon anybody?. But here he really should have won I mean seriously does anyone really remember Best Actor Winner Paul Scofield's turn now? Those close to McQueen have said that Jake Holman was closest in character to the man himself. It's a riveting emotionally nuanced performance that shows his unnerving ability to say more with his eyes and body language than with words. As antihero performances go McQueen's is right out of the top draw. Attenborough Golden Globe Winner for Best Supporting Actor Crenna and the impressive Mako all captivate and draw the viewers in while Bergen has a winsome quality that plays nicely off of McQueen's rugged weariness. The cinematography from Joseph MacDonald is gorgeous shot in Deluxe Color and Panavision in Taiwan and Hong Kong MacDonald brilliantly took advantage of the sweeping Oriental scenery. This in turn is backed up by a sublime score from Jerry Goldsmith at times beautiful  tender with a pinch of Oriental flavouring at others powerful and sharp and landing in the chest like a force of nature.It was a far from trouble free shoot. McQueen initially clashed with Wise over how certain scenes should be shot but the director won out and eventually got McQueen's support. Something that wasn't to be sniffed at and something that wasn't afforded to Anderson who was jettisoned after falling foul of Blue Eyes. Bergen and McQueen also didn't get on but with she being 19 years of age and he 36 that's somewhat understandable. But when she proclaimed that there was no talent on set! one hopes that was merely the misguided naivety of youth? Wise always said it was the most difficult picture he ever made. Expensive props thousands of extras low and high tides Taiwan still at war with China! Three months of delays and 3 million over budget Wise said that the cast and crew were heroes one and all. To be dropped into a completely foreign country and suffer the delays and problems they did it's a miracle the finished product is so dam good.The final word should go to Francis Ford Coppola. Who whilst suffering similar problems filming Apocalypse Now requested a copy of The Sand Pebbles from Robert Wise. He used it to show his cast and crew what a terrific end result can come out of adversity. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Robert Wise masterminded such a box office hit in 1965 with The Sound Of Music that the executives at Twentieth Century Fox gave him virtual total control  and an immense budget  for his next project. That project  The Sand Pebbles  is a passable epic set in 1926 China which while technically well done and colourfully performed is decidedly on the long side and hampered by irrelevant allegorical links with the Vietnam War. On the plus side the film features arguably the best performance ever given by Steve McQueen and expensively recreates a convincing view of its period and locale despite being shot forty years after the incidents on screen. The film was envisaged as a major event movie from the studio alongside the same year's The Bible In The Beginning and The Blue Max. But despite being up for eight Oscars the film won in none of the categories for which it was nominated  which tells you everything you need to know. This is one of those films that looks good sounds good tells a worthy story at great length. but ultimately fails to do justice to its own potential.In 1926 US Navy engineer Jake Holman Steve McQueen transfers from an oceanbased warship to the river gunboat San Pablo. The San Pablo patrols the Yangtze River in China under the orders of Captain Collins Richard Crenna. Collins likes to keep his engine room crew busy while the officers and deck sailors spend most of their time carrying out combat drills. However Holman performs his engine room duties with such conscientiousness and gusto that he gradually alienates himself from most of the other crew members. During their journeys up and down the river Holman falls in love with a teacher at a mission outpost the young and beautiful Shirley Eckert Candice Bergen. He also forms a strong friendship with fellow sailor Frenchy Burgoyne Richard Attenborough who has saved a Chinese prostitute from a life of vice and degradation by marrying her. The political situation in the country deteriorates and the crew of the San Pablo find themselves caught up in a difficult situation. Things reach crisis point when a Chinese crew member is captured and tortured because of his allegiance to the Americans. Worse still the aforementioned mission outpost is attacked by Chinese soldiers and the San Pablo has to smash through a blockade of Chinese junks  thereby declaring an intent of war  in order to rescue the missionaries and their colleagues. This act of foolhardy heroism proves to be fatal for many of the San Pablo's beleaguered sailors.The Sand Pebbles is based on a best selling novel by Richard Mackenna who actually served in the China River Patrol albeit in 1936 ten years after the events depicted in his story. Robert Anderson's screenplay incorporates much of the novel's complexity within its mammoth narrative but the decision to turn the film into an apologetic Vietnam allegory is not a wise move. A film like this would be better off dealing with its own period and story rather than dragging in heavyhanded subtextual meanings. Cinematographer Joseph MacDonald gives the film an exciting visual grandeur with his sumptuous lensing of the locations Taiwan standing in for 1920s China but Robert Wise's efforts to make the film succeed as entertainment generally come up short due in no small part to the heavygoing nature of the plot and the welldocumented production difficulties including bad weather plus creative differences between him and McQueen.".

But despite being up for eight Oscars the film won in none of the categories for which it was nominated  which tells you everything you need to know. This is one of those films that looks good sounds good tells a worthy story at great length. but ultimately fails to do justice to its own potential.In 1926 US Navy engineer Jake Holman Steve McQueen transfers from an oceanbased warship to the river gunboat San Pablo. The San Pablo patrols the Yangtze River in China under the orders of Captain Collins Richard Crenna. Collins likes to keep his engine room crew busy while the officers and deck sailors spend most of their time carrying out combat drills. However Holman performs his engine room duties with such conscientiousness and gusto that he gradually alienates himself from most of the other crew members. During their journeys up and down the river Holman falls in love with a teacher at a mission outpost the young and beautiful Shirley Eckert Candice Bergen. He also forms a strong friendship with fellow sailor Frenchy Burgoyne Richard Attenborough who has saved a Chinese prostitute from a life of vice and degradation by marrying her. The political situation in the country deteriorates and the crew of the San Pablo find themselves caught up in a difficult situation. Things reach crisis point when a Chinese crew member is captured and tortured because of his allegiance to the Americans. Worse still the aforementioned mission outpost is attacked by Chinese soldiers and the San Pablo has to smash through a blockade of Chinese junks  thereby declaring an intent of war  in order to rescue the missionaries and their colleagues. This act of foolhardy heroism proves to be fatal for many of the San Pablo's beleaguered sailors.The Sand Pebbles is based on a best selling novel by Richard Mackenna who actually served in the China River Patrol albeit in 1936 ten years after the events depicted in his story. Robert Anderson's screenplay incorporates much of the novel's complexity within its mammoth narrative but the decision to turn the film into an apologetic Vietnam allegory is not a wise move. A film like this would be better off dealing with its own period and story rather than dragging in heavyhanded subtextual meanings. Cinematographer Joseph MacDonald gives the film an exciting visual grandeur with his sumptuous lensing of the locations Taiwan standing in for 1920s China but Robert Wise's efforts to make the film succeed as entertainment generally come up short due in no small part to the heavygoing nature of the plot and the welldocumented production difficulties including bad weather plus creative differences between him and McQueen.";

	schema:reviewBody "lAn exciting curious movie epic in scope filmed in Taiwan.  A viewer can believe that this is what China looked like in the 1920s from the rebuilt river gunboat to the dingy whorehouses.  The acting is good as well. The production designer deserves commendation.  Everything seems so right. And the technical stuff too aboard the San Pablo every surface seems to have about two hundred coats of white paint.  This effectively insulates sailors from the asbestos that coats hot pipes making it unlikely that McQueen died from an asbestosinduced mesothelioma although he did work on ships.  The dress uniforms are neat as well.  And when I was wearing one as an adolescent I always fantasized wearing leggings carrying a rifle and joining a landing party.  The scenes ashore and on ship are equally good. What images  a flat wellarmed river gunboat sailing towards a boom across the river McQueen adjusting the sights on his BAR flashing swords love with a stone elephant in the background how to get along on ten dollars a month in a Chinese port of call.  There's a good deal of humor in the first part climaxing in the fight between Mako a closet Japanese actor and Stawski.The story is tense too.  Let me see.  Attenborough loves Meili a beautiful young Chinese virgin about to be auctioned off to the nearest glandular bidder.  McQueen loves Candace Bergen a virginal young missionary who believes in the unity of mankind.  And womankind.  McQueen also loves his engines being a motor machinist's mate.  However there is a conflict between the rest of the crew and McQueen.  And there is a dysfunction between the crew of the San Pablo and most of the Chinese.Both the action and the love stories are appealingly done.  The problem is that much of it doesn't make too much sense.  I must have seen this movie a dozen times.  Once in a theater in Trenton New Jersey which is mentioned in the film.  Trenton I mean not the theater.  Why does the crew grow to hate McQueen so much?  I still don't know unless the reason is that it just adds to the drama.  There's hardly any justification for it that follows a known chain of logic.  Why does McQueen switch his allegiance from the Navy to a socialreligiouspolitical cause against whose contamination his entire life has been designed to inure him?  I don't know either.  Even Candace Bergen angularly stunning as she is doesn't provide enough of a reason. What is this movie anyhow besides a collection of tense or humorous episodes and character exploration expressed in unforgettable imagery?  I read the novel years ago.  It was published not long after the blockbuster success of James Jones' From Here to Eternity which successfully  well MORE than just successfully  took us into the U. S. Army in Hawaii in 1941.  The novel aims for more or less the same thing and almost hits the mark but the influence of its model is strong enough to weaken the story. The parallels persist even after they might more profitably have been deep sixed.  Thus McQueen's love for his engines is like Prewitt's love for the army.  Attenborough is like Sinatra.  McQueen gets mixed up with a forbidden woman just like Burt Lancaster.  Meili is a respectable sensitive girl in a cathouse just like Donna Reed.  The setting is exotic in both cases. Social dynamics of the crew or the barracks are explored.  McQueen gets the treatment as Montgomery Clift did.  That's why the crew dislikes McQueen the original template calls for it.  McQueen deserts his professional love in favor of his emotional commitment to a woman as Clift did and dies for it as Clift did.  There is an exciting momentous action climax. Absolutely nothing about this movie is boring.  There are even original elements introduced  McQueen sponsoring a slope as an apprentice engineer. But behind the surface events is that nagging irritation over the holes in this leftover plot.  But don't misunderstand because I usually watch this when it's on TV.  It's like being Twilight Zoned into a more colorful past.".

At a time when meaty women's roles were becoming more and more scarce Burstyn was fighting for and winning one great part after another. She's probably never been better than she is here though she showed tremendous range in Same Time Next Year and gave one of the most heartbreakingly harrowing performances I've ever seen as recently as 2000 in Requiem for a Dream. Women's picture and Martin Scorsese are not two phrases that would seem to be tailor made for each other but a terrific women's picture is exactly what Scorsese gives us with Alice... Though I hate using the term women's picture as if men can't enjoy stories about women or as if women's pictures are isolated from the rest of real movies. Actually and ironically maybe it was Scorsese's penchant for the toughguy milieu that made him so right for this film because Alice doesn't suffer from the burnyourbra selfrighteousness of other women's lib movies of its era like Un Unmarried Woman. These other films ultimately feel phony because they were created for the most part by men who however noble their intentions simply didn't have an understanding for the material. But Scorsese gets the character of Alice and Burstyn knows exactly what she's doing. So the conflict isn't between Alice and the male world but between the Alice who doesn't have the confidence to be anything other than a doormat and the Alice who wants to make a life for herself on her own terms.There are some hilarious scenes between Alice and her son in this film most particularly the scenes of them driving to California like when Alice calls him Hellen Keller because he keeps asking what? to everything she says. Also a subplot about the evolving friendship between Alice and Flo played by Diane Ladd becomes one of the film's highlights not in the least because both actresses handle it expertly.This is a winner and must be seen by anyone who thinks Scorses is out of his element anywhere but the mean streets of NYC.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER ALERTThis small and oftoverlooked offering from Martin Scorsese his 4th feature ranks among his best and most interesting for a number of reasons  it's one of the only Scorsese films with a woman as the protagonist and  in typical Scorsese fashion she's tough if a bit conflicted like most of his male protagonists  and real in other words. ALICE...also provides a another great glimpse of his very original style as it was developing  the continuum between MEAN STREETS this film and TAXI DRIVER in look mood and performance is perfect as the post newwave grit and furious energy of MEAN STREETS is a bit more focused here. Overall ALICE... is a more subdued character study which  like life  swings from gripping to scary to funny to touching in the blink of an eye. Also notable as one of Scorsese's handful of nonNew York stories like LAST TEMPTATION CASINO and KUNDUN ALICE... follows Alice Hyatt Ellen Burstyn fresh out of THE EXORCIST and at her peak  a California native living in New Mexico with her truck driver husband. Suddenly widowed Alice decides that she and Joey are going to take off on what little cash they have left for California so she can pursue her longdormant dream of becoming a singer. They make it as far as Arizona before Alice runs out of cash and has to stop to find work. After initially landing in Phoenix  Alice ends up living in a rentbytheweek motel in Tuscon working at Mel's a trashy diner run by its' amusingly belligerent namesake Mel Vic Tayback and staffed by the wildbutwise Flo Diane Ladd in another amazing performance and psychologically unstable Vera Valerie Curtin. Before long Alice begins to put down roots and she takes up with David Kris Kristofferson a local rancher. The lone potential flaw is the ending which feels like a compromise  if after discovering her confidence and independence Alice feels like she oughta ride off into the sunset of Monterrey she also wants companionship and has allowed this desire to lead her into questionable choices in men witness one of Harvey Keitel's most unforgettable performances because of it. So if a somewhat conflicted ideology lingers through a film where tough mindedness and harsh reality interrupted by the occasional bit of lifelike randomlike humor gives way to romance then perhaps it simply is indicative of how cerebral ideologies sometimes will  or should  crumble in the face of human emotions and desires. In any case this thoughtful tension at the heart of this beautifully acted beautifully filmed tourdeforce gives ALICE... a rich earthy energy that places it among the most thoughtful and multifaceted films like TAXI DRIVER RAGING BULL and also the underrated KUNDUN that Scorsese has ever made.".

ALICE...also provides a another great glimpse of his very original style as it was developing  the continuum between MEAN STREETS this film and TAXI DRIVER in look mood and performance is perfect as the post newwave grit and furious energy of MEAN STREETS is a bit more focused here. Overall ALICE... is a more subdued character study which  like life  swings from gripping to scary to funny to touching in the blink of an eye. Also notable as one of Scorsese's handful of nonNew York stories like LAST TEMPTATION CASINO and KUNDUN ALICE... follows Alice Hyatt Ellen Burstyn fresh out of THE EXORCIST and at her peak  a California native living in New Mexico with her truck driver husband. Suddenly widowed Alice decides that she and Joey are going to take off on what little cash they have left for California so she can pursue her longdormant dream of becoming a singer. They make it as far as Arizona before Alice runs out of cash and has to stop to find work. After initially landing in Phoenix  Alice ends up living in a rentbytheweek motel in Tuscon working at Mel's a trashy diner run by its' amusingly belligerent namesake Mel Vic Tayback and staffed by the wildbutwise Flo Diane Ladd in another amazing performance and psychologically unstable Vera Valerie Curtin. Before long Alice begins to put down roots and she takes up with David Kris Kristofferson a local rancher. The lone potential flaw is the ending which feels like a compromise  if after discovering her confidence and independence Alice feels like she oughta ride off into the sunset of Monterrey she also wants companionship and has allowed this desire to lead her into questionable choices in men witness one of Harvey Keitel's most unforgettable performances because of it. So if a somewhat conflicted ideology lingers through a film where tough mindedness and harsh reality interrupted by the occasional bit of lifelike randomlike humor gives way to romance then perhaps it simply is indicative of how cerebral ideologies sometimes will  or should  crumble in the face of human emotions and desires. In any case this thoughtful tension at the heart of this beautifully acted beautifully filmed tourdeforce gives ALICE... a rich earthy energy that places it among the most thoughtful and multifaceted films like TAXI DRIVER RAGING BULL and also the underrated KUNDUN that Scorsese has ever made.";

It is far superior and a much more mature film than say Thelma  Louise. If you're looking for female empowerment movies. Alice is reality. The fine cast also includes Harvey Keitel and Diane Ladd.

Some critics complained that the happy ending felt tacked on but you come to respect Alice and her choices and most of the film's little faults are camouflaged by director Martin Scorsese's bittersweet framing and Robert Getchell's vivid screenplay.

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Scorsese's reputation as the director of some of the best gangster movies of all time often obscures his enormous sensitivity to the nuances of everyday modern life. Despite being his first commercial success 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' is probably Scorsese's most overlooked film which is shameful because it is arguably his best and in any analysis deserves acknowledgment as one of the most honest and ultimately uplifting portraits of workingclass womanhood written and directed by men.The scenario is familiar to anyone with a vague awareness of late 1970s American pop culture as it was adapted into a successful TV sitcom 'Alice' starring Linda Lavin in the title role originated by the great Ellen Burstyn a former lounge singer who traded a dicey future for the stability of bluecollar married life in suburban New Mexico Alice Hyatt finds herself suddenly widowed with little to no money no career possibilities or job experience and a precocious and frequently obnoxious twelve yearold son Alfred Lutter who went on to make 'The Bad News Bears' before growing up and disappearing to provide for. With few other options on hand Alice determines to restart her singing career back in Monterrey California the last place she remembered feeling truly happy and optimistic about the future. She packs her life and her son into the family station wagon and makes her way west stopping off first in Phoenix where the sitcom is set and then in Tucson trying to save enough cash to get to Monterrey. En route she suffers defeat humiliation and a continuation of her serial attraction to abusive men until finally she finds herself reduced to a job as a waitress in a roadside caf the nowubiquitous 'Mel's Diner' a dive dominated by the profane banter between saucy head waitress Flo Diane Ladd and cookowner Mel Vic Tayback. Alice finds herself living in an extendedstay fleabag motel pinching pennies and praying for a bit of luck which dubiously arrives in the form of David Kris Kristofferson a local rancher whom Alice feels herself falling for but is unable to trust thanks to her history of abuse at the hands of formerly charming men.Scorsese's innovative trademark camera work is on ample display here along with his arthouse director's penchant for the unusual the film opens with an homage to 'The Wizard of Oz' in which Dorothy is replaced by the young but already brassy and foulmouthed Alice. But this is a story about humanity and Scorsese knows enough to step back and let his brilliant lead actress fill up the screen with her honesty and emotional range.Ellen Burstyn won the 1976 Best Actress Oscar for this film and it's easy to see why. Scorsese clearly knew what he had on his hands Burstyn's Alice is both tough and vulnerable desperate and determined. Burstyn lets the camera linger on her aging face she was 42 when the film was released which strangely enough is more beautiful and alluring than the polished appearances of most of today's actresses. Alice faces countless hardships and Burstyn makes them feel as true as any we face in our own lives. She tries to keep up a bright face for Tommy her quirky quizzical son but has moments of naked gutwrenching despair as she tries to fathom how she'll ever be able to support herself. Burstyn was herself a singer and a waitress before finding success as a film actress and her vocal performances are powerfully affectingpitchperfect but shaky enough to reveal her inner vulnerability. She is a brilliant vehicle for this portrait of the life of a hardluck woman with no one to trust. The film is full of fine heartbreakingly memorable momentsAlice weeps in bed next to her husband Donald Billy Green Bush after another silent loveless dinner and the two clutch each other unable to speak Alice's disappointment outweighed only by her desperate need after a long day of rejections Alice breaks down into tears before a gentle bar manager who ultimately caves in allows her to audition for him whereupon she performs a heartbreaking medley of standards for a stunned crowd of average joes in a dingy piano bar Alice gets a rare moment of joy drunkenly sitting up from the kitchen table to show David her first dance routine after making love for the first time. These moments feel so real and honest that you almost forget you're watching a movie.The supporting performances are all easily above par especially Diane Ladd as Flo a role made famous for the sanitized 'Kiss my grits' line immortalized by Ladd's TV counterpart Polly Holliday interestingly Ladd briefly succeeded Holliday on the TV 'Alice' in the role of 'Belle' after Flo got her own shortlived spinoff. Alice and Flo initially clash but eventually form a sisterly bond revealing that in many ways they are opposite sides of the same coin curiously Diane Ladd and Ellen Burstyn were born within a month of each other Burstyn in Detroit and Ladd in Mississippi. Alfred Lutter's Tommy is perfectly exasperating but also lovable. Kris Kristofferson's David manages to be 'too good to be true' without being unbelievable as the first good man in Alice's life. Harvey Keitel as a rakish suitor Jodie Foster as a spunky ne'erdowell who befriends Tommy and of course Vic Tayback are all perfect in their smaller supporting roles.'Alice . . .' deserves to be revisited again and again. It's so close to the experience of single mothers in the 1970s that it could be considered a documentary. It's also frequently very funny capturing the small bits of laughter and silliness in normal life with pitchperfect accuracy. I doubt that there has ever been another film that has made fictional characters feel so real and true. Alice is a true heroinea survivorand sharing her travails and triumphs you feel the empathy and involvement that only appear in transcendent art.".

The plot is very simple thus making the film easy to follow and therefore light viewing and it could also be called a 'chick flick'. However Scorsese directs with his usual verve and manages to implement a number of memorable characters along the way some of which are played by the stars of future Scorsese films. The film starts when we are introduced to a young girl named Alice who has aspirations of being a singer. Several years later and after the death of her husband she and her son set off across the country in order for her to pursue her dream career. After her first job and choice of boyfriend go awry she travels on and ends up meeting a man named David.This film provides an acting credit for Ellen Burstyn who just as she would go on to do in the likes of The Exorcist delivers a well worked and believable performance. Kris Kristofferson is her opposite number although he doesn't get to flex his acting muscles much  while Taxi Driver costars Jodie Fosters and Harvey Keitel deliver memorable portrayals in small roles. The film benefits from a very well written script which manages to give credence to all of its lead characters which elevate the film above similar material in its class. The locations are well used and the director does well in implementing a gritty country style as well as the central theme of ordinary people trying to make something out of themselves. The main problem with the film is that sometimes it can be a little too lighthearted and some of the heavier plot ideas aren't allowed to shine through as they should. Overall this film may be disliked by fans of Scorsese films such as Goodfellas and Casino and it definitely is a chick flick but personally I have no qualms with naming it as one of the better films on Scorsese's list of film credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a lighter film than I am used to seeing from director Martin Scorsese known for his movies with gangsters and other blighters. Of course there are some such characters in this moviemostly malevolent men. At first Scorsese showcases some of his directorial ingenuity the film opens with an oldfashioned credits screen with Mack Gordon and Harry Warren's You'll Never Know playing in the background. The opening scene was in homage to The Wizard of Oz. The fences also reminded me of Gone with the Wind. But then Alice as a child played by Mia Bendixsen says if anybody doesn't like it they can blow it out their ass.All the Way from Memphis by Ian Hunter carries us to Alice 27 years older played by Ellen Burstyn in her Oscarwinning performance. Foul language and wisecracks are the brighter part of Alice's life the other part is hopping from one abusive relationship to the next while searching for employment. Alice eventually becomes a waitress at a diner the scenario was revived in the lousy sitcom Alice 19761985.Diane Ladd earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as smart aleck waitress Flo. Jodie Foster does well as an assertive child. Ellen Burstyn and Alfred Lutter who plays Alice's kid carry the movie most of the way though. When done right teaming an adult and a child together for the majority of conversation in a film results in an enjoyable light movie which this one is. This was Scorsese's first commercial success with editing and a moving camera among other tricks his presence is revealed throughout.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was younger my sister and I would spend countless hours each day watching television. One of the programs we found ourselves glued to was Alice. For those who may not remember the show too clearly one phrase may help jog your memory... Kiss my grits! If that didn't help you probably have never seen the show or as some folks may say... it was before my time.Anyway... last night I saw a film titled Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Upon starting the movie all I knew about it was that it was directed by the great Martin Scorsese and that it was about a widowed wife and her son who drive across the country. To my great surprise the character Alice is the same character from the TV sitcom. I didn't put two and two together until halfway through the film when it showed the diner with Mel and the other two waitresses. It was fun to see the other characters like Flo Vera and Mel the movie's Mel was the same actor as the TV show's Mel. Many of the elements were similar between television and movie the only noticeable difference was the tone. On television the show was a sitcom comedy made to get a good laugh every few minutes.The film however was a bit more serious because of various real life situations relationships child upbringing death.This coincidence made things much more interesting as the film continued. Don't get me wrong the movie was pretty damn good already I just seemed to enjoy it a bit more when I started putting the pieces together. Scorsese once again showed his incredible directing skills. He was able to bring the viewer into the extreme pain and desperation of the main character while at the same time show the positive things in Alice's life through his use of color and cinematography.Overall the film was enjoyable because it was quite heart warming in contrast to the more famous gangster type films by Scorsese. It made me wish that either the television show were still on syndication or that I get to chance to see this film sometime again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alice is a pearl  she's the kind of everyday heroine the world needs today  in French they call them mere courage meaning literally mother bravery and God I respect this woman and I respect Martin Scorsese the one who made the ultimate guy movies for having dedicated such a great film for women those misunderstood wonders of the world that we men use to make ourselves feel like men  God bless you Marty ! and Bravo for Ellen Burstyn for having portrayed such a character! Alice what a wonderful name she reminds me of a poor little girl plunged in a surrealistic world where everything seems against her  I don't know if it's an homage to Lewis Carrol's titular heroine the fact is that this film is a psychological road movie in the soul of a fragile creature that has a bad day a long bad day that tunnels us in the deepest fears and sentimental problems that a woman in the middle of the 70's could encounter ... and I sincerely hoped all through the film that this tunnel would end in a light of hope  Light is not something this movie lacked Ellen Burstyn's smile is the sunshine that enlightened my heart and made me wish that her dream to become a singer would finally be true  but this is a dream and she's Alice. Marty I know you're smart enough and I didn't expect a happy ending nor a cynical one this is a movie about women about mothers and I'm glad that you handled it with the respect we all owe to our mothers our women  Not that I'm surprised but I was worried and I'm glad that all ended that ended well for her  The story of Alice started with a homage to the Wizard of Oz a nice touch to remind us that sometimes our dreams are part of a sort of surrealistic world that doesn't take today's harshness into consideration  not surprising though that 27 years later we find Alice as a devoted mother trying to balance between an annoying but harmless little brat and a dominating husband figure  from the beginning we understand one thing that dear Alice needs a break but need in Scorsese's movies are not necessarily fulfilled not without the touch of fate anyway the same touch that decided to precociously make Alice a widow ...But a widow is not the character that suits her she basically can't live without a man why? Because despite everything this is not a feminist movie it's about reality idealization leads to disappointment while realism provides hope the same hope that guided Alice to look for a better future for her and her child  mere courage again. Crisis and opportunity are almost synonyms in the world of Alice she's always about to breakdown BUT never does. That's the very aspect of her personality she's so fragile that she needs a man but not enough to become dependent.Marty you were a precocious genius because even though you probably didn't understand women  who did and who will anyway?  You directed a movie with all the humility in your heart and let women guide you to make us understand the truths that lie beneath the beauty  they can be singers wives widows or waitresses these poor little souls are the greatest thing God ever created. And WE we men don't deserve them.Indeed what I learned from Alice Bea or Flo is that there's a whole universe inhabiting these hearts and we try to gain selfrespect we try to affirm our masculinity in the most cowardly way by reducing to dominated objects those creatures who just want to be protected understood loved and we're too weak to admit how needy we are  We all need women  and I'm glad you Marty didn't caricature the purpose of the film by making all the men equal to Donald a decent but rude guy or Ben Harvey Keitel a brief but powerful performance. We have something in common with them but there's an inner David in us Kris Kristofferson as the man who redeemed us all.David is the good guy with a living and a need of love no surprise he immediately felt for Alice  but there was the boy the product of a spoiled education worsened by the absence of a fatherly figure this could have lead to the worst clashes but Marty's film is more lighthearted than what I'd thought and it's better this way. It's not a female version of Taxi Driver despite the presence of a superb Jodie Foster in a promising performance. It's an inspiring film where Alice will finally have the break she always dreamed of.Alice after facing so much brutality and others expressions of masculine weakness will finally find the strength in its most honest and even clumsy way but clumsy for a man almost means sincere  and I was glad that despite everything she ended up with David  will she become a singer? Will she fulfill her dreams ? At least she's with a man ... but this is not a male victory the real winner is Alice and no one else.This is a movie about women but made by a man and it couldn't have been more honest and sincere about the way we treat our wives and mothers  we're bad we're flawed but God knows we need them  the movie is like a humble cinematic apology from one of the greatest directors of his generation and allow me to be among those who say  Sorry for the way we treat you. I love your films Marty I loved Alice and God knows how I love women  and Mom especially ".

	schema:reviewBody "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore at times might not look it to those who don't check or care to check the director credit but Martin Scorsese in the interim between Mean Streets and Taxi Driver took on a film where he could prove to his detractors wrong. Indeed Scorsese can direct anyone well man woman child just look at Kundun if you don't believe his knack for directing nonprofessional along with pros besides the point. In this story Ellen Burstyn plays the title character left abandoned with her son after her husband dies. She has to make ends meet as a waitress in Phoenix in order to make her dream for her and her son come true getting to Monterey. Enter in that cool presence that is Kris Kristofferson and the film goes into notsoconventional territory some would argue up till the end.For acting students this is one of those kinds of films one has to check out Burstyn in her Oscar winning role plays between kind angry frightened scared and strong in her role trying to break past other female types that had been around in films at the time. There is also ample room for a small role for Harvey Keitel as a smooth talker with a bad temper. Scenes between the two of them are like method acting staples of 70's moviemaking not to downplay Kristofferson or Diane Ladd's performances either. And then there's Scorsese injecting his style sometimes without much of a trace and sometimes so forcefully that one who knows his work well can sit up and take notice. The improvisation he lets the actors have in scenes is so delicate and precise that it adds to the reality or the illusions of most scenes. There is also a very funny in a weird way beginning to the film as a parody of farmgirl good times goes on.A recommended treat those who are diehards for the Scorsese crime films may be perplexed but for the Lifetime TV crowd who usually wouldn't go near a Scorsese film at the video store will likely be more pleased than I was or maybe not this film has as much detractors as defenders for its feminist themes.".

In the first few minutes Scorsese establishes Alice's need for companionship and her love of music while painting a poignant portrait of this little family. Essentially this is a road movie and its ending has been commented on in several posts as a Hollywood sell out. I don't see that. It is a very bittersweet ending with Alice having to give up the singing part of her dream for the time being. A Hollywood ending would have had her opening her onewoman show in Monterey or San Francisco wasn't the movie clip in the hotel from that movie?.

	schema:reviewBody "As a girl I watched Alice on TV and enjoyed the sitcom. I vaguely knew it was based on a movie but never watched the film until now. It is amazingwith wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn Kris Kristofferson Diane Ladd and that little scene stealer Alfred Lutter. Scorsese gives them the freedom to become their characters and directs with a loving hand.The chemistry between Burstyn and Kristofferson is palpablethey are one of the best on screen couples I have ever seen. Their romance set against the gorgeous backdrop of Tuscon is both tender and tempestuous. Alice is a woman who for years has had lousy taste in men so naturally her guard is up and she wants to be independent. David is a rugged outdoorsman who wants to open up his heart and his home to both Alice and her bratty son Tommy. A spoiled only child Tommy treats his mother with about as much respect as you'd expect from an 11 year old adolescent who is constantly uprooted and bored to tears. Tommy is a pragmatist wise beyond his years and Alice is a dreamer who at 35 is still naive about the ways of the world. It's a good thing when she strikes up a friendship with the sassy foulmouthed Flo played to the hilt by the marvelous Diane Ladd. Alice needs a lesson or two on how to take control of her life and she does a tremendous job of learning who she is.Beautiful outdoor scenery atmospheric music a great script and tremendous performances by the actors from the maestro Scorcese make this picture a perfect 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This summary may contain spoilers What a wonderful film this is to see! Ellen Burstyn who won an Oscar for this is wonderful as the lead character who has a dream of becoming a singer. After Alice's husband dies in a tragic accident she and her 11 year old son Tommy have to move elsewhere so that she can pursue her dream. She goes to several places to get work and I assume she finds it. Then she gets a job as a waitress in a very noisy roadside cafeteria in order to make money to save to help her get going. A number of other great actors got a break in this movie before they became famous. Harvey Keitel puts in a wonderful performance as the quick guy friend that Alice sees a few times but leaves him Jodie Foster gives a great role as Tommy's friend. Alfred Lutter is great as the bratty but lovable Tommy. I also liked Diane Ladd's performance as Flo the waitress with the salty language and sense of humor but a likable and easy going lady and Vic Tayback as the grouchy boss man Mel who also reprised his role in the sitcom. Valerie Curtin does a great job playing Vera who was a quiet soft spoken waitress who didn't say much compared to the Vera in the sitcom who was an over eager achiever. Kris Kristofferson is great as David the guy that Alice sees from time to time. This is a must see movie for those of you who have not seen it yet. Also in the final cafeteria scene look for the little blond girl with the glasses eating an ice cream cone. She is Laura Dern Diane Ladd's daughter. It would be great to see this movie come out on DVD sometime. Until then it is just going to show up rarely on cable TV. Another note Diane Ladd came on the sitcom as Belle during the 3rd season I think.".

Getting a job in a piano bar she gets into more trouble with men and move town again. Settling into a waitressing job she hates Alice continues to search for something better.Those of us who only see Scorsese as the guy who does gangster movies' should check out one of his earlier films and then realise why they are wrong.  Also they should check out King of Comedy' easily one of his better films but criminally undervalued and years ahead of it's time. Ahem anyway back to this movie.  Scorsese has managed to make a film from a female point of view.  Whereas many of his more successful films were male orientated this takes the female side well.   The story manages to be both funny but also touching and real.  The story may be a little rambling and quite melodramatic but it works well.  The gentle comedy is of the type between friends as opposed to elaborate sketches  this helps keep it feeling real.Scorsese cuts back on the heavily stylised direction evident in later films but this does help the content work.  As always he uses music to good effect even if there is a bit too much in the way of CW.  Burstyn does very well as Alice and carries the film well without letting it become a grind.  Lutter III is great for a child his irreverent humour prevents him being a cute kid' type.  Kristofferson is good value in a small part his character is just about a good enough mix of hot and cold to be real.  Ladd is great in support and very funny.  Keitel and Foster are both good and indicate why Scorsese came back to them for more in later films.Overall I imagine that those looking for more Fwords gangsters and De Niro will feel that this isn't a good Scorsese film.  However it is proof of his talent that he is able to deliver a very good house wife melodrama'. Of course looking over his work the focus will be on other films but here he turns a TVM weepy into an involving and amusing melodrama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Winner of Best Actress for Ellen Burstyn and nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Diane Ladd and Best Original Script for Robert Getchell and directed by one of the greatest directors of all time Martin Scorsese not to mention the inspiration of the long running Emmy Award winning TV series Alice Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore takes you on journey of finding opportunity in the big world out there and overcoming huge obstacles to achieve the pinnacle of independence when the going gets tough. It's a simple tale of a widowed mother with very little cash takes her husband's death as an opportunity to follow an ambition that was stalled due to her loyalty in her husband and her son Tommy Alfred Lutter III. The story is saturated with abuse rejection mother and son disputes and the love for each other that comes between these wedges. But through all the clawing and scratching towards Alice's not so perfect the movie most of all is filled with optimism that anyone can fill their dreams if they have the drive to reach it. One of the best traits about this movie is that it refrains from being overly artistic or poetic. It succeeds in making every scene as real as possible which makes it more interesting an provocative. The performances are what we've really came to see. Ellen Burstyn is a legendary actress and she truly exhibits her amazing acting ability and was showcased to near perfection. She truly catches your heart and the hearts among millions of fans who have watched this emotional comedydrama. The story her character and the flow of the story will melt your heart faster than a snowman in a microwave. Even though I always find road trip movies are the laziest scripts ever put on film Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore succeeds in keeping every scene and dialogue real. The mother and son interaction between Alice and Tommy are rich and very convincing. It is what you would expect from how a mother converses with her son. Their conversations will have you laughing and will likely have you in tears but no matter what there is seldom a dull moment when Alice and Tommy are together. Alice knows that she was not always the perfect mother and that she's doing everything she can to repair the damaged relationship between her and her son. And even though she's screwed up once too many times for us to even care about her there is still that little light out there that makes us root for her in her quest to find happiness and to rectify the situation she has to build the love and faith towards her son. You can't dismiss Alice by not trying to give her son the life he deserved and like always kids rebel that way feeling that their needs and wants are more important than the fact that you can't always get what you want. Together they keep us engaged and really reflect on the younger audience who may have had verbal matches with their parents. But in the end the love between them is the ultimate compromise each one embodies and that makes this film worthwhile.Burstyn was amazing in her role as Alice Hyatt. Sure she was imperfect and it makes you cringe after one stupid decision after another we realize that no one is perfect and everyone at one time has done stupid things. In the end I cared about her and her son and wanted very much to see her emerge victorious in achieving her goals whether little ones or ones that are more complex. Rounding out the supporting cast that had me intrigued was the performance from Harvey Keitel as Ben. He was just outstanding even though he was sadly underused. At one point in the movie he seemed very likable at first but without warning he goes 360 digress and before you know it he becomes a real jerk. He comes across as a warm guy with a trusting smile but then later we didn't expect him to be a twotiming wifebeating ahole. Keitel can play those kind of characters in his sleep. The other character that got my attention was the toughmouthy hardworking waitress Flo Castleberry played by Diane Ladd. Alice eventually ended up working as waitress at a greasy spoon diner run by the shrewd cantankerous owner Mel Sharples Vic Tayback. Ladd truly deserved her Best Supporting Acrress nomination. Many people get frustrated for not caring about people and the situations they're in but to me my anguish stems from caring way too much. I wanted to see Alice succeed. I wanted Tommy to get a better life for himself once he reaches adulthood. The storytelling is custom made to keep you on your toes and we root for them like we do when the Yankees beat the Red Sox in baseball or vice versa. And what's really great is that it's not the end all for Alice and Tommy but just the beginning of their new lives and that it'll be a long time before settling in. This truly is a very underrated from Martin Scorsese and truly one of the best films in 1974.".

Vera in this film is depicted as an out of control emotionally unbalanced woman. She is totally different from the Vera of the television series. That person was vulnerable by her simplicity.Burstyn earned the Oscar as a woman driven by despair desperately hoping to grab something positive in this life.

It looks like the affair is over when he attempts to discipline her unruly son.While trying to sing Alice winds up as a waitress in Mel's Diner. There she meets Flo played with relish by a gutsy Diane Ladd. Ladd is a foulmouthed babe one moment and an understanding friend the next. She well merited her best supporting actress nomination here. Vera in this film is depicted as an out of control emotionally unbalanced woman. She is totally different from the Vera of the television series. That person was vulnerable by her simplicity.Burstyn earned the Oscar as a woman driven by despair desperately hoping to grab something positive in this life. Vic Tayback is the only cast member who was also on the television series. He is much more subdued here.";

I must say that I don't think you'll ever find another picture in which the principal player cries as much as Ellen Burstyn does here as the title character. Not that she doesn't have good reason to she's put upon at every turn by the death of her husband a maniacal suitor Harvey Keitel and the desperation of trying to raise her son in virtually hopeless circumstances. What the film does reveal though to great effect I might add is the way Alice endeavors to persevere instead of relying on anyone else. She traipses from bar to bar to reestablish her dream of a singing career and when that fails takes a waitressing job to make ends meet. That's the kind of message that more folks need today instead of relying more and more for liberal politicians and the government to run to the rescue. So much for that rant but I had to get it out of my system after watching the evening news.While watching the picture I had a couple of my usual 'outside the box' type of observations that I'm prone to watching for the first of which occurred just a few minutes into the picture. I was amazed to hear Ian Hunter breaking into All The Way to Memphis' on Tommy's record player but then when I heard Alice acknowledge it was a Mott the Hoople song I couldn't believe it. Mott was my absolute favorite rock and roll band in the Seventies and I had just about every one of their albums. But I defy you to find any parent of the era to know who or what a Mott the Hoople was.The other thing I wondered about was why Coca Cola would have paid good money for product placement in this picture only to have Alice's husband die in a Coke truck wreck. Not to mention that he didn't seem to be that good a father to Tommy while wearing his Coca Cola work shirt in every scene he appeared in. I don't know why I think about stuff like this I just do.But I guess that's what makes this film an effective picture. It's a slice of life movie that probably approaches real life better than most with characters that come across as real with all of their hopes dreams and issues all jumbled up in a way that eventually work out in the end. I too at first like some other reviewers on this board felt that the ending was just a bit too unsatisfying for my taste. But then in thinking about it that's pretty much the way life works just when you have a resolution the story continues.".

The interplay between Haines and the Corps is probably realistic and offer a rare inside look into the socialization and molding of officers at the US Military Academy. Joan does a passable job but looks great. Well developed story will surprise those who think that all silent films offer little in the way of value today. Best shot in the movie is the superimposition of former soldiers from various eras over the marching of the band at the June graduation parade. I may be wrong but it appears that Edward Brophy is one of those extras seated in a train departing from West Point  he is credited as an Assistant Director in this movie as well as being credited in a documentary West Point made in 1927.

Crawford going to legendary status and Haines forced to give up acting when he wouldn't stay quietly in the closet.To the last day of her life Crawford insisted that the happiest couple she knew in Hollywood was Billy Haines and his partner. Haines landed on his feet and became one of the most sought out interior designers in Hollywood. Among his clients was Nancy Reagan.In this film Haines played his usual smart aleck whom we meet first on the Day Line boat to West Point to join the US Military Academy as a plebe. What struck me in his performance is how much it resembled Tyrone Power in one of his heroheel roles like A Yank In The RAF or In Old Chicago. Power in the sound era could have done this one in his sleep. Crawford meets Haines on the Day Line and this man starts putting the moves on Joan right then and there. The plot from there on in is pretty predictable given Haines's screen persona. The climax of course is the great ArmyNavy game. All the clichs in service academy films are there few films with this setting that had variation. Still Haines and Crawford are good and William Bakewell who is one of the few other cadets who becomes Bill Haines's friend even after he becomes a football hero stands out in the supporting cast.For myself I remember once a year going to Bear Mountain for an overnight get away with Daniel Strausbaugh and later David Frank and with both of them we did the Day Line. I miss you both and the film brought back some good times.".

He also meets and soon alienates a pretty girl with his cocky and selfish manner. Eventually when almost everyone hates him he learns humility and saves the day. When the film ends he gets the girl is the big man and has learned to be part of a team.So already WESTPOINT has a huge strike against it because it's so unoriginal and the best example of the word formulaic I have ever seen.

In addition he's a supertalented athlete and is the big star of the teambut he's also such a jerk that he eventually is without friends and is hated by all.

Great rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower.

And amazingly touching after Haines's character goes too far and nearly gets shunned by fellow cadets. The new humilityfilled Haines get s alastminute reprieve to play in the bill football game against Navy and despite a broken arm wins the game. Great rousing entertainment by MGM in this Haines formula film shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell also scores as the skinny follower. The handsomebutgoony character would be played by Clark Gable Cary Grant Gary Cooper and others in later decades another take on the beautifulbutdaffy dames played by Carole Lombard and Marion Davies. West Point is a winner!";

Although it's a silent I saw it with a marvelous musical score by David Davidson that hit the mark all the way and in what appears to be a restoration that puts it in mint condition.  It gets the comic treatment most of the time with Haines as a spoiled rich boy being tamed to become a good cadet and win the girl in the end as well as the respect of his team mates. His assurance in broad comedy is a delight to behold mugging in a way that Cary Grant would envya very appealing performance.Fun to see William Bakewell in an early role too. As host Robert Osborne pointed out he probably got his biggest moment of fame in GONE WITH THE WIND as the soldier on horseback who tells Scarlett O'Hara she better get out of Atlanta quickly. Here he plays the heroworshipper friend of Haines a not too subtle characterization as contrasted to Haines' ability with silent screen technique.Enjoyable fluff with titles that seem more modern in their slang than most silent films manage to do. Nothing new here but it's still fresh in its appeal. Joan Crawford is barely recognizable long before her makeover as a fullfledged star but does well with an ingenue role. The film belongs to Haines and he makes the most of it.".

The performances were convincing with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his comeuppance by film's end. It's hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times. I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro's Huddle 1932 to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking. The backdrop and integration of the Corps was well utilized but I was less involved than I thought that I would be. Perhaps Haines' character went too far or got away with too much. His repentance did not seem genuine enough and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the ArmyNavy game? Where's the Corps in that? Might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. Also I doubt very much that William Bakewell's weak puny character would ever have a reallife counterpart at West Point.All this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. Thank goodness that tradition still means something at West Point too unlike the vapid traditions of Ivy League schools only halfheartedly engaged in these days.As to the score it was appropriately martial. But there was a distinct overuse of snare drums. Using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et ALU as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. It rather lessened the viewing experience. I was ready to say I GET THE POINT ALREADY. With that enjoy the film but don't expect too much emotional involvement.".

	schema:reviewBody "Straightforwardly West Point is a clichridden formulaic vehicle for star William Haines jackass on campus learns the errors of his ways wins the big game and gets the girl. Plus it's a featurelength patriotic commercial for the United States Military Academy. The only way I find this interesting is in considering it in relation to Haines in real life being gay not only because of the irony this adds to this piece of chauvinism celebration for what at the time was an officiallyhomophobic institution but also because the narrative seems to call for a queer reading.Haines plays cocky and flamboyant cadet Brice Wayne who doesn't conform to the spirit of the Corps at West Point. He doesn't do anything quite right by that standard aboutfacing horse riding and generally making a mockery of the straightlaced institution except playing American football. He's a natural punter and excels at breaking through the physical defenses of other men. He rooms with and is followed around by Tex McNeil a smaller man who admires him with his stronger physique and who Wayne identifies as My boyfriend. This relationship is more pivotal to the plot than even Wayne's nominal heterosexual love interest played by Joan Crawford who wasn't yet a star at this point. Wayne outs himself in a newspaper interview which he refuses to deny when confronted about it by his team. He's subsequently shunned as an outcast with fellow cadets turning their backs to him when he approaches and they threaten to silence him with an Honor Committee meeting. Tex who as Brice also claims is scared of army officers begs Wayne to apologize and to convert to the spirit of the Corps promising him that he'll feel different after winning the big game and the girl. Thus beyond the generic college comedyturnedmelodrama plus Army commercial West Point relies upon the subtext of gay bashing just as the Army did at the timeand just as Hollywood did too. In real life Haines refused to deny his homosexuality and accept Louis B. Mayer's ultimatum of a lavender marriage and instead was silenced from the screen.Otherwise West Point is a dumb comedydrama full of jokey intertitles early on that would make for a script better suited to a talkie. Plus they're not funny. For instance one of Haines's quips is How are you Mr. West ....how's your Point? And what's with all the Mammy jokesdigs at Al Jolson? Title writer Joseph Farnham won the only Academy Award for this category perhaps partially based on the kind of work he did here. His intertitles serve a similar purpose in another college comedy from the same year The Fair CoEd with Marion Davies playing a similar role to the one Haines plays here except she played basketball. Sure West Point would've likely lost some of the flowing camerawork and its brisk pacing were it an early talkie but this is hardly an outstanding picture in these respects for an era when silent film had achieved a new pinnacle in the art form. As it stands a bit of a training montage and shots of marching stand out and the game is edited relatively well between documentary and staged scenes in an attempt to conceal that they didn't actually play football in a packed stadium. Both Davies and Haines would shortly hereafter fair better in Show People 1928 with an intelligent scenario and the direction of King Vidor who besides being a visuallycompetent filmmaker made a selfreferential film that's more compelling than the homophobic parallel seen here.".

He turns off people including a prospective girlfriend but eventually changes his attitude develops a true esprit de corps becomes a respected leader and wins the heart of the girl of his choice. You can see why this was an often used general plot for films. Here specifically William Haines stars as Brice Wayne scion of a wealthy family with superior athletic talent. On the boat trip up the Hudson he sees a pretty girlJoan Crawford as Betty and decides to introduce himself to her by pretending to be blind arousing her sympathy. He does quite a good job rolling his eyes back into his head. She is taken aback but provisionally accepted his advances. Later as he continued his smart aleck attitude she cooled toward him. He has a rival in upperclassman Bob Sperry. Nonetheless she cheers him as he dominates the offense of the plebe football squad and makes the varsity team take notice. The next season he's the star runner for the varsity early in the season. However eventually he's benched for his attitude. He fires back through a news reporter which escalates tensions. He shouts To hell with the Corps and quits the football team........The turning point occurs when Brice's roommate Tex McNeil William Bakewell tries to reverse Brice's attitude of To hell with the corps Brice finally pushes him into a locker he banging his head causing a concussion that puts him in the hospital.

Brice convinces him that he has given up his attitude of To hell with the corps'. After apologizing to the coach and players he is reinstated on the team but benched until the team is desperate for a score late in the game. Yes he becomes the hero of the moment.

It's an extraordinary and complex exploration of the concepts of guilt innocence betrayal justice and selfdeception.  It's not a movie about good guys and bad guys winners and losers.  Rather it concerns issues of both personal and institutional responsibility during war and its aftermath and it's immensely moving. Not flashy cinema on the surface but so beautifully written and acted that it stands out as one of the most haunting war films I've seen in the last several years far more so than the recent jingoistic Hollywood blockbusters.

One such woman is Vera Drake mother wife carer cleaner and parttime backstreet abortionist. Vera takes no money for her work and simply wishes to give them the help that they cannot afford to get through legitimate channels. However not everyone shares her view of abortion and it is only a matter of time before Vera's work comes to the attention of the authorities.Bearing in mind that this film being mentioned in the Oscars Baftas and general glowing support of critics it is easy to forget that it raced through the UK's multiplexes so quickly that I had to wedge myself into a soldout arthouse cinema just to see it sold out that is on an afternoon screening. It is even easier to forget that fewer than 1000 people have even voted for this title as I write this review. Certainly watching it yesterday it is easy to understand why it is feted by critics but not the choice of thousands of teenagers for a Saturday night at the movies because it is a very slow difficult film that is far from being a bundle of laughs. However it is still a fascinating film throughout even if it is not as strong as could have been expected. The story is basic and it can't quite fill the time maybe down to the way it was written  that is it was written as a frame and the dialogue was improvised and workshopped rather than scripted in the traditional fashion hence Leigh's surprise at one of his Oscar nominations!.While this weakens the story a little it seems to have produced great performances from the cast that do more than cover for the slow pace. Staunton is superb and she stands out in the best actress category. She is a complex character that the film never easily pigeonholes and it shows how balanced the film is in the way we are not swayed in her favour by her character whenever her morals come under fire. The film is very much hers and she is totally convincing in her character. She is well supported by natural performances from Graham Davis Marsan and Mays among others. Leigh's direction is very intimate and with sets and costumes he has painted a convincingly downbeat view of postwar Britain that looks good and adds to the realistic feel of the film.The film had a lot less debate than I had expected and it doesn't really come down on either side of the abortion issue I guess that it is better that it leaves it to us to think over rather than preaching to us  how nice and unusual to be treated like adults by a film. Overall though it is the story and Vera herself that make the film so involving the story is well framed and the workshop approach has produced some very good performances particularly from Staunton who outshines all others nominated alongside her in the Oscars. Deserves to be seen by larger audiences than it has had thus far but just don't expect it to be fastpaced fun or gripping  it is much more than that.".

Understate understate understate.Having lived in England from 1952 to 1959 and having married someone who was British who grew up during the war and it's aftermath this movie was like a bit of old home.

What this movie shows is not only the average life of a lower class family but the options forced on them that were different from those in the higher brackets of society.As anyone should know by know the movie is about illegal abortion in a rigidpuritanical society. Illegal that is for those without means but quite available to those who could grease the wheels of the medical establishment who had legal ways around the law. In other words if Roe v. Wade goes then Vera's will pop up again. There is no attempt to make a statement for or against abortion. As Mike Leigh has said abortion has been in every society for thousands of years.

Vera Drake is a woman who will go out of her way to be of use to anyone that needs her. In fact one's initial reaction to Mrs. Drake's activities is one of complete disbelief.Mike Leigh has created a film that although not easy to sit through is one of the finest movies that have come out of the English cinema in a long time. This director keeps getting better with every new film. The subject of the film is something that has been at the heart of the recent elections in the USA. With the new climate in this country it's easy to see that situations like the ones we see in the story could well be the norm here in a not too distant future.The main and perhaps the only reason for watching this extraordinary film is the portrayal of Vera by that wonderful actress Imelda Staunton. Her Vera is an example a person who can't say no to anyone in need. There is a scene when Vera is first confronted by the police during a dinner at her house where we see her face as charges are hurled at her then little by little Ms. Staunton breaks down in what is one of the great moments in acting by any actress in living memory. One can see her eyes fill with tears because it suddenly dawns on Vera the immensity of what she has done.The action takes place in 1950 in a London still ravaged by the effect of WWII. The film recreates the era with great details. Vera's flat is so tiny one wonders how can four grown up people live in such cramped quarters. Even though they are poor the Drake household is happy as they all live together without apparently getting on each other's nerves. Both children Ethel and Sid are well behaved they both love their parents. Stan and Vera love one another in a subdued but caring way. Is it possible that Vera could be the monster she is accused of being?The film also makes a point of the contrast between the humble way in which the Drakes live and the rich houses where Vera goes to work every day. Vera's home is tiny and the others are so well appointed it is only natural to assume that Vera will bear a resentment toward her employers but on the contrary she is a dignified woman who makes do with her meager wages.There is also the irony about how Susan Wells the daughter of one of Vera's employers goes through the same thing that the other girls that Vera helps and everything is done in a civilized way. Mr. Leigh shows us in this case how things are different because Susan is able to buy a solution to her problem and deal with it safely.The ensemble cast is marvelous. Imelda Staunton dominates the movie. We can't take our eyes away from the dowdy and plain woman we see on the screen. Phil Davis as Stan Vera's husband is excellent. Alex Kelly plays the mousy daughter Ethel who never utters a word this actress makes her real. Daniel Mays is Sid the son who can't understand what his mother has done. Eddie Marsan as Reg makes his character believable.The film is a triumph for Mike Leigh.".

A story that means something characters that feel rough and real in your hands like worn stones in an old pathway and above all film making with a purpose with no effort to dazzle just inform.It's not perfect but this is the kind of imperfection all of us in Hollywood should strive for.A word about the art direction too. I remember the 50's in England and yes it was just like that  I remember my parents kitchen being that dismal and green and yes English people and English families can be that incommunicative and yes they sat in front of the fire and talked about the war and the Blitz and yes we would sit in the parlour on Christmas day and eat off a table just like that.There. I've shared secrets with you. Now go and see this and keep crap like Alexander off the screens.";

	schema:reviewBody "Along with Abbas Kiarostami Mike Leigh must be the finest film artist now living. He sets up the story here very smartly it's Altmanesque the way that the lives intertwine. And like Altman the film has an observational style the camera sits still as people walk about the house though without his cynical humor. There is one comic relief character however who Vera's son measures for tailoring. The story is craftily puttogether  Leigh for all his realism isn't above cinema he's not against creating a scene. His entire movie is a buildup to individual looks and faces one especially fine scene is laid out incredibly well we see a car pull up outside inside we get the news that someone is going to have a baby then a knock at the door... What sets him apart from many socalled realists is that he's not an inept moviemaker. Even though a number of the scenes are complete of themselves and incredibly wellwrought none of them are scenes the only hint of cinematic flair that Leigh indulges in are the recurring motifs of heavenly music. The film is not traditional realism in terms of acting either  the actors all have a very distinct look that has to do with the way they're shot but each character each actor seems alive in such a way that isn't theatrical or exaggerated or false but still animated. There is an unflinching dedication to emotional consistency and detail such as the mechanics of the abortions but it always remains humane without ever turning sentimental when one woman is raped Leigh doesn't linger on the scene he doesn't really even show anything. Leigh makes few political points in the film. No doubt conservatives would see the film as a horror story this woman creeping around from house to house. It is not an issue movie. It is much more about families and people and how they support one of their own it could just as easily about someone accused of child molestation or who assisted suicides. The miracle of the film is that the catalyst for the emotional breakdown the abortions aren't just a device they're a whole complete film in their own right. It's what gives certain images such immediate painful power. His film planned as it is consists of events that are completely random and unforeseeable to the characters even though we the audience expect them it only serves to make them more devastating that we see it coming. We see an abortion we see a couple get engaged we see a rape we see that someone is expecting a baby. Leigh has empathy for everyone in the film and with the exception of three women  Vera's sister in law the woman who procures Vera's patients and the mother of one of the girls who she performs an abortion for  he doesn't turn anyone into a villain. Even one horrific psychiatrist interview grows into something where we realize haughty as he is he's not exactly out to get this girl who wants help although the scene hits home the difference involved in getting abortions performed by doctors and on the street. Sometimes the film is a little too obvious as when Vera's son can't deal with what she's done effectively sticking the knife in her and us. And you could complain that Staunton in the second half is ordered to put on a blank face as if she's had a stroke. But it's a simple view to see her as a smiling happy person in the first part and then a wrecked creature in the second  there is always something interesting in her performance completely aside from the looks on her face one such when the police ask to see her is the best image of the human face in years. In the beginning she uses her teeth in a very interesting way and though she's referred to as a woman with a heart of gold and while I'm not saying she isn't there's something more in her performance something indescribable  it's why she never stops to comfort the women she helps out. What prevents the film from being a display of the miserable like Lars von Trier at his worst is Leigh's innate connection to the legacy of the great humanists that of hope  not false optimistic hope but hope in something bigger and more intimate the human soul. 1010".

	schema:headline " Heartbreakingly Brilliant Acting Mike Leigh's Finest Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Winner of the Best Film Award at the Venice Film Festival director Mike Leigh's Vera Drake is the agonizing story of a stolid working class London married woman who leads two lives. Vera is Imelda Staunton who won most deservedly the Best Actress accolade in Venice. To her beloved and loving family she's the soul of gentleness the centerpiece of a happy home. She works as a day domestic for people a few rungs up on England's highly striated social ladder.But for many years the exact number known not even to her she's been the answer to the prayers of poor and lower class pregnant women who will not or can not carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. With a crude abortion kit including a cheese grater identical to the one in my kitchen hidden in a cupboard she accepts referrals from childhood friend Lily Ruth Sheen a viper whose mendacity and viciousness Vera never suspects.Vera's family hasn't a clue about her longtime passion to end unwanted pregnancies.But abortion isn't the scene that launches the story of the Drake family. She has two children Ethel wonderfully played by Alex Kelly and Sid. Husband Stan Phil Davis is a car mechanic working for wages for his brother one step up the economic ladder although his materialistic wife threatens to upset that status with her coy demands for the latest appliances.Vera regularly visits the sick and provides cheer and hot tea for the ill ones. She invites Reg Eddie Marsan for dinner. Her agenda is clear she hopes her hopelessly dorky Ethel and the awkward and mumbling Reg might hit it off. Both Marsan and Kelly are strong contenders for next year's Best Supporting Nerd Oscar nominations.But Vera's abortion activities are the heart of the tense story. She performs these procedures gratis getting referrals from Lily never suspecting that her acidtongued friend is paid by the pregnant women. They're cautioned not to mention the financial arrangement to Vera who does the job and bears the true mantle of risk.Vera Drake takes place in 1950 when still very war weary Britain was fighting with the U.S. in Korea. All the males in the story in one way or another were scarred or affected by World War II experiences and that was not an easy time for the women either. Stan continues distilling his combat experiences in slow confessions to his supportive and loving wife in bed with lights out. Abortion in 1950 in England was legal under some conditions one of which was being of the class that could easily with money and connections procure false medical testimony as to the need for terminating a pregnancy. None of Vera's patients I can't call them anything else desperate fearful facing enormous ostracism or worse if their condition became known to family and friends had that access. Vera with each procedure gently approaches the frightened and dependent women with the cheer appropriate for an ordinary visit to a friend afflicted with the usually benign flu. Perhaps she doesn't truly comprehend their fear of being alone after her ministration to them when she leaves with almost bubbly instructions to await the fetus's expulsion a frightening experience especially if alone but with no plan to return. She's efficient using a relatively safe nonsurgical abortifacient. Somewhat safe by the law of averages isn't in the long run good enough and one young woman almost dies.Her mother who knew Vera from before the war is questioned by police called by the hospital and she gives up her 1931 coworker.The police interrupt a family celebration to question and arrest Vera. She knows immediately why they are there and she both crumbles emotionally devastated while also displaying a quiet inner strength to insist in a soft sobbing voice that she just helps girls in trouble.Leigh who also wrote Vera Drake invests his lead character with a gripping vulnerability as well as a fundamental unyielding decency. Even the investigating police officers recognize she isn't a typical criminal. Burly Detective Inspector Webster Peter Wight is soon uncomfortable with what he has to do and he even spontaneously softens part of Vera's confession as it's written down by a junior colleague. Woman Police Constable Best subtly played by Helen Coker is gentle truly kind and one wonders whether this character would have had something supportive to say about Vera were she freed from her uniform.Vera's services fell squarely within the Offenses Against the Person Act 1861 and I'm very familiar with that statute having taught it many times in Criminal Law and Legal History classes. Courtroom scenes here brief as they are accurately reflect what a defendant confronted in His Majesty's tribunals. Leigh's camera work as in the wonderful TopsyTurvy angles in on Vera as she grasps the unfolding horror of her situation and the inevitability of a prison sentence. She struggles to remain the emotional center of her family when she in reality desperately needs shoring up. Vera is projected into the viewer's face for long shots and her terror is hurting to see.The arrant hypocrisy of England's sub rosa view of abortion at the time is displayed quietly but unforgettably as the daughter of one of Vera's customers her father a Ministry of Defense civil servant gets an abortion in a luxurious and safe facility for 100 guineas a fortune at that time after being savagely raped by a date a foppish cad. Without anything being said the viewer knows he was never reproached much less arraigned for his bestiality. But his victim Susan Sally Hawkins follows a script set up by a doctor and reinforced by a psychiatrist winkwink that insures that her weekend away from home is discreet. Traumatic the rape was unsettling the abortion too but for her life goes on with scarcely a bump.Frumpy a woman no one would notice on the Clapham omnibus Imelda Staunton as Vera is the heart and soul of the film her desperation at becoming embroiled with the law almost too heartbreaking at times to watch. But Leigh also makes sure that it's understood that illegal abortions posed high risks to vulnerable women. Hidebound English legal practice made criminals of women like Vera but police prosecutors and judges also knew that their activities too often spawned some true and irreversible tragedies including death. Leigh doesn't skip away from that reality. The Veras of her time were both benefactresses and potential killers.The male characters in Vera's family rally around her their love and commitment a bright spot. The police come out well too. But there's no avoiding the reality that manmade literally law and those who enforced it including the sympathetic but dutybound police put many women in the dock where conviction was virtually insured. And certainly many abortionists used far more dangerous methods than Vera.Sometimes agonizing to watch but endlessly riveting Vera Drake is one of the finest films from England in years. It's not a British counterpart to The Cider House Rules where Michael Caine's dashing devotion to his patients and to young orphaned boys in bucolic New England subtly removed the issue of laws restricting abortions from front and center attention. Vera Drake is raw and affecting. It's truly not so much prochoice as it is a retelling through one sympathetic character of many very sad tales.1010".

Because of his well known creative process the intrigue would be to see the actors and the characters and dramas and comedies they created. They were always worth watching in a voyeuristic way due to Leigh's unobtrusive camera work. Vera Drake is well worth seeing for these same reasons but Leigh has made a bigger and better movie than ever before even with all of Topsy Turvy's bombast. His ambitions as director are greater than ever. First of all to take on the subject of abortion is very brave. But I'll leave that for others to discuss. What was of interest to me from the opening shot was that this was going to be a visual tour de force and it was.Painting the scenes in dark crushing browns and greens with tight camera angles or letting the light in each scene had the feel of a well thought out canvas even the cut aways between scenes were new inventive and beautiful.And the acting is great and the scenes of the family interacting in close quarters moving in synch are so pitch perfect you feel they have been doing this for decades.So if you're thinking of seeing this movie sit back relax and prepare to be taken on a slow masterful ride.".

Part of this compassion is exemplified in a skill she has  she is a back street abortionist. She does not do it for financial gain but out of sympathy for the helpless women who cannot afford the psychiatric evaluations given to the rich who are then sent to private nursing homes for the procedures.Through a series of circumstances she is caught and convicted and we observe the effects on her family and those about her.Everything is flawless about this film. We really are in the cramped little flat where Vera lives in the near slum environment. Her cheerful domestic work in the wealthy homes of London is in stark contrast to the poverty of her own post war rationed existence.This film and the actors have to be nominated for many Oscars. Mike Leigh you have done it again. Bravo! 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Leigh has done it again. I adore Secrets and Lies my 2nd favorite film of all time and Leigh strikes gold again in the emotionally draining brilliantly directed study of a 50's era abortionist in London. Imelda Staunton gives yet another in Leigh's film outstandingly powerful and true performance as Vera Drake. She a innercity housewife and mother who spends much of her free time trying to help out the poor ladies of 50's London who are unable to get legal abortions. Some may consider this a hottopic issue film but it's moreover an independent study of a woman and her life and how her emotions play in her world. Every nuance of this film is perfectly crafted from every performance to the sets and the cinematography. The emotions overflow steadily especially after the traumatic dinner scene where the police arrive for Vera. The look of horror that Staunton displays and changes as she realizes what is happening is acting and direction at it's best. Why is it American films aren't able to capture this from it's performers? I can't praise this film enough and truly believe that this will be my favorite film of the year. It's a shame this film got only a small release and audiences seemed unmoved by it. I don't understand it. Hopefully DVD will allow those who missed it to catch up with it and relish in it's brilliance. It will be a rewarding experience for all to see. I am praying for Oscar noms all around but especially for Staunton. It is clearly and without any doubt the best female performance as of this date this year.".

Imelda Staunton gives yet another in Leigh's film outstandingly powerful and true performance as Vera Drake. She a innercity housewife and mother who spends much of her free time trying to help out the poor ladies of 50's London who are unable to get legal abortions. Some may consider this a hottopic issue film but it's moreover an independent study of a woman and her life and how her emotions play in her world. Every nuance of this film is perfectly crafted from every performance to the sets and the cinematography. The emotions overflow steadily especially after the traumatic dinner scene where the police arrive for Vera. The look of horror that Staunton displays and changes as she realizes what is happening is acting and direction at it's best. Why is it American films aren't able to capture this from it's performers? I can't praise this film enough and truly believe that this will be my favorite film of the year. It's a shame this film got only a small release and audiences seemed unmoved by it. I don't understand it. Hopefully DVD will allow those who missed it to catch up with it and relish in it's brilliance. It will be a rewarding experience for all to see. I am praying for Oscar noms all around but especially for Staunton. It is clearly and without any doubt the best female performance as of this date this year.";

	schema:headline " The most powerful female performance of the year";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think I need to fear rolling pins being thrown in my general direction when I say that powerful women roles are few and far between in Moviedom. That is not to say that there aren't any it's just that it is rare for a female performance to blow you away in any projector driven screening. This is due more to Hollywood's reluctance to create interesting and powerful roles for the female elite than the actresses' ability themselves. Where studio honchos salivate over the next Jack Nicholson powerhouse or Anthony Hopkins costume drama there are far far too few Charlize Theron's Monster to counter.However leave it up to Mike Leigh to try and correct this trend. In 1996 he wrote and directed the wonderful Secrets  Lies and his writing for the women leads was so strong that the Academy awarded nominations for both Best Actress Brenda Blethyn and Supporting Actress Marianne JeanBaptiste. Now in 2004 Leigh has given us the strongest performance by a male or female of the year with Imelda Staunton as the title character in the new film Vera Drake. Vera Drake is the story a family in 1950's London. Vera is the Motherhead and she is the jackofalltrades within the community. Her days are spend stopping in on elderly people to help them with their lunch working a various estates as a cleaning lady slaving at a light bulb producing factory and most notably as a caring individual who helps young and poor women terminate unwanted pregnancies. However if you were to ask Vera Drake what her role was she would probably admit to being a mother first  a caregiver to her husband and two children.A selfless woman who has little time for herself and therefore little time to digest the consequences of her illegal actions. Vera is goes about every bit of her business whether she is down on her knees cleaning the brass around a fireplace or helping a woman perform an abortion without a frown and usually with a smile on her face a whistling tune on her lips and the kettle on the stove. Vera's family are equally lovable individuals. Her husband Geroge Phil Davis works with his brother at an automobile repair shop. Her son Sid works as the local tailor and her daughter is a soft spoken lass who falls for a local man Vera invites over to dinner as a kind gesture. Together they make the quintessential family unit that we all envisioned 1950's households to encompass. But when a local girl has a bad reaction to a Drake endorsed abortion their world is turned on end. An investigation by the local police lead them to Vera's door on the night of celebration due to her daughters engagement. And as the police take Vera to the local booking station for a statement and sentencing Imelda Staunton does her best work through the tears and expressions mirroring the suffering at the anguish she has put her family through.Vera Drake might just be the best picture to be viewed by this critic this year. The characters are so robust and real that every time Vera put the kettle on for a cup of tea you would think she is doing it for everyone in the audience. We become captivated by their lives and interested in the effects the events have on the family unit. The writing is crisp and you can imagine these people saying these things to one another  a gift not often bestowed upon moviegoers in such a powerful form.Director Mike Leigh deserves most of the credit. He transforms Vera in front of us and manages to take an illegal action that is generally taboo in conversation and shows us the innocent side of the argument where rich people pay large sums of money to go specialists but the poor and equally needy require the services of a local underground network. As someone who sits on one side of the abortion issue I was amazed at the conclusion of the film how nonpreaching and argumentative the film ended up being. Vera goes about her business like a friend helping out someone in need. She deals not in the politics or the societal view of her task but rather as someone just doing what is best for those found in situations where this solution is the only viable option. Leigh's writing and directing however are overshadowed by the incredible performance by Imelda Staunton. This maybe the first film that I can remember where a female should win an Academy Award for a role that didn't harbor any speeches into the camera or voice over dramatization of the situation. With that I give Vera Drake a very strong recommendation.www.gregsrants.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The simplicity that this film achieves is where it's strength is gained and the manner in which the director uses his actors allows the audience to actually feel the same emotions as the characters. Story takes place in London in the 1950's where families are still struggling to piece together their lives following the war but one chipper woman named Vera Drake Emelda Staunton spends her time helping others. Vera works cleaning the homes of the rich and also manages to pop in on sick and bedridden people that need care but she's equally adored by her husband Stan Phil Davis and her two adult children. Also once or twice a week she performs illegal abortions on women that need help. SPOILER ALERTVera is handed a name and address by Lily Ruth Sheen who gets money for organizing these procedures but doesn't pay Vera anything as she does this for the sake of helping those in need. One day during dinner the Drake's are visited by the police who arrest Vera after an abortion goes wrong and a girl almost dies and this leaves the family in total shock as they never knew she was doing this. With her family sitting by and being supportive the court agrees that Vera is not a threat to do this again and even though many rely on her care this doesn't stop the judge Jim Broadbent from making an example of her.This film is directed by the great Mike Leigh Naked Secrets  Lies TopsyTurvy who has shown considerable skill in filming intimate stories about the English working class. Leigh also is known to structure his stories around the improvisations of his actors and with this film he didn't tell them the secret involving Vera so when they first hear about her performing abortions their reactions are for the most part real. This film is designed to be told in a very simplistic and honest manner for realism and it works completely on that level but it's biggest strength comes from the perfect casting of Staunton. With Staunton's wonderful face this film can be looked at in two halves with the first half showing that never ending smile and displaying her infectious upbeat personality but once the police enter her home her face becomes a mask of guilt and shame. One of the most indelible images in film in recent years is the look that Staunton gives when the police show up which will change her and her family forever. It's a powerful moment and in it's own quiet manner this film is more powerful than any loud action film that gets churned out by Hollywood on a regular basis. This film doesn't take a stand on abortion one way or another because that's not what it's about instead audiences are given the privilege of viewing an extremely strong film aided by an amazing performance by Staunton.".

A hardworking cleaning lady by day a devoted wife and mother the rest of the time and Vera even looks after her sick mother on top of her other duties this paragon of working class excellence is also an unpaid abortionist for a little while at five o'clock on a Friday  or occasionally at other times. Her friendly matteroffact approach to 'helping young women' is disarming both in her bedside manner and in almost drawing us in to accepting that something is happening without having to know the details. But know we do right down to the suction pump and cheesegrater for carbolic soap that are her stockintrade.Yet the shock value is still largely from what is unexpressed or unseen whether it is the ablutions Vera performs on folk or the first stages of an over amorous advance that we are all too horribly aware will end in date rape. This is a film that is driven by superb acting meticulous set recreation and a very believable script. It would have been easy to do the same story relying on hack sensationalism but Leigh's approach is more that of the artist near the height of power.The history and legislation on abortion developed in Britain in an almost unique way largely as successive measures in harmreduction and is maybe worth mentioning to clarify the backdrop in which the film is set. Until the Abortion Act of 1967 the law of Offences Against the Person Act was rigorously applied and criminalised any abortion or attempted abortion  even say prosecuting a 13year old girl who attempted to induce an abortion on herself by taking laxatives and sitting in a hot bath. The only way out was a defence by a doctor that he acted to save the life or health of the mother. In the film this is demonstrated by an upper class girl who is granted an abortion at a cost of 100 guineas reduced from 150 pounds. The financial pressure this created is put in context when we are told that a television considered an unattainable luxury by Vera's family cost 36 quid or that the 2 guineas charged by Vera's middleman was a vast sum for poorer women. The Abortion Act of 1967 16 years after Vera's crime allowed an abortion to be performed under certain conditions and was introduced to bring uniformity to the law to clarify the law for doctors and to stem the misery and deaths resulting from unhygienic risky and illegal abortions. Before 1967 thousands of women were victims of botched abortions. The legislation rather than taking sides on the moral issues simply tried to make a terrible situation less terrible. Perhaps it is for this reason that although abortion has always been controversial in Britain it has not attracted the sometimes violent confrontation that has characterised the debate in the USA.Remarkably Leigh's film doesn't appear to take sides either. It's the heartfelt differences of opinion in the characters when everything comes to light that make us more aware of how genuine the different views on the subject really are. Even Vera's sister in law portrayed through most of the film as quite a heartless character I felt was seen as more sympathetic when we realise she simply wanted a Christmas at home with her husband and nothing to do with the lawbreaking Vera. Britain's ProLife Alliance Party in a press release gave the film a cautious welcome though some people have branded the character an 'abortion loving witch' simply because Vera wins us over as is a nice person before we find out her secret. Most people I think will find the film very intellectually stimulating though and feel that a wide range of views and situations were incorporated into this brave piece of cinema that successfully portrays a pivotal epoch in British history.".

	schema:headline " Realism transcended by art and exceptional acting";
	schema:reviewBody "On the surface it looks simple a realistic movie depicting 1950 London and portraying a kind character fighting unfair antiabortion laws. But is it just that?REALISM TRANSCENDED BY IMAGEGranted the historical reconstitution is convincing. Exteriors and interiors are lifelike. Social types are well outlined. However Mike Leigh sublimes this realism providing an archetypal rendering.Colours and lighting have a purpose showing the opposition of living standards. On the one hand cold colours and dim lighting for middle and lower classes dwellings workplaces etc. On the other warm colours and bright lighting for upper classes and institutions homes including Frank's doctor psychiatrist clinic courtroom jail etc. This contrast is by no means natural notably the brightness in jail is surprising.The camera emphasises this opposition we seem to bump into walls and persons at Vera's home shots are close camera movements are rare as if we could barely move. In contrast in the bourgeois' home shots are more distant and the camera moves as if to benefit from available space.This sublimed vision has an objective going beyond the description of a period to deal with universal themes i.e. social classes money abortion justice values. AND BY ACTINGMain actors rehearsed extensively before shooting started lengthy discussions about script and characters thorough documentation about the period and personalities improvisation of scenes that were afterwards used in the movie or not. This largely explains the real life feeling of the movie.However just as noted above for image this acting method transcends roles actors do not just portray historical persons they enrich characters with their own personalities and emotions. Immersion is a twoway street actors grow into roles and inversely characters are modelled on actual individuals. This provides extra depth to characters and makes us feel closer to them they are just not bygone persons it seems we could meet them nowadays.It has been said many times nonetheless let's repeat Imelda Staunton's performance is absolutely outstanding and explains to a large extent the quality of the movie. Other actors are also excellent even in minor roles.CHARACTERS WE CAN CONNECT TOAll characters are sympathetic with only two exceptions Lily who immorally profits from abortions and black market Joyce who is rigid and greedy. This approach is intentional we understand how everyone thinks. A doctor informs the police but has no choice. The police arrest Vera but are decent. A mother gives Vera away but only after undergoing pressure from the police. A doctor and the psychiatrist benefit from the abortion business but are confined by the system. The magistrate is ruthless but complies with the law.Conversely if Vera is kind she is not a saint which prevents the movie from being one sided. She means well however her methods are dangerous because of her a young woman almost dies. Technically she helps young girls out yet fails to deliver an essential psychological support once finished she goes rapidly leaving the despaired women alone. She is so naive she does not understand her friend Lily is exploiting her. She does not evaluate the consequences of her action notably for her family who at the end is left morose.ABORTION IS THE MOVIE PROCHOICE?The movie is not a straightforward prochoice manifesto. We hear arguments from both sides. On the one hand the friendly Sid cannot understand nor forgive what Vera has done. Even the fair Stan and Frank do not take sides. There is a general condemnation of abortion.On the other wealthy families can bypass the law while poor or even middleclass families cannot. Because abortions have to be illegal a woman almost dies. Reg delivers a powerful quote It don't seem fair. Look at my mom six of us in two rooms. It's all right if you're rich but if you can't feed them you can't love them can you?

	onyx:emotionText "On the surface it looks simple a realistic movie depicting 1950 London and portraying a kind character fighting unfair antiabortion laws. But is it just that?REALISM TRANSCENDED BY IMAGEGranted the historical reconstitution is convincing. Exteriors and interiors are lifelike. Social types are well outlined. However Mike Leigh sublimes this realism providing an archetypal rendering.Colours and lighting have a purpose showing the opposition of living standards. On the one hand cold colours and dim lighting for middle and lower classes dwellings workplaces etc. On the other warm colours and bright lighting for upper classes and institutions homes including Frank's doctor psychiatrist clinic courtroom jail etc. This contrast is by no means natural notably the brightness in jail is surprising.The camera emphasises this opposition we seem to bump into walls and persons at Vera's home shots are close camera movements are rare as if we could barely move. In contrast in the bourgeois' home shots are more distant and the camera moves as if to benefit from available space.This sublimed vision has an objective going beyond the description of a period to deal with universal themes i.e. social classes money abortion justice values. AND BY ACTINGMain actors rehearsed extensively before shooting started lengthy discussions about script and characters thorough documentation about the period and personalities improvisation of scenes that were afterwards used in the movie or not. This largely explains the real life feeling of the movie.However just as noted above for image this acting method transcends roles actors do not just portray historical persons they enrich characters with their own personalities and emotions. Immersion is a twoway street actors grow into roles and inversely characters are modelled on actual individuals. This provides extra depth to characters and makes us feel closer to them they are just not bygone persons it seems we could meet them nowadays.It has been said many times nonetheless let's repeat Imelda Staunton's performance is absolutely outstanding and explains to a large extent the quality of the movie. Other actors are also excellent even in minor roles.CHARACTERS WE CAN CONNECT TOAll characters are sympathetic with only two exceptions Lily who immorally profits from abortions and black market Joyce who is rigid and greedy. This approach is intentional we understand how everyone thinks. A doctor informs the police but has no choice. The police arrest Vera but are decent. A mother gives Vera away but only after undergoing pressure from the police. A doctor and the psychiatrist benefit from the abortion business but are confined by the system. The magistrate is ruthless but complies with the law.Conversely if Vera is kind she is not a saint which prevents the movie from being one sided. She means well however her methods are dangerous because of her a young woman almost dies. Technically she helps young girls out yet fails to deliver an essential psychological support once finished she goes rapidly leaving the despaired women alone. She is so naive she does not understand her friend Lily is exploiting her. She does not evaluate the consequences of her action notably for her family who at the end is left morose.ABORTION IS THE MOVIE PROCHOICE?The movie is not a straightforward prochoice manifesto. We hear arguments from both sides. On the one hand the friendly Sid cannot understand nor forgive what Vera has done. Even the fair Stan and Frank do not take sides. There is a general condemnation of abortion.On the other wealthy families can bypass the law while poor or even middleclass families cannot. Because abortions have to be illegal a woman almost dies. Reg delivers a powerful quote It don't seem fair. Look at my mom six of us in two rooms. It's all right if you're rich but if you can't feed them you can't love them can you? Hence the message is prochoice in the context of social inequalities. Is this message universal? Each spectator will decide for oneself.We witness seven abortions of which six performed by Vera in different contexts which illustrates the complexity of the topic rape inability to raise another child infidelity probably prostitution probably.COMPELLING SCENESI believe every major movie has at least a prominent scene condensing its main qualities.

	schema:reviewBody "Nobody captures working class England and its socially reticent inhabitants better than directorscreenwriter Mike Leigh does. He brings a deeply felt authenticity to postWWII London in the setup of his rather controversial story and one needs to give credit to Leigh for not turning the film into a polemic about abortion. At the same time though the movie clocks in at over two hours and its unrelenting bleakness has a wearing effect especially since Leigh takes a decidedly episodic approach to his story. The title character is a simple frumpy woman so kindhearted that she thinks nothing of tending to those she sees as less fortunate whether they be her mother her invalid neighbor or the parade of mainly young girls who find themselves with unwanted pregnancies. Vera sees no distinction when it comes to helping these people selflessly and to her immediate family especially her loving husband she is nothing less than a saint beyond reproach. Leigh takes his time in establishing this fact too much time really and pacing is part of the movie's problem. It appears that he is intent on showing how matteroffact her illegal abortion practice is compared to her everyday activities with her family. To some degree the juxtaposition of scenes maximizes the later drama of consequences and ramifications but the results are uneven because there is nothing remotely surprising about what happens to her.The second half of the movie does develop a compelling emotionalism thanks to a stunning turn by Imelda Staunton. Until the moment she is arrested Vera seems almost like a British version of Betty White's character on The Golden Girls all applecheeked optimism offering a cup of tea to soothe everyone's worries. However when Vera realizes what is happening to her Staunton effectively uses an expression of glazed shock followed by an implosion of endless crying jags to illuminate the inner turmoil of her character. For the most part it's an economical performance and yet thanks to Staunton one never questions the sheer anguish her character is experiencing. The other actors are quite good in particular Phil Davis as her unsuspecting mechanic husband Stan Daniel Mays as her enterprising son Sid a men's store salesman Peter Wight as the guardedly sympathetic inspector and as two unlikely lovebirds Alex Kelly as her hopelessly lumpish daughter Ethel and Eddie Marsan as the schlubby bachelor upstairs. In fact his proposal scene to Ethel is a charming moment in their fumbling realization of their need for each other. Another keenly observed scene is one in which Sid deftly massages a middleclass customer's heartfelt desire to look like a swell at an important function. These are the moments in the movie that feel the most truthful and Leigh excels at directing such scenes without pretension.The aim of the film is sound. Leigh wants to exalt the heroism of abortion providers during an era of extreme repression and he makes sure to be true to the psychology of the working class at that time. Consequently it is compelling how he keeps Vera inarticulate during the most dramatic moments even when she's being interrogated and realizes a prison sentence is at hand. What I didn't appreciate as much is how Leigh uses certain characters simply to move the plot along only to drop them later for instance the character of Susan and her plight are introduced simply as a counterpoint to Vera's method showing how the rich took care of their abortions. There is the revelation that Vera's friend selfishly pocketed money from the pregnant girls all those years and we are robbed of a confrontation scene that should have occurred between her and Vera about it. One could watch the movie to savor the acting but truth be told the film is probably about half an hour too long as one scene after another signals the end of this desultory story. Despite Staunton's stellar performance I have to admit I felt relieved when it was all over.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thank heavens for Mike Leigh because you sure wouldn't see an American film with a serial abortionist as the heroine.The movie is set in 1950 and Vera Drake has been helping out young pregnant women for so long she's not even sure when she started. And she really does see herself as helping out she won't use the A word. Her clients are not all young mind you. There is the poor woman for example with six or seven children already and a sick husband who can't bear the thought of another. Nor are they all helpless or innocent  one has had at least one before  or even poor although most certainly are. The cost is two guineas but Vera takes no pay  the money going to her abortion pimp who also deals in rationed consumer goods for a profit.Vera truly has a heart of gold. I really can't think of a movie character  leaving aside that Jesus fellow  more selfless or altruistic. What is remarkable is that in part because of Leigh's naturalistic script and in part because of Imelda Staunton's extraordinary performance  you never for a moment doubt the truth of that claim. When Vera is arrested after one of her syringe and soapy water abortions finally goes wrong almost killing a young woman she is not thinking of herself but of the effect on her family.And this is when this already beautiful film gets even more heartbreakingly sublime. Her husband his brother her daughter even the daughter's hapless fianc stand by her without question. Only her son is appalled thinking that she has done something not only wrong but dirty but his father shows him that he must forgive his mother as she would forgive him. And so he does. Only the brotherinlaw's wife a woman with airs condemns Vera. Tellingly she is also a materialist.For this movie is mostly about the virtue of the working class another reason why it is impossible to conceive of it in an American version. Is what Vera did wrong? I don't think so but even if you do there is no denying that only the poor paid the price of unwanted pregnancy when abortion was a crime. The rich as we see in the case of desperate young woman who is date raped get a referral over tea at a tony restaurant see a Harley Street doctor get a dispensation from a winking psychiatrist and have the deed done in a posh sanatorium.In addition to Staunton the whole cast is wonderful. Special kudos go to Philip Davis as Stan the husband. This is the best picture of 2004.".

The rest of her family is everaware of her love as well and her children Sid and Ethel as well as her husband George realize her importance in their lives. All of the scandal erupts amidst a time of celebration and the viewer is aware of the emotional vacuum that seems to be present when Vera is absent.The second strongest aspect of the film is Leigh's wonderful gritty direction.

And think the viewer must as we are presented with Vera's kindheartedness in contrast to her lifeendangering acts and the tangible life of the girls in contrast to present but nearinvisible but life of the babies in their wombs. Sure conservative critics view Drake as a political prochoice piece of garbage but Leigh does not make the film so straightforward or so onedimensional. He makes no one the clear villain with the possible exception of two women one who is evidently prochoice and one who is evidently prolife.Yet amongst Leigh's thoughtprovoking images and parallels is Andrew Dickson's music which at first is quite beautiful and even troubling but then takes a turn for the worst as the same theme is played over and over again distracting from the rest of the film which is purposefully silent. Also I feel that towards the end of the film the conflict is made too simple and too rushed. Some scenes are unnecessary to the film but I think Leigh is just further contrasting happiness and celebration with eventual tragedy.I would encourage those who watch the film to look past the idea that this movie is mere political propaganda. We must examine Drake's character see her motives and question her actions but also her heart. The questioning of one's own moral values should not be ceased regardless of his or her political view.

	schema:reviewBody "Vera Drake is a brilliant movie I almost missed it when it came out because it didn't seem to interest me for no particular reason. I finally watched it one night after coming from college with some friends. The movie blew us all away immediately. The first thing that stands out is Imelda Staunton's gripping performance as Vera Drake a middleclass mother and wife who's Kindness personified. Mike Leigh leaves no doubt that he wants us to sympathise with Vera from the beginning. We quickly see her taking care of a wheelchairbound neighbour and then inviting a lonely neighbour to come and have supper with her. She works as a housemaid for a rich family and she has a loving patience for her family. On the side she helps young women end unwanted pregnancies.Staunton's performance could carry the movie alone she displays a wide range of emotions mostly through facial expressions and body language. The screenplay is very visual and the actors give great performances without many words. Staunton can go from joy to fear to confusion in a matter of seconds she can put on the most innocent look or show pity compassion and frustration quite easily and convincingly. However one shouldn't forget Philip Davis' performance as Vera's husband Stan I noticed he was nominated for a BAFTA I wish he had garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor too. He was really good as a loving father and husband who tries to keep the family together when Vera's secrets are found out. I love the way he's clearly hurt by his wife's secret double life and her crimes and yet he tries not to judge her immediately but shows compassion and tolerance. Their chemistry on the screen was full of tenderness and love.Kindness is something which appears quite suddenly and in the most unexpected places in this movie. For instance the way the police inspectors handle the situation when they go to Vera's home is very interesting Vera is completely frightened out of her wits and the inspector just treats her patiently and with compassion instead of scaring her even more. This scene is full of dramatic intensity because she's caught when she's celebrating with her family her daughter's wedding engagement. They're all enjoying themselves when the cops arrive and disrupt the harmony with their formalisms and questions. When they eventually take Vera away you can just feel her life has come to an end. The scene where she confesses to Stan her guilt is gutwrenching! There is a subplot in the movie which doesn't make a lot of sense to some people. No one really gets Susan's role in the movie and why she disappears one third into the narrative. This is perhaps where Leigh is more political in the movie. Susan's rape and unwanted pregnancy contrast well with the women Vera helps on the one hand we have the rich Susan who for the right amount can get an illegal abortion at a hospital with a luxurious treatment on the other hand we have the poor women who need backward methods to dispose of their pregnancies which sometimes backfire and kill them this is how Vera gets in trouble. The point seems to be that so long as you have money you can get away with this crime exposing the hypocrisy of the law which only affects the poorer classes. Otherwise Leigh isn't particularly political he takes a very naturalistic approach to the issue Vera's secret job is seldom seen in the movie it's not something that's on her mind all the time it's just routine for her the movie actually focus more on her and her family's routine than anything else.The ending is tragic for Vera but depending on how you feel about abortion you'll either love it or hated it personally I felt depressed with her fate and yet I'm glad it ended the way it did any other way would have been unrealistic to me. The court scenes are so unlike what one's used to seeing when the judge asks Vera if she has anything to say on her behalf I was afraid she'd give one of those preachy speeches in these type of movies instead and remaining fully in character Vera just remains silent and accepts whatever's coming to her. It was amazing! The last scene of the movie the Drake family eating without Vera in complete silence was worth a thousand words about how they feel not having her around anymore.With some fairness Staunton would win the Oscar for Best Leading Actress this year her performance was really beautiful and heartwarming. But I'm not holding my breath for her and expect to see Hilary Swank winning instead. I'm sure Leigh won't win Best Director either and personally I feel the movie's strength lies on the great naturalistic screenplay. The characters felt real at all times they never acted out of character there was conflict and many incredible dramatic moments. It's a simple screenplay the sort the Academy usually gives the Oscar to like 'Fargo' or 'The Crying Game' I'm feeling very hopeful this movie will win Best Original Screenplay it is a striking portrait of the human condition against a great conflict!".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in working class London in the 1950s long before abortion was legalized Mike Leigh's Vera Drake is about a middleaged wife and mother of two who performs abortions on young women without means only because she wants to help them out. Winner of the Golden Lion at the 61st Venice International Film Festival Vera Drake is a powerful character study about a generous but naive woman who allowed her good deeds to be undermined by secrets and lies. Imelda Staunton is outstanding as Vera projecting a love for humanity that is hard to resist.Vera lives in a modest London flat with her husband Stan Phil Davis a garage mechanic who works with his brother Frank Adrian Scarborough and her two adult children Sid Daniel Mays a tailor and Ethel Alex Kelly a withdrawn factory worker. Pregnant women are directed to Vera through a mercenary friend Lily Ruth Sheen who requires payment for her services but Vera does not ask for money and seems naively unaware of Lily's commercial ventures. She works in secret dispatching her troubled women with the same cheery efficiency that she shows when fixing a tasty dinner for her family.Employing a procedure that has worked effectively for centuries Vera uses only lye a pump and syringe and boiled water to perform the abortion. She stays with the young women only long enough to offer them tea and sympathy explaining that soon they will feel a pain down below and if they get themselves to the toilet with a little bleeding everything will come away. Though the film is primarily a social drama political points are scored when Vera's home remedies are contrasted with the professional medical procedures that only the wealthy can afford.The family is closeknit and very supporting and when Ethel announces that she is engaged to neighbor Reg Eddie Marsan it seems as if their happiness is boundless. Yet when one of Vera's patients ends up in the hospital in serious condition a police investigation is triggered and Vera is arrested on a felony charge on the same day the family is celebrating daughter Ethel's engagement. Her personality undergoes a heartbreaking change and the once loquacious woman is left mumbling incoherently unable to mount a defense of her actions. At the end I was left with anger at an inhumane system interested only in setting an example a profound sadness for Vera and for the betrayal felt by her family and a renewed experience of love for the people around me.".

Oh girlfriends got knocked up in those works but they were always seen as manipulative strangleholds to the freedom of the Angry Young Men they should just take care of it. With exquisite attention to complete period detail in body language coloring clothes physical surroundings etc. that fill the screen as much as he did theatrically in recreating The Mikado in Topsy Turvy Mike Leigh takes us to the other side of that doorway that the older movies rarely showed us though in the '60's the original Alfie and the schmaltzier Hollywood Love with the Proper Stranger gave us an exaggerated view. The film also works in tandem with Peter Mullan's The Magdalene Sisters in showing how cruel life in Ireland and Britain could be for women with unwanted pregnancies though evidently this film is not a docudrama.This complete mise en scene including contrasts with the upper crust families she works for as a domestic very gradually gives us the matter of fact quotidian of Drake's mundane life of caring for her family and the neighborhood unfortunates including girls she helps out. Imelda Staunton's selfeffacement into the role and her character's into her environment doesn't prepare us for how she comes to completely overwhelm us.Leigh created a similar working class world in All of Nothing but that film had no trajectory virtually nothing happened to those characters and none of the characters were as completely sympathetic as naive Drake is. It is wonderful to see a character actress get to fill the screen for long emotional closeups. The audience in the almost sold out theater I was in was completely gripped in silence and holding their breath as her life played out. Too bad the hot subject matter of abortion will probably keep her from getting an Academy Award. Because of the vivid realism in the film it is frustrating that there is no factual information provided for example as to when abortions became legally available to all women in Britain. A few facts are thrown out about enforcement and consequences but those are anecdotal though the class differences are portrayed vividly. One is left with complete sadness that for all the specificity of time and place in the film we could easily go back to a time like this when abortions are illegal and unsafe because there will always be women who feel that is their only option whether single married poor or rich. The past is prologue to the future.".

As David Steel sponsor of the private member's bill that became the legalising act of Parliament wisely pointed out 'abortion did not begin in 1968'. Women have always limited the number of babies they choose to have. It was just that before 1968 these methods were illegal and often horrific. The method practised by Vera Drake in this film pouring soapy water into the womb to terminate the pregnancy was a popular one. It was effective and generally safe. Generally not always. Other methods used by women included drinking a bottle of whisky and rolling down the stairs. Women would push knitting needles into their wombs and similar horrors. Their desperation to abort was such. Surely noone wants a return to this? Heterosexual women have every right to an active sex life and to limit the number of children they have. As the film points out for the rich and wellconnected there were always doctors willing to perform safe if illegal abortions for money. It was always the poor but no less sexually active and fertile women who had to resort to women like Vera Drake. The struggle for women's reproductive rights continues and the hysterical antiabortionists have not given up in the least. They are not 'Prolife' they are prodeath penalty pronuclear weapons prowar in almost any form. Women are not mere breeding machines for men despite some reactionary men wishing they were. A slogan once went If men became pregnant abortion would be a sacrament. Every child should be a wanted child. There is no shortage of unwanted babies needing parents to adopt them. Indeed there is an oversupply. The natural sex drive of the young is such that there will always be some unwanted pregnancies although hopefully less and less as sex education becomes more widespread and contraceptives more readily available but always some. Hence there will always be a need for safe free and legal abortions hopefully as early as possible in the pregnancy. We should all be grateful to Mike Leigh for this thoughtful film reminding us of the bad old days which surely no sensible people would wish us to return to.".
