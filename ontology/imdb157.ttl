I can't say I really enjoyed this film as it is not what I look for in horror films. It's a very good film  well acted well directed suspenseful and emotional but it's not really fun to watch. It starts off with the dog getting infected and from then on tension is built up slowly as you sense the dog is getting angrier and angrier. Eventually it snaps and starts killing people. The bulk of the film focuses on when Donna and her son are trapped in the broken down car because Cujo attacks whenever they try to leave. You can feel all the desperation pain and isolation of Donna and her son as they lay trapped inside. It makes you think twice about dogs and certainly what you would do in such a situation. Would you run attack the dog or wait until help arrives? This is not a fun campy or cheesy horror film so don't watch if you're a fan of cheese. It's for those who want to feel suspense fear and pain.".

	schema:reviewBody "We all know Cujo is a giant St. Bernard that has to kill because he is rabid.  The film works as a horror film because of that concept but this film and the story writer behind it believe that paybacks are a bitch. Retribution is always around the corner and when it is your time you don't know if it is going to from a guy in a hockey mask a massive great white sharka 58 red and white Plymouth Fury some idiot with long finger knives or a lovable Saint Bernard.  Whatever it is though sin always accounted for.  Cujo subscribes to that theory.Everyone that dies in this film with the exception of maybe one does so because they are not very likable people to begin with.  They are all tainted and when Cujo gets a hold of them we are almost glad that he wants their blood.  But it is the climax of the film that is the most intriguing. Because here we have a woman who has gotten rid of her sin.  But she now has to face the music not for what she is doing but for what she has done. And if you read the book you will see that it sticks to that theory and message much more than the film does.  It is understood that Cujo has to have a happy Hollywood ending and that is fine but the book tells a much more clear yet paradoxically convoluted tale of a boy his dog and how sin is never really forgiven.What is also great about Cujo is how it shows the dog coming unravelled. We see the transformation from lovable suck of a family dog to vicious killing machine that has an insatiable need for blood.  We see his nose get more wet we see how certain noises bother him more and we see how much saliva this dog has stored up in his nasty mouth.Cujo is a good movie.  It is scary especially the last half hour and it actually has a point.  It also does a fairly good job of bringing King's vision to life.  It is not easy to do that after all King has a very vivid imagination.  But Cujo comes close.  Very close".

Which it turns on its owner and also terrorises that of a unfaithful women and her son that came to get their vehicle repaired but only to be trapped in their broken down car with rabid dog outside trying to get to them.Beethoven yep I just couldn't stop thinking of the lovable Beethoven when watching this flick. That was one of my childhood favourites but I guess it isn't going to be quite the same when I come across it again. I won't look a Beethoven the same way again. Anyhow this is one of the King's bettermade adaptations. Although it's a long way from brilliant it delivers a stable amount of interest and tension to proceedings. This was my second viewing of it and it has hardly lost any of that fullblooded impact it generated especially the heart racing standoff between the dog and the trapped victims. I wouldn't be surprise that you don't think your watching a horror film to begin with as the opening basis centres around a family melodrama raising martial issues and work commitments. It kind of comes across as cheesy in its supposed sentiment in those moments. Then it kicks into gear with the slow beginning making way for a crackerjack final 40 minutes of simple confined tension built around isolation. It also doesn't hold back on the vicious dog attacks with ample ferocity and raw suspense being belted out. Watching people being mauled apart by this giant scuffed up dog wasn't that pleasant at all. The gore effects were more than adequate and it looked the part of a rabid dog perfectly. But you couldn't help but feel sorry for the dog as it's more of a victim then the people who he's terrorising. Honestly I cared more for the misunderstood pooch than the initial victims. The characters weren't entirely likable with the exception of one or two but I didn't connect with them in this mess. The story is simple and plays it straight but that doesn't mean it avoids the familiar clichs. Although it doesn't entirely hurt the film well it kind of enhances it actually. A surprising factor I found was that the film's camerawork was well choreographed with plenty of swirling shots and when it needed to up the ante it became rather erratic to fit in with the mood. Also add in some glorious slowmo. The score on the other hand I thought was forcefully unbalanced and didn't fit into the mood at times. The performances are all sturdy and very hard to knock. Dee WallaceStone was at the top of her game as the wayward wife and Danny Pintauro as her worried son was equally so. Daniel Hugh Kelly gives a likable performance as the father and of course the endearing dog is worth a mention too. The strong performances make this traumatic experience even more believable.A tautly constructed and workman like film that won't push the boundaries but its intensely petrifying in its simple origins.".

The Camber family composed of Joe wife Charity and son Brett might collectively have 25 lines which is ridiculous. Roger Breakstone Sheriff Bannerman Gary Pervier George Meara and Steve Kemp as characters with clear motives and reactions in the novel are all about as deep as paper in the film. Aunt Evvie Chambers Holly and her family and a few other minor characters have been omitted from the film completely.If this wasn't bad enough the main story was altered drastically and there was no falling action whatsoever!  SPOILER ALERT Tad Trenton lives in the movie! This huge change in plot completely takes away from the tragedy that Stephen King so wonderfully wrote. Also Cujo is shot in the end. This quick seemingly painless death allows the film to end quickly but totally ruins it. In the novel the long painful graphic death of Cujo is in a sense justice being served. In the film there is no such thing.Ultimately this film is weak not scary and does not stay true to the novel. I had to read the novel in broad daylight because of how frightening it was I watched the movie alone in the dark at night.

	schema:reviewBody "I have a lovehate relationship with Stephen King adaptations. I love The Shining Misery and most of IT but can't get behind The Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. I want to love the adaptations based on his books but as masterful as the beginnings are the endings mostly seem to fall flat a phenomenon not unlike Stephen King's books. The 1983 film Cujo by Lewis Teague was no different than my viewings of other King adaptations in the way that it starts off strong then falls off in the middle and the end. Starring Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro Cujo tells the story about a rabid dog who turns on those around him and brings evil to the small town he lives in. In the sleepy town of Castle Rock Maine Donna Trenton Dee Wallace lives a modest unfulfilling life with her son Tad Trenton Danny Pintauro and busy husband Vic Trenton Daniel Hugh Kelly. Spending her days taking care of her son and dealing with her husband's absence Donna seems to feel as though her very existence has been hijacked by the other members of her family. Feeling as though she solely exists for others Donna begins an affair with her husband's friend Steve Kemp Christopher Stone. When Vic finds out about the affair he abruptly leaves the house busy dealing with a business emergency anyway Donna is suddenly alone with her son. Because he had to hurry away to deal with the business emergency Vic left his family's car needing repairs. On the way to have the repairs done the car breaks down leaving Donna and her son Tad face to face with a rapid dog intent to kill. I never know what to expect with Stephen King films. Some are great and some are terrible. Cujo is somewhere in the middle of this spectrum. There are some good things that happen in this film. The score is brilliant and the dog is welldone for the screen. All the bad outweighs the few good things however. Pacing is just horrible I typically find great enjoyment out of a film that takes place in confinement as this film does in the car. Cujo is not a film that works well in confinement. Bad child actors can ruin a good movie and that is certainly the case with Cujo. The more horror movies I watch the more disappointed I am. I love the genre but it just seems that what passes as a horror movie is always disappointing. I won't quit the quest but Cujo certainly did not satisfy my craving for horror movies.".

	schema:headline " Pretty good Stephen King adaption";
	schema:reviewBody "1983 was a bit of a bumper year for cinematic versions of Stephen King novels. In that year alone we had Christine and The Dead Zone as well as Cujo. It would probably not be unfair to say that Cujo is the least good of the three but in all honesty there isn't a great deal in it with all being pretty effective and nicely varied horror films. Out of those three and unlike most King horror films in general Cujo is not a supernatural horror movie and is based on a plausible idea. A woman and her young son become trapped in their broken down car in a remote junkyard when a St. Bernard dog made rabid by a bite from an infected bat lays siege to their vehicle in a murderous mood.This one could be described as a high concept movie given the very basic nature of its setup. In order to pad things out to feature length and to add some depth we have quite a bit of character development in the first half of the movie which focuses mainly on a dysfunctional family and the dramas that surround them. Once the action moves to the junkyard though most of this is largely forgotten and the film essentially becomes an 'animalattack' horrorthriller. Dee Wallace does some good work as the mother who has to deal with the trauma while having to comfort her young son who it has to be said is involved in some pretty intense looking scenes which may have been quite full on for the young actor involved. But the scary scenes were often achieved by very clever editing after all a St. Bernard is hardly the most threatening of beasts to base a horror movie on. The fast and clever edits do make this creature seem genuinely menacing. Less successful though was the soundtrack which compromised of a considerable amount of really terrible music which would have been better suited to a daytime TV melodrama than a suspenseful and thrilling feature film. But on the whole this is a pretty decent and lean effort that gets the job done quite effectively.".

	schema:headline " When A Lovable Pet Becomes A Killer";
	schema:reviewBody "The novels of Stephen King provided the basis for a number of horror films that ranged from rather good FIRESTARTER THE DEAD ZONE CHRISTINE to absolute masterworks CARRIE THE SHINING. One adaptation that flew under the radar screens of even the most devoted fans of the horror genre as well as a few critics was CUJO based on King's 1981 novel of the same name and released in the late summer of 1983. Part of it could be that the story itself was considered a bit thinner than what most were used to from King as a novelist. Nevertheless in a decade that didn't see too many horror films become masterpieces and this even applied to later King adaptations like PET SEMETARY and CHILDREN OF THE CORN even slightly lowercaliber King from the 1980s like CUJO still outdoes even in the 21st century much of what is out there now.Dee Wallace who portrayed the emotionally distant mother in director Steven Spielberg's 1982 scifi masterpiece E.T. THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL plays more or less a similar role in CUJO a frustrated suburban wife in a northern California town whose life has become a subject of turmoil she has had an affair behind her husband Daniel HughKelly with another man Christopher Stone and her five yearold son Danny Pintauro is troubled by these issues which he is much too young to even begin to comprehend. Elsewhere in town another young boy Billy Jayne has other issues coping with youth and his only real friend in the world is his St. Bernard dog Cujo. Unfortunately what nobody yet knows is that Cujo is the victim of a horrible encounter. In the film's opening Cujo chases a rabbit into a hollowedout rotten log only to get bitten on the nose by a bat infected with rabies. When Wallace and Pintauro stop off at the local garage where Cujo is kept their car breaks down and very soon they are viciously attacked by the unfortunate St. Bernard. They are trapped in the brokendown car for much of the hot summer day the target of Cujo's wrath.Lewis Teague who directed the 1979 Dillingerinspired THE LADY IN RED and the 1980 cult horror film ALLIGATOR does an effective job of conveying smalltown life in this the first of King's adaptations to be set in his fictional community of Castle Rock. The major issue that he faces in directing this film is how he depicts Cujo's attacks which in the novel were not surprisingly quite a bit more explicit and how sympathetic one can be towards a St. Bernard who slowly but surely evolves into a vicious killer with teeth. This becomes a prime focus when it is perfectly obvious how well Wallace and Pintauro connect as mother and young son. A basic clue can be gleaned from the fact that Cujo's horrifying transformation from loving St. Bernard to irrational mauler isn't fast or easy. Another issue though more minor is how Teague can keep up the suspense once Wallace and Pintauro find themselves trapped in their car at the hands of Cujo. Since the attacks can't be depicted with such relentlessness but must be spaced at intervals as was the case in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS the film inevitably slows down at times and horror film fans impatient for the blood and gore to start pouring are likely to find all of this boring. But astute fans of the genre know that it's far better to do it this way.While King is often known for situations involving horror of some kind primarily supernatural though not really here he also has a firm eye for characterizations and Teague and screenwriters Dunaway and Currier take their cue from that aspect of King while not leaving out the horror though the attacks themselves while plenty horrifying aren't revoltingly graphic. The film's onlocation settings in areas around Petaluma and Santa Rosa gives the Castle Rock an idyllic but also sometimes claustrophobic feel which is enhanced and intensified once Cujo becomes a killer.In the end CUJO while not quite a masterpiece on the level of either CARRIE or THE SHINING must still be counted as one of the better horror films thanks to the emphasis on characterization and suspense and not just on blood and gore while providing plenty of scares. Not many horror films in the 1980s did that and even fewer would do so in the decades to come and on into the 21st century.".

This is what separates it from other animal attack films.The New York Times called the film predictable and said Cujo is not as menacing or frightening as other film adaptations of King's popular stories and especially can not compare to the 1976 Carrie... Now that may be true. But let us not sell it short either. Just about everyone whether they have seen the film or not knows what the word Cujo means... far more than say Christine. So this is one of King's more deeply imprinted films even if not the most creative.".

	onyx:emotionText "A friendly St. Bernard named Cujo contracts rabies and conducts a reign of terror on a small American town.Cujo is more than just a monstrous dog this is also a tale of infidelity and a family breakdown. This is what separates it from other animal attack films.The New York Times called the film predictable and said Cujo is not as menacing or frightening as other film adaptations of King's popular stories and especially can not compare to the 1976 Carrie... Now that may be true. But let us not sell it short either. Just about everyone whether they have seen the film or not knows what the word Cujo means... far more than say Christine. So this is one of King's more deeply imprinted films even if not the most creative.";

To my surprise I expected the film to much more supernatural but there really wasn't anything supernatural about it.The camerawork in the film was pretty good.  There were a few scenes that I wasn't terribly fond of like when the kid runs from the light switch to his bed.  I thought that was unneeded and just too dramatic for such a nondramatic scene.  Or when Donna Trenton Dee Wallace and Tad Trenton Danny Pintauro are stuck in the car and the camera goes in circles back and forth between them.  Just stupid!!!  But everything else was done quite well.  The dog Cujo looked excellent throughout the film although I think they went a little overboard at times with the goo on his face.The actors all did a fine job but there really isn't much to talk about. The Kid Danny Pintauro did start to annoy me a bit much at times but that's ok he's a kid.Overall the story was pretty interesting and a bit better than I expected but I still wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this.  Unless of course you are a big fan of Stephen King or the actorsdirector.  On the upside though the film is very short so even if you don't like it you won't be wasting a whole lot of time.  Well if you do end up seeing the film I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for readingChris".

	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is the ultimate statement on rural families that opt to live near bat caves. The result is a fairly competent Stephen King adaptation of a big friendly pooch that is somewhat innocently turned into a bloodthirsty devil dog.One frolicky afternoon in the sunshine the title farm dog is pursuing a scampering bunny rabbit through the countryside. Mistakenly popping his head into what he thinks is Thumper's underground domicile is instead infested with bats. One pierces poor Cujo's schnozz and days later the chaos begins.On the other side of town more mundane things are being played out. Your average threeperson family  complete with a kid who fears his closet at bedtime  are going through the motions. Sure we wouldn't mind a little character development and subtext for what's to come but it's this part of the screenplay that nearly kills the film. Completely needless subplots populate this thing like no tomorrow involving extramarital activities the most average town stud of the 80s and an asinine attempt at damage control for  you ready?  a cereal campaign that's made America physically ill. What any of this crap is doing in a horror film is beyond me.But once you've slogged through that superfluous nonsense you're permitted a decent little thriller. We observe a mother and her young son damned by a 70s eyesore Pinto which malfunctions at exactly the wrong time. What neighborhood farm does is crap out at? You guessed it. The residence of the now bloodsoaked dirtied Cujo.Director Teague ought to be commended for keeping the action so tense in what ends up being basically a one location film. A supremely trained movie dog or possibly dogs evoke genuine fear and panic for the audience. And Teague as well creates a perfect sense of isolation for the desolate setting which in many King novels is a character in itself. Jan de Bont's cinematography is superbly skilled as well most impressively involving a steadicam shot approaching the open door of the Pinto. And an excellent one rotating around Cujo as he sits on the porch of the house the car in his sights.Wallace and Pintauro carry the film quite well though Pintauro's screechy whining can be a bit much at times. But that's what it makes it so convincing! You feel a legitimate observation is going of how these two people would cope with being held hostage by a serial mutt. Other characters seem to occupy the screen for the sole purpose of distancing themselves from the audience so when they're attacked we feel better about it. And the bearded lathario who allegedly has several mistresses at his disposal still sees it necessary to take a knife to one of his conquests homes out of her rejection of him. Please.The close of the film leaves an important visual offscreen lemme just say gunshot! and the final frame especially the music is right out of a soap opera. And I'm sorry but as a dog lover there were just times that I actually had sympathy for Cujo. He's not inherently evil to begin with and most notably in the beginning is viewed as a fluffy friendly canine. So to see him descend into a killing machine was almost a bit depressing at times.But if you can power through a fodderladen start or even utilize the fast forward button Cujo is a passable scarefest for a Friday night with friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film shares a lot in common with Stephen King's other adaptation 'Christine'. In 'Christine' we have a psychotic car that went round killing people whereas in 'Cujo' we have a rabid dog going round killing people. Sadly like 'Christine' this film is effective in parts but it has an awful lot of problems....For me the first half of the film is where Cujo is at its weakest and that's mainly down to the fact that it's so tedious the kid says he's got monsters in his room...OK would have been alright if there was any point to it? We're then told that the husband Daniel Hugh Kelly is head of an advertising company for Sharp's who promote cereals amongst other things but then the company are seemingly brought to their knees by an allegation that their cereals have caused internal haemorrhaging to several individuals but then this is found to be false. If it's been proved to be untrue why go to pieces and disappear for 10 days to sort it out? Just sue the media. As a result of his selfabsorbent behaviour his wife Dee Wallace ends up having an affair in possibly one of the most tedious aspects of the first half of the film. It's also interesting that noone seems concerned by the bite mark on Cujo's nose which resulted in his rabies  didn't anyone think to get him checked out by a vet?I must admit the only thing that really held my interest in the first half of the film was wondering when Cujo would attack and here the writers dangle lots of carrots and then eventually decide to let Cujo loose which thankfully is when the film starts to pick up. Once Cujo goes nuts and when the wife Dee Wallace and the son Tad Danny Pintauro are isolated and Cujo is stalking them I have to admit that these moments are quite effective and do give the film some intensity despite the intensity there are some problems in the second half....We're not given a clear indication of how long wife and son are stranded for so this aspect is open to speculation but I know that it's light and dark on at least one occasion which begs the question does Cujo never sleep? Even if he's rabid surely he'd be hungry and would go and look for food elsewhere? It also requires a lot of suspension of disbelief to believe that a 9 stone woman can fight off a 20 stone dog yet on three separate occasions three fully grown men were unable to do this? Then wifey bashes Cujo six times across his head with a baseball bat which seemingly doesn't affect him  I know St Bernard's are big dogs but at best it would have knocked him out and at worst it would have killed him. Cujo's reappearance from the dead at the end was just lazy and predictable and rounded off just how bad this film was.If you're the sort of person who just wants a bit of excitement and edge of your seat antics and can suspend a lot of disbelief then you'll find the second half of the film enjoyable. However the first of the film for me was intolerably dull and although the second half was better for me it was still too sloppy and clichd to make up for the poor first half.".

I haven't read the novel but the person I've watched this movie with did and she claims it's a very faithful adaptation of King's writing and one of the most successful ones too! Stephen King has the talent to uphold the tense image of two people trapped in a car for twothirds of a book but it's not matter of course to translate this to a screen without losing its impact. Director Lewis Teague succeeded in making the most out of the scary struggles between dog and car. Cujo starts rather slow and throughout the entire first 45 min. you feel like you're being stuffed with information that isn't essential to the plot. The heartbreaking story of a seemly happy family falling apart due to adultery isn't top priority if you're watching a horror movie right? If you manage to overlook the fake sentiment and family drama you'll be rewarded with an actionfilled climax and some delightfully gruesome makeup effects. The crew did their best to make the St. Bernard look threatening with filthy mud on his fur bloodsoaked teeth and merciless eyes. Yet you can't help facing that the dog evokes feelings of pity instead of terror. That's probably another reason why it's easier to be compelled by a book.".

I actually thought that cujo was better than the shining but not quite as good as something like misery. The story is just very well told through film I cannot recommend the book because I have not read it but I can recommend this movie for horror or thriller lovers. Also the acting is done really well especially by Dee Wallace! Dee really pulled off a great performance here. And she delivers one of the best lines I've ever heard in a film fk you dog! Cujo definitely knows what will scare and it uses that. Also I think the run time and the pacing of the movie is spot on. I believe it's about an hour and 32 minutes which is just right for this movie because really it doesn't need to be long if this movie specifically was overly long then you would bore and lose the audience. And I think they did a good job at making the dog look borderline demonic and just downright evil. So all in all I think this was a great book to film Stephen King adaptation that I recommend to horror and thriller movie fans. 810 for Cujo!".

The problem was the section between the part where Cujo is bitten by the bat and the part where Donna's car breaks down it's very boring and not much fun to sit through. Also the Tad kid is rather annoying he is pretty dorky and has the voice of a twoyearold girl. He lives in the film but died in the book I think they should have stuck with the book if you ask me.

	schema:reviewBody "This was the first of three Stephen King adaptations to hit the screen in 1983 with the others being The Dead Zone and Christine. It's a respectful  if not completely faithful  version of the story that captures a lot of its visceral power.It actually takes its time to get started unlike a lot of modern movies where the aim is clearly to have things happen as fast as possible and gives us all too human and thus easily relatable characters to follow before and during their horrible ordeal in a Maine dooryard.Dee Wallace is wonderful in this as Donna Trenton a young mother who's had vague unpleasant thoughts about growing old and bored as a homemaker in the small Maine town of Castle Rock. She has an affair with her reallife husband Christopher Stone playing the lover that she comes to regret while her husband Vic's Daniel HughKelly business is threatened by a health scare involving one of the products that it's advertised. Eventually Donna and little son Tad Danny Pintauro find themselves stranded by a malfunctioning car on the property of local mechanic Joe Camber Ed Lauter. And there Cujo strikes. Cujo was a good hearted St. Bernard dog who contracted rabies after being bitten on the nose by a rabid bat and now the dog is a killer. With nowhere to go Donna has a hard time making it through the subsequent siege by the dog.Once Cujo kicks into gear it's a hell of a film with plenty of nerve jangling thrills and intense action scenes. The animal action supervised by Karl Lewis Miller is first rate and the several St. Bernards playing the part of Cujo are all impressive. The cinematography by Jan de Bont and camerawork are exemplary note the handling of an early scene in Tad's bedroom and a later one inside the car. The makeup is very well done also. You really feel the heat and discomfort experienced by Donna and Tad and feel like you're trapped inside that car with them.In addition to Wallaces' awardcaliber performance the rest of the cast is excellent right down the line. Young Pintauro proves to be a very good screamer.Cujo is one of those movies that definitely takes you on a ride complete with many hills and valleys along the way. And in the end it does have something to say about how sometimes the fears we create for ourselves can't hold a candle to a true lifeordeath situation.Eight out of 10.".

Eventually a mother Dee Wallace and her young son Danny Pintauro crosses paths with the monster and soon they're trapped in their car unable to go anywhere. CUJO isn't a complete success but there are enough effective moments to make it worth sitting through. I'm not familiar with the Stephen King story so I can't comment on how close this movie follows it but I think there are a few problems here. One problem is that we're given a pretty worthless subplot involving the wife having an affair on her husband Christopher Stone. I'm not sure if this played a bigger part in the book but here it just basically adds minutes to the running time and in the end it really adds up to nothing. Another problem I have with the film is that it's not nearly as intense as it should have been. In order for a film like this to succeed I think it needs to keep the viewer in constant terror as soon as everything starts to happen. That doesn't happen here although there is one attack sequence inside the car that is quite chilling. Finally the biggest problem with the picture is that it's simply way too predictable. With that said Dee Wallace is extremely good in her role as the mother who is forced to fight this creature to try and save her son. Pintauro is also very good in his role as the child and it's fun seeing Stone although his role isn't that well written. As I said there's one attack scene inside the car that is quite thrilling but the rest of them are only mildly entertaining. The final showdown does manage to be quite exciting although by this point you're ready for anyone to win just as long as the movie comes to an end.".

It is one of the more known works by director Paul May and writer Kurt Heuser who adapted the novel by Trygve Gulbranssen for the screen here. If you hear this name you probably already know that this is a Norwegian story in the original but the fact that Norway is not listed as one of the countries producing this film shows us that the cast is almost exclusively German. This includes Gert Froebe before he became a Bond villain Hansjrg Felmy and Joachim Hansen. I must say I am familiar with these names than the female actresses but then again there's far more males credited here. If you hear the title you probably guess that this is just another German Heimatfilm but in this case you are wrong as the Norwegian impact makes obvious already. Family and romance are components here for sure but there's more to this story like for example major plot references about family feuds and Froebe's character who is among the oldest in here and still he is firstbilled and probably has the most screentime. And the way the film ends shows too how it is mostly about him and the struggles about love and the landscape are just secondary in importance. However I must say despite being a big Froebe fan I did not enjoy this film as much as I hoped I would. He definitely has his moments and also elevated the material but there are lengthy sequences that add very little and are pretty uninteresting. As a consequence the film drags on some occasions. I do not recommend the watch and I also have no interest in checking out the sequel especially as it's without some of the major players from this first film. Thumbs down for the singing forests.".

They really did a good job not missing any cliche existing in these sort of movies. The jokes were all heard before and the storyline is somewhat predictable and somewhat lame. But as mentioned before this movie was shown in a sneak preview and so the auditory wasnt the target group for that kind of movie hell  we're going to watch a movie at 11pm during week and we dont know what crapubermovie they will serve us  so dont expect sneakers to be a target group for that ... we're bloodthirsty    there was a lot of laughter all the time because there was always someone commenting a scene  at least something funny. If you want to watch that movie you should be preteen or drunkstoned...then you can maybe doat preteen or snicker cheerfully drunkstoned.Have fun El".

	schema:reviewBody "Gtter Der Pest directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is set in Munich Germany. The main character Franz Walsch is a former prisoner played by Harry Baer. The setting is really dark and it reminds of filmnoir but the plot is really realistic and I have to say antiheroic. Franz doesn't have dreams he seems that he doesn't want anything from his live. He is like a bored nihilist a stoic human very different from the other characters of the film. The film centers on this character and his life. Franz had the chance to create a new life he has every woman he wants friends and his mother is still alone. But this affection seems to be drowned in hypocrisy of the modern society. Franz understands this and he chooses to continue a life of crime. Hanna Schygulla who plays Johanna is like the femme fatale of the story and she leads Franz to his death even if she loves him. Margarethe seems more loyal to Franz even if she is still lingered to society and her job. The male friends of Franz such as Gorilla are the only ones who can understand him. We have to point that Gorilla dies with him. Gtter Der Pest is a punch to our society. Even if it is full of defects. The movie is very dark and at sometimes boring the dialogs seem rather stodgy and arid. I think that Fassbinder shows his class here because without a writing a great scenario he managed to do a nice movie which is worth of seeing even if it's not one of his bests. I recommend this movie to all of you who like artistic cinema and filmnoir.".

	schema:reviewBody "If only Bayer or Pfizer could bottle this movie for insomniacs they'd make an even bigger fortune than they do now. Fassbinder proved he could fashion unique cinematic art out of a bunch of people standing around excoriating each other in several of his early pictures but here the internal tensions never mount and the tropes don't connect. Some claim it to be a homage to film noir and certainly there is alienation paranoia and betrayal in spades as well as iconic visual references to classics like Laura and Double Indemnity. But the moody lighting and framing in his excellent The American Soldier are much closer to the noir stylings of Alton and Planer than the arid nonstyle here. However the greatest offense of the film is the inclusion of a seemingly endless static sequence featuring the playing of a phonograph record of a gimmicky children's tune about an oddball menagerie  I guarantee you that this nauseating little ditty will echo in your skull for days. At the same time the subtitlers are owed a great deal of credit for their incisively clever translation of the absurd rhyming couplets into very British English.".

Fassbinder proved he could fashion unique cinematic art out of a bunch of people standing around excoriating each other in several of his early pictures but here the internal tensions never mount and the tropes don't connect. Some claim it to be a homage to film noir and certainly there is alienation paranoia and betrayal in spades as well as iconic visual references to classics like Laura and Double Indemnity. But the moody lighting and framing in his excellent The American Soldier are much closer to the noir stylings of Alton and Planer than the arid nonstyle here. However the greatest offense of the film is the inclusion of a seemingly endless static sequence featuring the playing of a phonograph record of a gimmicky children's tune about an oddball menagerie  I guarantee you that this nauseating little ditty will echo in your skull for days. At the same time the subtitlers are owed a great deal of credit for their incisively clever translation of the absurd rhyming couplets into very British English.";

Thus we do not see either if the Franz from Gods of the Pest is dizzy as is the Franz from Fassbinder's Berlin Alexanderplatz 1982 when they get back to liberty. But both Franz' take the tramway as Piel Jutzi's Franz and as Herzog's Stroszek does our Franz 'as Piel Jutz's Franz and Stroszek enters a restaurant from where the story develops in Fassbinder's Alexanderplatz Franz is picked up by the Jew Nachum and it follows the famous Zannowichstory. Franz Walsch  a Fassbinder amalgamate from the Berlin AlexanderplatzFranz Biberkopf and the American film director Raoul Walsh  now bears much more common features than only sharing his first name with the AlexanderplatzFranz. However when asked for his passport in the hotels Franz Walsch tells the receptionist that his name is Franz Biberkopf. Both Franz'are former prisoninmates for whom there is no future now in the outside world. They have no other chance than to following up their former life that they had left before having been arrested. However in the beginning both Franz Walsch and Franz Biberkopf promise that they well stay honest. In the case of Franz Walsch he stands between his old and the new girlfriend. The old one loves him too much and gets dangerous the new one raises a credit and both are astonished how quickly the money is used up. While Franz Biberkopf in the Alexanderplatz gets back to be a pimp Franz Walsch and his former colleagues plan a coup ... . Despite being slightly different one can say that Gods of the plague can be seen as Fassbinder's first fingerexercise towards filming Dblin's novel which he would do only 9 years after the present movie. Meanwhile Fassbinder himself appears as Franz Biberkopf in The American Soldier he hides himself behind the cutter of his movies Franz Walsch and there is hardly any Fassbinder film where there is no Franz or no Biberkopf variations of the same topic Franz Biberkopf from Alexanderplatz has to exercise himself in many characters in many places and in many societies and times before he will find himself almost at the end end of Fassbinder's life in his ultimate form.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gtter der Pest is a West German 90minute movie from 1970 so this one is already over 45 years old. It is from the earlier days of filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder as he was in his mid20s as he shot this one. There are three factors that are pretty frequent in his early works namely the fact that this is still in blackandwhite and also the runtime staying under 90 minutes. His works got longer as he grew older. And last but not least crimethemed films were something he also did primarily in the first 5 years of his filmmaking career. This is one of these. There is lots of murder in here. A man leaves prison and as the film continues we find out about his relationship with his brother with women and with an old friend who turns out pretty lusty. The latter is played by Gnther Kaufmann a regular in Fassbinder's films. But also lead actor Harry Baer and Hanna Schygulla especially she worked with Fassbinder on several occasions. Also in here are Jan George brother of the late Gtz Ingrid Caven Fassbinder's wife and Margarethe von Trotta during her acting days and quite a while before she solely focused on shooting films herself. As a whole I cannot say there were too many memorable or good moments in this film. To me it seemed as if Fassbinder was still a while back from his best years when he made the films I like the most from him. So I am not too surprised Gods of the Plague did not receive as much awards attention as some other works by RMF. My verdict is negative too. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the first Rush Hour and didn't know what to expect when i watched it at a friend's house. I watched it and thought it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I was glad that it was something fresh and new as the Lethal Weapon movies Which I also thought were excellent!!!!!!! had finished and i thought that it was even better than them. Then when i heard that they were making Rush Hour 2 I couldn't wait until it came out however i was worried that it might not be as good as the first as very few sequels are these days but i was not disappointed in the slightest. I laughed all the way through this movie and even more than the first one. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are perfect for the roles and both are excellent throughout the movie which has even more humor than Rush Hour 1. Rush Hour 1 is still excellent but i think Rush Hour 2 has to be funnier having watched them both hundreds of times. I cannot wait until Rush hour 3 comes out!I highly recommend this movie and Rush Hour 1 to all actioncomedy fans out there!".

	schema:reviewBody "James Carter comes to Hong Kong for a holiday with Inspector Lee.  However at the same time a bomber is striking key American targets.  Carter and Lee get drawn into an investigation into a counterfeiting ring run by Ricky Tan and his new partner Hu Li.  Before long their up to their necks in trouble again.The story doesn't matter because basically it's this  Carter talks funny to somebody while Lee is distracted it then all kicks off and Lee does lots of fancy moves it then moves to a different location and the pattern repeats again.  Essentially that's it  but it doesn't matter it worked the first time and it works again here.  The story is better than the first film's although the twists don't work as well as they think they do.The main improvement since the first movie is that there's more fighting action.  In RH Jackie Chan's fighting was toned down to make room for Tucker's comedy.  In RH2 Chan is allowed to have much more action and the addition of Zhang Ziyi ups the ante all the more.  Tucker still gets to do his bigmouthed comedy and have plenty of banter between him and Chan be sexual with girls and fight.  It's not breaking new ground but it's quite fun.Chan and Tucker are very good mainly because they're having fun and comfortable with each other.  Lone adds class and menace as Ricky Tan and Sanchez adds spice as the beautiful Isabella.  The best addition is Zhang Ziyi  she doesn't have any character but she can certainly move!  The cast also has very funny cameos from Don Cheadle and Jeremy Piven  adding laughs and class.The only problem with the film is that it is so very formulaic and is just a simple crowd pleaser.  Some of the banter is a few steps off racism I'll kick you back to Africa' and much of Tucker's ogling is borderline sexism. However it's all so very polished that you don't notice.Overall it's a very entertaining blockbuster.  The only problem is this  the funniest bits are the outtakes shouldn't it have been in the film?!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rush Hour 2' is a highly enjoyable followup to the original 1998 box office smash.  Like the previous film this first of what will undoubtedly be a long line of lucrative sequels combines sardonic humor with eyepopping martial arts action sequences to entertaining effect.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan repeat their roles as unlikely cop buddies starting off the film in Chan's home territory Hong Kong and finishing up in Tucker's the good ole US of A. Chan with his sheepish deadpan delivery makes a perfect straight man for Tucker's fasttalking bad brotha wiseacre whose mouth engages in more heavyduty action than Chan's karatechopping hands and feet.  Much of the humor is generated by Tucker's ability to seem totally unflustered by any peril that happens to come his way managing to sass talk his way out of one dangerous predicament after another.  Moreover Chan's ability to create humor out of perfectly choreographed stunt sequences puts him right up there with some of the silent comedy greats like Chaplin and Keaton.  The splitsecond perfection of these scenes combined with the balletic grace with which they are executed makes him one of the truly unique talents working in movies today.   Luckily in his move to mainstream American filmmaking Chan has been able to find behindthescenes talent good enough to match his own.  The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson though no worldbeater when it comes to originality or depth does posses a playful spirit that works well in the context of the genre.  Likewise director Brett Ratner keeps the action percolating along at a lively often dizzying clip.As with most Chan films however Rush Hour 2' seems to go on for about a half hour too long  even though its running time barely clocks in at a very short 90 minutes.  Perhaps this type of material really can't be sustained much beyond an hour before the repetitiousness of it begins to take its toll.  However that is certainly a minor quibble about a film that for the most part provides plenty of laughs some kickass performances and action sequences that as per usual for a Chan film will quite literally make your jaw drop.  .".

Both actors create likable characters with slightly more depth to them than the average comedic archetypes. Tucker is a loudmouthed clown from the LAPD and Chan is a quiet methodical Chief Inspector from Hong Kong. Not just racial stereotypes their characters are developed just enough to make you want more from them  particularly Chan's.The plot begins to develop in earnest about 13rd of the way through the film and takes a few predictable twists and turns until reaching a climactic conclusion. John Lone plays Chan's father's former police partner and the leader of the Triads  a huge Hong Kong gang. He plays his character like a Chinese Chris Walken and along with Ziyi Zhang his beautiful but psychotic partner provides a nice dramatic balance to the lunatic Tucker and straightman Chan. The story evolves to expose a counterfeiting plot in which the Triad the US Secret Service and others are all somehow involved.Chan and Tucker have great chemistry and with a good supporting cast they make this sequel work. Rush Hour 2 is a fun lightweight action film suitable for teens on up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some might say hearing about Rush Hour 2 Not another sequel!  Not another cop buddy film!' and so on. But with these kinds of films it is not so much originality at all. It is about being entertained. I mean going to this film and wanting to see something original is like going to see The Bridges of Madison County and rooting for violence massive shootings flying body parts and intense profanity. Either way THAT WILL NOT HAPPENAlmost all things being equal there were only two things that could screw this one up actually three. The script or the actors. The third thing I was talking about is actually something that was in the original Rush Hour as well. Chris Rock. I have seen a handful of films with him now and find him a bit annoying at times. but this time I did not feel like that at all. Either I have become immune to his overdone behaviour all the time it has become less worse or I'm simply getting to the point in my life where I'm accepting the fact that there are people like that in life. Either way I thought he was better than in for instance Money Talks and maybe even the first Rush Hour. Anyway the other two things that could have seriously screwed up this film were the script and the actors but I must say that although the film was not too original the story held up very well and so did the actors. The reason for that is probably that the tone of the Rush Hour films has so far been more comedic. It is not supposed to be serious it is supposed to be more like Die Hard with a couple of big explosions a lot of fighting less shooting than in Die Hard here and jokes. Well as in the first one the jokes were delivered well from beginning to end including the bloopers. As far as the film went I must say I thought the ending was great and I also enjoyed the last two bloopers very much. This film proves that if the jokes and the acting are good enough they even can make up for small losses in story quality and other bad things like action film clichs. It is kind of funny that there are films in which clichs can be really disturbing and ruin almost your whole film experience. In others however like in this one clichs are present though they not ruin your experience of the matter at all. I guess it is all in the approach of the material and the cast and crew involved. Jackie Chan as Inspector Lee did was he is supposed to do in this film be funny and do a lot of fighting. There were a few difficult stunts here but not one that really made my jaw drop to the floor. I  would never say this was due to the ageing of Chan like others do because I do not know whether that is true and second of all I did not mind that there were a few less jaw dropping stunts'. It did in no way hurt the film.To finish it all of I have to give credit to Roselyn Sanchez who did a great job on this film. I could just not figure out if she was supposed to be one of the good guys' or the bad guys'. It had nothing to do at all with the fact that she is very pretty. By the way was that really a Snoopy tattoo??? I could really not tell and it wasn't because I was looking elsewhere! No it was just that the cinematographer did not zoom in enough. I wish he could have brought things to my attention better! Anyway I really meant what I said about Roselyn Sanchez both that she could act and fight! well and that she indeed looks very pretty. Talking about pretty yes AGAIN where the hell do those filmmakers get all those pretty women? I mean if I would have been in the same situation as Carter Chris Tucker in the film when he was in the massage parlour I would have probably done the same thing. My eyes would have popped out and probably my jaw would have dropped and my tongue would have fallen to the floor as well. DAMN. Really good of actresses????? people. To get back to the film I would really appreciate it if the makers could bring back Roselyn Sanchez for Rush Hour 3 if they'll ever consider making another instalment. Although I don't think they have to consider Rush Hour 3 will definitely be happening. So Jackie and Chris BRING IT ON FOR RUSH HOUR 3!8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "If Chris Tucker's James Carter gallivanting in Hong Kong doesn't sound appealing to you surely you didn't see 'Rush Hour'. The dynamic 'Blackinese' duo return and they do so with a bite. We now have the situation completely reversed with Carter venturing into the unknown and Lee guiding him for the majority of the film. Carter's interactions with the locals and clashes with the more calm Chinese culture compared to his audacious egocentric personality are really the highlights yet again. As I said a hardcore African American making his way in Hong Kong is bound to be a laugh. Yet another stellar script and consistent directing from Brett Ratner help to ensure this sequel doesn't bomb out. A little less realistic but then again if you are familiar with 'Rush Hour' realism isn't the first thing on the agenda as much as action work and comedy play. The script was a little less compelling this time and seemed to be driven with a lighter direction in mind although it was interesting to learn a little more of the backgrounds of our two leads. Chris Tucker's loudmouth antics just about match up to his brilliant show in the original his dialogue is as fresh smooth fast and excessive as ever. Oh and did I mention as funny? He dominates the screen once again takes charge and gives you his typical impulsive onscreen persona. Jackie Chan reaffirms his reputation as one of the world's best film stuntmen. His stunts yet again were terrifically executed and he was well supported by 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' star Zhang Ziyi. The 'bamboo scene' was comparable in aweworthiness to the 'convention center' finale scene in 'Rush Hour'. Again as the more sensible and sedate Inspector Lee his partnership with Tucker is as good as ever and the interplay once again is just plain good fun. We also saw a shift in the love interest angle with the introduction of the seductive sexy secret service agent Isabella Molina played by Roselyn Sanchez. Her allegiances mysterious she really sizzles in her role. Now that the duo finally have a beautiful woman to fight over any guesses as to who wins? If I don't give this 5 stars it's simply because in some respects it's a rehash of the original in the same way in which you would deem Lethal Weapon 1 better than Lethal Weapon 2 or Beverly Hills Cop 1 superior to its successor. If you did however enjoy the original formula look into this. As I said it is the same old thing in some ways but in others the TuckerChan combination still find ways to surprise and entertain. And yet again do not miss the bloopers.P.S. Also don't miss Don Cheadle in surely one of the strangest roles you will see an African American man play. But a credit to him for it he was outstanding.".

He dominates the screen once again takes charge and gives you his typical impulsive onscreen persona. Jackie Chan reaffirms his reputation as one of the world's best film stuntmen. His stunts yet again were terrifically executed and he was well supported by 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' star Zhang Ziyi. The 'bamboo scene' was comparable in aweworthiness to the 'convention center' finale scene in 'Rush Hour'. Again as the more sensible and sedate Inspector Lee his partnership with Tucker is as good as ever and the interplay once again is just plain good fun. We also saw a shift in the love interest angle with the introduction of the seductive sexy secret service agent Isabella Molina played by Roselyn Sanchez. Her allegiances mysterious she really sizzles in her role. Now that the duo finally have a beautiful woman to fight over any guesses as to who wins? If I don't give this 5 stars it's simply because in some respects it's a rehash of the original in the same way in which you would deem Lethal Weapon 1 better than Lethal Weapon 2 or Beverly Hills Cop 1 superior to its successor. If you did however enjoy the original formula look into this. As I said it is the same old thing in some ways but in others the TuckerChan combination still find ways to surprise and entertain. And yet again do not miss the bloopers.P.S. Also don't miss Don Cheadle in surely one of the strangest roles you will see an African American man play. But a credit to him for it he was outstanding.";

	schema:headline " Rush Hour 2 proves a hundred times more entertaining than its 1998 blockbuster predecessor.";
	schema:reviewBody "Actorcomedian Chris Tucker cracks me up every time he tells a joke. He captivated me the first time that I saw him clowning around as the character Smoky in director F. Gary Gray's riotous 'N the Hood' farce Friday 1995 with IceCube. Tucker attained outlandish heights with his unforgettable coiffure and his looselipped loquacity as the ridiculous Ruby Rhod in director Luc Besson's scifi extravaganza The Fifth Element 1997 with Bruce Willis. Anybody that supports the American Rifle Association should praise Tucker too. In director Brett Ratner's Money Talks 1997 the Tucker hero Franklin Hatchett summed up his philosophy about guns. Guns don't kill people Hatchett ranted Stupid motherfkers with guns kill people! Probably the giddiest moments of director Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown 1998 featured nappy headed Tucker arguing with villainous Samuel L. Jackson about climbing in the trunk of Jackson's car. Tucker has rejected movie offers left and rightly largely because nobody wanted to pay his asking price. No matter how astronomical Tucker's salary demands may have seemed IceCube definitely blew it when he left Smoky out of Next Friday. As a result Next Friday pales by comparison with Friday. New Line Cinema which produced the Rush Hour thrillers learned it lesson from IceCube's disaster. Mind you Mike Epps is funny but he isn't Chris Tucker funny! Nobody could possibly fill Tucker's shoes in either Next Friday or Rush Hour 2! They paid the Def Jam standup comic from Decatur Georgia a whopping 20million so he would reprise his Rush Hour role as LAPD Detective James Carter opposite Jackie Chan in director Brett Ratner's turbodriven sequel. Producers Arthur Sarkissian Roger Birnbaum Jay Stern and Jonathan Glickman spent their bucks wisely. The comedian chemistry between Tucker and Chan surely the oddest couple of mismatched cops ever has lost none of its spontaneity. Altogether Rush Hour 2 proves a hundred times more satisfying than its tame 1998 blockbuster predecessor.Rush Hour 2 opens in exotic Hong Kong as a bomb explodes at the American Embassy and two translators die. The Royal Hong Kong Police suspect Triad chieftain Ricky Tan John Lone of The Last Emperor may have had something to do with the bombing. They send Chief Inspector Lee Jack Chan of Shanghai Noon out to question him. Riding with Lee is none other than LAPD Detective James Carter Chris Tucker who is trying to enjoy his vacation in Hong Kong. Lee tries to make contact with Tan at a karaoke bar while Carter decides to hog the microphone and croon Michael Jackson's Don't Stop Till You Get Enough. Carter thought they had entered the bar to pick up girls and he isn't amused when Lee tells him that they are supposed to be undercover. We are in Hong Kong now Lee reminds him. Here I am Michael Jackson and you are Toto! A disgruntled Carter corrects Lee's malapropism. That's Tito fool. Toto is what we had for dinner last night! No sooner has Lee revealed his true intentions than Carter decides to roust the Triad gangsters with his fractured Chinese. You just asked them to take out their samurai swords and shave your butt! No matter where Lee takes Carter they wind up surrounded by thugs out to kill them. The best scene in Rush Hour 2 takes place in the Heaven on Earth massage parlor. Lee spots Ricky Tan as he strolls and goes to call for backup. The impetuous egotistical Carter decides he can handle Tan alone. He realizes what a dreadful mistake that he has committed when Lee and he battle an entire army of Triad henchmen. The Triads don't kill our heroes. They strip them naked and leave them to fend for themselves in Hong Kong traffic.Happily not only does Rush Hour 2 boast more cleverly kinetic kung fu combat scenes for Chan but also Speed 2 scenarist Jeff Nathanson's screenplay concerns an international smuggling ring rather than a child kidnapping case and the thief of Chinese cultural artifacts. Don't get me wrong. Nathanson has contrived an action comedy as formulaic as they come. Clearly nobody wanted to tinker with the surefire hit so they have beefed up action plot and characters while keeping the same situations. When Lee and Carter aren't bickering they are kicking the crap out of the opposition. We know nothing on earth will prevent our heroes from triumphing over the villains but the situations are funnier than before. In Rush Hour Chan's Chinese cop played the fishoutofwater in Los Angeles. In Rush Hour 2 Carter is the fishoutofwater in Hong Kong. Carter's runin with a street vendor trying to butcher a chicken for him is a real hoot. Moreover the adversaries pose a greater challenge. Actress Zhang Ziyi who electrified audiences as the martial arts maiden in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon excels as a despicable dragon lady who enjoys kicking Carter in his jivetalking mouth. Urbane Jon Lone who hasn't played a villain since he menaced Christopher Lambert in The Hunted 1995 registers strongly as the treacherous Ricky Tan. The plot twist is that Tan once served as a Royal Hong Kong policeman in fact his partner was none other than Lee's murdered father!Rush Hour 2 proves a hundred times more entertaining than its 1998 blockbuster predecessor. Director Brett Ratner keeps the action balanced between Chan and Tucker. Pitting Ziyi against Tucker was a stroke of genius. Ratner wastes no time getting things going at a gungho pace and never lets the plot obstruct the action with complications. The opening combat sequence with Chan scrambling up bamboo scaffolding and battling several bad guys lacks the energy that Chan himself might have given had he been at the helm. Ratner redeems himself with the massage parlor fight. This is the fight that they'll have to top in Rush 3. At age 47 Jackie Chan seems half his age performing front and back flips while using ottomans and trash cans as weapons.".

The movie is fast paced with a simple plot and lots of trademark characteristics from Tucker as expected.This is one of those movies that you probably need to watch at least twice to appreciate the funny side of.

But RH 2 is really a good entertainer. The comedy is the best part of all. Forget the action it's a little less than RH. But Ratner's got some Chinese beauties and Roselyn Sanchez to add some oomph. One of my favorite scenes is the intro of Chan and Tucker in the car. Tucker's Cantonese is a laugh riot and Chan's English adds bigger laughs. I must say this film still rocks ten years on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rush Hour IIIt's all your fault we're going through all of this. Man I just wanted to take a break and get some mushu! That's exactly what Detective Carter had in mind as a perfect vacation. Rush Hour II. . . . Where action is fast and tempers are hot. Our heroes Insp. Lee Jackie Chan and his partner Detective James Carter Chris Tucker are in Hong Kong Lee's home town and Chris's dream opportunity to get some mushu. One day into the trip however the detectives face adversity. Someone has exploded a bomb at the U. S embassy and the Insp. Lee is ready to take up the case. Carter is not. The FBI have had enough of the antics of the two 'crazy' detectives but the Chinese government are concerned that this may be the latest crime along with a huge counterfeit scheme of Ricky Tan John Lone. They plead with Lee to take up the case Ricky was a close friend of Lee's father. Lee accepts the case and explains the situation to his partner Detective Carter. Carter is outraged that Lee has spoiled his idea of a true vacation but accepts anyways. The detective duo get into some comical situations especially because of Carter's hot temper his attempts to speak Chinese and his downright inability at kungfu Lee's specialty. Director Brett Ratner's usage of movement is spectacular with excellent usage of dolly shots kinetics and conventions. As Detective Lee becomes more and more involved with the case his colleague Carter is unable to resist becoming embroiled along side him. Both get into crazy situations simply out of concern for one another. In one hilarious scene the duo on a look out for Ricky Tan get tipped off by the Chinese government about his whereabouts. He is said to be at a posh salon called Heaven on Earth. The detectives go to the salon while Lee briefs Carter on their mission. As they are trying to blend in Ricky Tan walks into the salon and Lee points him out to Carter. Carter's temper gets completely out of control and the scene becomes violent. Both detectives are stripped of their clothes and they run for their lives. Dolly shots are used as the duo weaves between the heavy traffic. The camera is placed on a dolly and the director moves in out or alongside the actors. As the actors run towards their office the camera moves with them through the traffic on to the sidewalk up the stairs while Carter yells at Lee for not listening to his martial arts advice. Detective Lee's action skills are tested while he is trying to deal with Carter's temper and a murderous gang the Triads. Carter's reaction to Lee's concern and anxiety? Lee These men are Triads. The most deadly gang in China. James Carter You think they scare me? I'm from Los Angeles man. We invented gangs! Lee's kungfu scenes are choreographed with considerable kinetic grace. He is forced to use his kungfu skills through most of the movie owing to the fact that he is facing a brutal gang leader Rick Tan and a beautiful assassin Hu Li Ziyi Zhang. He fights considerably well despite being nearly buttnaked or helpless. He escapes sticky situations simply by the superb choreography of Jackie Chan. Conventions are the usage of symbolic expressions to portray emotions and feelings. In Rush Hour II many conventions are used before the true action surfaces. Carter and Lee soon find out that they aren't the only ones assigned to nab the criminals. Isabella Molina Rosalyn Sanchez has been put to the task by the FBI. She informs Carter and Lee about a truck that is filled with counterfeit money. As the camera enters the truck the detectives' absence becomes obvious with the ominous silence. The camera focuses on one statue after another and one is left with the thought that the detectives may be in one of the statues. Sure enough they are tied to the back of the statues and we find out later that the statues are relatively important they are filled with the counterfeit money. Thus before we can find out anything about the detectives or their whereabouts the camera has placed a symbolic importance on the statues. Rush Hour II is a comedy of movement. Beginning in Hong Kong and ending in California the detective duo get lesser mushu and more action then they had expected. The movie is great with its major spots being dolly shots kinetics and conventions. It is after all a Jackie Chan movie so Get ready for a second rush!".

As a film it's pretty  pretty enjoyable and pretty well worth watching  and of course Anna Netrebko as Mimi is fairly pretty too!Young penniless couple meet fall instantly head over heels in love for no reason at all but their dreams are cruelly cut down by her illness and all to some of the most emotionally charged music ever written. So long as the music libretto and script are adhered to a film version can't go wrong  the director generally sticks to it and doesn't force his own interpretations on us too much. When he does it works a restrained use of artistic license. And there's nice imagery plush backgrounds and clever use of colour. Trouble is the atmosphere generated by a live performance is lost with a film  the lavish 2008 Met Opera production by Zefferelli recorded with Angela Georghiu and Ramon Vargas had its faults too but imho is preferable to this. We all probably have our own favourite versions of Puccini's most famous opera  mine is the May 1938 complete recording in Milan with Beniamino Gigli as Rodolfo especially of O Mimi Tu Piu Non Torni at the beginning of Act 4  something so beautiful which has not been bettered since the advent of stereo or digital  since the singer was unrepeatable. What's yours? For arguments sake I could also say the legendary Lucrezia Bori's Mimi still resonates well through the acoustic mono hiss from her centuryold records.Netrebko has a fine and well controlled voice but having seen her repeatedly wallow in a swimsuit to Dvorak's Song To The Moon on the late UK Classic FM TV I still wonder whether she's punching above her weight with operas like La Boheme  incidentally great blood spattered acting in the Met's Lucia Di Lammermoor a few months ago but is she colouratura enough? Her acting for the camera here is also fine something which is occasionally in doubt when she's performing live  however the rapturous applause from her adoring Met audiences for her various performances this year leave no doubt of her superstardom. Favourite bits from many O Soave Fancuilla  definitely not bathed in moonlight Dunque E Propio Finita in the pouring snow naturally the climax back in the garret  as suitably tearjerking as it should be. However this is a film with minor faults well worth the timeeffort and an admirable vehicle for Anna Netrebko as it should be. Brava!".

	schema:reviewBody "It is surprising to see the number of naysayers among the reviews of this filmed version of Puccini's beloved LA BOHEME singling out the very elements that allow stage works to become transferred to the film medium lip syncing closeups of cinematic details uses of both black and white and color etc. What seems to be overlooked is this chance to see the two leading interpreters of this opera in wide distribution for those who cannot see them in person. As a film this version by Robert Dornhelm works wonders with the intentions of Puccini's bohemian lovers living on little but their love of the arts and for life in the Parisian garrets in the snowy wintertime. He introduces moments of Paris in the snow in black and white much like old animated daguerreotypes before the brief overture begins and keeps the flavor of the action moving seamlessly while adding additional elements of information using the same format. He offers some visual information about the passion of the lovers that allows him to reference these moments later in the story when memory brings them forward. All of this makes the opera more than opera these elements make this a fine movie. But the true pleasure of this film is the glorious singing and acting of Rolando Villazn and Anna Netrebko as the lovers. They are gorgeous to look at magnificent in their vocal interpretations and extraordinary actors. And close behind them is the camaraderie of the entire cast especially Nicole Cabell as Musetta George Von Bergen as Marcello Adrian Erd as an exceptional Schaunard and Vitalij Kowaljow as Colline. The involvement in the story is solid and wholly believable and this is a cast of 'minor characters' whose presence is constantly felt and appreciated. Bertrand de Billy conducts with a sure hand. In short if anyone can watch this version of LA BOHEME with a dry eye then perhaps they are not giving the power of Puccini a chance to be extended into the cinematic techniques required of really excellent filmmaking.

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this Boheme and I would have given it the full marks apart from two unforgivable problems. The direction dramatises the opera while never fully straying from the original staging however the audience instead of being fixed are taken onto and around the stage. This opens the drama to subtle interpretations and allows the directions to expand as in O Soave Fancuilla where there is considerable action outside the apartment. For the most part this worked beautifully. Where it worked to some effect was in allowing Netrebko to display her considerable talents.Now I have two rules regarding Puccini. Firstly his soprano must be believable although she is larger than life. If she is not a diva she is a homicidal nut case or an utter bitch. In Boheme she is the girl you just cannot help falling in love with just forget it you are smitten. The second rule is that the singers must be Puccini singers they must have a strong vocal line so they can simply surf the waves of his glorious melodies. Netrebko brings the whole package and more If you do not love this Mimi I am sorry for you. She sings beautifully her line is strong not powerful as in say De los Angeles. She also is aware of the production in that her singing is quite intimate. She is singing for the audience alongside her not up in the gods. The performance is correct for the medium she is in. Quite simply she is a star a treasure. The Director took a little risk in MarcelloColline and Shaunard in that he hired actors to perform and they mimed the voices of the singers. Don't look for a Merrill or a Warren here but what you do get is the most believable bunch of mates I've ever seen in Boheme. Nicole Cabell is Musetta I personally found her more than adequate and along side Netrebko that must be good. I don't know where she found her inspiration for this role but it must be a small world because I know this character. I did not like Villazon in this role which is a shame because his acting was good I didn't even mind his lapses into Mr Bean because it seemed to fit into his place in the company of his mates. His voice is good it has a warm colour to it it isn't powerful but it should be more than adequate unfortunately it seems to lack strength in Che gelida manina he is fine until l'anima millionaria and from there strength not power is required the line must hold the melody. Netrebko shows how it is done in her following aria the line follows the melody with vowels consonants and colour being applied with lightest of touches. He is good in the second act and again in the third until Dunque proprio finita and then again not enough strength to hold the line.One star lost for the tenor the other lost star baffles me This is an Opera not just any opera most peoples favourite I possess six versions. I want to hear the music and the singing there is no excuse for putting out an opera with sound faults I tried changing amplifiers speakers and finally a different system all gave the same sound breakup so I thought I had a rubbish DVD until I find others have the same problem. So there it is two stars lost and nearly a point off a third  what in the name of god is that thing on Marcellos easel its supposed to be his masterpiece which he flogs as an inn sign when money is short. I spite of everything I loved this the production works wonderfully and it has Netrebko and that should be enough for you to want this.".

All scenes in the movie beautifully constructed giving a correct pacing for the actors to have enough space to create their roles.The colour superb.Netrebko as always fine but lacking in the bloom of her voice. I have heard her many times before on DVD and it seems to me the sound engineer put a hard edge on her voice. Her acting is superb and it was finally nice to see the role interpreted as though Mimi was a mature woman and not some girlish female fingering her clothing is some coy way as Georghiu does in the met DVD production. Both woman I mention in this paragraph are stunning. Netrebko comes off tops because of her portrayal.Villazon's voice  and he is not to blame loses its line because of a faulty sound engineers inability to keep the voice in focus and at the right forte as in the example of his top C in Che Gelida Manina where it seems to drop off in volume and tone. He also does not sing his mezza voce where it is called for in the score. As usual his acting is contrived and over the top with flailing arms and hands touching his face and head in place of honest acting. He is not a very pleasant looking singer to watch in the way he has been trained to use his mouth.The other men are fine actors and the behind the scene voices were admirable.Musetta was fabulous and a real scene stealer in the caf scene. She looked good. Her acting was great and her voice was very fine for the role. I really liked her.On the whole I will not watch this production again as for me in opera it is the voice which is the most important. Here I blame the sound engineer.When I listen to La Boheme again it will be the Met production with Vargas and Ghiorghiu  or the earlier recording of Teresa Stratas and Jose Carreras. Now this is a Mimi and Rudolpho and although an older recording you see and hear two artists in their prime.".

And the makeup artists surely could have done something to make him appear less lugubrious.It was disappointing to see Anna Netrebko a riveting actress and singer so illused. Again there must have been some way to make her appear both more attractive and more interesting on stage she is gorgeous and completely unique. The splitscreen technique made no sense and added nothing to the drama while scenes that featured people singing offscreen were confusing and boring.I'm sure this is not entirely the director's fault. Grand opera fares best on the stage and often appears stiff and overblown in film versions. Probably the best idea would simply have been to film the singers performing on stage in front of an audience. We would have gotten the benefit of verisimilitude and the dramatic gestures and heroic singing that opera demands would have seemed much more fitting.Oh well!".

Considerable trouble seems to have been taken with the lip synching and Rolando Villazn in particular really looks as though he is singing rather than just opening and closing his mouth in time to the music. So what this film lacks in operatic authenticity it makes up for in dramatic impact. Villazn has an impressive dramatic range with a very mobile face OK so sometimes he looks like Mr Bean. Anna Netrebko does not have to do much more than look lovely and sing divinely two things that she does supremely well. Nicole Cabell is a scream as Musetta and almost outglams La Netrebko. I was going to say that Schaunard Marcello and Colline are well sung and well acted but checking the credits I see that they are performed by three onscreen actors miming to the singers' voices. That probably explains why I thought that the lipsynching was not so good in those roles.There is just enough opening up of the action. We see Mimi right at the beginning in her room listening with interest to the antics of the four artists. We also see her cross the landing and deliberately blow out her candle before knocking on Rodofo's door. Most surprisingly we see Mimi and Rodolfo pause on the way to the Caf Momus to go to her room and consummate their relationship.Such a splendid production makes you wonder why they did not do it this way and also record the sound live. The technology is available these days. I suppose it was a question of priorities with the first priority being to make a perfect CD with the film being a subsidiary aim.".

I have countless productions on VHS DVD casettes and CD's. But I never have seen Netrebko in it. She is a SUPERB Mimi  devious flirty and coy. A little too healthy looking for somebody dying of consumption but what the heck... this is opera... Nicole Cabelle is a wonderfully unique Musetta. And they have captured the boisterous camaraderie of the students perfectly as well as the atmosphere of Paris in the early nineteenth century. I've always loved the Zeffirelli film of La Traviata.

There is a disk of the last scene in ACT 1 filed with my will with instructions it be played at my funeral. I have seen Boheme live and on video many times. I have countless productions on VHS DVD casettes and CD's. But I never have seen Netrebko in it. She is a SUPERB Mimi  devious flirty and coy. A little too healthy looking for somebody dying of consumption but what the heck... this is opera... Nicole Cabelle is a wonderfully unique Musetta. And they have captured the boisterous camaraderie of the students perfectly as well as the atmosphere of Paris in the early nineteenth century. I've always loved the Zeffirelli film of La Traviata. This is its equal!";

	schema:reviewBody "As some people may know I am a huge fan of opera and classical music. And I am a huge fan of La Boheme so I wanted to see this naturally. And I thought overall it was beautiful. My only complaint was the sound some of it sounded a bit off and lazy particularly in the middle of Che Glenida Manina at first I wasn't sure whether it was the sound or whether it was Villazon trying to be even more delicate than he was being anyone who's seen him before will know he does have quite an eccentric passionate and exciting presence particularly when he's talking about singing and opera.Other than that I loved this production of La Boheme. It's not the bestI remember the 1988 production with Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti with such fondness but it doesn't try to be. On its own it is a very solid performance of a beautiful opera. The production values are wonderful. The photography has some interesting angles that don't jar while the sets lighting and costumes are very pleasing to the eye.Puccini's music is amazing. It is an incredibly lyrical and poignant score with some of the most breathtakingly beautiful tunes in the history of opera particularly Mimi's Act 1 aria and the Act 3 duet both of which bring a lump to my throat alwaysand it did here too. I also cannot hold back my tears during Act 4 knowing what is going to happen at the end just has me in floods and here it did do that.La Boheme while heartrending does also have one or two humorous spots. Particularly in Act 2 primarily Musetta's entrance and Marcello's reactions to her and the men's shock over the expensive bill. The story is beautifully constructed and never feels forced or superficial.The performances are top drawer. Anna Netrebko is a stunning Mimi she is in beautiful voice she looks beautiful here her stage presence feels natural and understated and she really moved me in Act 4. Rolando Villazon is a pleasant surprise. Although the sound does him little favour Villazon does do what he can to give a delicate acting performance as well as using his powerful voice to the limits without overdoing it too much. Nicole Cabell is a sheer delight as Musetta and really holds her own she is deliciously flirty charming and seductive in Quando M'en Vo yet in Act 4 we see a completely different side to Musetta that we don't expect as here she is more humble and sensitive. Marcello and Colline also perform well and the dubbing actually doesn't distract.Overall beautiful version that could have been even better had the sound been more than it was. If you haven't seen it before or any other version of La Boheme have a box of tissues at the ready I think you'll need them. 910 Bethany Cox".

The plastic ghost ship in the bathtub may cause humorous howls from the more FX sensitive.The film is atmospheric and conveys dread with an even hand. The camera work is excellent throughout. More than anything else the film is purely hamstrung by budgetary constraints.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was my first introduction to the severely underrated Blind Dead mythos. Despite their age they stand as some of the most hauntingly eerie and frightening horror films of all time. The film centers for its first half around two models we shall call them 1 and 2 lost at sea on their way to an assignment who come across an old Galleon. 1 goes aboard 2 too frightened to come aboard and disappears. After a long contemplation 2 decides to face her fear and board the decrepit vessel. Naturally 1 does not answer her calls and she assumes it is simply a cruel joke and camps out in one of the ship's rooms. Eventually she is awakened to a noise outside and becomes confronted with the ship's long dead crew of 13th century Templar Knights. They slowly approach extending their skeletal arms. Of course 2 attempts to escape however her attempts are futile as she is caught and almost gloriously in a sickeningly sadistic way lifted onto the shoulders of the knights and carried off to certain death. I suppose it is hard to look at such films objectively without Wes Craven's cleverly written satire Scream coming to mind. As the second model tried feebly to escape the malicious Templars the line always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door! reverberated in my head and I fought the urge to laugh as I was seeing this principle in action. Then I realized just how much principles such as those addressed in Scream fail to work outside the other Wes Craven films. The fact of the matter is 2 did try the front door the boat but the boat had vanished. So at that point all she could do was run feebly up the stairs. It is easy for us the viewer to make such remarks at such situations considering that we are not there on that galleon surrounded by bloodthirsty Templars. It is a simple fact of human nature that in situations of high stress coherent thought becomes jarbled as raw instinct and the will to survive takes over making even the most futile escape routes seem like open doors to havens of unrivaled safety. So to all those who have lambasted such works of art as this for such reasons as those presented in Scream try to tell yourself to run out the front door instead of running up the stairs whenever you're being attacked by a deranged killer or killers alive or undead!. In conclusion the Blind Dead series stands as the epitome of the horror film for their abilities to make the sly satirical remarks of Scream fans null and void in the face of true danger.".

	schema:headline " Welcome aboard for a cruise into another dimension of TERROR!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Blind Dead leave the sanctuary of the Templar's crumbling monastery for the third in the series the floating frightfest Horror of The Zombies aka The Ghost Galleon. If there was ever a film that's rooted firmly in the decade from which it sprung it's this one. Oh and Saturday Night Fever but this one's from 1974 predisco and posttaste.Now if we've all forgotten just how senselessly ugly Seventies fashions were the opener will bring it all kicking and screaming back to us. It's at a swimwear photo shoot where top model Noemi is looking for her missing girlfriend. She's taken to a secret location by photofrau Lillian Maria Perschy where the great mystery is revealed  her girlfriend Cathy and another model are out in the middle of the ocean as part of an elaborate publicity stunt to promote a weathercontrolled boat cooked up by cocky financier Howard Tucker Jack Taylor.Unfortunately for the girls the fog rolls in although being the Seventies everyone is huffing away on cigarettes and cigars so how would you notice and an ancient galleon seemingly abandoned with rags for sails floats into view. The girls radio the news of the Ghost Galleon back to base the resident token egghead Professor Gruber goes a little strange and despite his rigorous scientific training suggests the legendary Ghost Galleon is from a another dimension outside of time and space. Clearly a huge fan of Eric von Daniken Gruber seems to have read one too many supermarket paperbacks on the Bermuda Triangle but like I said it's the Seventies  we ALL read Von Daniken. The girl's are here he reasons but they're not and they won't be coming back. Nothing is real  the ship the fog you or I... A philosophical paradox for sure but the real mystery is this how de Ossorio stretches such a flimsy premise to feature length truly defies all scientific explanation.So of course they all go looking for the Galleon and the missing bikinis or maybe Howard Tucker wants his speedboat back. Cue more fog and the resurrected skeletons of the Knights Templar rising from their onboard coffins. We soon discover on a 16th Century boat there really is nowhere to run. Or you could swim but wait for the waterlogged ending to drown that theory. Preposterous is the key word here  de Ossorio asks a great deal of his viewers to suspend belief when what amounts to little more than chicken bones drags a fully grown woman down a flight of stairs to her complete and utter dismemberment.Horror Of The Zombies features the two most popular stars in Spanish horror. Austrianborn Maria Perschy and American expatriate Jack Taylor who starred in a string of nobudget shockers for Jess Franco and decided he couldn't go home ever again.

	onyx:emotionText "The Blind Dead leave the sanctuary of the Templar's crumbling monastery for the third in the series the floating frightfest Horror of The Zombies aka The Ghost Galleon. If there was ever a film that's rooted firmly in the decade from which it sprung it's this one. Oh and Saturday Night Fever but this one's from 1974 predisco and posttaste.Now if we've all forgotten just how senselessly ugly Seventies fashions were the opener will bring it all kicking and screaming back to us. It's at a swimwear photo shoot where top model Noemi is looking for her missing girlfriend. She's taken to a secret location by photofrau Lillian Maria Perschy where the great mystery is revealed  her girlfriend Cathy and another model are out in the middle of the ocean as part of an elaborate publicity stunt to promote a weathercontrolled boat cooked up by cocky financier Howard Tucker Jack Taylor.Unfortunately for the girls the fog rolls in although being the Seventies everyone is huffing away on cigarettes and cigars so how would you notice and an ancient galleon seemingly abandoned with rags for sails floats into view. The girls radio the news of the Ghost Galleon back to base the resident token egghead Professor Gruber goes a little strange and despite his rigorous scientific training suggests the legendary Ghost Galleon is from a another dimension outside of time and space. Clearly a huge fan of Eric von Daniken Gruber seems to have read one too many supermarket paperbacks on the Bermuda Triangle but like I said it's the Seventies  we ALL read Von Daniken. The girl's are here he reasons but they're not and they won't be coming back. Nothing is real  the ship the fog you or I... A philosophical paradox for sure but the real mystery is this how de Ossorio stretches such a flimsy premise to feature length truly defies all scientific explanation.So of course they all go looking for the Galleon and the missing bikinis or maybe Howard Tucker wants his speedboat back. Cue more fog and the resurrected skeletons of the Knights Templar rising from their onboard coffins. We soon discover on a 16th Century boat there really is nowhere to run. Or you could swim but wait for the waterlogged ending to drown that theory. Preposterous is the key word here  de Ossorio asks a great deal of his viewers to suspend belief when what amounts to little more than chicken bones drags a fully grown woman down a flight of stairs to her complete and utter dismemberment.Horror Of The Zombies features the two most popular stars in Spanish horror. Austrianborn Maria Perschy and American expatriate Jack Taylor who starred in a string of nobudget shockers for Jess Franco and decided he couldn't go home ever again. And yet Horror Of The Zombies was the least successful of the Blind Dead quartet. Perhaps the film strayed too far from the formula although how could you go wrong girls in bikinis on a boat with zombies? Despite its limited scope microcast and tendency to be stagebound it's still an entertaining exercise in tension atmospheric and illogic and the empty eye sockets of the Knights Templar are always a welcome sight.All I can say now is Welcome aboard for a cruise into another dimension of TERROR! with the 1974 Horror Of The Zombies.";

	schema:headline " Cool zombies great concept terrible screenplay";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all Horror Of the Zombies the title of the version I saw makes it sound like the movie is about something that scares the living dead. This turns out not to be the case. If fact these aren't conventional zombies at all they are more like undead pirate skeleton mummies and it turns out that this is actually a sequel in a franchise called The Blind Dead. Now if you ask me The Blind Dead is a much creepier and much less overused concept and would stand out quite a bit from the usual overexposed run of undead horror flicks so the distributor was missing on a good bet here. Apparently this particular variety of skeleton mummy has a predilection for attacking European supermodels or whoever the producers can afford to hire to pretend to be supermodels and there is an ugly violent sexual undertone to much of the proceedings. This includes a nasty gratuitous rape scene near the beginning and two excruciatingly extended scenes where young women are dragged screaming and begging for help to their doom. None of this is visually all that explicit but the soundtrack is mixed way up to capture every gasp sob and moan from the young women. I realize that this is a grindhouse film and so that is a large reason for the film to exist in the first place but it still means the film doesn't age very well. On the good side cool looking zombie designs with the skeletal figures tattered cloaks and empty shadowy eye sockets they're nicely framed and shot and the best parts of the movie consist of watching them advance like a wave of human leprosy. They really do look implacable and sinister as opposed to the normal run of zombies who are somehow pathetic in their advanced states of decomposition. Also good is the rest of the art direction and the set design for the main set of the ghost ship the swirling fog and gloomy sets really do give the impression of a pocket version of Hell. And someone had the brilliant notion to accompany the march of the undead skeletons with some disturbing chants and antiphonal choral sounds these add a great deal of ooomph to the impact of the actual zombie scenes. And the last five minutes or so deliver a nice grim comeuppance of sorts. On the negative side the camera keeps cutting from the viscerally creepy and claustrophobic closed sets to one of the worst miniatures of a ship since...actually these are even worse than the miniature effects in Danger! Death Ray which previously held that title. Looking at these travesties of a socalled ghost galleon completely undercuts all the atmosphere and tension and the effects where coffins sink to the ocean floor are even worse. Why didn't the director just show the coffins sinking into the water on the surface when he saw how awful the miniatures of the coffins on the ocean floor were? Was he that desperate for usable footage? But mostly the screenplay just doesn't deliver. Most of the scenes leading up to the Undead's appearances drag like leaden galoshes. The characters with the exception of the professor are not likable or admirable at all it was nice that Supermodel Noemi was concerned about the fate of her best friend but I was almost happy when she got killed off after 50 minutes of watching her. The logic of the film is constantly falling apart  since when does a professor just know a little bit about exorcisms and since when did exorcisms involve brandishing a flaming cross? If the zombies only attack at night why did they rise off the ocean floor in the middle of the day? If the zombies come up from the hold when they attack why didn't the party find a way to seal the hatch? And the acting is barely there  all though I will admit that the dubbing here is not as awful as you would normally expect in a cheapie like this. Maybe the guy who did the sound design for the zombie attack sequences had a hand in the ADR and mixing of the vocals for the English version. Based on this entry I might conceivably watch the first Blind Dead movie if it appeared on a cable channel or something. Mummy skeletons in cloaks are never a complete waste of time...but this one comes close. If not for the final three minutes of the film which are reminiscent of some of John Carpenter's grimmer tales I'd rate it even lower.".

The title sequence is partially missing probably to accommodate the name change the lack of gore and nudity make me think that this version is a TV edit but until they release a Criterion version this one is OK.Typical ghost ship story with a couple of twists. Namely the ghost ship is full of Templars. Creepy scenes with the bearded Templars running around in their grubby oilskin robes are so well done that they excuse surreally wooden dialog huge plot holes and the all time goofiest burning toy ship in a bathtub scene you will ever see.

	schema:reviewBody "note this review is of the US release version titled HORROR OF THE ZOMBIES and released by IndependentInternational. While this is part of the famous Spanish Blind Dead series it has little to do with the others and has a completely different feel. The ancient zombies do appear but this time they are at sea in a plot that reminded me initially of THE PLAYGIRLS AND THE VAMPIRE. There's not much gore and except for one ugly sexual attack committed by one of the human cast not by a zombie there's little here you couldn't show to a 12 year old. In fact this is really an oldfashioned zombie filman abandoned old Spanish galleon that seems to exist in another dimension is stumbled across by two young models on a publicity stunt in the sea and it turns out to be populated by the Blind Dead. The whole film plays like an amusement park haunted housethe kind where you cruise through it in a boat and are exposed to shocking sights zombies flying out at you etc. I found the film wonderfully entertaining on that level. I don't really care for gore films so I found the tame nature of the film to be refreshing. The two stars in the film in other words NOT the models or the professor who is enlisted to help in the mission are old favorites of international bmovies Jack Taylor legendary for his Mexican horror films and Spanish films of all types and the lovely Maria Perschy and like most established actors who find themselves in these type of films they manage to keep a straight face yet communicate that they are having as much fun as the audience. Some viewers have complained about the many cheaplooking miniatures used for the ship but they are welldone in an old Republic Picture serial kind of way and those who cannot go beyond today's computer generated effects need to get a little willing suspension of disbelief and have some fun. Overall this is a wonderful oldfashioned zombie film that is quite unlike the rest of the Blind Dead series in tone and in amount of gore. You can still find the VHS of the US release titled HORROR OF THE ZOMBIES for next to nothing used mine cost 99 cents and except for not being letterboxed it's supposedly the same cut as that now being sold on a new Blue Underground DVD.".

It's an interesting concept but sadly this film fails to make much of it. As part of a publicity stunt a modeling agency puts bikiniclad models Kathy Blanca Estrada and Lorena Margarita Moreno in a boat way out at sea hoping they'll be rescued by a passing ship and make front page news. Unfortunately both girls become lost in a thick blanket of fog run across a large ghost ship and disappear immediately after boarding first getting word out via radio what's going on. Fearing the bad press headed their way if they don't locate the girls and bring them back safely photographer Lillian Perry Maria Perschy agency head honcho Howard Tucker Jack Taylor and his sadistic assistant Sergio Manuel de Blas who all spearheaded this odd campaign decide to take Howard's yacht out on the sea to find them. Also going along are Professor Gruber Carlos Lemos who is schooled on the Phantom Ship legend and wants to see if there's any truth to it and blonde Noemi Barbara Rey who lets everyone know there will be hell to pay if her roommate and best friend Kathy isn't found. At nightfall the five enter into the mist which is actually another dimension altogether and is invisible to radar run into the galleon board the boat and begin looking around. Their boat disappears and instead of finding Kathy and Lorena they find a bunch of large chests which are the coffinlike resting places of the hooded skeletonfaced Knights Templar zombies. They rise from their slumber every once in awhile to spill some blood for Satan and are scared of fire and crucifixes. We also discover there's a hidden treasure on board the boat but this revelation almost seems like an afterthought thrown in at the end to ensure the death of one of the characters.The cult reputation of this series as far as I can tell seems to rest mainly on the fact they have coollooking zombies. They're definitely the highlight of this movie creepy and menacing looking as they rise up from their tombs slowly shuffle toward their victims and reach out their bony hands at them. Ral Artigot's cinematography and Antn Garca Abril's score are also worth praising and help to make it all fairly atmospheric. Unfortunately the rest of the movie is pretty much a boring mess. My biggest problem with GHOST GALLEON is that is lurches along with the same exact momentum as the featured shambling undead. The pace is deadening slow throughout... The annoying thoroughly unlikable characters bitch walk sleep and stand around with their mouths gaped open for minutes at a time anytime anything weird happens. And when the ghouls corner a victim if you're expecting a nice bloody killing to commence then you're just st out of luck with this one. Almost all of the mayhem takes place offscreen aside from one dismemberment murder which we only see about three quick flashes of and this scene itself has been cut out of some of the video prints. I still have no idea why it's rated R. The dubbing and dialogue are both bad bad bad not that I expected otherwise.The Blue Underground DVD comes with a few extras namely a poster and still gallery a couple of trailers a TV spot and radio spots. They also released a box set with all four Blind Dead titles.".

However it does have a nice eerie atmosphere with all the fog and cultish chants. Plus the skeletons look great.The boat appeared like it was a toy floating in a bathtub. Obviously the budget didn't allow for a real ship. But I could accept it. What annoyed me most was the scene where the blonde chick wakes up the mad skeletons. It takes forever for them to finally claim their prey. She does all this screaming for about 5 minutes then finally loses her head literally.But the Exorcistlike ending was good. These guys are invincible!A more suiting title would be Ship of the Evil Dead. So if you found this title because you're seeking Romero style zombies keep looking. This film is more about demonic supernaturalism. Very spooky.".

I also love the music and chanting that accompanies the Blind Dead.If the film had a little more violence by the Blind Dead some gratuitous nudity cleaned up sfx of the boat when shot from a distance a larger model shot in slomo would suffice a complete overhaul of the dialogue and a better cast this film would have been a classic. The premise is that good. It's easy to see that almost no additional money could have made this film a great one. This split decision garners a 510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite being slightly just slightly disappointed by this third offering I simply can't bring myself to rate any of the Blind Dead films any lower than 7 out of 10. Call me biased if you must but these are eyeless Templar zombies we're talking about here! It's only the greatest most inventive euroexploitation idea of all times and writerdirector Amando de Ossorio never fails in delivering a couple of atmospheric and downright spinechilling scares. Ghost Ships of the Blind Dead has an entirely new setting that immensely appeals to me. The feelings of claustrophobia which automatically come with this setting somewhat makes up for the most powerful sequences of the previous two installments which are missing here namely when the Templar Knights were slowmotion galloping on their undead horses. You guessed it by the title here in part three the Templars bob up and down international waters on a mysterious 16th century galleon. Two young fashion models floating around the ocean unprotected for the sake of a publicity stunt report the existence of the eerie galleon before vanishing of the face of the planet. A limited rescue expedition is sent after them only to encounter an alternate fog bank dimension where the blind dead walk the deck of their ship at night and guard a legendary treasure. Compared to the first two films Ghost Ships starts off rather slow and it nearly takes half a film before we get to see our beloved sinister skeletons and hear their obligatory Gothic music. For some reason probably budgetrelated this second sequel is also a lot softer as most of the killings take place offscreen and not one of the female cast members takes her clothes off! Nonetheless and as stated above this film is overall very suspenseful and contains several beautifully horrific images. The climax sequence here is also a vast improvement over the one in Return of the Blind Dead and definitely raises your expectations for yet another fun sequel. And maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of this series but I definitely think that this entry in particular was very influential to future horror classics. The terrific scene near the end in which the Templar zombies emerge from the sea was imitated by Ken Wiederhorn in Shock Waves and the glorious use of ominous inescapable fog was optimized by John Carpenter in duh The Fog.".

I jumped to the chance of renting it not wanting to wait for whenever Anchor Bay decided to release it. Seeing as they had already released Tombs of the Blind Dead and it's first sequel.Two models Cathy and Lorraina are for some not quite clear reason sent out to sea on a boat for a publicity campaign of some stunt. They soon come along an oldtime galleon in the midst of darkness and fog. Lorraina boards and is heard screaming and soon Cathy follows and the Templars come for her too. Meanwhile Cathy's best friend Noami not Naomi as I figured but Noami is searching for her and soon gets herself into trouble with Sergio who was behind the publicity stunt. She demands they go off and find the girls so with the help of a professor Noami Sergio photographer Lillian and Howard whom I forgot the involvement of with the subplot head out to sea to find the girls. They soon find the galleon and board only to soon be greeted by the Templar knights from the dead and they discover they are trapped in another dimension ! and must defeat the curse of the knights and escape.It's a miracle I remembered all those characters' names!A pretty good movie suspenseful Templar attacks. The galleon is creepylooking but so obviously fake it's funny. It looks like it belongs in one of those old claymation shows from the sixties and seventies. The acting is what you would expect from a movie like this and the music is the classic chanting that always sets a good atmosphere. The only problem with this is that it wasn't milked for all it was worth. The story seemed short and a bit weak at times. And understandably so. How much story could there be! Still though an alright movie with a creepy ending. One odd note the sound suddenly disappeared the last ten seconds of the film. Was that intentional? It could have been but it seemed a little odd. I don't know could have been the copy of the movie I got. Overall I recommend this for Blind Dead fans if you can find it. Not as drawnout at Tombs and not as exciting as Return except Return's horrendously flat ending! but still a good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Plot Synopsis Sporting goods magnate Howard Tucker sends two models in a speedboat into the Atlantic for a publicity stunt. Contact with the pair is lost but not before they report being stuck in a fog  coming into contact with a 16th Century galleon. Along with another model his modelling agent a henchman  a scientist Tucker organizes an expedition to find the missing models. They board the galleon where they encounter the blind zombies of the Knights Templar who were banished to the sea for devilworship.Film Review The Ghost Galleon known in some countries as either Ghost Ship of the Blind Dead or Horror of the Zombies is the third film in Spanish director Amando De Ossorio's Blind Dead saga. The original film TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD was one of the finest zombie films that Spain has ever produced only matched with the relatively recent effort REC.In keeping with the series' tradition The Ghost Galleon is less a sequel than an outright remake. As was the case with all the sequels the rules are changed with each film  here the Knights Templar are devil worshippers who are condemned to sail the seas for eternity.None of the films in the Blind Dead series particularly stand out in terms of script quality but the writing for The Ghost Galleon is noticeably shoddy. One may get past the idea of a platoon of zombies roaming the seas in a derelict ship but the idea of a salesman sending a pair of models in a speedboat into the Atlantic shipping lanes for a publicity stunt is ridiculous to say the least  what is the point of this?

	onyx:emotionText "Plot Synopsis Sporting goods magnate Howard Tucker sends two models in a speedboat into the Atlantic for a publicity stunt. Contact with the pair is lost but not before they report being stuck in a fog  coming into contact with a 16th Century galleon. Along with another model his modelling agent a henchman  a scientist Tucker organizes an expedition to find the missing models. They board the galleon where they encounter the blind zombies of the Knights Templar who were banished to the sea for devilworship.Film Review The Ghost Galleon known in some countries as either Ghost Ship of the Blind Dead or Horror of the Zombies is the third film in Spanish director Amando De Ossorio's Blind Dead saga. The original film TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD was one of the finest zombie films that Spain has ever produced only matched with the relatively recent effort REC.In keeping with the series' tradition The Ghost Galleon is less a sequel than an outright remake. As was the case with all the sequels the rules are changed with each film  here the Knights Templar are devil worshippers who are condemned to sail the seas for eternity.None of the films in the Blind Dead series particularly stand out in terms of script quality but the writing for The Ghost Galleon is noticeably shoddy. One may get past the idea of a platoon of zombies roaming the seas in a derelict ship but the idea of a salesman sending a pair of models in a speedboat into the Atlantic shipping lanes for a publicity stunt is ridiculous to say the least  what is the point of this? The models aren't displaying anything  only have a small boat to stay in.

It's up to their mates some shady guy and a couple of others to look for them.

This time the setting is a galleon from the 16th century that only appears to small watercraft.  The plot is pretty typical as a pair of models on a boat hook up with the galleon as it comes out of a consuming fog and mist.  They disappear and others go after them.  We eventually learn that the ship is centuries old traveling in its own time field.  The prey as with most Ossorio films is filled with beautiful bikiniclad women warbling out their deathscreams thus alerting their predators of their whereabouts. Atmosphere over plot to be sure here and the film does pretty good as a suspense vehicle.  The special effects...well they are not too special.  The ship is quite effective in closeups and midshots but long shots reveal that it is nothing more than a model.  The acting is pretty typical of such films but certainly not detracting in any way.  All in all this is a fine edition to the Blind Dead series....not the best...but entertaining nonetheless.".

One of the forces that championed this film to me was Cathall Tolhill and Peter Tombs' IMMORAL TALES  a highly Squonk Approved compendium on European erotic horror  exploitation films 1962 to 1982 or so. The nice big color reproduction of the EL BUQUE MALDITO marquee poster was what really caught my imagination though The image of the bikini'd lovely being carried to her death like a lifesized holy communion is very striking and in fact restaged in the film in a really eerie moment.But when I first saw the print Brentwood digitized I kind of wondered if Cathall  Pete had been referring to a different film. Along with their writings posts to various message forums on Eurohorror and contact with folks who knew it inside  out had sort of created this expectation of an insane bowel eviscerating excersize in borderline pornographic horror.What I found instead has been FAR FAR more precious this is one of the most gloriously goofy movies ever made and now a genuine Guilty Pleasures favorite  especially when viewed in it's 'UNCUT' 90 minute form available online from a number of sources though forget about Amazon. The preferred English Language version to find is a long out of print reissue for home video from the mid 1980's called HORROR OF THE ZOMBIES. Unfortunate choice of titles one of my thesis statements on Ossorio's work relates to how irresponsibly his work has been marketed. Sorry to nitpick but the Blind Dead aren't zombies they are Templars. Members of the Knights Templars sect based on a legend of a band of blind monks who banded together to protect the innocent from the ravages of the Spanish Inquisition which No One Expects!! by the way. Sorry had to do that once DOssorio changed that legend and made the Templars a group of Knights who had learned the secret of eternal life while on Crusade in the middle east Torture and ritually slaughter a gorgeous Spanish supporting actress then feast on her still warm blood and flesh. If anything they have more in common with vampires  very much in vogue for 1970's Eurohorror. They sleep in graves or coffins between blood rituals cannot be harmed by conventional methods other than burning and according to EL BUQUE MALDITO fear exorcismic incantations  flaming crosses. Good thing they had a Professor from a local science institute with them to act as an Expert figure who just happened to be versed in the Templars.And right there is the beginning of why this is such a fun movie. Movies used to be fun. Now there has to be some message some underlying theme to redeem the 20 million dollars wasted on the garbage flooding the cineplex screens. They are painful to sit through and look like they were painful to make.Not this one. This must have been a riot mostly because Ossorio apparently shared the insight with those involved that what they were making was GARBAGE and as such the film is better than it had to be but still produces some great laugh out loud That is sooo fake moments that are just plain fun. If anything the movie looks like it may have been inspired by that old SCOOBY DOO WHERE ARE YOU? adventure with the Ghost Pirate on his sunken galleon in the Sargasso Sea wherever. The film starts with a rather pointless introduction that includes an unpleasant sex assault scene flavorings of a women in prison flick? but once the main action moves above the galleon set Ossorio was able to utilize the interest level picks up.Fans of Godzilla films and other classics of miniature trick shot cinematography will be WOW!'ed by the gripping images of a model boat bobbing in a bathtub. Those familiar with the churning force of the sea will be impressed that Ossorio found himself the one spot in the Medeterranean to film this where THERE IS NO WIND waves or other natural forces that might ruin a shot. The scenes on the galleon were actually shot on what looks like a closed television soundscreen and bring to mind the stunning realism of Hammer's PREHISTORIC WOMEN set in the treacherous reaches of Pinewood Studios where they made a fake jungle. I love stuff like that! Give me Ossorio's model boat destroyed by being lit on fire by a cigarette lighter over another Jar Jar Binks movie any day  I will be a happy man.Of the legendary scenes of sex and GORE that are often whispered about forget it. Yes Brentwood's appropriated print has shortened the sex assault scene and did cut the one big gore moment where the ditzy blond lesbian fashion model is hacked to bits by the Templars as a midvoyage snack but the results of finding it intact will probably leave the GORE fanatic nonplussed. That's it? was my reaction after seeing it uncut for the first time. And yes that's it. No nudity at all registers on this print and it is not a covered take though the theory that it appears to have been made for television is salient That would explain the broadcast media style videotaped look to the majority of the soundstage scenes where the first two and last installments of the series are all photomechanical film down to the last frame.So with no boobs  very little blood the two first blood rituals happen offcamera and we aren't even treated to a viewing of the messy aftermaths the main interest in the film is related to who made it and how. Ossorio was a very visually oriented director and posters of comments are 100 correct when stating that the images involving the Templars skanking about in their rotting robes  drooling all over the fashion models are mesmerizing ... There is a juxtaposition going on with bikinis and GoGo boots on one side rotting skeletal vampiric Templars on the other that creates a sort of Gee I wonder impression. The mind takes over fills in the gaps and PRESTO! A film that suggests perhaps more than it actually depicts.But that is what leaves peope feeling short changed one trusted colleage whom I had sought an opinion on this said it was boring but I think we come back to my thesis Nobody really knew how to market Ossorio's movies and lumped them in with crapola that deserves titles like ZOMBIE FLESH EATER when in fact he was making modern Spanish art with film circa 1973. The best images he arrived at are just as beautiful horrible repulsive and hypnotic as anything Goya ever painted and made him a whole heck of a lot of cash.Seek out those Brentwood sets it is also available on a 5 disc 10 movie set called DEADTIME STORIES that has his final BLIND DEAD film on it as well and be prepared for skinny fashion models being menaced by goons shuffling templars on a boat a burning model in a bathtub and you should be all set.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the best of the 'Blind Dead' films... but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. If you're going to sit through any of them I'd recommend you be on some sort of heavy narcotic. Morphine or any opiate derivative would probably be best as this will slow down your brain's response time enough to match the pace of the film and unlike alcohol you'll be too languid to get up and find something better to do. A sense of humor will go a long way in getting you through the film as well.The decaying corpses of the Templar Knights have given up their timehonored hobby of horse riding for boating in this one and actually their creepy old Spanish galleon does manage to provide a rather foreboding atmosphere that is when it's not a poor scale model filmed in a bath tub. Also some exposition about the boat existing in some sort of Bermuda Triangleish alternate dimension which is inescapable once entered adds to the almost nonexistent fun. But the nautical folklore only goes so far and the film plods along.It's a decent setting and a basic premise that John Carpenter did wonders with in his classic 'The Fog' but obviously De Ossorio is no Carpenter. This barely even works as camp but that's really the only way you can view it. The characters are all stupid beyond belief which usually works in a campy film's favor but the movie moves so slowly and the dialogue is so sparse that it sometimes takes a full ten minutes for a character to do or say something that you can laugh at. Also it takes the Templars what feels like an hour to kill someone and they go kicking and screaming the WHOLE way. I'm all for Scream Queens but may I recommend a cut to the other characters HEARING them scream or a really cool death scene to justify it all instead of just a little bit of blood drooling out of their mouth? There's no nuditywhich is a terrible shame as there is no shortage of hot models but they do spend the whole film in bikinis so that's kind of a plus. So yeah watch it for the creepy pirate ship atmosphere with cool wind sounds and all extremely stupid girls in bikinis clunky dialogueand of course the skeletal Templars who were wearing hoodies and making it look good several hundred years before you were born. Or don't watch it and save yourself the anguish. But if someone's holding a gun to your head and forcing you to pick between this or the followup 'Night of the Seagulls' for God's sake PICK THIS ONE! 'Night of the Seagulls' will swallow your SOUL!".

If you're going to sit through any of them I'd recommend you be on some sort of heavy narcotic. Morphine or any opiate derivative would probably be best as this will slow down your brain's response time enough to match the pace of the film and unlike alcohol you'll be too languid to get up and find something better to do.

	schema:reviewBody "The Ghost Galleon is a pretty underrated entry in the series.SPOILERSA young model Noemi Barbara Rey is worried about her friend Kathy Blanca Estrada who has disappeared for several days. Her boss Lilian Maria Perschy informs her that Kathy is out on an assignment for Howard Tucker Jack Taylor a sporting magnate and takes them both to his headquarters to check in on them. When Kathy reports a strange mist and a floating galleon close by Howard becomes concerned for her safety and decides to investigate. Professor Gruber Carlos Lemos a meteorologist comes along as he has heard the myths about the galleon. Arriving to find the ship desolate and empty the only trace of Kathy being her handbag. Thinking it's a sign she ventures around the ship and finds the hold to contain coffins containing the Knights Templar undead creations who come to life and overrun the ship. Thinking of desperate measures to escape the everdwindling group struggles to survive.The Good News The Ghost Galleon is the underrated entry in the series and it's not nearly as bad as some have made it out to be. This is a great return to the Gothic feeling of the first one with the spooky interiors of the ship it's best part. Barely lit cobweb filled and just filled with the right amount of ambiance to creep out the viewer the ship is a masterpiece of mood that works wonderfully. Working just as well is the setups to use that imagery. Having extended scenes where people wander around aimlessly looking for something are handled the best and they are particularly suspenseful. Many are quite extended giving added suspense as it takes a while to get to the fruit of the search the Blind Dead themselves. It bares little mention that they again steal the show the slowly shuffling horde are at their usual creepiness here. The decayed look bony claws and rotting hoods are a near perfect horror creation. It was also a pretty creative move to place them on the ship here as it ups the suspense considerably when you know there is no escape from a neverending threat such as this and the different suggestions to how to deal with them are both creative in their thought and logical in their realization. It was also a clever way of dealing with the ship as it's true nature is spelled out quite effectively and gives a couple of other really effective scenes. It also works well to add a little more suspense in the film which this is the most suspenseful film bar the original. It was pretty well handled.The Bad News There are mainly two main gripes I have against the film the Templars have very little screen time being restricted to come on only to kill off a character after an extended stalk sequence. A little more screen time for them would've gone a long way here as my second gripe will illustrate. This is a pretty slow film which isn't as violent or actionpacked as the second one. The Templars work well with extended sequences on screen and here the slow pace doesn't allow a lot of time for them. Otherwise I was quite entertained by this one.The Final Verdict By fixing two problems this becomes a much better film that it's reputation deserves to be. It's the second most Gothicinfluenced film in the series and it features a lot more suspense than many give it credit for. Patient fans of the series may get a kick out of it as well as oldschool horror fans.Rated R Violence a rape scene Brief Nudity and mild language".

I am glad I didn't listen to their disappointment and went to see it anyway. Sometimes it is critics that are the disappointment! The acting was tremendous. The setting of India was beautiful and perfect. The theatre was full and as most people have already said here everyone was laughing out loud. It was like a great and funny and cleansing session at a cinematherapistthat just washed over you so touching were all the emotions and insights so real to life you could not believe they were acting.I read one newspaper critic who said the characters didn't have enough depth. Well no it was a two hour movie silly and what you got was a vignette of 7 real lives each of them facing the reality of old age in their own way.How wonderful to have a real movie about real issues that addresses them with humour and leaves you feeling uplifted. And how refreshing to have a film by and for the mature and senior members of society. To me the whole idea and effect of this movie is to fly in the face of the Western idea we have of old age somehow being something pitiful to be feared and if possible to be glossed over fixed up and avoided so you can remain as young powerful and appealing to your very last day as possible.The movie opens up all these ideas to question and I am sure left many like me pondering. Why are over 60's in this country called Old Age Pensioners when no selfrespecting American would allow that? They are Senior Citizens over therenote the difference. Why don't we look after and respect our elders? Why does the extended family work perfectly well in countries like Italy Spain Greece India but is a rarity here? And who is responsible for ignoring or marginalizing a whole generation of baby boomers who lived through and oversaw one of the biggest transformations in society ever? They were the generation that believed in a Brave New World and many of them still do.A society that doesn't value the wisdom and experience of its elders is without foundation.Young and oldevery man is a piece of the continent a part of the whole. Go and see this movie and think about it. And take your family. Great stuff.".

It really is the most entertaining colourful and uplifting film I've seen for a very long time. Apart from India itself  which is a star in its own right  it is the performances from this stellar cast that really make this movie. At times it was like an acting masterclass but never at any time could you see the cogs turning. The central characters were all wholly believable and to be honest I find it impossible to single anyone out although if I had to my vote would probably go to Bill Nighy. He is just superb as Douglas  the apologetic hesitant henpecked husband of the self centred bitter scolding Jean portrayed by Penelope Wilton who is also excellent. There is one particular scene between the two where Douglas for once bites back  and the emotion from Nighy is just mesmerising to watch. When you add the likes of Dames Maggie Smith and Judy Dench to the mix the delicious Celia Imrie Tom Wilkinson and Ronald Pickup with an honourable mention to the latter who brought a wonderfully rakish comedic performance to the mix  and you can't go wrong. The younger cast members and all the supporting players do an excellent job  but it is the oldies who steal the show. That doesn't mean it's an oldies film  far from it. I took my 16 year old daughter and she laughed cried and loved it as much as I did.".

So this is a movie aiming at a very different demographic than the usual teenagetargeted Hollywood fare and it is a refreshing and welcome change that will delight young as well as old.The doyennes of the cast are Judi Dench and Maggie Smith who are both now in their late 70s but sparkle here as very different lonely singletons. Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton play a sweet and sour couple in the thespian menu. Tom Wilkinson is a retired judge with a secret. Finally Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup are two more sad souls who might or might not find solace together. All of the seven find that retirement can be 'outsourced' to an Indian hotel that certainly looks exotic in the photoshopped brochure but actually needs somewhat more than the enthusiasm of its young manager Dev Patel with romantic problems of his own.The location of the hotel is Jaipur in northern India which is a character in itself and since I have visited the city I can attest to the wonderful vibrancy and colour of this extraordinary metropolis. Butas our seven intrepid Brits learn India requires some adjustment to one's expectations and lifestyle and some make the adjustment sooner or better than others. A cynic might dub this multiple storyline of comedy and romance as Love Geriatrically and the characters are rather stereotypical but this is a delightful movie that makes the viewer feel good about life.".

Once it is released to paying customers I can assure you that this score will go up considerably.The title can be a little off putting but anyone who has seen Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Cafe will tell you that a daft title is not a precursor to a bad film. Far from it.I came out of the cinema exhausted. The range of emotions this movie drags out of you and the speed it does it is incredible and I have to thank the scriptwriters and director for that. It is a while since I saw a movie that made me laugh out loud so much and so frequently. Dev Patel's character is one of the most likable you will ever come across but then all the characters bar one have characteristics that just grow on you.It's a shame that Ronald Pickup and the beautiful Celia Imrie aren't shown on the poster as they are just as responsible for the enjoyment I got from this film as the other more famous members of the cast.This is a great film that will have you crying and laughing in equal measure but in the end will leave you with that really warm feeling inside that you get when you have just seen a classic.Do not be put off by the title and ignore the current score this film has until it starts to get up to at least an 8.".

Judi Dench is excellent as always and Bill Nighy really captures the child within for this film. In fact all of the cast were superb although Dev Patel suffered from a little overacting! The plot is more like a moral and explores a 'young at heart' theme throughout. I think the vision of the film is somewhat confused at times. It seems to shift from a fullon comedy to a film about ageism and it doesn't flow as well as one would hope. Also Maggie Smith's character although superbly played is a slightly far fetched transformation so I would have liked to see more focus on her throughout the film. Overall though a nice entertaining piece of work. Perhaps not as good as you would expect from such a starstudded cast but nevertheless very entertaining!".

The Daily Mail readers were out in force this morning free tickets in hand and storming the cinema to catch this charming story of a bunch of old folks retiring in India. Like the line for entry to heaven there was regretfully the odd young person in the audience no doubt terrified at the prospect of leaving their life behind to sit with all the oldies for what might seem like eternity.But fortunately The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a charmer and even the youngest viewers will find something to enjoy here. Whether it's Bill Nighy again stealing the film from under the noses of an accomplished ensemble see also Love Actually or the sweet love story of the films only younger characters the film has enough unexpected moments to mask the more predictable and clichd elements of the story.When seven British retirees opt to 'outsource' their retirements to cheap and cheerful India they arrive at a hotel that is not as expected from the brochure. Dev Patel's Sonny runs the place under the watchful eye of his disapproving mother and the visitors are left to dust off the furniture and make do with the cockroaches on the floors and the curry served up every dinnertime. The stars of the movie are delightful Judi Dench does vulnerable but determined Bill Nighy funny and heartbreaking and Tom Wilkinson quiet reserved and struggling with an unexpected burden. It is a story of seven characters facing up to a new time of their lives with new challenges and new loves presenting themselves. It is a hopeful story about letting go of the past and embracing the future.Like any film set in the country India is a central character. The colours the faces the smiles the sounds the hustle and bustle of the packed streets all assault the senses not just for the characters but also for the viewer. You might see less of the real India than many would like but it is always present in the background.The love stories are touching with the ups and downs of relationships sensitively written. The unwinding of Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton's Douglas and Jean is particularly well handled and bound to induce the odd tear once the inevitable finally happens. Wilkinson's search for a lost love is concluded a little too conveniently and lacks the emotional gutpunch it could have. But all the characters get their moments in the spotlight whether it is bigoted old racist Maggie Smith's opening of her heart to the locals or Ronald Pickup's desperate search for a last bit of nookie ahem sorry meaningful connection.The elderly members of the audience loved it laughing heartily from the opening moments of Dench on the phone to her internet service provider. More unsettling was how many found Maggie Smith's Muriel and her hideously outdated racist comments at the beginning even funnier. Hopefully the Daily Mail readers like Muriel will come away from the film with a slightly enlightened view of the world outside their doors.Overall Dench and Nighy are the standouts but Wilkinson also gets a strong storyline in a film chockfull to the brim with colour joy a little bit of sadness and hardship and a lot of hope.

A couple of other things didn't work either. I know it was supposed to have comic aspects but Dev Patel's stereotype might even have embarrassed Peter Sellars. However the most incongruous moment was when Maggie Smith suddenly revealed herself no longer a senile old nanny who used to manage a household budget but someone who could glance at a set of accounts and instantly assess a hotel business.

	schema:reviewBody "Seven elderly English people move to India. They do this because they have been lured by promises of a golden retirement far from the drizzle and depression of Dorking. Naturally when they arrive in the East things are not as they expected. Obstacles must be overcome new ways of living must be learned and people find they must let go of the past. Can these sixtyandseventysomethings overcome their prejudices and forge a new life in the Third World? This being a British middleclass attempt at a comedydrama you can round up the usual suspects  Judi Dench Maggie Smith Bill Nighy Ronald Pickup Celia Imrie what happened to Richard Briers and Maria Aitken? Were they tied up in pantomime in Leatherhead? To be a successful TV and film actor in England you must a speak with a cutglass accent and b have been born before World War Two.

If the threadbare Empire thing is finally receding there are many educated British people who have backpacked their way around Goa and Uttar Pradesh in their student days and are also vaguely aware of India as an emerging economy so there might be money to be made from an AngloIndian film. So why the stereotypes? To say this film's understanding of India is skindeep is not being very complimentary  towards skin. India in 2012 is a burgeoning modern state with its own nuclear weapons and its own space program. In a population of 1.2 billion there are quite a few switchedon individuals who know about stuff. But in Western films we stubbornly insist on patronizing this vast and vibrant culture. You know the sort of thing. Get to India and you can't trust the water can't trust the food can't trust the drivers. Sonny Dev Patel is the young dreamer whose ramshackle hotel forms the setting of the story and guess what  he is delightful charming unrealistic and not entirely honest. In other words he is a child. Adorable but a child. And there's the rub. Like City of Joy and Slumdog Millionaire this film feeds into the assumption that Indians are inferior. They don't have our standards. Efficiency propriety hygiene  these are Western characteristics. You enter the maelstrom when you set out on an Indian road because  bless them  they are suicidal maniacs when they get behind the wheel of a motorized vehicle. And they eat funny food. What becomes of our Surbiton Seven after they've exchanged Cheam for Chandigarh? Well it's all fairly predictable. They go through a phase of disillusionment then they learn to love the Indians and it all gets nice and heartwarming. Evelyn Judi Dench's character starts working in a call center and Muriel Maggie Smith takes a look at the hotel books. Before you can say poppadum the call center is a raging success because Evelyn shows the operators how to interact with callers. The hotel is turned around because now somebody with skill is controlling the finances. You see? That's all India needed  for two elderly women to show up and tell the locals what to do. Never mind that Muriel is a dyedinthewool racist and Evelyn has never actually had a job of any kind in her life. As for Norman Ronald Pickup he is the Reigate Romeo who can't accept the aging process and the loss of sexual potency. Know what happens? He meets an English woman who's lived all her life in India and they fall in love. The Subcontinent has worked its magic again. The only thing is why couldn't he fall in love with an Indian woman? In the final analysis the film doesn't work because these people are not touched by India. They go there but they remain psychologically in Wimbledon. India is a success only in so far as it submits to Western ways of doing things. Sunny decides he's going to marry Sunaina Tena Desae even though she's from an inferior caste because he wants to  and love conquers all doesn't it? Never mind that they are both Hindus living in an ancient Hindu civilization with its timehonored ways of doing things. The Western quick fix is the way to go. How nice for us to be able to breathe in India's aromas glory in its colors solve all its problems within hours of arriving  and still remain stranded psychologically in Surrey.".

Naturally when they arrive in the East things are not as they expected. Obstacles must be overcome new ways of living must be learned and people find they must let go of the past. Can these sixtyandseventysomethings overcome their prejudices and forge a new life in the Third World?

While the standard clichs of the foreigner in India initially struggling with the dust and flies and poverty and noise and finally embarking of a successful journey of selfdiscovery after accepting India for what it is and going with the flow genre are all present it is the performances and the dialogue that make this movie work.

Well okay at times it's a little predictable the premise is wholly unlikely and certain aspects tie up too neatly but then Shakespeare built a 400 year and counting career on such plots and it didn't do him any harm. More recently the same can be said of Billy Elliot Notting Hill The Lord of the Rings trilogy I'm sure you catch my drift. It loses one star for that but I'm not going to knock it.It's directed by Jon Madden who helmed Mrs Brown Shakespeare in Love and The Debt we'll gloss over the literary mutilation that was Captain Corelli's Mandolin and he's reunited here with the star of two of those films Judi Dench. Not content with casting one of the finest actresses of any generation he's gathered an impressive who's who of acting aristocracy Bill Nighy Maggie Smith Penelope Wilton Tom Wilkinson Celia Imrie Ronald Pickup and topped it up with Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel.For various reasons surrounding diminished wealth health and happiness seven British wrinklies decamp to India to retire and recuperate at the eponymous hotel. Unfortunately it doesn't quite resemble the brochure lacking phones doors rooms They are thrown together in an experience that challenges their prejudices makes them reevaluate their lives and in certain instances takes them so far out of their comfort zones that all manner of emotions tumble out of them. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a film about dismantling and building relationships and learning new things about old selves. It's often funny frequently touching occasionally frustrating constantly inspirational and thoroughly uplifting.One minor plot line is left unresolved for me at least but the film doesn't end. It simply closes a chapter and so there is great hope. It may not be the greatest film ever but it has its place in the world and will probably earn a space on my DVD shelf. It is beautiful in many ways the nuances of lesser characters the touching honesty of principals and the simple humorous and occasionally poignant dialogue all bring colour and light to the 124 minutes you'll spend in the company of this film.Beyond all that is delightfully scripted the overwhelming beauty that floods through the film is the location. The decaying crumbling ornate temples are magnificent on their own but the striking saris the vivid blossoms and the heartwarming smiles rekindled memories of my own all too brief and all too distant experiences of India. I recalled every sight sound and smell and my mouth watered in recollection of the exquisite meals I ate in dusty cafes and vibrant streets and I wished throughout the film on my drive home and in several dreams to experience again feeling alive in India and perhaps living there.I want to be old I want to be poor and I want to retire to India right NOW!

But for the over 60s in our group of film goers there were some inescapable questions. Who would provide health care indeed how would that be paid for in the absence of an NHS? What if one choked to death in the dust and fumes? And none of us could see the point of having the youthful love interest except that it felt somehow contrived as if to balance out the oldies.

I have never found myself to like any of his work. I find him samey and lamey. This however really opened my eyes to how fantastic an actor this guy is! He was one of my favourites I really felt I bonded with the character so well done Bill.

Judi Dench can do no wrong as far as I am concerned even in this light role she can say more with a glance than many actors can with an hour of screen time.Tom Wilkinson the only one of the group wise in the ways of India plays a retired judge with a secret is reliable if not surprising.

Celia Imrie is the hunter of wealthy men who assists Ronald Pickup an inept Lothario a brilliant turn these characters are even more thinly sketched than the others. Dev Patel is in danger of getting typecast and he does an adequate job of being a kind hearted by nave Indian dreamerhotelier.

At times touching at others funny it's the sort of well produced picture that gets taken for granted by snooty critics who can't see past the end of their nose. Picture basically thrusts all its characters into life affirmingchanging situations their fears hangups and closet terrors are all laid bare under the pleasant Indian sun. The messages are played out in bold type but this is a great thing since the writing is so delicate and it of course helps that the cast performances are superb. With the film set in Jaipur we also get a peek at Indian culture how the populace live everyday life while the young love strand involving Dev Patel and Tena Desae is no hindrance to the elderly relationships this is because it acts as a counter point to love being relevant at any stage of life. It's just one of the big themes in a film that is undeniably big on heart.Watch and pick your favourite character your favourite moment and maybe keep the Kleenex handy as well. A beautiful and involving picture for the young and old to enjoy. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Long live Mike Barker! This fairly fresh feature director has pulled off one of those rare tributes to the film noir scene which once coloured the movie scene in the past. There have been worthy efforts but this one seems to have it all right. The movie starts as most movies from Mike Barker start. Circumstances found as in the traditions of working class realism found in the films of Ken Loach and the novels of Alan Silitoe colour the first couple of scenes. The story starts with a scene in which is explained that Bryce Josh Brolin has 'accidentally' raped a minor. He calls his old university buddy friend Nick Nivola to help him out. At this moment the story rewinds to 4 months earlier and we can peak in the history to see how this problem started. Nick has just lost his father found out he doesn't get any money and works at a recycling plant. He than engages in some criminal activities which turns horribly sour and he ends up owing 15000 dollars to a local criminal. Now that's all you need to know about the storyline there are so many plots and twists that even the most critical movie fan would be impressed by the surprises that are being thrown at you. The last time I experienced such a feast was during the Usual Suspects and that is quite a compliment.Reese Witherspoon Lissa nick's girlfriend and the 'raped' minor pulls off one of her more impressing acting roles since 'Freeway' Although a bit more constraint than her role in Freeway her presence definitely enriches the movie. Allessandro Nivola Nick will await a big future. His nonchalance acting and worried looks will make him the perfect actor for subblockbusters. Finally one of his bigger roles after movies such as Inventing the Abbotts and FaceOff. Josh Brolin is less appealing but even he is not bad enough to ruin this movie.Mike Barker continues his strong line of work after The James Gang in '97. And in a sort of way this movie resembles his previous to some aspect. In both movies poor families take center stage and in both movies they are resulting in criminal activities because of the financial trouble they are in. Barker is definitely one of the most artistic directors around up there with Scorsese but one wonders if he doesn't overdue it a bit sometimes. Even these minor negative things can't make me change my mind that this is a great movie cinematic wise with a well written script that the characters are well thought out and acted and that Barker has proven himself once more that he is a major talent. Bravo!".

Josh Brolin is less appealing but even he is not bad enough to ruin this movie.Mike Barker continues his strong line of work after The James Gang in '97. And in a sort of way this movie resembles his previous to some aspect. In both movies poor families take center stage and in both movies they are resulting in criminal activities because of the financial trouble they are in. Barker is definitely one of the most artistic directors around up there with Scorsese but one wonders if he doesn't overdue it a bit sometimes. Even these minor negative things can't make me change my mind that this is a great movie cinematic wise with a well written script that the characters are well thought out and acted and that Barker has proven himself once more that he is a major talent. Bravo!";

	schema:headline " Where's Mamet When You Need Him?";
	schema:reviewBody "Screenwriter Ted Griffin takes a page out of the David Mamet book with this story of the things we do for love and money and how desperation has a way of leading even the most forthright among us into regions beyond the known. And the fact that there is no such animal as a sure thing is pointedly expressed in Best Laid Plans' a dramathriller directed by Mike Barker and starring Reese Witherspoon and Alessandro Nivola. The film begins with a meeting in a bar between Nick Nivola and Bryce Josh Brolin old college chums who have not seen one another since graduation.  Over a few rounds of drinks they get reacquainted Bryce is back in town to teach while Nick has secured employment at the local recycling establishment.  They do the goodtoseeyouagain thing and Nick leaves.  But at about two o'clock in the morning he gets a call from Bryce who begs him to come over to his house actually one he's watching for some friends who are out of town.  Nick doesn't want to go but Bryce sounds desperate and he can't refuse.  What he finds when he gets there is something totally out of left field.  Suffice to say it involves a young woman named Lissa Witherspoon whom Bryce picked up in the bar just as Nick was leaving.  It's not a pretty situation and Bryce doesn't know what to do so it falls to Nick to figure it out.  And now having crossed that proverbial line in the sand Nick's involved too.  Or so it seems.  But then again maybe there's more to this than meets the eye.  There's just something about this whole setup that instinctively tells you that what appears to be ain't necessarily so.  The question is what is it and who is doing what to whom exactly?Barker has fashioned a fairly involving film from a story that initially seems somewhat convoluted but which evolves and later can actually be regarded as having a plot that is quite intricate and credible making the comparison to Mamet entirely valid.  The difference between this film and one of Mamet's however lies in the fact that Barker simply doesn't have that Mamet touch when it comes to presenting the material.  He does a decent job but lacks the finesse the eye for detail and the grasp of what it takes to achieve that necessary sense of mystery that could have taken it to a much higher level.  It lacks that sense of fear and menace and the urgency it needed to be really effective.  Barker does manage to give you enough to sustain interest but his pace is wanting there are moments when the pulse of his film simply flatlines.Nivola is clearly the star of the show and his performance is passable but he lacks that extra something that quality that would have made his character anything special or memorable.  Nick is believable but too common there's simply nothing distinctive enough about him to make you care much what happens to him one way or the other.  On one hand it's good acting the character is real but he's a guy who leaves you fairly nonplused he needs a hangnail as it were a flaw that would have at least made him interesting.Witherspoon gives a good performance but this character is certainly not a stretch for her by any means.  Lissa like Nick is rather nondescript and Witherspoon does little to spark much interest in her.  In her defense however Barker really doesn't afford her the time nor the opportunity to do much exploring by way of characterization.  But she is watchable and fans of hers especially will no doubt find her work here satisfying.As Bryce Josh Brolin is disappointing giving a onenote performance that is flat and forced.  Granted his character is supposed to be something of a nerd but he puts nothing into it a bit of nuance would have done wonders for his portrayal and it's the kind of character that is ripe with opportunity like a blank canvas just waiting to be shaded and textured. But Brolin dropped the ball and Bryce ends up being completely forgettable.The supporting cast includes Gene Wolande Lawyer Jonathan McMurtry Vet Rocky Carroll Bad Dude Jamie Marsh Barry Michael McCleery Recycling Owner Michael G. Hagerty Charlie Terrence Dashon Howard Jimmy and Sean Nepita Freddie.  A very average movie but with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting Best Laid Plans' nevertheless comes off as inexplicably lackluster given the storyline.  This one had the potential of being a real edgeofyourseater but instead fails to stir the blood much at all.  Performances aside the story alone makes it worth a look just don't expect too much.  It takes some effort to get into it initially and by the end you'll be reflecting on what a great movie this almost' was.  I rate this one 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.This mostly forgotten thriller starring Reese Witherspoon Lissa and Alessandro Nivola Nick suffers from a mightily contrived plot and a Huh?What happened? ending. Nick is a guy who works at the local recycling plant that's a new workplace for celluloid protagonists who is about to inherit some big bucks from his father who has just kicked the bucket.Meanwhile some of his coworkers are scheming up a plot to...well no spoilers here. Let's just say that the viewer does not find out about this plot until the end and then it seems a little...well lame.Along comes Lissa looking mighty fine and they fall in love although I must say the chemistry certainly didn't spark up the screen. Now comes complication number one the old man blew almost all his money and what he didn't blow the IRS is grabbing. Because of this Nick gets tempted into driving a getaway car for a drug rip off... Things go awry and Nick ends up in deep doodoo and in desperation gets Lissa to help him rip off an old school chum...which...

Get it at Amazon.This mostly forgotten thriller starring Reese Witherspoon Lissa and Alessandro Nivola Nick suffers from a mightily contrived plot and a Huh?What happened? ending. Nick is a guy who works at the local recycling plant that's a new workplace for celluloid protagonists who is about to inherit some big bucks from his father who has just kicked the bucket.Meanwhile some of his coworkers are scheming up a plot to...well no spoilers here. Let's just say that the viewer does not find out about this plot until the end and then it seems a little...well lame.Along comes Lissa looking mighty fine and they fall in love although I must say the chemistry certainly didn't spark up the screen. Now comes complication number one the old man blew almost all his money and what he didn't blow the IRS is grabbing. Because of this Nick gets tempted into driving a getaway car for a drug rip off... Things go awry and Nick ends up in deep doodoo and in desperation gets Lissa to help him rip off an old school chum...which...

This is movie is sooo desperate to be a post modern crime thriller that it looks and feels so relentlessly superficial. Most scenes are decked out in unpleasant pastel colors and interiors are always lit with warm lights. It's nice to look at but has a student filmmaking feel to it that distracts me. Something else that is quite unreal is the scene in which Nivola and Witherspoon discuss their forthcoming crime...on a roof in front of a neon sign on a sofa. Yeah...like people keep sofas on roofs in front of neon signs. This was obviously an attempt by the director to add a little sparkle to an otherwise BORING scene. Which is also the reason he throws in some cliched camera angles. It's a film noir you see...so diagonal shots on an ordinary scene are standard. Composer Craig Armstrong was obviously hired at the last minute when the director heard the score for Romeo and Juliet to provide a superficial that word again soundtrack. It sounds like it belongs in a totally different movie. But perhaps this is a good thing. There isn't much theme but the music does evoke some weird feelings from us. Much like the feelings the characters have. It's cool and I wish more scores were this way.The twist wasn't too obvious to me. Once it occurs it takes away all the tension and stress right away and will relieve you big time. It even manages to change the tone of the whole movie to lighthearted.In case your wondering my girlfriend lists this as number 2 in her top 3 movies.

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this film noir story about hopeless people taking desperate measures to try to wriggle out of the trouble wrought by their bad luck and foolish acts.   Ted Griffin's screenplay is first rate with numerous unexpected plot twists and ironies.  I defy anyone to outguess all the curves he throws.  What is noticeable about the plot is that it was very realistic.  The schemes were hair brained but it was believable that the numbskull characters portrayed would cook up these kinds of cons.Mike Barker's direction was very good.  He was visually daring and unconventional with liberal use of tight shots and extreme closeups that were mostly effective.  He was a little too enamored with these techniques though and used them to excess.  Such shots are good to emphasize certain emotions or to add impact but Barker has the viewer in the actors' faces more often than your average teenage lovers.  After a while the whole film has the feeling of watching characters with giant heads.  Yet this is a minor criticism for what was mostly a very good directorial effort.The weakest aspect of the film was the acting which was mediocre though not terrible.  Alessandro Nivola gave a lifeless performance as the hapless Nick desperately scheming for a way out of his small town.  He came across too wimpy and flaccid for the daring character who was planning this elaborate rip off.Reese Witherspoon was mostly window dressing in this film.  Though she did a reasonable job with her character the part did not have much meat to it as she was relegated to the role of sycophantic girl friend a victim of her own weakness and bad judgment.Josh Brolin was the weak link.  His interpretation of his character's emotion is mostly measured by how loud he yells at the camera.  Since his character was in hot water through most of the film he was mostly screaming his lines at the top of his lungs.  His portrayal was like surgery performed with a chain saw.The best performance of the film goes to Rocky Carroll as the intimidating drug dealer who threatens to kill Nick for swiping his money.  Carroll stole every scene he was in with high energy performances.Overall I gave this film a 710.  The acting was not compelling but it was not so dreadful that it detracted from a terrific story and a well crafted film by Barker.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having met his old buddy Bryce for the first time in years for a drink Nick gets a call from him in the middle of night asking for help. He goes to Bryce's place where he gets told that Bryce pulled a girl that night took her home started messing around and then had sex. However immediately after sex the girl says that she is going to the police to tell them that she was raped. Bryce then takes Nick downstairs where he has the girl tied to a billiard table to prevent her leaving. The two men try to work out what they are going to do but are things what they seem?Opening with an interesting setup this film jumps back in time and immediately undoes itself with a plot that is interesting but not as good as it really should have been. The plot follows the fall of Nick as he needs more money to cover firstly the dreams he has and then the problems he gets into when he tries to get the money by crime. Essentially this film could have been a mix of Tarantino Mamet and Usual Suspects twists but it falls short of any of those targets but still manages to produce a reasonably good drama with elements of each. The plot isn't as good once it jumps back four months although it still has enough movement to keep things going. The twists are not that great and the plot itself doesn't make as much logical sense as it would like to think that it does. Nor is it as clever as it would like to think  the small town America was well painted but the work on the characters was not as good.Nivola leads the cast well with a nice performance of subtlety even if the material isn't always there for him. Witherspoon walks the film rather easily with a simple role that only really gets interesting towards the end. Of the rest of the cast Brolin is OK Howard makes a solid appearance and generally everyone else turns in solid performances. It was a film that I felt the characters could have been more important and better developed but they were still good enough for the cast to work with.Overall this is a fairly typical thriller with a twist. It seems to want to be a bit like Tarantino with the dialogue edge of Mamet and the twists of things like Suspects but it doesn't really get close to any of them. Still it produces an engaging thriller that although not original is distracting at least.".

	onyx:emotionText "Having met his old buddy Bryce for the first time in years for a drink Nick gets a call from him in the middle of night asking for help. He goes to Bryce's place where he gets told that Bryce pulled a girl that night took her home started messing around and then had sex. However immediately after sex the girl says that she is going to the police to tell them that she was raped. Bryce then takes Nick downstairs where he has the girl tied to a billiard table to prevent her leaving. The two men try to work out what they are going to do but are things what they seem?Opening with an interesting setup this film jumps back in time and immediately undoes itself with a plot that is interesting but not as good as it really should have been. The plot follows the fall of Nick as he needs more money to cover firstly the dreams he has and then the problems he gets into when he tries to get the money by crime. Essentially this film could have been a mix of Tarantino Mamet and Usual Suspects twists but it falls short of any of those targets but still manages to produce a reasonably good drama with elements of each. The plot isn't as good once it jumps back four months although it still has enough movement to keep things going. The twists are not that great and the plot itself doesn't make as much logical sense as it would like to think that it does. Nor is it as clever as it would like to think  the small town America was well painted but the work on the characters was not as good.Nivola leads the cast well with a nice performance of subtlety even if the material isn't always there for him. Witherspoon walks the film rather easily with a simple role that only really gets interesting towards the end. Of the rest of the cast Brolin is OK Howard makes a solid appearance and generally everyone else turns in solid performances.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent thriller that's quite suspenseful and tense with some great plot twists and top notch performances!. All the characters are awesome and the story is really good as well plus Reese Witherspoon is simply amazing in this!. Alessandro Nivola is fantastic as the main lead and had excellent chemistry with Reese and Josh Brolin plays the irritating prick of a professor extremely well plus It's very unpredictable throughout. It's also nicely old fashioned and it's very well written and made plus the ending was completely unexpected as I absolutely loved it!. One part that was quite tense and me cringe was when the main villainTerrence Howard spays pop up a guy's nose and you are able to care for Nivola's and Reese's characters because you know there both good people and need to do this to get out of a bad situation plus it's a great filmnoir film as well. This is a true underrated gem in my opinion and it's also quite creepy at times as well plus It's also quite clever as well. This is an excellent thriller that's quite suspenseful and tense with some great plot twists and top notch performances and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Mike Barker does an excellent! job here with awesome camera work very good angles adding creepy atmosphere and keeping the film suspenseful and at a very fast pace. The Acting is top notch!. Alessandro Nivola is fantastic as the main lead he is extremely likable had excellent chemistry with Reese and was very intense in some scenes I have never seen him In anything before but he was fantastic here I loved him!. Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always and is amazing here she is stunningly gorgeous is extremely likable had fantastic chemistry with Nivola was incredibly sweet as she is especially good in the opening segment as that was a real intense one she was just a normal down too earth type of woman and was very believable! Reese rules!!!!!!!!!!. Josh Brolin is extremely convincing as the prick of a professor he was very irritating and only cared about himself I hated him he was really good. Terrence Howard is good in his scenes as the villain and was quite menacing. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. 12 out of 5".

The film begins with Nick Alessandro Nivola and his college friend Bryce Josh Brolin in a bar. A young woman walks by and you can see Bryce checking her out. Nick leaves and while he's asleep he gets a panicked call from Bryce. The woman has threatened to call the police and claim rape. Bryce has tied her up and duct taped her mouth because he's terrified and doesn't know what to do.Eventually the film flashes back to an earlier time. When his father dies Nick assumes his father will leave him a lot of money which will help him get out of the onehorse town in which he lives. Unfortunately his father died and left him with nothing as he was 240000 in debt to the IRS plus other debts.When he gets an opportunity to make some real cash by stealing money from a drug dealer Nick agrees. Somehow the dealer finds out he's involved and has him picked up. He tells Nick if Nick pays him back he'll forget about what happened. Nick is frantic to get the money since he no longer has his cut.Pretty good noir with good acting. Someone here commented that Alessandro Nivola is dull. I liked him because he played the character as if he was capable of anything.Not a stretch for Reese Witherspoon the other people were fine.I liked the film I thought it was well done and I like that certain things were revealed in the beginning. I loved the scene where the commercial for the recycling place came on television and Nick is so desperate to get Bryce's back to it. Very funny.In better hands this could have been a blockbuster. But it's still good.".

	schema:headline " Waaay too elaborate plans";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some spoilers if you care  This movie is one of those where it starts off kind of cool but slowly gets more and more far fetched and loses my interest.  I think it would have been a lot cooler if for example the entire movie took place at the mansion and featured only the 2 friends and reece and focused on them playing off each other without letting the audience in on who is trying to screw who.  Well I digress that was not to be.  Instead it was a classic case of characters setting up elaborate plans to get what they want and making stupid decisions and keep getting themselves in further trouble.  The actual plot centers around the character Nick who involves himself in a one time drug scheme and becomes increasingly desperate for money when the plan goes awry.  I won't give too much away here as invariably someone will find this clever but I will say that I found it really stupid that not ONCE did Nick ever consider going to the police even when his life was threatened.  I realize he might get in trouble for his one time role as a driver but it would still be better then being DEAD.  I guess why call the police when you can deep breath hatch a scheme to steal antique civil war money signed by Abraham Lincoln at the house that your old college buddy is housesitting by getting him drunk and tricking him into thinking that he raped some 16 year old girl who is actually older then 16 and your girlfriend and then murdering her so that she won't go to the police and get her uncle to try him for statuatory rape.  Really when you think about it it's almost too easy. There are a few twists the first of which was easy to spot the big one at the end actually had the effect of being a let down.  You know the movie you are watching isn't that great when even though it successfully pulls off a twist you don't care.  To me the ending seemed to be a rather convinient way of ending the movie.  I guess movies aren't always supposed to be realistic but for a film like this to work it must create situations that will at least allow me to suspend my disbelief that was not sadly the case with this possibly direct to video Blockbuster Video staple.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit that I've never seen Waiting for Guffman 1997's critically acclaimed comedy mockumentary about a small town thats that stages a pageant. When the advertising for Best in Show had the tagline From the Team That Brought You Waiting for Guffman a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. For shame critics for shame times two!  Any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world but this is one film that I hope people will experience now that its videodvd. Best in Show is without a doubt  the best comedy of 2000.The film begins with a mockumentary style introducing the main competitors not to mention screwballs of the annual Mayflower Best In Show competition where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. We have the loveable and gullable Harry Pepper Guest with his bloodhound the simple Gerry  Cookie Fleck Levy  O'Hara with their terriors nutcase yuppies Hamilton  Meg Swan Hitchcock  Posey the gay dog groomers Scott Dolan  Stefan Vanderhoof Higgins  McKean and the airheaded millionare Sheri Ann Ward Cabot Coolidge along with her trainer Christy Cummings Lynch.  They all have their minds on one simple object The Blue Ribbon which will be awarded to the best dog. And...do I have to tell you the rest?Directorwriterstar Guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at and that the idiocy of films like American Pie or other pointless teenage flicks won't take over the world after all. His idea is simple make your comedy not just funny but SMART funny. But instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like Zero Effect and High Fidelity he used a rather unusual approach and as I understand he also used this approach for Guffman. Whether you notice or not a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script maybe even not even dreamed of by Guest and cowriterstar Levy. But with a gentle hand from Guest he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other less adept actors.  Now that's smart!The cast is of course what makes improv work the most. All of them are a comedic marvel to behold especially Guest as Pepper. But the real standout has to be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of...that is if the announcer was trying to be funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press. There's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like have a doggiestyle of a time. Its priceless as is his performance.I hope that people engage in this 90minute dogumentary. The film deserves so much recognition. It did get nominated for Best PictureComedy at the Golden Globes but didn't win. I can't see why. I mean in the comedy department it is best in show.GRADE A".

Best in Show is without a doubt  the best comedy of 2000.The film begins with a mockumentary style introducing the main competitors not to mention screwballs of the annual Mayflower Best In Show competition where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. We have the loveable and gullable Harry Pepper Guest with his bloodhound the simple Gerry  Cookie Fleck Levy  O'Hara with their terriors nutcase yuppies Hamilton  Meg Swan Hitchcock  Posey the gay dog groomers Scott Dolan  Stefan Vanderhoof Higgins  McKean and the airheaded millionare Sheri Ann Ward Cabot Coolidge along with her trainer Christy Cummings Lynch.  They all have their minds on one simple object The Blue Ribbon which will be awarded to the best dog. And...do I have to tell you the rest?Directorwriterstar Guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at and that the idiocy of films like American Pie or other pointless teenage flicks won't take over the world after all. His idea is simple make your comedy not just funny but SMART funny. But instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like Zero Effect and High Fidelity he used a rather unusual approach and as I understand he also used this approach for Guffman. Whether you notice or not a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script maybe even not even dreamed of by Guest and cowriterstar Levy. But with a gentle hand from Guest he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other less adept actors.  Now that's smart!The cast is of course what makes improv work the most. All of them are a comedic marvel to behold especially Guest as Pepper. But the real standout has to be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of...that is if the announcer was trying to be funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press. There's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like have a doggiestyle of a time. Its priceless as is his performance.I hope that people engage in this 90minute dogumentary. The film deserves so much recognition. It did get nominated for Best PictureComedy at the Golden Globes but didn't win. I can't see why. I mean in the comedy department it is best in show.GRADE A";

Starring Parker Posey Michael Hitchcock Levy Catherine O'Hara John Michael Higgins Michael McKean Guest and Fred Willard. Running Time 90 minutes   Rated PG13Dog people and the dogs that own them are often amusing in real life. But in the hands of master mock documentarist Christopher Guest the amusement is marvelously magnified. Guest practically invented the mockumentary with his 1984 rock band sendup This is Spinal Tap.In the days leading up to the Mayfair Kennel Club Dog Show several sets of contestants make their way to Philadelphia to realize a dream of being Best in Show. There's a pair of New York yuppies Posey and Hitchcock who are even higher strung than their willful weimaraner. A gay couple Higgins and McKean shows up to show off their shih tzu. A Florida husband and wife Levy and O'Hara make the trip with their terrier discovering along the way that every man they meet is one of her former lovers. And finally springing fullygrown from a country music song lonely guy Harlan Pepper Guest arrives from North Carolina in a pickup truck with his droopfaced bloodhound. Once at the show the odd assortment of owners conduct their canines toward a best in show showdown where brilliantly inept color commentary is provided by Buck Laughlin Willard.Even though fairly well known actors play the primary roles Guest achieves a documentary feel mainly because much of the dialogue seems improvised. As writerdirector he deserves credit either for writing sharp dialogue or for directing in a way that inspires creativity in his actors.Some of the best lines come from Posey and Hitchcock the yuppie couple who met when their eyes locked as they sipped coffee at separate but closeby Starbucks and whose pooch becomes paranoid whenever they get intimate in its presence. The other cast members ably deliver lines that define their quirky characters. Especially good is O'Hara as a woman with a past who is nonetheless devoted to spouse Levy who literally has two left feet. Even the background extras probably reallife dog handlers are fascinating to watch and seem to inhabit their own documentaries waiting for their own closeups.The last third of the film brings the entire cast together for the Best in Show competition. This is where Willard who seems to have wandered in from a slow day at the XFL delivers his wildly comic commentary which amazes and befuddles his more serious partner. For a while there was actually some Oscar buzz for Willard's performance here. Though the film pokes fun at the dog show circuit it also reveals a fondness for the people involved. It may not inspire you to become a dog show person but it just may have you looking in the classifieds to see when the next reallife show is coming to your town.Rating  3.5 stars out of 4".

The owners truly are characters as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. That's really all there is to it but that makes it funny enough.You'd never be able to convince me that a mockumentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on TV...but that's really all it takes to convert any doubters. Spinal Tap was nonstop hilarity joke after joke whereas Best in Show was had a few more lulls and by that I mean say 3 minute at MOST where something riotously funny doesn't happen but the big laughs are even bigger.The casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job. In fact her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film.What's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot simple as it was around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction. I guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely overthetop. The realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then. If you like Guest's stuff at all you should definitely own this one.".

Best in Show would be on and although she hadn't seen it she'd heard it got great reviews.I kept working and forgot the time. The telly was on but I ignored it. All of a sudden I began hearing this very weird dialog. 'We like the same things  soup snow peas talking  and not talking.' I thought to myself 'what is this  some kind of weird porn movie?' And I continued ignoring it for a while longer until I heard the voices of Levy and Begley Jr. It was then I remembered what the girlfriend had said.I looked the movie up at the IMDb quickly and was surprised to see who was behind it Christopher Guest aka Nigel Tufnel the man with the extra loud guitar amplifier. I knew then I was lucky to still be awake to witness this one.I made two more checks at the IMDb before getting back to the movie the number of awards and nominations and the box office. Not surprisingly this was a low budget venture and not surprisingly either it's garnered tonnes of awards and nominations. The studio made a profit off this one but it's pocket change in comparison to the big blockbusters. Still it must be a kind of Woody Allen and Orion kind of thing movies like this make the studio look good.On to the movie it's a riot a bloody riot. It might not be your cuppa but then OK  turn it off or watch something else. But there is so much in this one  it plays a bit like an Altman. Lots of handheld too. And when you finally get to the show itself on comes Fred Willard and takes it away. He uses Jim Piddock as a foil  actually he uses almost everything as a foil. And if you think his portrayal is too much over the top reflect on the fact it's supposedly a copy of an actual commentator at shows of this kind.This type of movie is either extraordinarily difficult or admirably easy to make and I suspect it's a bit of both. Some of the skits are just too much and everywhere you turn the acting is inspired. One scene with I believe Posey in a pet shop is precious  and not only her work but the shop assistant's. Amazing stuff.Mostly my sympathies went to Begley Jr who was the receptionist at the hotel. Meeting all these weird types and trying to remain accommodating and representative  it must be difficult if not impossible. There are some very weird characters in this one.And you may be asking yourselves 'watch a mockumentary about a dog show and its participants?' And that's the whole point  it's hilarious it's a riot.I give it an 11.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before the lights went out and the movie Best in Show began the representative from Warner Bros. asked the audience two questions Any Spinal Tap fans? and Any dog fans? The audience responded affirmatively in both instances and such began the movie.  If you answer yes to both of these questions this is a mustsee movie.  If you answered no you should still see this satirical romp following the actions of the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. The director writer and star of Best in Show Christopher Guest is no newcomer to fake documentaries.  As the lead guitarist in the aforementioned This Is Spinal Tap 1984 and the director writer and star of Waiting for Guffman 1997 he is perhaps the master of the field exploring a common theme as reflected in the Guffman tag line There's a good reason some talent remains undiscovered. Guest explores this theme further in Best in Show looking at ordinary people not mockingly but almost tenderly.  You understand the characters' fears and insecurities and you can only see too much of people you know or yourself in them.  More importantly you like these characters.  When Eugene Levy's character Gerry Fleck reacts to his wife Cookie's Catherine O'Hara past wild sex life you know that this is a man who loves his wife and whom his wife loves despite his huge dorkiness and her having slept with almost every man they meet.  Pookie and I work as a team he says and they do singing in harmony about their beloved terrier. The other characters are as banal and human as they can be the braceswearing yuppie couple played with aplomb by Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock take their dog to a therapist because the dog is depressed and angry about having seen the couple in the Congress of the Cow Kama Sutra position.  They wax poetic about having been raised amongst catalogues extolling the virtues of J. Crew and L.L. Bean and describe their similarities as loving soup outdoors snowpeas talking and not talking. These two are perhaps the most caricaturistic and onedimensional of the characters in the film but you feel sad for them for their transference of parental instinct onto their woeful dog. Best in Show has its share of comedic highs most notably the interplay between Buck Laughlin Fred Willard the hopelessly clueless commentator and Trevor Beckwith Jim Piddock the British dog expert.  As Buck barrages Trevor with inane and hilarious questions Trevor brings up the most specific detail about the different breeds and the particular judges. Buck reminds me of my Uncle Bob the man who doesn't know anything about anything but talks about it anyway and it's perhaps the funniest part of the movie. This movie is kind to its characters while making fun of them and the result is hilarity.  While I'm curious about the new Tim Meadows' vehicle The Ladies Man this is the most original and arguably the funniest comedy out right now.".

	onyx:emotionText "Before the lights went out and the movie Best in Show began the representative from Warner Bros. asked the audience two questions Any Spinal Tap fans? and Any dog fans? The audience responded affirmatively in both instances and such began the movie.  If you answer yes to both of these questions this is a mustsee movie.  If you answered no you should still see this satirical romp following the actions of the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. The director writer and star of Best in Show Christopher Guest is no newcomer to fake documentaries.  As the lead guitarist in the aforementioned This Is Spinal Tap 1984 and the director writer and star of Waiting for Guffman 1997 he is perhaps the master of the field exploring a common theme as reflected in the Guffman tag line There's a good reason some talent remains undiscovered. Guest explores this theme further in Best in Show looking at ordinary people not mockingly but almost tenderly.  You understand the characters' fears and insecurities and you can only see too much of people you know or yourself in them.  More importantly you like these characters.  When Eugene Levy's character Gerry Fleck reacts to his wife Cookie's Catherine O'Hara past wild sex life you know that this is a man who loves his wife and whom his wife loves despite his huge dorkiness and her having slept with almost every man they meet.  Pookie and I work as a team he says and they do singing in harmony about their beloved terrier.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history. Its cousins A mighty wind Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman are terrific in their own right but Best in Show takes the cake. A movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good. After watching the movie about 75 times I have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. There is very little interaction between any of the groups of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film. If you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as I am billing it as watch it again. The first time I saw it I thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious. It is a film that grows on you. Defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently. Characters Hamilton and Meg Swan A if you get the DVD check out how these characters were born amazing that these two could hit it so on the head. And to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went. Gerry and Cookie Guggleman A Cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the Cookie character. Gerry Eugene Levy delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half. Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan A Find me a funnier character than Scott Donalan I DARE YOU! He will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. Stefan Micheal McKean was very good as well and they interplay here and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans goes to show why he is always in these films. A great actor with razor like wit. Harlan Pepper B I don't want it to seem like he isn't funny he sure is but being the only Solo act he can't be quite as funny as the others above. He does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him.The rest are all great as well there is no weak character. See this film at least twice. Buy it you will not regret it.".

The comedy varies from very subtle to obvious but never becomes ridiculous. Many things will not be noticed on the first viewing. This is one of those films that can be trotted out frequently and still be as funny as ever. The film was written by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy who also star in it Guest directed it. They and much of the cast were also in Waiting for Guffman. The cast consists predominantly of improv comedians from Second City National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. The scene concepts were planned but there were no rehearsals the actors improvised the dialogue resulting in very spontaneous interaction between the characters. The actors could plan things that they wanted their characters to say but they might not get the chance to use much of what they planned it all depended on what the other characters would say. Different takes of the same scene could be completely different. Over sixty hours of film were taken and the editing took about eight months. The film culminates in the big Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. There are two commentators one Trevor Beckwith British actor Jim Piddock who was required to study everything that he could about dogs and dog shows is an expert on dogs and the local Buck Laughlin Fred Willard who was instructed to learn nothing about dogs obviously knows nothing about dogs except perhaps that they have four legs and two genders they interacted with great hilarity. Three of the five dog show judges were actually show dog judges the other two were actors. Most of the dog handlers in the show were not actors. The film is one of the funniest that I have ever seen when I was not laughing I was at the edge of laughter.".

Whlie it seems like it should be the dogs who take this competition seriously it turns out the owners are just as insane. Megan one of the dog owners goes almost serial psycho killer on the hotel manager because she cannot find the special bee squeaky toy for her dog.There is another couple that is just great Gerry and Cookie this complete nerd and attractive woman that are just so lovable. In the beginning of the movie Gerry describes how many boyfriends Cookie had. Throughout the movie her lovers see her and hit on her even in front of Gerry! It was just great and fun to watch Gerry's looks. This whole movie is just a hoot and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. It's a great movie is just fun to watch I'd highly recommend it! Now I have to find a nice way of showing this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. D 810".

In a fit of generosity I gave it a 6 of 10 only after I viewed the DVD version with the director's commentary turned on.The director and cowriter is Christopher Guess who also stars as Harlan Pepper a country bumkin who is showing his bloodhound and studies ventriloquism on the side.  The other cowriter is Eugene Levy who stars as Jerry Fleck who meets up with another of his wife's exlovers almost everywhere they go. Jerry as two left feet literally.To say the movie was written is a bit of a stretch because as Guess and Levy explain all scenes and dialog were improvised with no rehearsals. Except for Parker Posey who plays the outofcontrol housewife all the actors are veterans of improvisation and most have worked together in other movies.  The whole film has the feel of improvisation and the look of a handheld home movie but with better sound. Instead of using selective focus to isolate the subject almost everything is in focus in most scenes.Fred Willard was the most entertaining. Many of us have seen him regularly in comic skits on the Jay Leno late night TV show. He was one of the two announcers at the dog show and his questions and comments never fit but were funny because of that. How do they get those Scnauzers to become minature? Do they shrink them? Do you know they eat dogs in some cultures? That judge examining the dog's testicles I would be uncofortable on a date with her!The dog show brings forth the gay couple the quarreling couple the MarchDecember couple and so forth. After best in show is picked and everyone goes their separate ways the short epilog shows how the show influenced them and what they did afterward. The funniest was the calendar the gay couple were making showing two dogs posed as various famous movie characters.Why do I think this is a mediocre movie?  It is obviously a vanity project. Guess and Levy apparently said let's make a comedy with lots of funny people and sight gags let's use improvisation and use a dog show in Philadelphia as a reason for following the lives of all these fringe personalities.  I found it entertaining for the most part but also found Parker Posey's acting to be too much over the top and found myself cringing instead of laughing. Too many of the gags came across as forced humor.  While I admire the project having made many home movies myself when my children were growing up overall the effort misses the entertainment mark of a major film.".

Farcical and amusing misadventures presented as real life documentaries starring some of the best minds in comedy working today. This is somewhat appropriate as the film that arguably made him a star was the fantastic This is Spinal Tap which he costarred in in addition to cowriting. From the amusing and quirky Waiting for Guffman to the surprisingly heartfelt A Might Wind Guest's films have been consistently hilarious and have maintained a frankly shocking degree of freshness through the years.While individual tastes vary between fans and while everyone has their own personal favorite Guest film I know I'm certainly in no minority to feel that the greatest achievement of his career is the incredible and frankly brilliant 2000 release Best in Show. A film I feel is amongst the most underrated and underappreciated comedies of all time. Sure it does have a fan base but even still... it's a film that is so unique and so special that it deserves a far greater audience and far more recognition that it currently receives from its moderate but very dedicated cult audience.It's time again for the annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show a prestigious dogbreed competition held in Philedelphia. The documentary follows a varied and very peculiar collection of contestants as they prepare to depart for their show with their beloved canines. Among them are Gerry and Cookie Fleck Eugene Levy Catherine O'Hara a friendly and seemingly average middle class couple who hope their terrier has what it takes Harlan Pepper director Guest a southern man with a pronounced drawl who raises bloodhounds and has some interesting aspirations Meg and Hamilton Swan Parker Posey Michael Hitchcock the most stereotypical upperclass yuppie hipsters you could ever imagine camp gay couple Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof John Michael Higgins Michael McKean and their Shih Tzu and Sherri Ann Jennifer Coolidge a wealthy trophywife and two time winner of the competition.A film made heavily through improvisational comedy and a clever highconcept hook Best in Show is such a wild success thanks to the incredible cast of performers assembled and the delightfully bizarre characters they cultivate. From the pretentious Swan duo losing their minds over a squeaky toy by the name of Busy Bee to the delightful interactions between Donlan and Stefan and certainly to the pure and very relatable giggles the averageseeming Flecks bring about... everyone is at the top of their game creatively supplying some of the best subtle and notsosubtle at times humor I've ever seen. Director Guest skillfully pulls out nonstop moments of charm and laughs from the amazing cast and puts together one heck of a show.Though the film's appeal may be lost on those looking for a more general jokeaminuteriot Best in Show encapsulates many of the best instances of clever comedy to emerge in recent memory. It's a film more about delivering smirks and chuckles than outloud belly laughs where quirky characters and oddly personal stakes take center stage and the plot often takes an overt back seat. The great fun of the film is seeing people who feel like they could very well exist even if they are exaggerated for comedy in a situation that's just odd enough that the average person would find it fascinating. It's about people first and foremost... it's about the men and women behind the dogs. And how the show is more about them than the canines on display.Best in Show is in my mind one of the greatest comedies of all time. It's clever. It's entertaining. It's enthralling and charming. And it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10. Sit! Stay! And prepare to laugh!".

It is anything but family fare.Yet despite all the sleaze factor  and there is a lot of it  I still found this charming for some reason. The laughs range from crude to subtle and the characters who enter their dogs in professional shows are really the subject of exaggerated ridicule here from Yuppies to gay men to redneck hunters to dog trainers to nerdy types to whatever. No one pictured in this movie is a healthy normal person. Everyone is whacked to some degree except the announcer. However his sidekick the color man played by Fred Williard is brutal!

There's Harlan Pepper Guest a redneck from Florida and his bloodhound. There are Meg and Hamilton Swan Posey and Hitchcock a yuppie couple who are obsessed with their dog. There are Cookie and Gerry Fleck Levy and O'Hara who love their terrier. There are Sherry Cabot and Christy Cumming Coolidge and Lynch one of whom is a gold digger and the other is a trainer for the poodle. Lastly there are Stephen Vanderhoof and Scott Donlan McKean and Higgins who play gay lovers who own shih tzus. They all want to win the top prize but who will truly win? From there the mayhem is out of control. The jokes in this movie are great. From a kid who wants to strap a toy parachuter to the terrier and throw it off the shed to a man with two left feet to Buck Laughlin Lilard that steals the show with his unknowledge about dogs. This movie is flat out hilarious. If you can get the DVD because it has great deleted scenes. 1010 Rating Couple talking about their dog watching them mate gay scenes not extreme and some language.".

Previously they'd made the excellent WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and following BEST IN SHOW they made the very enjoyable A MIGHTY WIND. As for their latest FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION the less said the better.The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. You follow these few chosen dogs from preshow preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious Mayflower Kennel Club. However none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. Amazingly even though the characters are rather outlandish there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodyingas decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a VERY cutthroat group of people! My favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly highpressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple as they were terribly funny and clever. However the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from Fred Willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. His comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid personhow he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess. The other contestants featured were also quite funnythe highpriced professional poodle handler and its rich owner the country boy and his hound as well as Winkie's parents who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.Despite the improvised style of film making the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling storyone that is NOT for dog owners only. Exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade. Clever and consistently funny.By the way try to find this on DVD as the extras were actually worth seeing.

They are all pretty stereotypical dog owners in that they are eccentric and self obsessed but all very different.The second half of the movie is the dog show where the movie kicks into overdrive thanks largely to the commentary of Buck Laughlin played by the brilliant Fred Willard. He seems to be a frustrated ex sports commentator who is now resigned to the lower rating sports. He knows nothing about dogs and bumbles through by asking dumb questions making poor analysis and adding some sexual innuendo. Just awesome.Very well written excellent cast and plenty of laughs.".

Our hero Tommy Lee as portrayed by Phillip Rhee encounters and overcomes a myriad set of common problems in the deep south. From strange cuisine to white power groups who value an idea of might makes right. I'd like to digress here to applaud Mr. Rhee not only did he star as Tommy Lee but also directed and produced. It can been seen that Mr. Lee applied his own experiences as a minority in America to his magnum opus.Strong political message aside the inner workings of the film the basic craft if you will is on point throughout. From inspired lighting and set design to insightful scene transitions a spinning chain gun into a spinning plastic flower. We can see a juxtaposition of spinning things one on the side of whimsy the other cold raw steel crafted for killing.Every one understands that no thing be it movie or sandwich can be perfect. Thus I must concede that Best of the Best 3 Cool Runnings does have its faults. One half hour is spent before a showcase of Mr. Rhee's fistic acumen. In fact Lee Rhee's character seems to have no real competition in the film. Nearly every skinhead he fights falls with little effort this is strange due to the basic toughness and fighting skill attributed to the skinhead stereotype. Particularly with the basic para military training they are given.As the plot reaches its climax beginning with a dirt bike chase no less and ramps up to a full on assault. We learn here that Lee can outrun an explosion. In a dizzying display of action and full on violence Tommy and his partner the local sheriff and his bother in law take out the skin head compound. Of course in the end Tommy proves he is indeed the best of the best. Then again this really never became an issue in the movie.All in all Best of the Best 3 the lion the witch and the wardrobe does a fine job of telling a complex story in simple terms that can be appreciated by young and old alike. 4 giant clown shoe beat downs out of a possible 10.".

White supremacists are taking over the formerlypeaceful town led by the hatefilled preacher Brian an uncredited Ermey. Just as their evil empire is growing none other than Tommy Lee the drummer from Motley Crue just kidding it's Phillip Rhee of course rolls into town to visit his sister who just happens to live in this town and her husband Jack McDonald. Jack also happens to be the sheriff but is powerless to stop the hatefilled mobs. Lee finds he must use his fists and his feet not only to defeat the stupid racists but to defend choir director Margo Gershon. Will Tommy Lee beat the neoNazis and ride off into the sunset? To Best of the Best 3's credit it has an extremely professional look with very good production values. This was Phillip Rhee's first directorial effort and it seems like he had been building up to this for a while because he does a very competent job with a lot of interesting shots and as mentioned the technical aspects are very good. Plus with its themes about racism it was at least trying not to be the same old dumb meathead movie. It made an effort to make you think which is more than you can say about some of this movie's competitors or other entries in the series for that matter.Like China O'Brien 1990 the rural action movie angle is used and like Substitute 4 2001 the white power angle is used. Interestingly enough the director of Substitute 4 is Robert Radler the director of Best of the Best 2 1993. There's even some Jackie Chanlike martial arts as evidenced by the scene in which Rhee fights some baddies in a clown outfit. You truly haven't lived until you've seen thugs get kicked by a man with giant shoes.As we've seen in everything from American Ninja 1985 to terrorist training videos the army of bad guys have their own training camp complete with you guessed it monkey bars. Exactly how these monkey bars would help someone defeat Tommy Lee in a fight is not known. And the head Nazi guy wouldn't even come close to challenging Lee in a fight. He only holds his own for a long time because that's what a lot of final bad guys do. A lot of action movies fall into that clich Although the main baddie may have no martial arts or combat training whatsoever when the hero faces off against him in a fight after handily defeating hundreds of goons NOW the final fight is actually a challenge for the hero. It's just silly but you can't really help it.If you have Netflix streaming you should view Best of the Best 3 that way as the quality is excellent and it's in widescreen. The movie has never looked better.So grab a Like soda and cheer for Phillip Rhee Christopher McDonald and Gina Gershon in a truly hard hitting tale of racism.For more action insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

Jack informs Tommy about a missing black Reverend named Luhter Phelps Andra R. Ward whose Church was burned down Jack suspects a local group of racist neoNazi thugs lead by the vicious Donnie Hansen Mark Rolston but noone in town will testify out of fear so the Sheriff's hands are tied. Hansen  his white power group hate all foreigner's  the Chinese Tommy Lee  his sister Karen are next in line for the racial abuse  violence but Tommy being a world Karate champ  general brilliant martial artist fights back. Things become personal as Jack  Karen's kid is kidnapped  the true extent of Hansen's plans become apparent Hansen wants to start a war between black  white...Directed by  starring Phillip Rhee this is the third entry in the Best of the Best franchise  while it's not as good as Best of the Best 2 1993 it's better than the weak original Best of the Best 1989. Right first things first series continuity has gone right out of the window here for some reason Tommy Lee now refuses to teach martial arts  despite being an only child after his brother was killed by Dae Han in the original Best of the Best now magically has a sister gone is his mate Alex Grady played by Eric Roberts in the previous two  this time he's on his own. In fact Best of the Best 3 No Turning Back has very little to do with the previous two films except that it features Tommy Lee anyone else think the character was originally meant as a homage to Bruce Lee?. A little bit of research actually reveals that the script was originally written as a stand alone film called No Turning Back about a black soldier returning home  finding his town overrun with racists but Phillip Rhee saw the script  turned it into a Best of the Best film. This is all about racism the effect of it the causes of it  Tommy Lee single handedly stopping it. There's no great depth here the racists are seen as pure scum while the abused are pretty much perfection the biggest problem with the script is why was Hensen stockpiling so many weapons? What was he going to do with them? Kill all the blacks in his town? The State? The whole of the US? What? There's just no reason for it. Having said that the bad guy's are bad enough the good guy's get to kick ass  there some decent action once it kicks in during the final thirty odd minutes. A little slow to get going Tommy Lee doesn't doesn't beat up his first racist until after the thirty minute mark but from then on it continues to move along at a nice pace until the action packed climax. Not as deep as some films might have been considering it's touchy racial subject matter but as pure action entertainment then this is worth a watch.The fights are well staged  look impressive the last thirty minutes are great with lots of shooting explosions out of control buses car  motorbike stunts  a final climatic knife fight between Tommy Lee  Hansen. The violence has been toned down from Best of the Best 2 while still violent it's not that bloody or graphic. All current UK versions are missing about 45 seconds of the attempted rape of Margot anyone who has this cut shouldn't worry too much as the excised footage is tame  nothing more than Margot being held on a table while someone rips her top off. Set in a small town in the US the picturesque opening credits feature kids playing in fields  fishing  a rickety old school bus picking them up in a really syrupy scene but things soon turn nasty as a Church is burned down.Filmed in Indiana  Ohio this looks nice enough first time director Rhee does a decent enough job here although the action scenes  fights predictably fare better than the human drama. The acting is alright Gina Gershon  Dee WallaceStone appear as does R. Lee Emery in a small role while Kane Hodder joins Rhee as being the only actor to have appeared in all three Best of the Best films but unlike Rhee as a different character in each although always as a bad guy.Best of the Best 3 No Turning Back tries to mix a hard  emotive issue like racial abuse  tension with mindless martial arts action  is somewhat successful while not that deep it does entertain on a basic level with some good action scenes during the last thirty minutes. Followed by Best of the Best Without Warning 1998.".

A lot of people look at this movie as a step down for the Best of the Best series but in my opinion it isn't. If anything it was a growing step up until Without Warning the fourth Best of the Best was created.Picking up from the events of Best of the Best 2 Tommy has left his good friend Alex Grady behind and comes to Liberty to see his sister Karen brotherinlaw Jack who's the town Sheriff his nephew Justin and Luther Justin's friend who's father is a preacher who goes missing earlier in the film. Tommy is glad to see his family and is enjoying the love and warmth that he receives but when he learns that local supremacists have taken over the town and are responsible for the death of Luther's father Tommy must decide whether or not to use his lethal skills again in order to help the locals take back their home from predators who use fear as a weapon and violence against the innocent just because they're 'different'.A lot of people think that this Best of the Best just follows a tired old clich story that people have seen and heard hundreds of times before. Yes the topic at hand does revolve around racial conflict but in this story the victims in this decide to butch up and fight back. Most movies I've seen about 'hate crimes' in the past have the same plot a hate crime is committed people want to come forward but are too scared for fear of retaliation from the haters the law does all they can to put a stop to it but are unable to and the people who are victims just try to rely on religion alone to get them through the incident. But how often do we see movies where those who are unjustly persecuted for their race decide to take a stand against that kind of tyranny and terrorism? The movie has many messages mainly about redemption and salvation. Tommy is trying to live a life of peace but the supremacists make that extremely difficult and force him to use lethal countermeasures to put a stop to their bullying and he hopes and prays that the situation won't result in more death at his hands.Another message in this film is that even if you despise violence you have to be ready to use it at a moment's notice. Nobody likes violence and would like to resolve conflicts without it...but violence is all some people know in this world. And the enemy won't learn anything about respecting another individual's rights until someone 'teaches' it to them. And rest assured Phillp Rhee's character has a lot of teaching to do in this film.Basically put there's plenty of gunfights galore highkicking action explosive pyrotechnics and behind it all a message about being ready to go to war if you ever want peace on your land. That's the main thing everyone should pay attention to when they watch this film...God knows it got my attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall the BEST OF THE BEST series is one of the most enjoyable martial arts franchises in film. It took two movies before tae kwon do bigshot Phillip Rhee was properly established as the real star of the story and I'm pleased to say that even in the disappointing absence of Eric Roberts  co. he proves to be a solid solo action hero not to mention a better firsttime director than his morerecognized cohorts Seagal and Van Damme. It's a bit strange that he chose a story dealing with domestic racial terrorism as his first project but while not perfect I think it came out much better than anyone could have expected.The story Following the events of the the second film Tommy Lee Rhee rides into a rural town besieged by a neoNazi militia. When their violent mania takes its toll on the family of his brotherinlaw Christopher McDonald and his new romantic interest Gina Gershon he uses his championshipcaliber martial arts skills to fight back.NeoNazism neoConfederatism and white supremicism remain lingering social problems but while they've been tackled before in drama form e.g. American HISTORY X I'm pretty sure that Phillip Rhee is the first filmmaker to make an action film that predominantly dealt with the issue. It's a movie decision that you'd expect Steven Seagal to make and it's quite possible that despite this one's strong production values the storyline is what kept it from getting a theatrical release. It's kind of heavyhanded with a rather tasteless scene early on wherein the militant leader played by great villainactor Mark Rolston beats a black activist priest to death with a baseball bat but the film does make a point of differentiating between the racial separatism ideology and racial warfare as well as depicting the kind of social hopelessness that can lead some folks to grasp at extremes. Still it's an action flick so don't expect a completely empathetic movie.Speaking of action this one's offering is pretty darn good being mostly limited to four fights and an explosionfilled invasion scene. During his relatively short career Phillip Rhee was one of the most consistent martial arts performers and his outing here helps build this reputation. During three oneagainstmany fights and a single oneonone brawl with bad guy Rolston Rhee goes through an encyclopedia of strikes and throws for the most part exquisitely choreographed and competently filmed. The showdown at the end sort of disappointed me for its change of pace but by most standards it's still pretty good and it doesn't deter from the glorious scene in the first half of the film wherein Rhee  dressed as a clown  takes on a bunch of brutes at a fair. The segment wherein Rhee and Christopher McDonald launch an attack on the supremacists' base is also pretty good practically at Commando levels of explosions. There are even parts with motorcycles and a rocket launcher.The cast and their performances round off the good parts of the movie. Along with the aforementioned members an uncredited R. Lee Ermey plays a racist pastor with his usual infectious talent and Peter Simmons gives a pretty good performance as young supremacist recruit with mixed feelings about his actions. The fact that the film only connects with its prequels via a minute's exposition is somewhat disappointing  I'd have liked to see the ending of the last movie weigh in more on the events of this one  but Rhee proves himself such a consummate performer that you don't miss the other characters too much. This one could technically stand alone but it still feels like a part of the series. Action fans should definitely give it a try.".

BOTB 2 in particular is one of my classics of Martial Arts i enjoyed the original but the second one is the one i saw as a kid and still remain a cult classic in te MA gender for meand i own hundreds of them. Yet the fighting scenes in BOTB3 are good sure but any character could had been Tommy here. Anyway like i said i enjoyed it sure but not on the level of the second movie.But shuuuut to all people saying this is a crappy movie its pretty good by itself.".

Now this area is in major trouble because we've got the old white supremacists out on the warpath led by none other than R L Emery. There's this other guy who doesn't think Emery is white enough who at the start of the film bludgeons to death a black reverend while all his skinhead mates look on. And one of the skinheads is the teenage son of Dee Wallace Stone.Now that's a lot of story with no Tommy involved right? It does take some time for him to show up but doesn't take much time for the old Nazis to get right on his case and also start hassling his sister. Didn't they watch Best of the Best 2? No one messes with Tommy's family! Eric Roberts isn't in this one by the way and I think it was probably because his character took the rap for killing the bad guy in the last film. Otherwise I can't think of a reason how Tommy got away with breaking a guy's neck in front of a screaming crowd.Anyway while a schoolteachers goes up against R Lee Emery who doesn't get a credit here for some reason Tommy goes up against the far more dangerous henchman played by Drake from Aliens! Drake is all up for a bit of ethnic cleansing and gets his army of skinheads some hardware while Tommy breaks all their noses while dressed as a clown.Just when I thought this film was never going to get going Drake kidnaps Tommy's nephew and the fight is on! Tommy and the guy from Happy Gilmore head off to the Nazi compound and start wasting their way through a skinhead army in a whirlwind of machine gun fire explosions and even an M80 machine gun. Thank God for that.Tommy also directs this one under the pseudonym Phillip Rhee so you'll have to ask him how Tommy manages to kick three guys off three separate bikes using just two legs or how we see the schoolteacher getting attacked in her home then cut to Tommy on his bike then cut back to the schoolteacher's house where Tommy suddenly appears.It's okay this one once it gets going. The big battle at the end kind of makes up for all the drama and such like so there's not much to worry about there.".

Both in reality and on screen Rhee's techniques look great and the man clearly has an excellent command of martial arts so why is it that in a movie starring this guy in a series about martial arts do we not even seen him fight anyone until about 40 minutes into this one? Now I'm not saying that an action movie can't have build up and suspense or it should be all fighting and no plot but Best of the Best 3 starts the movie off with the heavy subject of violent racism and doesn't dial back from there. With virtually no relation and continuity to the other 2 movies in the series Best of the Best 3 has only one constant the character of Rhee's Tommy Lee who is down South visiting his sister that he's never mentioned although he does apparently have Indian grandparents and a brother from the second and has to intervene in the grand plot of a White Supremacist group.Compared to the other 2 Best of the Best movies which were about fighting tournaments and the comradery between the martial artists on the team this one is totally Tommy Lee's show and deals with an intense sensitive and serious issue. But it deals with it via motorcycle chases explosions and kicking. Even though the film has a good message the corny acting and dialouge and overall 90's action movie goofiness just doesn't work for the hard hitting subject matter which is something that deserves serious examination and treatment.It's not to say that the movie doesn't have it's entertaining moments but whenever you get into some of the action it draws you right back to the ugly topic it's all based around but the poor execution makes it hard to enjoy. Overall Phillip Rhee would've been better off including Eric Roberts a major character in the other 2 movies in some way and continuing the story and through line he had established with 1 and 2 which were also cheezy martial arts movies but stayed within their depth and didn't try to tackle something this hard hitting and real. Since this installments attempts and fails I have to say it's the worst of The Best of the Best.5 out 10.".

Chris Penn is his usual macho self and puts on a good show until he runs into the behemoth Ralph Moeller Brakus. Eric Roberts and Phillip Rhee avenge the death of their friend with some spectacular fighting. Special mention must be made of Wayne Newton's smarmy performance as the Coliseum's pompous announcer someone you'll love to hate. As pure entertainment the film succeeds because of the enthusiastic performances and well staged gladiator style battles. Give this one a try if you enjoy martial arts you will not be disappointed  MERK".

	schema:headline " Good bad and ugly";
	schema:reviewBody "If you want to talk about a movie that's a black hole for careers let's talk about Best of the Best 2. Director Robert Radler wound up working on Power Rangers episodes Eric Roberts usually appears in magazines making jealous comments about his much more successful sister and Philip Rhee...well the less said about Best of the Best 3 and 4 the better. Ralf Moeller the chief bad guy usually winds up playing the big sidekick most visibly in Gladiator. Ironically he's probably made out better than anyone else involved save for the invincible Wayne Newton.Judged by the standards of its genre the movie isn't entirely terrible. Judging action movies on the same scale as more respectable fare is like expecting your 59 cent hamburger to taste like steak and Best of the Best 2 is better than a lot of comparable movies I've seen. The fight scenes are refreshingly highimpact and plentiful Newton is as deliciously slimy as Richard Dawson in The Running Man and Moeller makes for a formidable bad guy in the ring. In these respects and others this movie compares well with betterknown movies like Bloodsport or the terrible Kickboxer.The bad parts are definitely bad however. The script as is usual for the genre consists of the standard toughguy posturing but is not even particularly clever at that. Roberts looks like he's being directed to think about his paycheck whenever he's supposed to act happy. Rhee the real star does a good job in the ring but his transformation from calm martial artist to brutal vengeance artist is not really played at all. The bad guys other than Moeller and to some extent Newton are completely devoid of menace. The worst part of all  and one of the most cringeinducing scenes I've ever witnessed  is the first scene with James where a pathetic drunk's tragic fall is played for laughs. This scene will and should offend almost anyone who understands it.On the ugly side the movie's production design definitely reflects its budget. Best of the Best 2 looks and sounds at least 10 years older than it actually is. In style form and substance it's well behind the curve. Some of the violence is really painful to watch namely two closeups of Rhee breaking limbs in hapkido arm locks. This is a cheap shot but Roberts' girlfriend looks like she's about 70. All told it is not a study in economy. Shot for about the same budget as a Star Trek The Next Generation 2part episode this movie looks way worse.Is it completely terrible? Well don't be looking for The Godfather. If some cheesy fighting is your bag however you're looking at the right movie. Recommended for genre diehards and 12yearolds but not really for anyone else.".

The character of James played by Predator star Sonny Landham was kind of a good family conflict and climax within the movie thus adding some depth.

The three fighters Grady Roberts Tommy Rhee and Travis Chris Penn are now good friend and they are enjoying their retirement after championship but the infamous troublemaker Travis is participating in underground fights in so called Colosseum and dies after he challenged a champion called Bracus. And now as usual just like in many martial arts films the two remaining fighters Grady and Tommy are seeking revenge against Bracus and his manager Weldon. This film is strictly for those who love martial arts film especially for those who are trained in Taekwondo Hapkino Karate or Kung FuSo don't pay attention to other things like script or makeup because there isn't anything special about it. The acting crew is pretty interesting here. We have Eric Roberts Phillip Rhee and Chris Penn from the first film. Eric Roberts with his usual performance trying to look cool but stiff in tense scenes. He was slightly a little bit important here because the real star was Phillip Rhee. Rhee was no longer to show his acting abilities in this film he was in his own terrain to show really cool skills in spectacular fighting scenes. He really showed some good techniques from Taekwondo Kung Fu Hapkido and even some Aikido. Chris Penn was there well we all knew that something bad was gonna happen to him. Not much from him except that I didn't quite expect him here I like him more in some serious films with his intense performance. Now we have Dae Han played by Simon Rhee who returns to help Grady and Tommy in vengeance. Our bad guy champion is Bracus played by Ralf Moeller best know for playing Conan in Conan the Adventurer TV series well.. they needed someone who is big strong and imposing but for heaven's sake this guy can't talk right he is like Arnie even worse. He couldn't even hide his German accent. He wasn't even charismatic or evil he was only a egoistic angry tank who is strong and that's it. The real leading villain here was his manager and owner of the Colosseum Weldon played by Wayne Newton who would knew it? A famous Vegas performer and entertainer who nearly played himself in this film although he didn't sing but he was OK really cool. And he has an exceptional high voice. Other supporting actors we have lovely Meg Foster oh those eyes so feminine and for the real surprise we have Sonny Landham Billy from Predator love that guy. He was cool. As I said before this is for martial arts fans and I highly recommend this film to them. Enjoy it.".

	schema:headline " The change to a more violent picture makes this sequel unpleasant";
	schema:reviewBody "While Eric Roberts has had something of a resurgence in today's age with The Dark Knight and a stint on Celebrity Rehab he truly was stuck in B movie hell for quite some time. Even after moderate successes with The Pope of Greenwich Village and Runaway Train he simply failed to capitalize on those successes and went straight to video and eventually Lifetime. Case in point Best of the Best a martial arts movie that tried so hard to imitate better movies that the only thing that made it interesting was the fight sequences and ending.All that is thrown out the window in Best of the Best II a sequel that to my amazement is not only cheaper but also more disgusting. Action movies don't have to be brainless but Best of the Best II sure takes the cake with silly one liners and action that feels like it's on auto mode. Leaving off where the original ended Alex Roberts Tommy Rhee and Travis Penn return home to the states to open up their own martial arts studio.But Travis has other plans in mind when he decides to fight to the death in an unsanctioned fighting arena known as the Colosseum where the champion is Brakus Ralf Moeller. When Travis gets the chance to fight he is unfortunately killed senselessly and dumped into a nearby river. After learning of this Alex and Tommy confront Brakus but get thrown out while tearing up his place. To make things interesting Brakus sends some henchmen to kill them but Alex Tommy and Alex's son escape to Tommy's foster parents where they learn to fight like Brakus from Alex's foster brother James sonny Landham. When Brakus finds the location Tommy will have to fight Brakus to get not only his freedom but save Alex's life as well.Best of the Best wasn't exactly Shakespeare but it looks like it compared to the utterly idiotic nature of Best of the Best II. Cheaper than a Chuck Norris film Best of the Best II mostly throws out the usual in any dumb action movie thin characters little plot and a lot of violent action that doesn't excite but rather disgust us with the way it develops. The first Best of the Best was something of a feel good movie but this one made me want to vomit all over my lap when I saw it. Usually if there's one good action sequence in any movie then it can't be all bad. Sadly Best of the Best II has no redeeming value as an action movie though it tries hard when it wants to be an underground gladiator movie. As dumb as Best of the Best II can be it could have been at least watchable had the film emphasized the arena instead of the characters who are so thinly drawn out that there is little attention as to how they actually get to the point of fighting their way out like that Bruce Lee wannabe did in Game of Death.Roberts does try so desperately hard to inject some kind of drama or passion in this sequel but even his minor talents can't do anything for him and the others. He sure looks fit here which is why Best of the Best II feels like Rocky IV. From the montages to the cheesy dialogue to cold hearted villain Best of the Best II is your basic ripoff of Rocky IV or any movie involving overcoming the odds. Rocky IV at least had good music to accompany the montages. Best of the Best II has some cheesy rock n roll score that couldn't be more simplistic if it tried.Getting back to Roberts he does what he can to not be involved in his character. That's where the motivation for Best of the Best II falls apart leaning on a flat personality like Rhee to carry the film when he has to fight Brakus. While he fights well his acting is something of a disappointment lacking much of a larger than life persona that should fit this movie. Even the additional screen time for Alex's kid doesn't help giving us a lot of hokey sentiment that doesn't fit such a gratuitously violent sequel. Yeah Walter distracts a henchman so that his dad can beat him up but so what? Even Moeller as Brakus seems largely forgettable though his accent might be the only thing that makes his character stand out. He's given a lot of bad one liners that really make me cringe and the only thing that makes him remotely compelling is that his muscles might be bigger than his head. Wayne Newton was fun to look at in Licence to Kill but here he overstays his welcome and becomes something of a nuisance for those wanting a good scene stealer for the movie. Sadly he isn't and as Brakus' manager he really is an egotistical jerk without a soul.The action is where Best of the Best II lives and dies but unfortunately it dies before it lives up to its expectations. Various people get killed for no reasons and what's with the guns? If Best of the Best II wanted to stick with some resemblance to the original it should have been all martial arts and no guns. This is where Best of the Best II fails when it tries to be something of a no win situation for the main characters. The finale is moderately entertaining but it is more disgusting than exciting as with the rest of the film. People get their heads blown off get their limbs broken but not much of it seems to make sense as with the rest of Best of the Best II.Grade D".

Ridiculous sequel is a lot like Rocky IV in how stupid and terrible it is. Some of it is funny but a lot more of it is boring.

BEST OF THE BEST 2 jettisons the familyorientated nature of the first film to provide a bloodthirsty hardhitting sequel which plays out as a riff on Van Damme's KICKBOXER. There's an illegal fight tournament death at the hands of a monstrous opponent and revenge in mind. There's even some '90sstyle Bmovie action outside of the ring complete with bloody shootouts and the like. It's a heck of a lot of fun.Eric Roberts Phillip Rhee and Chris Penn all return from the first film although Roberts and Penn have relatively limited screen time. Rhee is the real star here and he holds his own in a series of brutally violent fight scenes. I love the over the top sound effects and explicit violence of these '90s fight flicks and BEST OF THE BEST 2 doesn't disappointment. The German Ralf Moeller UNIVERSAL SOLDIER makes for a convincingly tough opponent and the film as a whole is replete with violence and beatdowns.The supporting cast contains appearances from a number of familiar faces not least the unmissable Meg Foster THEY LIVE who contributes a cameo. Sonny Landham PREDATOR has a small but violent role as the man who trains the team. Simon Rhee Phillip's reallife brother also returns from the original and Wayne Newton LICENCE TO KILL plays a weaselly fight promoter.

Tommy Lee Eric Roberts and Chris Penn are back as our Tae Kwon Do trio now running a martial arts school. Chris however is bored of the antics and heads off to a place called The Coliseum where folks basically fight for cash. Chris reckons he can take on the owner a man so muscly he looks like a rubber glove filled with walnuts. This is Brakus who thinks guns aren't manly enough. Chris doesn't do too well in the fight and the last time we see him he's being lowered into the ground in a box. Luckily he was stupid enough to take Eric's kid along to the fight so now Tommy and Eric are all out to get Brakus.It gets better when Tommy smashes Brakus' face against a mirror and now Brakus has a scar on his face and ends up pouting around the place in a dressing gown staring into a mirror and just getting madder and madder. So Tommy and Eric want to kill Brakus and Brakus wants to kill everyone related to Tommy and kill Tommy in the ring at the Coliseum.If you hadn't guessed already Tommy was raised by native Americans and everyone heads off to stay with them for a while a get trained up to fight Brakus by Sonny Landham of all people! That'll be Billy from Predator to you and me before I looked up his name. Before I knew it I was shouting Jeez you got a big pussy! which is why my neighbours now look at me as if I'm nuts.They all have a friendly punch up and then it's montage time! This time round the film get it right and just in time too before some of Brakus' men arrive in a helicopter and seemingly kill everyone except Tommy Billy himself goes down fighting in an impressive Massimo Vanni style shootout. There's also a massive explosion for all those massive explosion fans out there.So now Brakus has Tommy to fight in the ring and Tommy thinks everyone's dead so all he's got left is the motivation to kick Brakus in the face several thousand times. Didn't feel like Brakus thought that one through too much.This film is a lot more fun that the last one and is nonstop action and cheese from start to finish. A total winner! Even Eric's hair is more dynamic and manageable this time round.".

Does not mean it sucks just means it is cheesier and not as good.Making their returns are Alex Grady Tommy Lee and Travis Brickley Roberts Rhee Penn who now run a karate studio. Funny how they are taekwondo guys in the first and are now karate guys. Travis thirsts more money and enters an illegal fight tournament in Las Vegas where death can happen. Wayne Newton as a different character is the sponsor and the audience are rich high rollers that love to see death. That is sickening. Why would people like that want to see people beat each other to death? Who wants to see death in general? All the Las Vegas hotshots love to see it! I know this is just a cheesy movie but I did not buy it. When Alex's young song Walter sneaks in and witnesses the undefeated Brackus Ralph Moeller beats Travis to death he is scarred and tells his father and Tommy right away. Sounds like Rocky IV when Apoolo was killed by Drago eh? The angry duo crash a fancy dinner and tear up the joint then go on the run. Brackus wants Tommy and Tommy must fight to the death in order to live another day. All the fights scenes are spectacular and the gunfights are cool too. The subplots are no as good as the ones from the first but good enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "Best of the Best from 1989 is a VERY well done film. This is a review of Best of the Best 2 so I will keep my summary of the first one short but here it goes BEST OF THE BEST is one of the very few movies that has emotionally touched and moved me. I can watch that film any day of the week and each and every time it leaves me happy inspired feeling good. It is a PERFECT feel good about yourself movie and it is just PHENOMENAL with its writing and storyline. It has morals of brotherhood and teamwork and it is just a FANTASTIC film. Best of the Best 2 on the other hand...different story. I normally am a HUGE action movie guy. I love action movies to no end. Best of the Best was one of the very few movies to be mostly a drama centered around the characters and to move me as it did. Best of the Best 2 takes everything about the first movie that did that....and DESTROYS it. The plot is basically just Rocky IV. Chris Penn of the first film is killed so Phillip Rhee  Eric Roberts want revenge. Thats it. There is a completely overdrawn sequence where Tommy is being reunited with his family and dealing with his alcoholic uncle James Sonny Landham. That part is a bit too drawn out and takes away from the films pacing. But basically its a fight for your life movie with ZERO morals and ZERO values like the first one had. To me that was an ENORMOUS disappointment so see the likable characters from the first emotionally driven movie placed in a Gladiatorarena fighting movie. As an action movie it is not bad some very grizzly scenes where Rhee breaks limbs of other gladiators but I HATED how the film destroyed everything that made the first one such a powerful film. The end title song To Be The Best of the Best is a pretty inspirational solid softrock anthem performed by Mark Free that is definitely a highlight of the movie...I just highly preferred the first film to this because this delivers besides fight scenes close to NOTHING the original had to offer. Not a bad action movie but I did not like it as the sequel to Best of the Best. Perhaps if it was a stand alone movie. 410".

The front is a Las Vegas dance club called The Stock Exchange but behind the scenes Gladiator Fights are taking place remember at this time the TV show American Gladiators was huge. Specifically fighters dress up in absurd outfits and pummel each other to death. The star of the show is the arrogant powerful and unbeatable soulless automaton Brakus Moeller.When the likable Travis Brickley Penn dies at the hands of the nefarious Brakus only fellow fighter Alex Grady his young son inexplicably named Walter Gross and of course Tommy Lee Rhee can get to the bottom of this illegal Punchfighting operation. To do this they head out to the desert so James Landham can help them train. Oh and one more thing...WAYNE NEWTON is the head of this evil hydra.Only in the early 90's could a mix of utter silliness and brutal violence come together like this. Not only that but we feel this movie was instrumental in promoting the Punchfighting genre. The Best of the Best series was surprisingly popular in video stores and on cable channels and many people first got their taste of Punchfighting because of them. So for that they deserve a lot of credit. Additionally this was a time in which filmmakers felt that they should get quality actors and teach them to fight instead of the other way around. That they should get Eric Roberts and Chris Penn instead of any old meathead. And at least here the formula works great.And when I think action movies I immediately think Wayne Newton. Newton is a showbiz professional and gives his all here and he for whatever reason really seems to care. he gives an energetic big performance and his presence sets the movie apart and makes it really enjoyable. And while it's great to see Chris Penn Wayne Newton Walter the kid who looks more like a 35 yearold stunted adult who loves his Tetris and Eric Roberts complete with his tomato apron AND Phillip Rhee Sonny Lanham Meg Foster and Nicholas Worth lest we forget....BRAKUS? The writers of this movie must really be proud that they came up with the name Brakus because it is said a minimum of 36 times throughout the movie. Ralf Moeller plays the classic German baddie and a lot of Best of the Best 2 is lifted from Rocky IV 1985. The invincible Teutonic muscleman is the antagonist and our heroes must go out into the wilderness to train to beat him why are Phillip Rhee's relatives Indians for some reason? and of course the parallels between Apollo Creed and Travis Brickley.There are many funny bits Eric Roberts seems tipsy if not drunk throughout the movie and all is well and good but even as lovable as it is it is a bit overlong. If the movie had been chopped down by about 1015 minutes we'd be dealing with an even bigger classic. But this is one David and Goliath tale that can certainly withstand multiple viewings.Featuring the memorable title song by Mark Free Best of the Best 2 just narrowly makes it into the ranks of a mustsee.".

The movie was never made in quebec on DVD in french.... and my cousin dosen't speak much English so well i finally got it by ordering a Korean versionlol yeah i know that had the 3 tracks on it. It immediately started back the fire in me and i got on a rampage to grab every American kickboxing movies of the 90s... Now i have hundreds of them. Yet BOTB2 will always have a sweet spot. I like the first one but this one is even better the story yet classic is well written the characters are believable the soundtrack is AMAZING. Both Wayne Newton and Ralph Moeller are superb as the bad guys in this not to mention Tommy LeePhillip Rhee is dress exactly as Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat in the final part of the movie even performing Liu Kang traditional finishing move. I know MK actually got JCVD bloodsport character for inspiration of the character Johnny Cage and that Sonya is based on Cynthia Rothrock but since MK is from 92 when BOTB2 is 93 i would say BOTB2 had Tommy looked like Liu. Anyway i love everything about this movie action sequences the acting  the story its a true classic. You have to see this if you like American Martial Arts movies of the 90s".

	schema:reviewBody "Rum Diary 2011If you're looking for the craziness of later Hunter S. Thompson you'll find shreds of it here. In a way this is a more cogent movie than say Fear and Loathing but it's also a bit prosaic beneath the wilder stuff that peppers the surface. Johnny Depp stars and runs the show in his usual strong if uninspired way as a new harddrinking reporter with a failing English language newspaper in Puerto Rico.There is a true surface here that's pretty amazingthe cars the low down rot of the apartments the racism between the rich white Americans and the indigenous Puerto Ricans.

There are several secondary characters who do their best to be a bit insane including Giovanni Ribisi as a drugged out waif of a reporter something like what Thompson himself might have become later in life. See of course the Depp in the imperfect 1998 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for a sense of the famous freewheeling selfish addled sometimes brilliant Thompson.The director here also adapted Thompson's book and if he gets the credit for the nice ambiance of the film he also gets the burden of how clunky choppy and sometimes slow it is even with such exciting material. It's not a horror it's watchable but you'll flag here and there. Even the end without giving a thing away is a bit deflating.".

In a way this is a more cogent movie than say Fear and Loathing but it's also a bit prosaic beneath the wilder stuff that peppers the surface. Johnny Depp stars and runs the show in his usual strong if uninspired way as a new harddrinking reporter with a failing English language newspaper in Puerto Rico.There is a true surface here that's pretty amazingthe cars the low down rot of the apartments the racism between the rich white Americans and the indigenous Puerto Ricans.

And even if you did not read the book this film lacks drama cinematic style character arcs a hooking intro and satisfying end. I am not sure if the writerdirector Bruce Robinson spent the time to really READ the book. It's a DARK comedy not a lighthearted love story. Hunter S. Thompson played by Johnny Depp was very depressed at the time getting wasting working minimal amounts and having sex with any Puerto Rican girl that was interested. None of this was portrayed accurately in the film. One key factor that Bruce Robinson screwed up was eliminating the character of Yemon which was crucial in the book. Instead this Robinson combined three characters into two which isn't true to the book and does not work on screen. Another factor missed was the bar Al's which played a big role in the book. This was the local bar in which all the works at the newspaper went to everyday and got wasted at. Besides the two lead characters in the film all the workers were alcoholics and Robinson failed at exposing the working environment of the newspaper.The ending of the book was tremendous the boss Lotterman has a heart attack and dies when he thinks one of the employees was going to beat him up. Instead of using this great ending handed to him Bruce Robinson steered away from that and it fell flat at the end. All in all when adapting a book like The Rum Diary you have to stay true to the heart balls of the story. Bruce Robinson missed the dark tone of the book did not develop the characters and the environment to its fullest extent. On top of that did a terrible job of exposing the beautiful landscape of Puerto Rico shooting everything much too tight not allowing the viewer to get a true feel of the surroundings and native people. Instead of wasting your ten bucks at the cinema sit down relax and read an amazing book by Hunter S. Thompson The Rum Diary.".

In the book Paul Kemp and Sanderson represent the dueling persona's of Hunter one being a cutthroat athletic type the other being the boozehound antiauthoritarian. In this film Johnny Depp plays more to the character being a young HST and combines the characteristics of both into Kemp. Some may have a problem with this but the movie is stronger for it as you are only rooting for the protagonist while giving the story a strong antagonist a necessity in filmmaking.In my eyes this is Bruce Robinson's best work on screen to date Johnny Depp is absolutely aweinspiringly believable as a very young and constrained Hunter and the cast could not have been more dead on. I'll be seeing this several more times in the theaters in the coming months.".

	schema:headline " The Rum Diary film review";
	schema:reviewBody "The Rum Diary is a drama conjoined with elements of playful humour based on the self entitled novel by Hunter S. Thompson. The film boasts one of the most critically acclaimed actors Johnny Depp who is joined by other noticeable stars such as Aaron Eckhart The Dark Knight Giovanni Ribisi Gone In 60 Seconds and upcoming beauty Amber Heard. Depp himself is familiar with Thompson when incorporating his novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas onto the big screen in 1998. With this in mind we were certain to expect elements of surrealism with maybe the odd drug usage now and then. The story is set in the 1950's and follows Depp through the character of Paul Kemp who moves to Puerto Rico as a journalist who is in search of work a good story and possibly something more. With his new job comes new friendships utter absurdity vast amounts of alcohol all topped off with a blonde bombshell.The Rum Diary displays beautiful visual strategies in stages throughout the narrative. Being based on the island of Puerto Rico the camera work certainly fetishises the beauty of the island in the same way in which beauty Chenault Amber herd is captured. Her blonde hair and blue eyes offer the same satisfaction as long stretching beaches and deep blue oceans. The visual strategies are very creative and often juggle between states of mind that Kemp and others alike are under. This being most apparent in a scene between Kemp and coworker Sala when experiencing an unknown drug which is taken as eye drops. Similar visuals between this scene and ones in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas can be matched and anyone who is familiar to this film knows that experiences of intoxication are to be had. The hazy and slow motion camera work have been closely thought out to create these effects over us the audience as we are able to be a part of these actions.One thing that I have been highly impressed with is the script itself people have mentioned that The Rum Diary has not lived up to expectations and could have been better. However this is not my personal opinion and I will offer a different outlook on the matter. My expectations of the film were not high due to these reviews but I am an individual who likes to make my own assumptions. The storyline offered in my opinion intriguing characters that all offer special characteristics in the narrative. They have been well thought of and are strong and understood rather than being weak or pointless. Moberg played by Giovanni Ribisi is a violent black mailing alcoholic who works in the newspaper with Kemp and Sala but rarely shows up to work and on the odd occasion he does he is drunk. The character is built to represent the pointlessness of the newspaper and seems to have worked out what Kemp has yet to learn already. His far fetched logic and actions all add up to a comic effect in the story which present light relief to a dramatic storyline. Scenes involving Voodoo witches and Nazi uniforms add to the surreal yet humorous conventions The Rum Diary offers.As I mentioned my expectations of The Rum Diary weren't at all particularly high but because of this aspect I think I enjoyed the spectacle more and was pleasantly surprised. The storyline keeps on going and I was never left with the feeling of it dragging on but left wanting more which the film could have easily done without becoming numb. The characters are entertaining as well as fresh and the surreal aspects certainly are not typical in everyday Hollywood blockbusters. The film is defiantly worth watching in terms of its originality as well as the comical moments and strong storyline.Defiantly a film worth seeing and remembering. You don't have to be under the influence to enjoy this ride".

	schema:reviewBody "Plot Summary Now if your the sort of person that needs a definitive story line and thick plot to enjoy a film then this probably isn't for you. Its more a 'fly on the wall' view of a young journalists struggles in a failing newspaper. Paul KempDepp is a young man trying to make his way in a new place making new friends and enemy's along the way.What I thought of it I wasn't sure what I would think of this film I new it has some great actors such as Johnny Depp and Giovanni Ribisi but the concept of the film was a strange one. I was pleasantly surprised the director Bruce Robinson has done a great job with this film which was always going to be a very tough job being adapted from a novel by Hunter S Thompson and technically having next to no strong plot.The film itself is stunning the locations are amazing and well shot and the editing style and shots work brilliantly with the type of film and more importantly with Johnny Depp who has a massive screen presence in everything he does including 'The Rum Diary'.This film has everything I want to see in a good movie strong characters great sets and brilliant comedy along with meaning. It really makes you think about society and life nowadays and how primarily nothing has changed in the way the world goes round and the sort of corruption and manipulation that still goes on today all around us as it did back in the fifties only less obviously.On a lighter note this film is hilarious and great to watch more than once there is something rather satisfying about watch a man drink huge amounts of high octane rum and have to deal with the consequences the next morning something that makes you happy its not only you.Summary In all I thought this was a very enjoyable film for anyone to watch and have a good laugh at while loving everything about the characters. The acting is scintillating and exciting.I highly recommend this film to all one to watch ..... 710 Stars".

The movie turned out to be really great the acting was very good from everybody the less colorful actor in this was probably Depp but in relative terms of course its just he didn't bring anything new to the table but all the other actors were a blast Michael Rispoli was awesome a great friend in the movie just one of these roles that you watch it and want to go chill and drink few rums with him. Giovanni Ribisi is just great as a drunk journalist lately every role with him I saw its just pure magic. His role is a bit controversial or at least as Johhny said in one of his European interviews defending this film few aspects of the film are not made for the American audience I guess you have to watch the film and judge for yourself on this one. What else can I say I was surprised very underrated movie don't go in expecting Withnail  I or Fear and Loathing because those movies are masterpieces in their own right and its very hard to make something similar to them especially Fear and Loathing but this film definitely comes close in its atmosphere pacing and friendly feeling to Withnail  I so don't go in expecting it to be Fear or Withnail but keep in mind the charm is there. Give it a try and you will not regret it. ".

	schema:reviewBody "By the film's intentional anticlimax we learn that Hunter S. Thompson who wrote THE RUM DIARY about his stint as a journalist in Puerto Rico in 1960 would go onto better things taking on all the bastards he let slip by in his youth.The problem is there's none in this movie worth troubling over or for the audience to root against. Which means Johnny Depp's Paul Kemp Thompson with a fake name has nothing for an audience to root for other than he's a popular actor that played a pirate who loved rum and so does this character. Every time Depp mentions drinking he's practically winking at the audience. Doing the same Walter Cronkite mumble from FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS Johnny's performance is so lowkey it hardly registers at all. His porky photographer sidekick Sala Michael Rispoli has more interesting and memorable qualities since he's sloppy and somewhat humorous. But in this film there's a lack of anything meaningful beneath the surface... which is an existential odyssey misadventure sort of... yet it sporadically plants a political flag but other than clips of Nixon or shots of poor people being exploited there's nothing substantial to hold onto.The plot has Kemp hired as a journalist at a fledgling Puerto Rico newspaper with the task of making the country seem like an accessible tourist trap and then conned by a millionaire to be his propagandist  a man who seems nice at first but has his eyes on turning the gorgeous exterior into a real estate landmine. He has a sexy girlfriend who Kemp lusts after leading to a brief romance more lacking in chemistry than the film does purpose.As a Thompson fan and having read his posthumous novel it's a understandably difficult work to base a movie on. Making it that much more annoying when cinematic clichs  like the scruffy underdogs battling the greedy rich guys or a drug trip that too easily propels a creative edge  are shoved at the screen turning a subtle book never intended for publication into a ponderous film trying way too hard to make a point whatever that might be.For More Movie Reviews httpcultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Johnny Depp's vanity project The Rum Diary  'vanity project' for that at the end of the day is all it is  is based on a novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson Depp is said to have found among Thompson's belongings after the writer's suicide. The novel completed in 1960 wasn't published until 1998 and well you have to ask yourself why. If the film of the novel is anything to go by I suspect it was simply because it wasn't very good. But as I have never read it I can't tell you either way.Mediocre novels have been turned into great films by great scriptwriters and directors. Unfortunately on this offering Bruce Robinson isn't one. Or if he is he this is one occasion when he hasn't pulled it off. Robinson made his name with his semiautobiographical film Withnail  I and I have to admit that didn't do too much for me either. Depp has previously dabbled in Thompson's work with Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. That didn't come off either which suggests to me Depp has something of a blind spot where Thompson is concerned. And this is Robinson's first film as director in 19 years. That too should tell us something and possibly something not particularly complimentary.The film itself is oddly oldfashioned in storyline cinematography direction and production. In the hands of another director Thompson's rather slight story might well have been turned to gold. Here it remains base metal. Almost everything about it from the soundtrack to the dialogue from the 'plot' to the humour  it has been billed as a comedy  is flat and lifeless and well mediocre. This kind of schtick was churned out weekly by journeymen writers and directors until the digital age changed what the punter wanted to see. Depp it has to be said and this is a personal view always has an attractive screen presence even when the film he's starring in is thirdrate and I have seen him in some real clunkers  Blow comes to mind.Amber Heard has virtually no role and I simply did not buy the romance between her character and Depp's. Michael Rispoli Giovanni Ribisi Aaron Eckhart and Richard Jenkins who was excellent as the pennycounting hitman's paymaster in Killing Them Softly turn in workaday performances and do the best of a bad job given what little they had to work with. Situations which I'm sure were intended to raise a laugh do nothing of the kind. I really did want to turn off halfway through but held out in case it somehow went from second to third gear. But it didn't.Sorry Johnny perhaps you should get better advice and listen to others rather than your own gut.".

Throughout the film we see examples of the opulent lifestyle of few and downtrodden livings of the many. What Depp confides with his friend allows us to use what we have learned up to that point in the movie and chew on for the remainder of the movie is this  the banks hold the wealth while leaving us and the starving children to stare at empty brass plates hanging on their front doors. Whether you agree with it or not this is not a stretch to compare with the occupy movement settling into America and around Europe today.This movie is good.

While I enjoy the actor's performance in general the movie as a whole is very very disappointing.It's a little hard to give a proper review on a movie that has well no real direction to the very sequential I wouldn't call it linear because it's got too much randomness for it events occurring in it. If not true to its title it seems like whoever wrote the script or the book it was based on in a drunken stupor going from one adventure into the next and shambling and swaying through it. There is no real binding plot no larger picture that is interesting enough to be captivating and it seems tied together with a farfetched almost haphazard thread to try and give it some semblance of coherence.As said the main actor's performance is enjoyable which is a plus but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. A giggle or two maybe and suitable for inflight entertainment or afternoon TV yes but not for much if anything else.".

While I enjoy the actor's performance in general the movie as a whole is very very disappointing.It's a little hard to give a proper review on a movie that has well no real direction to the very sequential I wouldn't call it linear because it's got too much randomness for it events occurring in it. If not true to its title it seems like whoever wrote the script or the book it was based on in a drunken stupor going from one adventure into the next and shambling and swaying through it. There is no real binding plot no larger picture that is interesting enough to be captivating and it seems tied together with a farfetched almost haphazard thread to try and give it some semblance of coherence.As said the main actor's performance is enjoyable which is a plus but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. A giggle or two maybe and suitable for inflight entertainment or afternoon TV yes but not for much if anything else.";

Throughout the first hour and a half we didn't have Hunter S Thompson narrating this story. And I don't think Robinson realized that until the last thirty minutes of the feature.In Fear and Loathing Gilliam made a commitment to exploiting the drug abusing nature of HST. But Robinson couldn't do that as much in The Rum Diary and I think he wanted to badly because that's what the last 30 minutes told me.As much as Robinson wanted to make this journey through Puerto Rico hallucinogenic the novel he was trying to adapt didn't call for it. And all that from Fear and Loathing is probably what really inspired Robinson to direct The Rum Diary in the first place. So toward the end it's kind of like Robinson thought 'wait we still haven't shown them enough surrealistic hallucinations narrated by Thompson so he tacked on another thirty minutes of a possible story line.Up until that point we almost got somewhat of an authentic autobiographical epic of the late author obviously told from the perspective of someone besides. But that also meant by this point it was too late for the director to just suddenly turn over the narrative to Johnny Depp from behind the type writer of Thompson.At this point I began to feel like the words coming out of Johnny Depp's mouth were not the words of HST.If this was supposed to be a close adaptation to the book it didn't feel that way in the end.".

	schema:headline " The Rum Diary";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been waiting for the film adaptation of The Rum Diary to be released for quite some time now. I am a big fan of writer Hunter S. Thompson and his books articles and films made from his writings such as Terry Gilliam's 1998 masterpiece Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Over the past several years I kept hearing that different people were attached to do The Rum Diary movie but people would back out and just when it seemed like the film was ready it would be delayed. Finally it has been released and I can easily say that the film exceeded way past my expectations of it. I own The Rum Diary but it has been several years since I have read it and till I watched the film I could not really remember all that much about it. Basically just minor details. This is not because it is necessarily a bad book but when I read it I think I found that I liked a lot of Hunter S. Thompson's other writings considerably better. Fortunately for me the film translates really well to the screen and has given me a whole new admiration for the book and the film has easily become one of my favourite films of this year. The story just briefly takes place in the 1960's where an American writer and journalist named Paul Kemp goes to Puerto Rico and gets a job at a rundown and failing newspaper as a writer. There he befriends some of the others who work at the paper and gets involved with a shady character named Sanderson and also falls for his girlfriend Chenault. Throughout the rest of the film there is a lot of humour despair eccentricities and a lot that I absolutely loved. When the film version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas came out it was really divided by critics. Some absolutely loved it and others hated it with a passion. I can safely say that if Fear was not your film you may still like The Rum Diary. Fear was all about having a good time and partying and seeing all the freaky things that came out of it. The Rum Diary is a much more subdued and low key film in that regard. There is drinking and some partying but not a lot and it is not the focus of the film. The focus and main message that The Rum Diary was trying to get across is the decline and failure of the American dream politics greed and human nature. It is told in somewhat a bitter way but it is making a point here and is making it loud and clear just as revved up and ready to go as any of Hunter S. Thompson's writings. The thing is the characters in the film know of this decline and it comes to the point where they try and do something about it but there is no values ethics or things left to save. The film at times is a beautiful looking film and at other times very bleak drab and ugly. I say this in a good way because it really strikes home the conditions the writers are talking about and further adds to the message it is trying to convey and also show the lifestyle of where they are living. The Rum Diary is not all hopelessness and despair either. There is a good amount of fun to be had here as well. Some of the supporting characters are so out there and wonderfully unique that they made me laugh out loud several times. I really enjoyed the chemistry and forbidden love of Paul Kemp's character and Chenault and found it really added tension and other interesting elements to the film. That acting here by everyone is superb and there is not one weak performance in the bunch. The film has the look feel and style of Thompson's gonzo style journalism and his blunt way of saying things. It strikes home a message that some may already get and others perhaps not. It is important but remember that there is also a lot of fun to be had here as well. This film is destined to become a cult classic because unfortunately it is doing poorly at the theatres. If you are at all a fan of Thompson cult films or just anything different I highly recommend you give this film a try. One of the year's best.".

It is about a madeup writer that they falsely lead you to believe was a real man who moves to Puerto Rico to get a job and is a drunk. What else is it about may you ask? I'm not altogether sure. It was not completely incoherent but the storyline had no focus. It jumped around and quickly left one topic idea or narrative just as soon as it introduced it. Towards the end right when you think Paul Kemp had an ambitious cause it was over. With the cheesy line this is the end of one story and the beginning of another they leave you to realize that you are in the same place as you started. Nothing had really happened at all or had been accomplished. I did enjoy the performances by all of the actors but this fact was dampened by distractions of the plot that lead to nowhere. In the end it all just seemed pointless and without reason.".

It is about a madeup writer that they falsely lead you to believe was a real man who moves to Puerto Rico to get a job and is a drunk. What else is it about may you ask? I'm not altogether sure. It was not completely incoherent but the storyline had no focus. It jumped around and quickly left one topic idea or narrative just as soon as it introduced it. Towards the end right when you think Paul Kemp had an ambitious cause it was over. With the cheesy line this is the end of one story and the beginning of another they leave you to realize that you are in the same place as you started. Nothing had really happened at all or had been accomplished. I did enjoy the performances by all of the actors but this fact was dampened by distractions of the plot that lead to nowhere. In the end it all just seemed pointless and without reason.";

Her notorious pickiness when it comes  to choosing roles has served her well and she is one of the few stars from that time who has moved quite gracefully through a film career.  Her resources as an actress allow the character of Phyllis Mann to come alive in a way that few could accomplish and the magic she creates is unforgetable.

Nick Nolte's rugged charm serves him well throughout and when these two are alone together on screen the art of film acting is proudly displayed.

But when Nick Nolte and especially Julie Christie are on screen all is forgiven.  They're great together but it's Christie's film all the way.  She is such a rarity  an actress who combines genuine Movie Star Glamour the real deal with a thoroughly modern sensibility.  I could go on gushing but let me just say that she is sublime and this film gives us an all too rare opportunity to see her in full glory albeit in a vehicle that's less than worthy of her.".

Most of the people were unhappy and if I'm not mistaken Chaplin spends the whole movie in taxi cabs taking pictures of the corners of buildings. When I saw Choose Me years later it had a breezy jazzy feel to it that I loved.  It was about people in love unlucky in love wanting more love wanting love from someone else etc. Afterglow is a little like both of these movies.  It has its jazz soundtrack intact and the people are miserable. In a nutshell Julie and Nick haven't had a decent moment together since before they can remember.  Lara and Johnny Lee are much younger but also accumulating many bad moments.  Secrets are revealed. Both couples switch mates.  They are not that much happier.  Both find out about the other.  That's it. Nolte and Julie Christie have some good scenes together but she has much more chemistry with Johnny Lee Miller who gives the best performance in the movie by a mile.  He nails his role as a yuppiescumbag perfectly.The whole thing is way too long.  There are unnecessary scenes galore.

I happen to like his films when they don't star Keith Carradine whom I don't like but can see why others don't.  In a Rudolph film plot is less important than mood and texture and there really isn't much of a plot in this film it's pretty much all mood and texture.  The dialogue he writes is also right out of the 30's and 40's a friend once said Rudolph films are what would happen in Bogart ended up in a Fred Astaire movie.In this movie the dialogue sometimes falls flat and some of the tone shifts are jarring.  In addition Miller's character is a complete lout we hardly understand why Boyle let alone Christie would even bother with him.  And Boyle had a character to play in Rudolph's EQUINOX but here she just flails around.Nevertheless this is a good movie and that's partly because of the romantic pull Rudolph does achieve and because of the performances of Nick Nolte and Julie Christie.  Although both of them are playing characters past their prime Rudolph films them like old movie stars would be filmed and matches his tempo to their performances which are relaxed and confident which contrasts to Boyle and Miller whose discomfort is obvious. Critics up here noted this was one of the few if not the only U.S. films filmed in Canada Montreal that actually took place there.".

The stilted dialogue the muddled storyline the confused editing the glacial pace... and that ending! What was that about?? Do yourself a favour go directly to the best part of the film and buy the soundtrack album.

I was very worried that with only 4 months of German training and a total of only 7 months living in Bavaria that i would have a massive problem understanding a lot of the humor throughout the film. Much to my surprise i found that the story was very easy to understand to an auslander. I'm looking very forward to reading the subtitles on this movie when i watch it the second time and i will definitely be recommending it to my Mum and sister. However my boyfriend who was with me at the premier also enjoyed it very much but i think that was mostly because of the Bavarian humor. He is also Bavarian. The relationships between the main character Kati and her friends and family surrounding her are so understandable and easy to relate to. They really have fantastic bonds and these are explored quite well throughout the film. Apparently this is part of a trilogy set and if that is true i look forward to seeing how these relationships grow and grow.There are little to no conflicts in the film but i didn't find this to be a problem at all as i enjoyed the uplifting nature completely. All in all its a wonderful romantic painting of the Bavarian countryside and its lovable inhabitants. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to travel to these remote parts of Germany or even if you just feel like taking a holiday in your local independent cinema. It's just great.".

	schema:headline " Nothing about the film is best not even good";
	schema:reviewBody "Beste Zeit or Best Times or Good Times is a German 90minute movie from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary this year. It was made by director Marcus H. Rosenmller during a really prolific phase in his filmmaking career. The script is by Karin Michalke and the word beginnings describes this project very well as it is the very first writing effort by Michalke and she worked together with Rosenmller on several other projects including the two sequels to this one here as by now it is already a trilogy. It is the very first acting credit for Anna Maria Sturm and Rosalie Thomass who is quite a star in Germany now had her first bigger role in here too even if I would not call it a breakthrough performance. In contrast to the other films perhaps Sturm is really so much in the center of it all that Thomass' is more of a supporting performance. The crucial plot points here also all involve Sturm's character like her invitation to make an exchange year in America or her boys' troubles. Thomass' character is just there to comfort her friend and deal with the situation of her friend missing for a long time herself. So yeah there you already have some crucial plot components from this film. Like several of Rosenmller's other works there is great focus on the Bavarian area where the film is set in terms of accents Bavarian joie de vivre beautiful rural landscapes and other aspects. As for the film itself I really wasn't impressed at all. I am not a great fan of Thomass and see her more an an equally untalented but younger Veronica Ferres and still I must say the actress they put next to her in here isn't any better either. Pretty disappointing. More known actors in here are Brckner and Bruch but the way they were written they hardly make an impact at all. It's all about the girls. The more dramatic moments did not become memorable to me and the ending is as unrealistic as it is predictable. Happy ending for the sake of it but only the simple minds in the audience will be satisfied. Also the attempt to make these girls likable did not work out from my perspective as I really found myself with a couldn't care less position in terms of me caring for what would happen to them next let alone hope for them finding happiness. I give this one a thumbsdown and for all I care no sequels should have been made. Watch something else instead.".

This is the second of so far three films from the series and the time gap between films 1 and 2 is tiny compared to the one between 2 and 3. Marcus H. Rosenmller returns as director of course and the script is by Karin Michalke again. Like the first it runs for roughly 1.5 hours slightly over actually. Anna Maria Sturm and Rosalie Thomass play the two young women again that are in the center of the story. In the first film the focus was almost entirely on Sturm's character but in this one here it is fairly equal. Maybe they realized already that Thomass had more potential if we are looking at where the two are today in terms of popularity. Or the reason could also have been that they saw that Sturm has hardly any talent or range and looking at how limited of an actress Thomass is it's really painful to see how they managed to get a colead for this franchise that is even worse. The contents in here are about failed ALevels illness of family members a planned trip abroad and about conflict rising and the two girls also having an argument while everything in the first 90 minutes was peaceful and harmony. Needless to say that these scenes here feel just rushed in unauthentic and for the sake of it. With what happens to the grandpa you'd expect them to stick together now more than ever but that would have been boring and not worth telling however so lets just have them hate each other now and for the sake of a forced and unrealistic ending that will satisfy the simple masses have them reunite quickly again as if nothing happened but of course so much happened actually so their friendship is even stronger now. Truly cringeworthy stuff just like everything about the male characters in the female characters' lives especially the football references. Again the only quality aspect here that stays is probably the beautiful countryside of Bavaria. Everything else is either forgettable or garbage such as the highly pretentious quotes by Thomass' character when she is on the plane at the very end. I was incredibly close to a  rating here. Lets hope the long gap before film 3 helped them in actually finally inserting some quality in this Beste series. This one here is much closer to Schlechteste. Highly not recommended.".

Valmont is someone who measures success by the number of his conquests and Merteuil challenges him to seduce the soon to be married Cecile de Volanges and provide proof in writing of his success. His reward for doing so will be to spend the night with Merteuil. He has little difficulty seducing Cecile but what he really wants is to seduce Madame de Tourvel. When Merteuil learns that he has actually fallen in love with her she refuses to let him claim his reward for seducing Cecile. Death soon follows.";

Better yet the acting entirely matches the skill of the direction that takes its method from the theatre  emotions are conveyed by expression and not dialogue. Glenn Close gives her best performance on celluloid as the scheming Madame de Merteuil amorally hellbent on bending everyone to her will no matter the method or the cost and John Malkovitch is her perfect foil as the cynical hedonistic but worldweary Valmont. Michelle Pfeiffer engages our empathy as the tortured and manipulated target of Malkovitch's desire and Close's plotting.The film is basically a morality tale but one that fascinates in its exposure of ego vanity intrigue and the war between the genders subjects that are timeless in their relevance despite the period setting.

	schema:reviewBody "Dangerous Liaisons is this incredible movie that is so under rated. It's the battle of the sexes and this book was written over 200 years ago! I love to know that there was this same problem that we still have to this day. That's why enjoyed Dangerous Liaisons so much because it proves that we have so many differences from the opposite sexes. Men are usually expected to have sex and with a few clever words destroy women's reputations in minutes while women have to be careful of sleeping with whom because it's considered shameful.Glenn Close plays Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil a proper lady with a secretive double life of sex and wishing to destroy a girl's reputation for revenge on her ex for dumping her for this young lady. She also makes a bet with her closest friend Vicomte Sbastien de Valmont played by John Malkovich that he could not bed a lady of such high stature and morals in return if he succeeds he will finally have the conquest he's been dreaming of bedding Marquise Isabelle. I don't care what people say this was Glenn's best performance and she was so brilliant. Her speech of Dominate your sex and avenge my own was perfect and as a woman I rooted for her in the story. She is a tragic figure that was over looked by many as just another slut. Glenn had my sympathy and I agreed with a lot of her dialog.John as Valmont was absolutely perfect he's not that sexy looking but has such charm and charisma on the screen you believe him as a lady's man. It's beyond my control he repeats this several times throughout the film and it becomes more darker each and every time he says it to Michelle's character. He does the Marquise a favor of bedding young Cecile to help the Marquise's plan of revenge and does such a good job. It was almost too easy for him but he has a more difficult task of bedding Madame Marie de Tourvel who is married and has very high morals and standards of God and love. He falls in love with her in the process of getting to know her and is so believable you can see how it breaks his heart to break her's. But he feels he must stand by his reputation and your own heart goes out to him despite his cruel manors as a man.Michelle Pfeiffer as Marie de Tourvel is so beautiful and elegant and is the only one who knows of Valmont's true side. But she cannot help but fall for his charm and love for her when she talks to his aunt this is one of the most true speeches ever in cinema that all women can relate too I'm sorry to say this but those who are most worthy of love are never made happy by it. Do you still think men love the way we do? No... men enjoy the happiness they feel. We can only enjoy the happiness we give. They are not capable of devoting themselves exclusively to one person. So to hope to be made happy by love is a certain cause of grief. That is so incredibly and painfully true that Marie knows better but can't help but give herself to Valmont.Swoosie Kurtz Uma Thurman and Mildred Natwick are all so exceptional and amazing as well in the film. They truly bring the story to life and keep it going with their dialog and actions. Keanu? Shudder his acting is like... how do I put this delicately? I think it's... wood.  Otherwise trust me this is one of the best movies of all time. This deserves higher than a 7.6 and should be in the top 250. But it's beyond my control. D 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The Age of Enlightment gave to the world some pretty controversial minds. At one end of the spectrum there was the Marquis de Sade who no secret to anyone created the concept that is now known as sadism. At the other end there is Choderlos de Laclos who is widely known for creating this story which in essence is very close to Sade's dark heart even when it never reaches the extremes of his florid depictions of ritualistic sexual perversion.DANGEROUS LIAISONS based on the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses is this tale Laclos' most known adapted many times for television and screen but never like this with such attention to detail to make it as French as possible and bringing a classical sensibility to the front. Stephen Frears in his American film debut creates a lush visage of restrained yet swooning passions icy stares and hushed measured speeches against the backdrop of the IledeFrance and should have been the film of the year had it not been for the usual sentimentalism prevalent during the 1980's which gave the major awards to RAINMAN a film centered around autism that while delicate as a subject matter was hardly dramatic and today is barely memorable.On the other hand this story is. The dark comedy that pins two bored aristocrats against each other as they play God with other people's lives without realizing the devastating consequences that will result from this has been the stuff of legend and allure. Glenn Close John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer all are beyond awards in their exacting and multidimensional portrayals of three very different people caught in a web of deceit. However the star of this adaptation has to be Christopher Hampton who immortalizes Laclos' vision in a subtle yet powerful story filled with subtext and restrained cruelty. He's the one who suggests pages about his characters most tellingly of the Marquis de Merteuil in three key scenes in the first opening sequence which she also shares with the Vicomte de Valmont she admires her reflection in a mirror with a smug expression akin to the Mona Lisa. She is in control and about to go through with her activities. She is dressed into an orgy of corsets and fabric looking directly into the camera  the Vicomte does the same as he is dressed  which sets their characters' tones. They are mirror images of one another each in their gender. Both are apparently in full control.The second telling revelation of the Marquise is when she arrives to the Volanges' to give advice to Cecile about virtue. You can see how she has her Mona Lisa smile on which as soon as she gets off her carriage turns to a rictus of anguish. Cut to her later saying about shame You find the shame is like the pain. You only feel it once. As her head rests against a window you may see her eyes briefly moisten. Her expression is however blank but very deep and expressive. It's the first time she cracks open the door to her inner face but just a little and only for a second but what a second! The last time Hampton describes Merteuil is in a scene which mirrors the first scene watch how again she looks at herself in her mirror. Her traps have been discovered and she faces her own self and uncertain future having destroyed everyone around her and being left alone. It's the calm right before the taking of the Bastille hence why the timing of the story has to be in the Eighteenth Century right before the French Revolution. And in being so revealing while using expressions Hampton creates the internal dialog that was the driving force behind the epistolary nature of the novel. His rendition of the Madame de Tourvel and Valmont are no less complex. Michelle Pfieffer with minimal dialog and her wide doe eyes is given a rewarding role that explodes during her faceoff with Malkovich when her character is betrayed. Their physicality skirts with sadism and sets the stage for Valmont's own internal pain as he faces his own mortality since he has been led to destroy the one he loves and for a promise and nothing else.It's been no mystery that films that lose to other of the moment films become timeless and the stuff that makes movie magic. DANGEROUS LIAISONS nearly twenty years later still bites especially when from a light comedy it becomes this horrific monster staring at us from the abyss more so because of the exquisite cruelty that we cause to others in the name of reputation and vanity. And in that the Marquise is right vanity and love are incompatible. Just look at Valmont and you will see why.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe this is the best of the four adaptations of the playnovel Dangerous Liaisons.  Glenn Close plays Mertuil who with Malkovich's Valmont manipulate and seduce others for entertainment.  In comes Michelle Pfieffer's beautiful Madame de Tourvel whose husband is off at a trial or something to that extent.  Valmont realizes what a capture it would be if he were to succeed in seducing her and making her forget all her vows of fidelity.

In comes Michelle Pfieffer's beautiful Madame de Tourvel whose husband is off at a trial or something to that extent.  Valmont realizes what a capture it would be if he were to succeed in seducing her and making her forget all her vows of fidelity.

	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.This is a tale about the ancien rgime in 18th century France before the revolution in which the moral decadence of the privileged classes rivaled that of Sodom and Gomorrah and the ancient Romans. The story comes from a novel by Choderlos de Laclos that was made into a stage play by Christopher Hampton. It is a cynical satire on human sexuality as well as a very subtle examination of sexual hypocrisy and desire a kind of oh so sophisticated laugh at bourgeois morality that would have delighted Voltaire and Moliere and greatly amused Shakespeare. It is a tale of elaborate lechery and revenge that backfires because it seems that anybody even the most jagged rake can fall in love and thereby become the victim.John Malkovich plays the rake Vicomte de Valmont whose sole purpose in life is to seduce women rob them of their virtue and then move on. Glenn Close plays his backstabbing confidante and onetime lover the Marquise de Merteuil. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the coy and virtuous Madame de Tourvel who is to be Valmont's latest conquest. Uma Thurman is cast as a teenaged ingenue who is betrothed to Merteuil's lover while Keanu Reeves plays her naive music teacher and would be lover Chevalier Danceny. Stephen Frears who has directed such diverse films as The Grifters 1990 and My Beautiful Laundrette 1985 after a somewhat cryptic start does an excellent job of bringing the biting cynicism of Laclos and Hampton to the screen.I know of two other versions of this film Milos Forman's Valmont 1989 starring Colin Firth and Annette Bening and Roger Vadim's Dangerous Liaisons 1960. Regrettably  I haven't seen Vadim's film but Forman's Valmont is excellent. In polite society comparisons are said to be odious. I shall proceed anywayJohn Malkovich vs. Colin Firth. Malkovich is widely recognized as a great actor but he is clearly miscast in this role yet he brings a predatory dimension to the part that is in keeping with the overall psychology of the movie. Firth while not as celebrated for his acting skills as Malkovich is nonetheless a fine actor and his charm and playful inventiveness are more in keeping with the character of Valmont whom women love. Call it even.Glenn Close vs. Annette Bening. Again Close is considered the more accomplished actor but Bening is sexier prettier and considerably more charming. Whether that is a plus as far as the reality of the novel and play are concerned is debatable. For my part I found Bening a lot more fun to watch. Edge to Bening.Michelle Pfeiffer vs. Meg Tilly. Pfeiffer is a much bigger star and has more experience as an actress. She is beautiful but Tilly is more passionate. Pfeiffer was nominated for an academy award for best supporting actress for her work but did not win. Personally I thought Tilly was more believable and was especially effective in projecting first the repressed passion and then the complete abandonment as she gives herself to Valmont. Pfeiffer's portrayal of Tourvel's coy awakening with just a hint of duplicity and then her utter dissolution when he leaves her was star quality. Edge to Pfeiffer.Uma Thurman vs. Fairuza Balk. I loved them both. Thurman of course is a more statuesque beauty with a polished and controlled acting style but Balk's wideeyed innocence was a delight. Call it even.Keanu Reeves vs. Henry Thomas. Thomas was cute but almost too juvenile to be believed. Reeves seemed just right for the part. Clear edge to Reeves.Frears vs. Forman. Frears's direction was more cynical especially in the duel between Valmont and Merteuil in which their mutual and complementary debauchery is in sharp focus. And his resolution was more clearly defined. Forman's strength was in the delight and playfulness of many of the scenes especially those relating to the seduction of Tourvel. His direction was more comedic and he allowed a greater development of secondary characters while Frears concentrated more on the two leads. I give a very small edge to Forman but would not argue with those preferring Frears.Bottom line I liked Forman's movie better but the voters at IMDb.com preferred Frears's Dangerous Liaisons giving it an average of 7.7 stars out of ten to 6.7 for Valmont. Some bon motsValmont tells Madame de Tourvel as he dumps her My love had great difficulty outlasting your virtue. It's beyond my control.Valmont demands that the Marquise de Merteuil reply to his proposal of a night together will it be love of war? He says A single word is all that is required. Long pause and then she gives him three All right. Pause.Cut to satisfied smile on Valmont's face. War.When Valmont returns from making love to Madame de Tourvel he reveals to Merteuil that for the first time he may be in love. He relates his feelings to her I love her. I hate her... The camera turns to Close who yawns.Valmont's aunt while consoling Madame de Tourvel who has confessed that she is in love with Valmont and can't help herself says reflecting the wisdom of all who have been there In such matters all advice is useless.Toward the end Valmont says I have no illusions. I lost them on my travels.".

The pace at which the cabal develops is leisurely going towards slow but I think that is advantageous. This is because its very slowness allows us to appreciate the atmosphere in which Merteuil and Valmont plan the ruination of innocents boredom really. They have nothing better to do so destroying others is a pastime to them.The settings costumes and makeup reinforce this atmosphere  they are splendidly done and one may well talk of oppressive opulence. The opening of the film actually puts costume and makeup to symbolic use it is inspired we follow Merteuil and Valmont through their morning toilette getting dressed and made up foreshadowing the masquerade they put on and in which they both are actors but Merteuil is eventually revealed to be the director.The casting I thought superb. Malkovich is in my opinion perfectly suited to play Valmont precisely because he is not conventionally attractive. The character relies on his powers of manipulation and the occasional subterfuge for his conquests' and Malkovich achieves an accomplished embodiment of both  impossible to say no to with just that necessary element of ruthlessness. There have been complaints that Glenn Close is not attractive enough to be the Marquise but I disagree. Her character is motivated by a will to control and dominate. As she says herself I was born to dominate your sex and to avenge my own' or words to that effect. Her sexuality similarly is not driven purely by pleasure hence her refusal to give Valmont his reward. She sees him not conforming to the part she has written' for him and reestablishes herself as unattainable unless he brings the ultimate sacrifice. And Glenn Close delivers this calculating woman so convincingly that it is easy for me at least to understand why Valmont would go to any length to bed her. Just as he wants Tourvel to betray everything she ever believed in he wants the controlling Merteuil to submit to him  hence the repeated reminders of their past love. Merteuil at one point says that he was the only one she almost? I'm not entirely sure lost control with.The supporting actors I also find well chosen. Reeves may seem a strange choice but the character is a bit of a wet blanket to start with and he gives the docile creature easily manipulated by Valmont and Merteuil quite well. But better are Pfeiffer and Thurman who both undergo convincing changes from innocents abroad to someone well on the way to a willing pupil of the Marquise and Vicomte in Thurman's case and to someone genuinely suffering from the opposing demands of morals and love Pfeiffer.If you only watch one dialoguedriven costume drama set in the eighteenth century this year make it this one though if you can take more give The Madness of King George' a lookin too.".

I especially found Malkovich a bit too whiny to be believable as the Vicomte de Valmont. He is supposed to be a lover of many women but I find it hard to believe many would be drawn to him in this film. Glenn Close does perform well except that I don't believe her character could be believed to be anything but a hardened woman disappointed in love and badly used in marriage. I do credit Michelle Pfeiffer as giving a good performance as Madame de Tourvel. It is believable although not quite as I had pictured it when reading the book.I have not seen the more recent film Cruel Intentions based on the book but I have seen Valmont. Of the two versions I much prefer Valmont. Although it does not follow the book's plot it is definitely believable and Annette Bening is exactly how I would picture Madame de Mertueil absolutely an angel in public but cunning and deceitful behind the scenes. Colin Firth seems a far more likely Valmont very likeable and difficult for a woman to resist. My only complaint with that film was the lack of consistency in the accents of the characters.".

Cruel Intentions was a loosely based remake of this film which came out 11 years later I enjoyed Cruel Intentions the first time I watched it and have seen it several times since but sadly I didn't enjoy Dangerous Liaisons quite as much.I think the problem here is that I didn't find the story quite as involving it was a bit talky for my liking and if truth be told it was probably a little overplotted as well. In some ways I was also a little turned off by the fact that it featured a bunch of rich aristocrats  I just found it all a little bit pretentious which is why I generally don't like period dramas. Dangerous Liaisons just seemed to amble along without ever really involving me in the story. Cruel Intentions told pretty much the same story in just over 90 minutes and one has to wonder why the writers felt the need for this film to run close to the 2 hour mark? The truth is that there just isn't enough material here to warrant that kind of run time.Another problem I had here was that I never really felt any connections to any of the characters they weren't really fleshed out particularly well and at the end of the day I just felt like I'd spent 2 hours looking at cardboard cutouts in pretty costumes. I also had a bit of an issue with Keanu Reeves character he was the music teacher in this and aside from his wooden performance he added nothing to the film and may as well not have been in it compare that to how important the music teacher was to the plot in Cruel Intentions.Aside from an obviously miscast Keanu Reeves the performances were all excellent with particular praise going to Malkovich Close and Thurman. Thurman was perhaps the biggest revelation and I felt that she accentuated vulnerability and was actually very good.The film doesn't even shine at the end and has a rather formulaic and obvious ending. To me the whole film just felt rather flat and unexciting. I found the ending to Cruel Intentions to be moving and somewhat surprising.Dangerous Liaisons has far too much polish on it for it to be a truly bad film but it's also not involving enough for it to be considered a great film.

	schema:reviewBody "The Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil is a harsh and cold woman who views other women as her rivals as clearly as she holds them publicly close as friends. Victomte Sebastien de Valmont is equally out for the destruction of women but does so by seducing and destroying them. Merteuil turns to Valmont to seduce the chaste Cecile de Volanges thus destroying her marriage but Valmont cannot help and feel that it is all too easy and instead wagers sex with Merteuil against him being able to seduce the notoriously moral Marie de Tourvel.While children flock to the infinitely inferior Cruel Intentions the viewer of more discerning taste will always stick with this classy rich and enjoyable version of Dangerous Liaisons. The plot can be summarised simply but has several strong threads running together to create an involving game of seduction and cruelty. The say the film is nasty and cruel is to perhaps not stress highly enough how enjoyable it is for being so it is done with such a taste for it that it makes it engaging while also being repulsive in the depths the games go to. It develops very satisfyingly and I easily found myself drawn into it. It is to the credit of Hampton's script that I found the characters both horrible but yet also engaging  unlike Cruel Intentions where I just hated their vacuous selfishness and couldn't barely bring myself to care about them enough to even dislike them. No with DL the characters are much stronger and much more appealing while simultaneously managing to be cruel and repulsive.The cast rise to the material and I'm hard pressed to think of a similarly starry cast where all involved turn in such rich performances. Close is maybe not the most obvious of roles but she is all the better for it turning in one of the most deliciously scheming and cruel characters I can recall seeing. With the excesses it is to her credit that she is so subtle and restrained for the majority. Malkovich has more fun with a showier character and makes it look easy where really it is challenging to play such an antihero and keep the audience onside while also pushing them away. Although these two make up the majority of the film the smaller roles are also very well filled. Pfeiffer is brilliant Thurman gets the mix of innocence and sexuality just right and Reeves is well not rubbish. I refrain from giving any credit to Kurtz simply because I think she lost whatever she was due by appearing in the same role in the MTV remake. Frears' direction is great and he makes good use of closeups and other reoccurring techniques he is well supported by his costume and set designers who combine to produce a tangible sense of time and place that is befitting the lavish feel of the whole film.Overall this is a fine film that is driven by so many factors that it is hard to pin down just one. The script is well written and produces an engaging and tasty plot for adults to get into. The characters are both engaging and repulsive and are well delivered by a cast that give roundly strong performances. All this comes together to produce a fantastically cruel film that just shows how poor Cruel Intentions was and what an insult to the intelligence it is.".

Dangerous liaisons' was interesting from beginning to end. I can't believe how incredible this movie was. I like John Malcovich's performance. He showed us his great acting skills. He was certainly well cast to play the main character Vicomte de Valmont. He really envelops himself into the role quite well. What about Glenn Close? I think she was amazing I never thought she could act in films as interesting as this one. This movie is utterly stupendous. Have a look at the scenery in 18th century France where this movie takes place. It's great. I really enjoyed this movie every minute Nevertheless I don't understand why some people said that this movie was too slow. I don't think it was slow. I think it was very fast instead because the movie just lasted two hours. It wasn't definitely that long and slow. Glenn Close must have been the academy award winner for best actress in a leading role. Anyway I think this movie was wonderful. The ending was thoroughly appropriate Look at Glenn Close's face expressions when she's wiping her face and getting tearyeyed for having been ashamed in front of everybody because of what she did. She was certainly mean. This movie shows us that everybody gets what they deserve. She reminds me of Kathryn Sarah Michell Gellar in Cruel intentions. Cruel intentions was Ok however Dangerous liaisons' was much better. I really enjoyed this more than cruel intentions even though it's the same story.As for Michelle Pfieffer What can I say? I think she was wonderful to portray Madame de Tourve. She's a revelation What a tremendous actress!. Her academy award nomination for best actress in a supporting role was very welldeserved. I like the scene as she dies but she dies realizing that Vicomte de Valmont loved her with his whole being. All in all. It's worth watching and beautiful visually the costumes are stunning. I'm glad this movie was overrated. Glenn Close is one of the best actresses I have ever seen. Two thumbs up!! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film numerous times and is has massive obvious appeal. It's visually very beautiful the photography the costumes and so on and I think all of the performances are either good or exceptional I refer to those given by Glenn Close and John Malkovich Who I consider to be one of the finest actors of his generation and a personal favourite. That the principal players are considered to be insufficiently physically attractive for the roles they play I find curious. They are not conventionally attractive and I believe that adds interest authority and an undeniable sense of power to the performances and the way the characters are presented. They are flawed self regarding manipulative bullies whose behaviour is thoroughly vile but they also have enormous appeal. They are driven by a need to control the fate of others but are unable to control their own fate they are equally victims.Conversely the character of Mm. de Tourvel as played by Michelle Pfeiffer is in comparison fairly colourless and uninteresting and her beauty is a hindrance rather than a help. Her soul is presented a pure but it is not of course. She as others caved into her desires when her capacity to resist was sufficiently eroded. Valmont is well aware that he will succeed though he didn't expect to fall in love and thus lose all control of the consequent course of events. For me the weakest performance and the weakest character was that of Cecile Valanges played by Uma Thurman. There is little for her to do and she is not given much of a personality even when one takes into account her young age. A performance which is thoroughly overlooked is that of Peter Capaldi as the Vicomptes clearly devoted manservant. He is aware of his masters nature but is able to see beyond this to the point of developing a love for him. The entire dual scene with Danceny is the most moving in the film when Valmont allows himself to be released from his torment. Particularly moving is the moment when Azolan places Valmont jacket around his deceased body as Danceny looks on apparently filled with a sense of regret. As this is interspersed with Danceny fulfilling Valmonts request to tell the dying Mm. de Tourvels of his immense love for her the poignancy of their respective passing is added to tenfold. It is one of the most moving pieces of film I have seen. It is also the perfect build up to the final scenes in which the Marquise learns of Valmonts death and is so desperately distraught she appears tearing at her own skin before collapsing to the floor. She has lost all control but her character has not lost the sympathy of the audience. She has finally given into her true feelings and is in the process is destroyed. Her final and very public destruction as she looks around only her eyes moving at the baying onlookers at the opera who have through the circulation of correspondence between her and Valmont been made aware of the wicked acts planned and executed by both is an acting triumph. The character is hollow and irreparably broken.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen this film numerous times and is has massive obvious appeal. It's visually very beautiful the photography the costumes and so on and I think all of the performances are either good or exceptional I refer to those given by Glenn Close and John Malkovich Who I consider to be one of the finest actors of his generation and a personal favourite. That the principal players are considered to be insufficiently physically attractive for the roles they play I find curious. They are not conventionally attractive and I believe that adds interest authority and an undeniable sense of power to the performances and the way the characters are presented.

	schema:headline " Unsatisfying adaptation of a great novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Les Liaisons Dangereuses Dangerous Liaisons has been one of my favorite books ever since I read it in a college French class a few years before the movie came out.  It is a novel of dark wit and keen insight into human behavior and psychology.  I was really looking forward to seeing the film. Well to me it was a major disappointment.For one thing I don't think this movie was wellcast.  I like John Malkovich I think he was excellent in In the Line of Fire Places in the Heart and even in a small part in Jennifer Eight but he was the wrong person to play Valmont.  Yes he does a good job of conveying the character's perfidy and viciousness but in my view he was so lacking in charm that he just wasn't very credible as a master seducer not did he come across as smooth and aristocratic the way he should.  It didn't help that at some points the film had him acting more like a frat boy than an aristocrat  like flick his tongue at one of his conquests or sprint up the stairs yelling Success! after scoring with another.Glenn Close was better as Madame de Merteuil but while she captured the duplicity of the Marquise  the surface sweetness concealing an essential ruthlessness  she didn't exude sexual magnetism either.  The only good choices were Michelle Pfeiffer lovely and touching as the beguiled Madame de Tourvel and Swoosie Kurtz in the minor part of Madame de Volanges.  Uma Thurman was mostly forgettable as Cecile and the less said of Keanu Reeves as Danceny the better.SPOILERS COMINGThe screenplay was mostly quite good and the writers did a very successful job of adapting a novel that consisted of exchanges of letters.  I certainly don't fault them for not being 100 faithful to the novel  that often doesn't work on the screen.  However some of the departures from the book didn't work well at all and didn't make much sense.  I cannot for the life of me understand why Cecile's young suitor Danceny was turned into a music teacher.  In the novel he sings duets with Cecile but doesn't teach her. Danceny is an aristocrat and a social equal of the other characters an 18th Century French aristocrat would never have been employed as a music teacher or as anything else for that matter!  Had he been a commoner he never could have challenged Valmont to a duel.Another problem in the novel when Valmont breaks up with Madame de Tourvel at the Marquise's instigation he does so by sending her a casually cruel letter  copying it word for word from the Marquise's letter.  I know it wouldn't have been very dramatic.  However in the film when he announces the breakup to de Tourvel in a facetoface confrontation it takes away some of that casual cruelty... especially since he shows far too much emotion.  Madame de Tourvel would have figured out that something was going on and he didn't really want to dump her.Finally the ending was artificially sweetened.  A dying Valmont asks Danceny to tell Madame de T. that he loved her and that the only true happiness he had ever experienced was with her Danceny goes over to see the ailing Madame de T. and gives her Valmont's message before she dies.  The ending of the novel is far more ambiguous.  While Valmont does profess love for Madame de Tourvel and regret for what he has done to her whether he is sincere or faking it in order to win her over one more time and feed his own ego is left deliberately unresolved. And while he does write her a letter of apology she is delirious when she received it.  There is no consolation for her before she dies.Les Liaisons Dangereuses is still awaiting a worthy screen adaptation. The 1989 film Valmont by Milos Forman wasn't all that good and strayed way too far from the plot of the novel.  Personally I'm inclined to think that the only way justice can be done to the book is in a miniseries of 6 hours or so like the one they recently did of Pride and Prejudice.  It's the only way to capture the novel's psychological subtleties and the subplots that are quite crucial to character development.".

	schema:reviewBody "For ages now ever since I first saw it I absolutely adore this film. I can watch this again and again because it is so well directed acted shoot designed and researched.I have watched it several times and yet I have not discovered any flaws in acting or directing. The flaws usually start to show if you watch something several timesThis is one of the films that gets better each time you watch it as you discover new layers in the story and characters. John Malkovich and Glenn Close are absolutely brilliant as leading characters the Machiavellian duo of 18th century aristocrats. Their acting is immaculate and powerful. Down to the very smallest nuances. This film contains lots of barelythere nuances on characters faces that speak volumes about their background story or true feelings. The nuances on the face of Mrs Merteuil are simply wonderful for a split second when she knows nobody watches her she shows her true face then puts on a most elaborate social mask at the next moment. I absolutely love that S. Frears has not chosen pretty faces for main characters. Some viewers have complained that Malkovich and Glose as principal master seducers aren't looking sexy enough themselves. I think this is a slightly primitive view of the matter. I love the fact that at the beginning they both come across as almost ugly and you think now really? But as the film goes on both become more and more attractive and seductive. Which means sexuality and attractiveness does not come down to pretty face. It is the character soul inside the body that makes it attractive or not. And Mmoiselle Mertuil and Valmont both have this attractiveness of sinful and evil.But one of the masterstrokes of this film is that we eventually see that they are not fully evil that even they have the piece of soul that is sincere suffers and longs for true love. We understand bitbybit that something has happened both to Mertuil and Valmont that has lead them to these evil games and ridiculing true love. Even though true love is what they foremost long they would never admit it. That is why this story is timeless and very much contemporary. As what we see in the contemporary world love specially love between the man and a woman is what is least valued and cared for. Everything else seems to be more important  imago power money success  and people stamp mercilessly over the gift given to them disposing it as something inferior. And forgetting they once were able to love. As for comparison with Milosh Forman film  the latter was OK but not nearly as powerful and deep as Mr Frears'is version. In fact the pretty faces in Forman's film made it more Hollywood creamcakelike. This is not to say actors were bad as I love Colin Firth and Anette Bening but in this film their pretty faces simply did not cut. They were a kind of. too pretty lacking the edge. I think it also the genius of Stephen Frears how the film starts as a light comedy of manners and eventually escalates into a Greek tragedy.All casting was excellent. Some have complained about casting of Keanu Reeves but I do not see why. I thought he like everyone else was spoton for his role. He and Uma Thurman provided some very humorous moments as naive puppylike lovers helpless pray for the sharks. If you liked this film then I assume you would also like Frears'is other masterpiece with a similar theme The Grifters. It is set in the second half of 20 the century in USA and the protagonists are three con artists. It is as good as the Liasons and these two belong to my top five films of all times.".

The Soviet army is the oppressive evil presence. This film was made during the Cold War when Americans saw a line drawn in the sand between communism and capitalist democracy. In the film the Soviets are clearly the bad guys and the Mujahadeen are fighting the good fight. The main character comes to understand this during the film finally telling his Soviet commanding officer that we're the Nazis this time.During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the United States funded supplied and trained Mujahadeen forces. American stinger missiles were used to shoot down Soviet helicopters. The most famous Mujahadeen fighter trained by the United States would come to be Osama bin Laden. He would participate in the fight against the Soviet army much to the approval of the United States. This film pays tribute to the Mujahadeen for valiantly defending themselves against America's enemy. The fact that the United States has invaded Afghanistan makes the film much more interesting to watch. It is ironic that these militants once praised by Hollywood are now our enemies. The lesson this film should teach us now albeit inadvertently is that we should be careful who we glorify and who we vilify. Humans will be humans and will fight for what they believe is right sometimes whether it actually is right or not.".

Each main character struggles at some point with his or her decisions in the face of right and wrong duty and morality. It is the results of these choices that guide the film to transcend the events of war and delve into the universal questions of how and why man struggles with real and painful choices.Although the film does prove to be quite predictable the underlying messages are timeless and well depicted. A moving story with good character development artistically filmed and approached realistically. The brutality and violence of war is not gratuitous and the antiwar message is delivered superbly.I highly recommend this film to all audiences... not just warfilm buffs. With the US presence in Afghanistan today the film should serve to help understand that conflict and this one in regards to the human components that are so often overlooked.A note regarding other user's comments The film was subtitled. It seems that some saw it without the subtitles for some reason. If you are one of those people you really must view it with them. Rent it. I cannot imagine truly understanding the full scope of the film without the benefit of the Afghan dialog. Also the Americanization of the soviet dialog not only serves to draw parallels between that conflict and the Vietnam War but it universalizes the struggles of war and allows the viewer to empathize on a human level not just a political one. In our long human history how often have these basic human conflicts occurred... particularly in times of war and oppression and injustice?".

Since other posters have commented extensively on this movie I'll limit myself to a few comments about those elements others have not addressed.In it my understanding from material I read at the time the movie was in release I saw it in Los Angeles when I was living there in the late 80s that the actors who portrayed Afghanis learned and delivered their lines phonetically.  The fact that the Russians sound like Americans and the Afghans are speaking the language without subtitles is a brilliant dramatic device.  Virtually no one is going to understand what the Afghanis are actually saying but it is possible to get the gist from the context and from body language.  This has the effect of alienating the viewer from the freedom fighters and making them tend to identify with the Russian tank crew.  The movie then operates subversively against this natural tendency throughout the remainder of the story.The hunting of the tank by the Mujahadeen has an almost mythic quality except for the fact that the T62 is real and it has a human crew.  And leading that crew is the tank commander whose entire life was shaped by his experiences in The Great Patriotic War against the Nazis when as an 8yearold he was used by Russian troops in Stalingrad to help kill German tanks.  The commander is as monomaniacal as Ahab but instead of pursuing the whale he is it's animating spirit.There are a lot of layers to this movie  it will definitely repay repeat viewings.".

Stephen Baldwin is even tolerable in this one and this is the only role to date where he shouldn't be killed for his decision to act. Don Harvey is a unsung star as the brake fluid swigging Kaminski and Jason Patric turns in a good perfomance as Koverchenko the moral driver torn between being a good soldier and obeying his instincts. This also qualifies as the best tank movie ever made and the T62 tank that is featured is the real star of the show. I think that the Soviets were using T72 tanks in this particular conflict but I'm just being a little anal. Overall this is one of my top ten and I think that any war movie fan should check this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "That a film as good as The Beast of War is so unknown to the masses is nothing short of criminal. The film is tragic exciting suspenseful and intelligent. From detailed depictions of the Soviet military to the rare glimpse inside the Afghan social structure this film takes the viewer to places that few films have ever dared to venture. The film is compelling on many levels and it will stick with you for a long time after you see it.The film centers around a fiveman Soviet tank crew hopelessly lost in Afghanistan after taking part in a vicious raid on a tiny village. The survivors of the village vow to chase this tank to the edge of the earth in order to achieve badal which is a fancy word for revenge. Steven Bauer of Scarface fame plays their young leader. The tank crew is led by a hardnosed commander who would seemingly trade the lives of his crew for the safety of his tank. He's played by a slimmeddown George Dzundza who you may recognize but not be able to name the other films he's been in. Deer Hunter No Mercy are a couple of them. Also on board is an idealistic young driver played by Jason Patric. He and the commander are at odds from the very beginning and that conflict takes a turn you would never guess at the film's outset. The tank crew and those in pursuit have numerous skirmishes as the film plays out. The film is so wellcrafted that the viewer can emphasize with whatever characters are in the camera lens. We know the Soviets are pigs for the way they have behaved during their invasion but it's amazing to see what the commander will come up with next to keep the tank running fast enough to keep them just ahead of the rebels who are hot on their tail. Scene after scene punctuates the tragic human cost of such an invasion and the devastated lives left in its wake. The film is extraordinarily violent. Director Kevin Reynolds leaves nothing to the imagination regarding the brutality of the Soviet invaders and the destruction that their weapons have brought to Afghanistan. The film is technically astounding in many respects. Filmed in Israel the vast desert landscape is a beautiful but desperate backdrop for a film about the savagery of military conflict. I'll bet you won't be able to get some of the violent images out of your head for days after seeing this film. Nor will you be unable to imagine yourself in the shoes of the tank crew completely cut off from help and at the mercy of a merciless commander and an unforgiving desert. George Dzundza walks away with the film from an acting perspective. How about his line regarding their standing orders once the tank has been disabled by the rebels? As he passes out grenades to the remaining crew members he utters the unforgettable dogma Out of commission become a pillbox out of ammo become a bunker out of time become heroes....See this film. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

As he passes out grenades to the remaining crew members he utters the unforgettable dogma Out of commission become a pillbox out of ammo become a bunker out of time become heroes....See this film. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.";

	schema:headline " The Soviets Lost In Afghanistan";
	schema:reviewBody "The only movie that I am aware of that deals explicitly with the Soviet war in Afghanistan The Beast is also a fascinating example of an American made war movie that features absolutely no American characters. The conflict here is totally between a group of local Afghan mujahideen and the crew of a lost Soviet tank struggling to find their way out of a valley in which they're trapped. The image of the lost tank may well be a symbolic representation of the wider war  the Soviet Union being hopelessly lost in Afghanistan. The movie features a fairly graphic portrayal of the horrors of the battle from the point of view of both sides as well as of the growing weariness of the Soviets who  with the exception of their gungho and somewhat insane commander  want nothing more than to get out of this country as fast as possible. The mood of the movie is complemented perfectly by the starkness of the desert landscape. Opening with an example of an atrocity by the tank crew against the inhabitants of a small Afghan village the movie follows the mujahideen as they seek revenge against their invaders.The performances in this movie were absolutely firstrate headed by a fantastic piece of work by George Dzundza as the insane commander Daskal who willingly kills his own men if he takes a dislike to them and who refuses a chance to escape via a Soviet helicopter that chances upon the lost crew choosing instead to get out with his tank and his crew. Jason Patric was equally good as Koverchenko a member of the tank crew who finally turns against Daskal and eventually finds himself aligned with the mujahideen in a quest for his own personal revenge against Daskal.The Russians in this movie speak English thankfully without fake accents while the Afghans speak whatever their particular native language is with subtitles which suggests to me that the Russians and how they respond to their increasingly hopeless situation are the focal point of the movie. I approach this type of movie with a bit of a grain of salt. American movies that depicted the Soviet Union in the 1980's tended to be a little bit over the top in their portrayal of the Soviet Union as Ronald Reagan's evil empire. Still there's no doubt that the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan was a rather brutal affair and this seemed a not unreasonable depiction of it. Truly one of the better war movies I've ever seen. 910".

My uncle served in action in Afganistan for soviets as commando. Although he isn't Russian and had little respect as most Latvians to soviets he's never disrespected his army fellows or combating officers.Starting action was pretty made up as well as for village blowing purposes soviets would use choppers not tanks. Tanks was used in protecting roads and securing routes. Operatons was mainly carried out by solders and armored vehicles  BTR's. Tanks could be used as support but there is no way massive tank attack would be enforced without commandos on foot or vehicles guarding them as it was shown well armament has always been a virtue for soviet commanders not soldiers.But as I already said in general this movie is totally worth to see.".

	schema:headline " A well crafted and beautifully stylized film with a great story slightly marred by some unlikely elements";
	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie on DVD for five dollars in the bargain bin at Walmart and thought it looked interesting.  The Beast is the DVD title but this movie is also known as The Beast of War.  This film revolves around the story of five Russians whose tank is separated from the others when the Soviet Union invades Afghanistan in 1981.  The commander of the tank is a cruel and ruthless man played by George Dzunda.  Possible Spoilers Ahead Jason Patric portrays a tank man who  begins to despise the cruelty of his commander and question the purpose of the invasion.  The commander shoots one of the men in the back and claims he was a traitor.  There is infighting and even hatred amongst the four remaining men on the tank.  The men need to get their tank through a pass to escape Afghanistan and get back to the safety of Russia.  The tension mounts as the Afghans close in on them with the intent of destroying the Soviet tank. The contempt the 'tank men' have for each other intensifies and betrayal and death ensue. I was pleasantly surprised by The Beast  It is first rate entertainment. However please be forewarned that it does have a couple of scenes which are not for the squeamish and the cruelty which the Russians display when they invade an Afghan village in the opening scenes are tough to watch.  On the other hand the photography is breathtaking and I was vividly transported to the rugged terrain of Afghanistan while watching this film.  I don't know how else to describe the camera work on this film other than liquid and silky smooth.  It stood out so much that I must comment on the skill of it. The acting was almost uniformly great with perhpas one exception of Stephen Baldwin which was just ok.  George Dzundza Jason Patric and Steven Bauer each had full command of their characters and made them believable with Dzundza and Patric being the standouts.  You should be aware however that the likelihood of this story occurring exactly as it was told especially some of the dialogue between the tank men and the basically liberal American reasoning of Patric's character seem extremely unlikely.  Nonetheless the story is well crafted and drew me effortlessly into it.  This film is well worth watching.  I rate it 86100 points.".

	schema:reviewBody "Systems exist so we never meet each other.  Mr. Lif This is a review of Rambo 3 The Living Daylights and The Beast three action movies from the late 1980s now interesting for the way in which they toe the Pentagon line regarding Afghanistan's Mujahideen.The best of the three films Rambo 3 stars Sylvester Stallone as a Vietnam veteran who lives in a monastery looks depressed pumps iron and wears a mullet. Though now a pacifist Rambo nevertheless returns for one last job. His old Colonel has been kidnapped by evil Soviets forces and is being imprisoned in a super cool looking military base deep within the heart of Afghanistan. Rambo's mission? Get in kick ass get out. As he's essentially a giant walking penis Rambo severely overcompensates. Not only does he rescue his buddy but he kicks Russia out of Afghanistan rallies a band of friendly Mujahideen freedom fighters teaches locals to love Westerners and schools us all in the evils of communism. The film ends with a title card praising the brave heroes of the Mujahideen.The Living Daylights tells the same tale though here our hero is British Secret Agent James Bond Timothy Dalton. Less homoerotic than Stallone's film but equally patriotic Daylights opens with various totems of Britannia  the Rock of Gibraltar Union Jacks Harrier jets  before nosediving into a plot about defecting Russians Afghan opium and evil commies.

	onyx:emotionText "Systems exist so we never meet each other.  Mr. Lif This is a review of Rambo 3 The Living Daylights and The Beast three action movies from the late 1980s now interesting for the way in which they toe the Pentagon line regarding Afghanistan's Mujahideen.The best of the three films Rambo 3 stars Sylvester Stallone as a Vietnam veteran who lives in a monastery looks depressed pumps iron and wears a mullet. Though now a pacifist Rambo nevertheless returns for one last job. His old Colonel has been kidnapped by evil Soviets forces and is being imprisoned in a super cool looking military base deep within the heart of Afghanistan. Rambo's mission? Get in kick ass get out. As he's essentially a giant walking penis Rambo severely overcompensates. Not only does he rescue his buddy but he kicks Russia out of Afghanistan rallies a band of friendly Mujahideen freedom fighters teaches locals to love Westerners and schools us all in the evils of communism. The film ends with a title card praising the brave heroes of the Mujahideen.The Living Daylights tells the same tale though here our hero is British Secret Agent James Bond Timothy Dalton. Less homoerotic than Stallone's film but equally patriotic Daylights opens with various totems of Britannia  the Rock of Gibraltar Union Jacks Harrier jets  before nosediving into a plot about defecting Russians Afghan opium and evil commies.

	schema:reviewBody "The year 1981. The event The Soviet invasion on Afghanistan. The two sides fighting The Soviet Army versus the Mujahadeen supplied by the United States Army. Kevin Reynolds's The Beast tells the story of an Mujahadeen group with a mission to capture and destroy a Soviet war tank or as they call The Beast. And what these nomadic soldiers didn't expected was that an Soviet soldier would help them in this mission.The Soviet side is led by Daskal George Dzundza in a non typical role of bad guy an tyrannical commander leading a minor group of men in the desert trying to reach Kandahar. After a group of people of a small attack his tank he and his soldiers capture a man and kill him by running over with the tank. In his crew there's two noble souls an Afghan translator Erick Avari and the young soldier Konstantin Koverchenko Jason Patric. This last one realizes that his commander is totally out of control and he knows that something very wrong can happen. Konstantin is a guy who play by the rule even keeping notes over his colleagues bad behaviors. After many baseless suspicions of treason Daskal kills the translator making Konstantin very angered. As result the soldier is tied up on a rock as a punishment for being insubordinate to his commander. But luck is on his side and he's rescued by the Mujahadeen. Now even without speaking their language he only knows a term of friendship that he learned with the translator he finds new friends or better saying allies with one common goal destroy the tank. In short the old saying worked here The enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Mujahadeen group is led by Taj Steven Bauer excellent performance he speaks in a total different language only using a few words in English a very brave and faithful leader seeking for revenge and he's become Konstantin's best friend in this reckless war.Released in 1988 this film wasn't a box office hit and it's almost an unknown work from director Kevin Reynolds Waterworld. Back in the 1980's is one of the rare films about the Afghanistan War it's a work of fiction along with Rambo III. But it's a very original film with action scenes and a political criticism little things and also a story about how mankind acts in times of war. Two different groups with different cultures can understand each other with only a few words as it was showed here. But what this war was it for? Why did it happened? The titles at the beginning of the film doesn't inform us of why it happened. After watching this movie you might think that everything here was pointless because all you see is the desert the killings and a tank. No it's more than that. It shows that wars don't have meaningless stupid brutal and always kills innocent people the people of the village in the beginning of the movie. It's also about honor. Konstantin was told by the translator that in Afghanistan people has three words that an enemy can show to them and with these words he will be saved. It's a promise an honor trade cultivated by the tribes. And that's how he was saved and he learned to trust his old enemies.Desite the cruelty shown at the beginning the scene involving the tank and the guy crushed by it was very impressive it's a excellent movie easy to sit through very entertaining for audiences who like war films and a thought provoking film for those who enjoy a good criticism about honor cruel commanders loyalty and wrath of gods. I really don't know if it works for today audiences after the plot is dated there's no more Cold War and Afghanistan is not much on the side that can be cheered after 911 but that's another story. Watch it and think about it. 1010".

The cast and the tank perform beautifully giving it a gut wrenching feel that grips you hard and keeps you on the edge of your seat! The movie shows the tank's strenghs as well as it's weaknesses. In my opinion Daskal is the true beastGoliath  not the tank itself. Putting it in other term's Daskal is the mad master and the tank is the brainless blaster.

Possibly the stealer of the show is the T62 tank that is used. Not only is it shown from the inside out you get to see it shoot move everything. What other movie has that?

Roubaud is a train conductor on the same railroad that Lantier works on married to the much younger Sverine. When Roubaud catches wind of his wife's affair with her godfather the wealthy M. Grandmorin he kills him during a train journey in a fit of jealousy. He makes sure that Sverine is also present making her an accomplice to murder. Lantier despite having witnessed them quite clearly in the train corridor hides the fact during the investigation as he is attracted to Sverine. They both begin an affair all the while Roubaud becomes increasingly withdrawn and starts to gamble. Sverine urges Lantier to kill her husband so that they would be free but she is unaware of Lantier's unfortunate condition.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jean Renoir's La Bte Humaine is an excellent screen adaptation of mile Zola's novel which also contains some excellent photography and a fine performance by lead actor Jean Gabin.  While usually overshadowed by Renoir's other more justifiably celebrated masterpieces in itself it is a very good picture with Zola's ideas and characters providing ideal material for the great director.Most likely the reason why La Bte Humaine is less appreciated than Renoir's other works is because it is so closely tied to the novel  which itself is actually part of a series of novels.  Someone not familiar with Zola would find it harder to understand some of the action especially the behavior of the main character railway engineer Jacques Lantier Gabin. There is a brief message at the opening of the film explaining the basic theme but it would hardly be possible to bring an audience completely uptodate with just a short note.The novel on which the film is based is part of a series of 20 novels that Zola wrote which cover the history of a single family through several generations and through several decades of 19thcentury French history. Each of these stories is capable of standing on its own but they are more satisfying if you know at least something of the broader context.  La Bte Humaine is one of the last few volumes in the series and accordingly it largely assumes a familiarity with the basic themes.  Zola had two main concerns in these novels i to show how certain family traits positive and negative reappear in successive generations and ii to show how the lives of a particular family reflect events and trends in French society as a whole.  Zola was a naturalistic writer  he had a strong sense of identification with and sympathy for his characters but he also portrayed his characters and his country in an uncompromising light just as they were.There are at least a couple of ways that this context helps better to appreciate the film version of La Bte Humaine.  First Jacques Lantier comes from a branch of the family that was particularly plagued with mental instability.  He has many positive qualities but also is tormented by barelysuppressed violent urges.  Gabin does an excellent job as he always does of portraying his character but some of it is lost if the viewer is unaware of who he is supposed to be.  Second the railway setting interesting in its own right is meant to be suggestive of other forces both within Lantier's mind and also outside of his life.  The action in this story is supposed to have taken place in about 1870 a tumultuous time in French history.All of this comes together in the outstanding opening sequence which shows Lantier's train rushing across the countryside.  The beautiful photography and skillful editing help us to feel as if we were in the train with him and all of this is supposed to suggest not just the setting of the story to come but also the powerful forces  both inside Lantier and outside of him  which he cannot control.All of the subsequent plot developments  interesting and sometimes surprising in themselves  build on this foundation.  This is nicely and carefully done even if some of it is unfortunately lost if the viewer does not know a little of the wider context.".

Simone Simon's Severine Roubaud can and should be seen as the precursor of such similar characters as Jane Greer's Kathie Moffett in the film noir classic Out of the Past 1947 almost ten years later. Both are highly complex characters with dangerous sexuality and a totally amoral view of life. Both make it very difficult to distinguish between truth and fiction in what they say to us. Simone Simon plays the Jean Gabin character like a welltuned musical instrumentand Jane Greer's Kathie is no less successful in manipulating Robert Mitchum's character. Both are beautiful childlike at times feminine at other times very different than what they seem to be seductive to an extreme and in the enddestined to experience the consequences of a life not well lived.La Bete Humaine can be enjoyed on its own terms as a seminal example of great French film drama of the 1930s. However its more important message is to give us an early illustration of the origins of Hollywood film noir's femme fatale.Next time you wonder where all those deadly dangerous female predators came from in American film noir check out La Bete Humaine.

A train engineer by the name of Jacques spies upon them and not only does this man not turn the couple in he falls in love with Severine. The film plays out much a like an entry from the film noir style that was popular in the forties and fifties. The dark tone and the story which deals with atrocities gives the film that feel and as a fan of film noir I found this pleasing. Nobody in the cast stands out above the rest really but nobody can be singled out for not delivering a fine performance either and the ensemble comes together well on the whole in that respect. It's evident that this film was made only shortly after the silent film era as the music is overdone and at times undermines the dialogue in certain scenes. Jean Renoir deserves the title of one of the best French directors ever to grace the director's chair as his direction is superb and his list of directorial credits echoes this fact.

There is a major very serious editing flaw in the version shown on Sundance that i wanted people to be aware of as i think it makes a significant impact on the total effect of the film.WARNING SPOILER AHEADWhen Jean Gabin's character Lantier murders his love Severine it is within the frame of a song.  The characters and their friends have gone to a railroad party.  Lantier and Severine both leave early and end up at her house.  As they are talking the film cuts back and forth between an entertainer at the party singing a song called Ninette which actually describes the Severine character.  during the course of the song Lantier is compelled by his inner demons to murder the unsuspecting Severine.  when the murder is done the shots cut back and  forth between the singer at the party with this song describing the coquettish Ninette and shots of the lifeless body off Severine.  It's very chilling and has tremendous impact. We then see a shot of Lantier in a mirror looking at himself with revulsion  he looks so strangely in this shot.  this scene ends with the singer finishing the song rather prissily to the applause of the partygoers.  the next scene begins with Lantier walking in a daze down the railroad track. the problem with the Sundance copy of the film is that it only includes one brief shot of this whole really critical climatic scene  a very brief glimpse of Lantier in the mirror  and the whole scene loses tremendous power.  we don't see any of the alternating shots between the party singer and Severine's lifeless form.  this is very disturbing both because it wrecked the climatic scene in the movie itself and because i wondered what else may have been cut from this movie that i didn't remember so well  or what might be cut from other movies that again  i just may not recall or have seen.  those that have not seen this movie would not notice the edits sadly.   Sundance may not have done these edits themselves in fact that is highly unlikely but they should know they are showing a regrettably and poorly edited film and should try to obtain complete copy which do exist as i've seen it.    I'm probably going to write directly to Sundance as well as this is one of my favorite films I would suggest you go forth and do likewise. ".

We then see a shot of Lantier in a mirror looking at himself with revulsion  he looks so strangely in this shot.  this scene ends with the singer finishing the song rather prissily to the applause of the partygoers.  the next scene begins with Lantier walking in a daze down the railroad track. the problem with the Sundance copy of the film is that it only includes one brief shot of this whole really critical climatic scene  a very brief glimpse of Lantier in the mirror  and the whole scene loses tremendous power.  we don't see any of the alternating shots between the party singer and Severine's lifeless form.  this is very disturbing both because it wrecked the climatic scene in the movie itself and because i wondered what else may have been cut from this movie that i didn't remember so well  or what might be cut from other movies that again  i just may not recall or have seen.  those that have not seen this movie would not notice the edits sadly.   Sundance may not have done these edits themselves in fact that is highly unlikely but they should know they are showing a regrettably and poorly edited film and should try to obtain complete copy which do exist as i've seen it.    I'm probably going to write directly to Sundance as well as this is one of my favorite films I would suggest you go forth and do likewise. ";

Both films are based on Zolas story and obviously the merit is Renoirs since his version is much better. The psychological and deep meaning beneath the coolness of the main character Jacques Lantier in a Gabin memorable performance is handled superbly so is his troubled relation with Simones character. Despite some boring shots the photography and screenplay are gems and Bete Humaine ends up being a great addition to Renoirs filmography.

	schema:reviewBody "After having seen Human Desire which was an American version of this film based on a novel by Emile Zola I knew full well that the French version would be a lot closer to what Zola was writing about. What he was writing about was sex and how it can really put men in a jackpot. It puts two of them there in this film.The actual Zola novel is set in the 19th century and the climax takes place on a train carrying munitions to the front during the Franco Prussian War. La Bete Humaine is moved up and it takes place in 1938 France and it opens with Jean Gabin driving a train on the run from Paris to Le Havre. The supervisor of the station is Fernand Ledoux and he's got one young minx of a wife in Simone Simon.Ledoux gets himself in a situation with a rich man who can make trouble for him on his job. But Simon's got some influence with an even richer dude. But that's not the way Ledoux wants to keep his job. She's a no good woman Simon but Ledoux is obsessed with her.So much so that he wants to kill Jacques Berlioz the rich man who Simon bopped. And he conceives of a plan to kill him on the train and forces Simon to go with him. The crime comes off but Gabin is a passenger on the train who just happened to be out in the corridor and can place at least Simon at the crime scene.He keeps his mouth shut because he too becomes obsessed with her. American film fans will remember her from Val Lewton's Cat People and from The Devil And Daniel Webster where she's the temptress sent from hell to seduce James Craig. She's Mary Poppins in those roles next to the one she plays in La Bete Humaine. Then again the French did not have the omnipresent American Code to deal with.Emile Zola when he wasn't defending Alfred Dreyfus as the American film of his life concentrated on wrote novels just like this dealing with realistic human weaknesses. I have to wonder who were the real life models for the characters he created. Of course it all ends rather badly for everyone all around.Jean Renoir's whole ambiance in this film was gray and rainy so rainy you would think it was London instead of Paris. The scenes in the railroad yards were realistically depicted. I think they served as a blueprint for what John Frankenheimer did in The Train.As for Gabin's character he's a man with issues of his own and plays it quite different than Glenn Ford did in Human Desire. Fritz Lang who directed Human Desire had to deal with Code parameters. I think he'd have preferred to do the same film Renoir did.Best to see La Bete Humaine back to back with Human Desire. I have no doubt which one you'll rate better.".

	schema:headline " A Review Admittedly Bothered By Outside Influences";
	schema:reviewBody "The two most noted elements of Jean Renoir's classic poetic realist precursor to film noir are indeed the two elements I felt worked more as ends in themselves than seminal features of the story. They are the use of the train as one of the film's main characters as Renoir himself describes and the characterization of Simone Simon's femme fatale. There is genuinely palpable sensory vibrance in the extensive bookending sequences of Jacques played by Jean Gabin and his best friend utterly obsessed by manning a steaming chugging locomotive as it speeds down railroads in and out of pitch black tunnels and blackens their faces with the smoke it incessantly pumps into the sky. The flames of the furnace the peripheral landscape speeding by. We have the feeling not of watching reality but of being occupied by it a feeling prolonged as we experience as if for the first time the impact of abruptly emerging from a tunnel ultimately screeching to a halt in the linear spectacle of a vast rail yard.I suppose the speeding train is supposed to spark the fierce percussion that outlines the film. Other than these two extended set pieces La Bete Humaine is a succession of mercurial sketches. It all flows from labor and of the limited time stolen from labor. It's a film of hurried transitions where all appear to be perpetually passing through doors or climbing stairs or peering out windows. Volumes are spoken when the seductive wife of one of Jacques' colleagues is greeted into her lustful godfather's study while the door is warily closed behind her. A reckless Jacques flees the dance hall unobserved by the dancers engrossed in their ecstasy. I was intrigued that we see the moments before and after all the murders and seductions but not they themselves. So many crisp exchanges of glances. The blackening impact of a wife's chance admission is found in the way she and her aggressively jealous husband can't bear to look each other in the eye.Uncharacteristically of me I found the remake much more affecting. Fritz Lang's Human Desire is to me the stronger film in terms of character. La Bete Humaine gets its themes across in its own restless way but the result is lightweight in effect while Lang's 1954 version is unyielding in depicting the spiritual isolation of the characters. He punctuates the dramatic action with threatening shots of the many railroad tracks interlacing and breaking away. He needs not brandish any certainty of intention for them to act as metaphor for the characters' paths tying themselves in knots. Lang remained in the shadows as a more effective way of showcasing a distinctive style. Straitjacketing its insight and intensity Human Desire is the more resonating parable for the shadows of human rationale and the distortion of the heart and of desperate characters who lead disappointed lives.Renoir cast Simone Simon as the adulterous wife at the center of Emile Zola's falling house of cards. He posits that the cute innocent kittenish women are the ones to watch out for because you are so enamored with their sweet and endearing nature that you would never suspect them of manipulating you. Well that is very true. All of us men and women alike have encountered a female of this deceptive kind. She is a femme fatale in her own right. But Simon remains in the role of an exotic object rather than meeting the male characters on their own level the way Gloria Grahame does in Human Desire. Grahame was always seductive enough to make you crazy but so audacious. There wasn't a demure bone in her ferociously sexy body but that made her even more effectively cunning and guileful. She came at her male puppets headlong and matched their presence as well as their wits.Grahame and Glenn Ford remain sympathetic in their own respective ways though one is in some sense a champion and the other is an adversary just like Gabin and Simon here but Grahame and Ford evoke a more lucid understanding of their desires and in the face of the cruelty and ruthlessness in getting what they want regardless of how far they unravel each other's darkest colors despite the scorpionlike sidestepping around their flirtatious relationship. Accordingly Human Desire is a boldly familiarizing study of the sense of right and wrong achieving its shadowy effect by aiming for your heart and loins rather than only your cerebrum. The development of the drama in La Bete Humaine could be totaled in roughly ten or fifteen closeups. Renoir just bulks up the lonesome hardships of his three central characters in a wholly animated world of locations and things. If one doesn't totally take in the materiality of the rail yards rooming quarters and dance halls the incessant coming and going on platforms and in corridors the buzz and capricious commotion grinding amidst any personal dilemmas we can barely be so involved in the uninvited and unconscionable devastation brought down on the three jinxed protagonists.At any rate in its own right La Bete Humaine is a fine piece of stylized realism about disillusionment done with an embellished aestheticism that while it draws more attention to its representational elements is still what gave Renoir's great films Grand Illusion and The River such beauty humor and vitality. It is best to see this film unfettered by Fritz Lang's later adaptation to take into account all of the fixations of its own time and culture without any outside influences to see it as its own human beast.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this classic adaptation of Emile Zola's novel a tortured train engineer Jean Gabin falls in love with a troubled married woman Simone Simon who has helped her husband commit a murder.Renoir confessed that at the time when he wrote the screenplay he had not read Zola's novel in over 25 years While I was shooting I kept modifying the scenario bringing it closer to Zola ... the dialogue which I gave Simone Simon is almost entirely copied from Zola's text. Since I was working at top speed I'd reread a few pages of Zola every night to make sure I wasn't overlooking anything. Now I never read the novel at all and I suspect most who have seen the film have not either. Perhaps this could be a strike against it but it seems to me that the more obscure the novel the more liberty you can take. Zola may not be obscure but certainly not the big name he once was.The fact this is considered a precursor to film noir make it all the more interesting.

	onyx:emotionText "In this classic adaptation of Emile Zola's novel a tortured train engineer Jean Gabin falls in love with a troubled married woman Simone Simon who has helped her husband commit a murder.Renoir confessed that at the time when he wrote the screenplay he had not read Zola's novel in over 25 years While I was shooting I kept modifying the scenario bringing it closer to Zola ... the dialogue which I gave Simone Simon is almost entirely copied from Zola's text. Since I was working at top speed I'd reread a few pages of Zola every night to make sure I wasn't overlooking anything. Now I never read the novel at all and I suspect most who have seen the film have not either. Perhaps this could be a strike against it but it seems to me that the more obscure the novel the more liberty you can take. Zola may not be obscure but certainly not the big name he once was.The fact this is considered a precursor to film noir make it all the more interesting. Indeed it has all the grit of a noir and the murder aspects make it appropriate to be put in the genre. I suppose it could be called this... now I am curious what other films are considered precursors and at what point the genre came into its own.";

It ask the question What makes a person to kill another human being?It's a very inspiring film and I have not seen Fritz Lang's version of the film.

The last time I saw it on the big screen was about 5 or 6 years ago when a small art house devoted one day to a Jean Gabin trilogy and I felt strongly that the other two Quai des Brumes and Le jour se Leve left this one for dead. Three Jean Gabin films were released in 1938 this one Quai des Brumes and Recif de corail in which he was again teamed with Michel Morgan but even a screenplay by Charles Spaak couldn't do much for a hackneyed plot. The great Julien Carette on the other hand who scores heavily here as Pecqueux had nine films released that year and managed a better batting average than Gabin. It's hard to put one's finger on the problem possibly it helps if you've read the book part of a cycle of nine novels by Emile Zola but given the ratio of the reading public to the cinema going public that's not really good enough an adaptation of even the largest selling novel should be accessible to nonreaders. In my case an aversion to the Simone Simons of this world probably didn't help the wideeyed littlegirl who expects hotblooded men to roll over and play dead every time she looks cute will I suppose always be with us witness Simon's natural successors Goldie Hawn and Vanessa Paradis but I was unable to detect even a tissue of sexual chemistry between Gabin and Simon though other viewers may disagree. Nor was I able to swallow easily Gabin's uncontrollable and inexplicable 'rages'  apparently the novel offers a 'hereditary' theory. On the other hand Gabin is always highly watchable Fernand Ledoux little known outside France is an excellent actor and Julien Carrette is beyond praise. The film is now available in another trio format a threeDVD package of Jean Renoir films and once again the other two Le Crime de Monsiour Lange and La Grande Illusion leave this one standing.".

In Jean Renoir's 'The Human Beast 1938' the noir mould thematically if not stylistically is virtually complete.

To protect herself the wife quickly seduces Lantier and attempts to maneuver him into murdering her abusive and controlling husband. The following year Renoir produced 'The Rules of the Game 1939' as a pleasant film about a society that he believed had become rotten. There's no such pleasantness to be found in 'The Human Beast' in which even the prettiest most innocentlooking woman is capable of evil in an introduction recorded in 1967 Renoir remarks that he chose Simone Simon for the role precisely because she seemed perfectly innocuous.Simone Simon gracefully seductive in her natural tongue as opposed to her stunted English in 'Cat People 1942' is a classic femme fatale. Jean Gabin's performance is also good though his character is afflicted with an unlikely psychological condition for no sensible reason Lantier occasionally feels the need to throttle the women in his life a psychosis that is so poorly explored beyond vague allusions to a family history of alcoholism that it serves merely as a clumsy plot device. Throughout the film Lantier spends large amounts of time with his locomotive La Lison which is lovingly photographed in action during a wordless opening sequence. Renoir intended the train to be interpreted as a third party in a twisted love triangle also involving Lantier and Sverine. However I never really got the sense that the train was a major animate character perhaps this was more clearly established in mile Zola's 1890 novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have yet to read any of the works of Zola but I am familiar with what he wrote about in his time in a modern drama class I took  he was part of a naturalistic movement in literature and theater that tried to take relationship stories to another area or at least to one that might have been frowned upon with some of the overt sensuality and questioning of the roles of men and women. But for Jean Renoir he takes the basic elements that were in Zola's work and gives the film a great spirit a tale of falling in love murder heartbreak among the working class. Although it is moreso a melodrama at times the acting isn't overwrought or 'bad' in the slightest Jean Gabin is perfect in his role of Jacques Lantier an engineer working on the trains who has a problem sometimes from his family's alcoholic history. Simone Simon is a good choice for Simone Simon a woman with a troubled past and with love almost improbable at times. And Fernand Ledoux is a fine antagonist Roubaud husband to Simone and with some problems of his own.The power of the story comes through the use of the image of the seeming simplicity of Renoir's style. Above anything else in the three films of his I have seen from his late 30's period Grand Illusion this film and The Rules of the Game I can tell that Renoir is first and foremost a master at storytelling and probably improving on a story. Coinciding with Zola the dialog he uses for the characters is very real even transcending the time period for today. One could imagine this story in any time period which also links up to the filmnoir element or more appropriately the sort of 'romantic' filmnoir that one might find in the work of James M. Cain. It's a crime story that involves really no 'criminals' but working people who have hit some bad personal times.But along with Renoir being more than able to tell the story many of the images are memorable even indelible at times. The way he opens the film with a kind of montage of trains is sensational. And towards the climax as Lantier faces a dire internal conflict on the train Renoir rushes past in a straightforward POV shot as the train chugs ahead. And specific shots too make the point very clear even in a bad print like the one I saw it in for example when Lantier and Simone first have their push and pull romantic moment it leads to the first signs of Lantier's mental instability and I wouldn't reveal anything else except to say that it's quite emotional it arises again at a point I won't say either. Certain conventions end up working their way into the film and the ending may seem to be a little too much. But overall I was extremely pleased with this film the directions it took and the emotional reach it had on me. It's a story of people who need love and can never seem to get a grasp of it in a world of deception and strife.".

The beginning sequence on the train is brilliant with the awesome power noise and smoke really setting the tone. Unfortunately the rest of the film didn't live up to this beginning. There are issues that stem back to Zola himself whose theories about the blood line of a family being poisoned by its ancestors were pseudoscientific at best. The result is that it's hard to believe the violence that at times suddenly possesses the character of Lantier Jean Gabin. Simone Simon is a treat to watch and suitably underhanded in her dealings with men but there is something too cool  too lacking in real passion  about the movie as a whole. The two male performances  Gabin's and that of Fernand Ledoux Simon's jealous husband  are flat. Zola believed that love and death possessing and killing are the dark foundations of the human soul and while all of these things are represented by director Jean Renoir they don't always feel authentic.Also I don't mean to go off on a the book was better than the movie rant particularly as the novel itself wasn't Zola's best work but I would point out that one of the more memorable parts in it was the slow poisoning taking place in a house near a train crossing and this was a story line that was one of those excised by Renoir. He is also sloppy about other parts of the novel and when I read later that his screenplay was rushed and that when he started filming he hadn't read the novel in 25 years I wasn't surprised. It's not horrible by any means and in some of the train imagery you can see Renoir's influence on films like 1985's Runaway Train with Jon Voigt but it fails to live up to its potential.".

They are different and I liked them both with both having subtle and pertinent differences all good. This one is a French film and one must take that into consideration when watching for this very important reason. It is not uncommon for the French culture to support marriage and at the same time having a lover on the side too. This applies to both spouses and not necessarily endorsed or supported but perhaps tolerated for reasons I don't care to explore. With that in mind the movie has more meaning in certain scenes. I enjoyed the trains of old and who doesn't like a good movie with trains in them? Objectively speaking it is shocking what men and women will do when it comes to sex and lust. Nothing is off the table when the desires of the flesh are activated and then unleashed. Many a murder robbery and perversion is done in this mindset and for those few moments people literally go out of their minds lose all reason and let their inner beasts out to play and cause harm. Once completed shame and guilt visit until either one repents changes in the Greek or has to have another fix. Being addicted to dysfunction is a curse and can only end one way. Repentance on the other hand leads one to a better way and literally away from the fallen deed or mishap. This principal is acted out and shown quite well in this movie. Good sandwich French bread movie and a tasty drink with some chocolate recommended while watching. The nature of the human always makes for good story telling".

A previous reviewer slammed this movie for its antiJapanese propaganda. Perhaps a slight bit of history would help. Statisitically an American POW was FOUR times likely to die as a prisoner of the Japanese than of the Germans. The end of the war saved the lives of thousands of Americans because their treatment in Japanese camps was so horrifying. Six foot tall sailors weighing 100 pounds was not an uncommon site. The same Japanese military also starved its own people in places like Okinawa to feed itself and I would hope that all people would now be familiar with the 'rape of Nanking' so what was called propaganda was more just the way of the world at the time. This is one reason that the people who fought for America during World War II are revered and treasured so much.".

Statisitically an American POW was FOUR times likely to die as a prisoner of the Japanese than of the Germans. The end of the war saved the lives of thousands of Americans because their treatment in Japanese camps was so horrifying. Six foot tall sailors weighing 100 pounds was not an uncommon site. The same Japanese military also starved its own people in places like Okinawa to feed itself and I would hope that all people would now be familiar with the 'rape of Nanking' so what was called propaganda was more just the way of the world at the time. This is one reason that the people who fought for America during World War II are revered and treasured so much.";

Then there was John Garfield who spoke for all of us when he branded Japan as a police state. Dane Clark was very good if somewhat emotional And Charlie of the Angels John Forsythe made his debut and he too was good. There was some propaganda but really not that much.

I saw a in previous review where a reader said that the movie stared Alan Hale before he went on to Captain his own boat in Gilligan's Island. It's actually Alan Hale Sr. who's in Destination Tokyo and Alan Hale Jr. who's in Gilligan's Island. Cary Grant does a good job as Captain and I enjoyed the drama of Torpedoman Adams getting hit with an appendicitis while the sub is in Tokyo Bay. It also showed that people die during a war. The sub took quite a beating from depthcharges as well as discussing the fear that some men would have had. It was also interesting how they incorporated the Col. James Dolittle raid into the movie. It seemed a little more realistic than in Pearl Harbor. Overall a pretty good movie.".

Part of this is the excellent acting and direction and part of this must be the result in writing an unusual plot for a submarine movie. Instead of just blowing up Japanese ships the crew is ordered to sneak into Tokyo Bay. The tension as a result of this slow covert mission is incredible. About the only negative I can think of for the film is that there are more shots of toy subs AND the sides of the back lot pool in it than usual. Most sub films if you look carefully were filmed in these pools and the sides of the pool can occasionally be seen. However the number of times you see the shot is fake is higher than normal so it reduces my rating slightly.FYItry watching OPERATION PACIFIC 1951 after you see this film. In this sub movie the crew trades movies with another sub crew so they can be entertained on their long missions. They trade a cowboy flick and are given DESTINATION TOKYO. Later one of the crew members remarks that he liked the film but it was REALLY SHORT ON REALISM!! That's funny huh?!".

That is to say every cliche in the book very nicely buffed and some of which had not yet become cliches.The cast is workmanlike and no one disappoints.  Cary Grant is a bit hard to swallow as some dude from Oklahoma City but okay.  Let's see.  Among the rest of the crew we have John Garfield as a wolf and a wise guy from New York.  Then there is Dakota presumably from Dakota.  The green new kid who looks too tall to be in such a cramped space who endures some friendly hazing from the more experienced and who eventually wins his spurs.  There is the atheist who undergoes a religious conversion under stress.  There is the avuncular older man who takes other crew members under his wing.  An underappreciated comedic cook.  The ubiquitous James Ridgely as an aerology officer.  And let me think I believe that's all except  where the hell is the braggart from Texas??Incidents.  Very neatly drawn.  The first suspenseful dive under threat of air attack.  The taking aboard of a passenger in a fogbound Aleutian nook. The attack by and destruction of two Zero float planes.  The unexploded bomb lodged in the superstructure that must be manually disarmed.  The knife in the back by the treacherous Japanese pilot.  The funeral at sea.  The sneaking through the antisubmarine nets.  The appendectomy performed by amateurs under primitive conditions on the bottom of Tokyo Bay.  Based on a true incident.  The landing party on the Japanese coast gathering information vital to the Doolittle raid hunted by Japanese patrols.  The B25s taking off from the Hornet and Enterprise with the departing gumchewing crewmen waving cheerfully from the airplane windows.  No mention of their premature launch or the loss of every airplane.  The torpedoing of a Japanese carrier accompanied by dialogue like Take her UNDER the carrier.  We'll finish her with the sting from our tail!  The depth charge attack with the shattered chronometer and the water spurting from the burst pipes.  The demolition of the pursuing destroyer with a down the throat shot.  The triumphant return home with the wife and kiddies waiting on the dock at Mare Island.  It's fascinating to watch.  The imagery itself crude by today's standards is gripping.  And there is the colorful change of uniforms from dress whites on Sutter Street to dark sweaters head covers and watch caps in the landing party.  Okay the sub does look like a toy in some shots.  And the Navy didn't want to release enough information about sonar equipment to make the scope look like anything other than an oscilloscope later sold to the producers of Plan Nine From Outer Space.  And maybe it's hard to believe that Cary Grant would daydream about his kid's first haircut while the submarine is about to implode on him.  And sure some of the dialogue is plain silly.  And nobody above the age of twelve would take a doll aboard the boat to play with.  Well maybe they would at that.  And some slight problems with continuity when the carrier is torpedoed from the bow John Garfield is seen jumping gleefully and saying It was mine!  It was mine! And then when the carrier gets a second dose from the stern tubes we see Garfield again guiding the fish into the tube.  None of that matters much though.  This is not a thought piece.  It's craftsmanship not art.  You have to go with the flow on this one.  If you want to see Garfield in a more realistic WB war effort catch Pride of the Marines if you can.  You won't forget that one.  Well you won't forget this one either but for very different reasons.".

The supporting cast in this film is very solid. Unlike many war films it takes time to develop dramatic story lines  gives the actors more chance to act than many action films of the war era.The films starts in San Francisco  has two sequences with the Golden Gate Bridge. While this is an action film where you have to wait for the action it is worth the wait. As the mission is started on Christmas Eve there is a little early holiday cheer thrown in for good measure.While the technology in this is more primitive than later silent service films the results are much more satisfying than some of the films made later.

	schema:reviewBody "First to all who feel the film was wrong to be used as a propaganda tool portraying the Japanese as villains terrorists or worse while the USA was is without sin please use ALL of history as a benchmark. At the time the film was made the Japanese military had committed far more atrocities than the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. They had invaded China unprovoked indiscriminately bombed population centers of major Chinese cities and raped tortured and killed a large population of Nanking the Chinese capital city. This compares with the German march through Eastern Europe at the same time combined with the Holocaust as well as the unprovoked Italian conquest of Abysinnia Ethiopia in the 1930's. When Jimmy Doolittle's bomb group left the Hornet they didn't fly in formation nor arrive over Tokyo in formation. They were forced to leave the Hornet approximately 200 miles sooner than originally planned due to being detected by a Japanese picket patrol which the task force sunk. Once Doolittle's plane was airborne it headed for Japan with the remainder of the group following behind at approximately 1 to 2 minute intervals.

	onyx:emotionText "First to all who feel the film was wrong to be used as a propaganda tool portraying the Japanese as villains terrorists or worse while the USA was is without sin please use ALL of history as a benchmark. At the time the film was made the Japanese military had committed far more atrocities than the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. They had invaded China unprovoked indiscriminately bombed population centers of major Chinese cities and raped tortured and killed a large population of Nanking the Chinese capital city. This compares with the German march through Eastern Europe at the same time combined with the Holocaust as well as the unprovoked Italian conquest of Abysinnia Ethiopia in the 1930's. When Jimmy Doolittle's bomb group left the Hornet they didn't fly in formation nor arrive over Tokyo in formation. They were forced to leave the Hornet approximately 200 miles sooner than originally planned due to being detected by a Japanese picket patrol which the task force sunk. Once Doolittle's plane was airborne it headed for Japan with the remainder of the group following behind at approximately 1 to 2 minute intervals. The film shows the entire bomb group in formation after leaving the Hornet and arriving the same way over Tokyo. In spite of this and being a bit corny by today's standards a wonderful tribute to many many men and woman who made incredible sacrifices ensuring victory in WWII.";

Typically in WWII era movies they would simply have said Them Japs are animals. Not civilized or even human. Loosely quoted from John Wayne in The Fighting Seebeas but not Cary Grant. Instead he explained how the Japanese were raised with the Bushido spirit. He didn't demonize them and even said they were not only fighting for their children but for the freedom of the Japanese children as well. I thought this was a bold statement in a time of war especially WWII.I really enjoyed this movie not only for the action but also because of the human story. The characters grow and change by the end of the film but also retain their strong sense of national pride. This movie worked really well as propaganda and portrayed the navy in a good light.".

Morton sank 19 Japanese ships in his first year and a halfmore than any other US sub at the time the US Navy decided to break its rules on secrecy and allow news accounts of the USS Wahoo's patrols. As a result of intense public interest in these stories a decision was made to make a movie fictionalizing the Wahoo and its successes. That movie is Destination Tokyo and it is said that Cary Grant met Capt. Morton and used him as the basis for his character in this film. To call this film propaganda as other reviewers have is to belittle the USS Wahoo and the fantastic successes of its captain and crew who died in action after this film was released and can only be excused on the basis of ignorance of the history behind the making of Destination Tokyo. This film is important then both because it is based upon the success of a real US sub in action and because it was one of the early submarine films of the second World War.I regret that the news account A WWII Submarine Finally Comes Home Divers Find the USS Wahoo the Most Storied of U.S. Subs By NED POTTER which contains the interview and appeared at www.sungazette.comNewsarticles.asp?articleID11380 is no longer on the web so the above URL will not work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Destination Tokyo 1943While not officially a propaganda film it's not endorsed or paid for by the government this is one of many films the studios put out to basically join the effort putting their shoulder to the wheel. It's not a great film for our times mostly because it's overflowing with lessons with the propagandistic style of persuading us the Japanese were bad and the U.S. soldiers with all their wonderful flaws were out to save us.I say this first because it's a lot of baggage to wade through. The other side to this coin is an adventure war movie where Cary Grant is in charge of a submarine out for a special mission. It's well paced generally well acted the cast is filled with lesser actors along with the main three. John Garfield is an average sailor with a big role and big ego that grates on some of the other sailors. But he tells ribald stories that they can't help listening to. The one older actor is the cook played by character actor Alan Hale who is appropriately comic.So what you get is some very talented people explaining the current events including lots of antiJapanese chat. The interior shots in the sub are fairly realistic though from what I read an actual sub is far more cramped. The outside stuff varies a lot in quality. The shots of the sub underwater are painfully crude models in water tanks. Some of the landscapes are also invented in the studio and you can tell.What carries it at all is a sense of danger and necessity. These men have to succeed to defeat evil. Remember of course the audience at the time had a very black and white view of the war and of the enemies. They were anxious for confirmation that we were capable of such things and that the enemy Japan but also Germany is discussed is fundamentally wrongthey lack freedoms the woman are simply alive to bear children no free press etc.Why did I watch it? Cary Grant. I'm curious about his range and his being corralled into this kind of vehicle. I'm guessing he was partly interested in helping the war effort and partly under contract. And you know what? He's great. He plays it straight and he's smart confident warm complex. If you like Grant you might like this movie just for that reason.Another thing to say overall it gets better as it goes. The set up in the first half is a bit obvious and sometimes stiff or slow. But there is a medical emergency which is pretty great and then there is the general operation in Tokyo Harbor. It's all dramatic and well done by firsttime director Delmar Daves. Yeah it's got a lot of dated script to wade through but the best of it is great war stuff best remembered for its context.".

Copperfin sails out of San Francisco in 1943 on a top secret assignment which cannot be revealed until another 24 hours at sea. The commander of this vessel is a man named Captain Cassidy Cary Grant and like many of the men who have served with him has 5 successful patrols to his credit. However this specific assignment is far more dangerous than anything any of them could have ever realized and it will also have an immediate impact on the war against Japan. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that as far as submarine movies are concerned this film certainly ranks as one of the better ones out there. Be advised though that it was made during World War 2 and because of that there are some elements of propaganda here and there. Likewise even though the plot is based on a true event it is also quite evident that there are some typical Hollywood exaggerations here as well. But even so this is still a pretty good film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.".

If it's a wartime navy film you have to bet on either the senior Hale or the junior Hale showing up somewhere on the boat. There's not a lot of heavyduty battle action until the last half hour or so but then we get enough torpedoes and depthcharges for any sub junkie. Grant is the best Hollywood sub captain ever I think anyone would be proud to serve under him. There's something special about the movies made when the outcome of the war was still in doubt. Top notch flick with the sort of innocence and faith which would not be attempted today. Our loss. 10 out of ten.".

	schema:headline " Enduring Warner Gangster Melodrama.";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the finest of the great gangster melodramas KEY LARGO is still a firm favourite with fans and cultists alike. Produced by Jerry Wald in 1948 for Warner Bros. it was based on the stage play by Maxwell Anderson and was beautifully written for the screen by Richard Brooks and John Huston. Stunningly photographed in low key black  white by Karl Freund it was expertly directed with his customary flair by Huston. The cast assembled couldn't be better with Humphrey Bogart delivering one of his very best subdued performances and arguably being almost eclipsed by a riveting Ed. G. Robinson. The rest of the small cast is fleshed out with Lauren Bacall Lionel Barrymore Claire Trevor and Thomas Gomez. And complimenting the on screen proceedings is the splendid music by the tireless Max Steiner who provided one of his best forties scores. It is 1946 the war in Europe is over and a returning GI Humphrey Bogart arrives at The Largo Hotel in Key Largo. Asked who he is Bogart coolly replies McCloud Frank by John out of Helen. He is here to meet with the hotel owner John Temple Lionel Barrymore to talk about the death of his son George Temple and how he lost his life in combat in Italy saving his unit. But McCloud notices that also staying in the hotel are a undesirable crowd of sinister looking characters. It's not long before he learns that they are a gang of mobsters led by an abrasive deported racketeer  the infamous Johnny Rocco Robinson. When McCloud reveals who Rocco is and lists his many illegal and crooked enterprises the aging wheelchair bound John Temple gloweringly chides him You Filth which elicits little more than a snigger from Rocco. Then the gang declare themselves and display their violent ways they murder the deputy sheriff and make known their intention to force McCloud to sail them to Cuba. However after Rocco's moll Claire Trevor slips McCloud a gun he takes them on in a surprise move out at sea which makes for an intense and exciting sequence. The picture ends with McCloud's dispatch of the baddies and turning the boat around he heads back to Key Largo and The Largo Hotel where a new life awaits him.With some remarkable ensemble playing performances are top notch. Bogart gives one of his best portrayals in a likable reserved manner. Here proving yet again that he remains one of the most enduring icons of the silver screen. But there's little doubt KEY LARGO is Robinson's picture! His snarling and totally mean spirited Rocco is the best thing he has ever done. Good too are those in support especially Lionel Barrymore as the irascible aging hotelier Lauren Bacall as Nora his daughter inlaw and Claire Trevor giving a great turn as Rocco's moll in her Acadamy Award winning best supporting actress performance.And holding the whole thing together is Max Steiner's great score. His main theme is a lovely gentle anthemlike cue which points up the sadness of George Temple's death in the war and the loneliness now felt without him by his father and widow Nora. Also heard are some great action cues and an appropriate swirling piece for the Hurricane sequence. 1948 was a bumper year for the busy composer.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the finest of the great gangster melodramas KEY LARGO is still a firm favourite with fans and cultists alike. Produced by Jerry Wald in 1948 for Warner Bros. it was based on the stage play by Maxwell Anderson and was beautifully written for the screen by Richard Brooks and John Huston. Stunningly photographed in low key black  white by Karl Freund it was expertly directed with his customary flair by Huston. The cast assembled couldn't be better with Humphrey Bogart delivering one of his very best subdued performances and arguably being almost eclipsed by a riveting Ed. G. Robinson. The rest of the small cast is fleshed out with Lauren Bacall Lionel Barrymore Claire Trevor and Thomas Gomez. And complimenting the on screen proceedings is the splendid music by the tireless Max Steiner who provided one of his best forties scores. It is 1946 the war in Europe is over and a returning GI Humphrey Bogart arrives at The Largo Hotel in Key Largo. Asked who he is Bogart coolly replies McCloud Frank by John out of Helen. He is here to meet with the hotel owner John Temple Lionel Barrymore to talk about the death of his son George Temple and how he lost his life in combat in Italy saving his unit. But McCloud notices that also staying in the hotel are a undesirable crowd of sinister looking characters. It's not long before he learns that they are a gang of mobsters led by an abrasive deported racketeer  the infamous Johnny Rocco Robinson. When McCloud reveals who Rocco is and lists his many illegal and crooked enterprises the aging wheelchair bound John Temple gloweringly chides him You Filth which elicits little more than a snigger from Rocco. Then the gang declare themselves and display their violent ways they murder the deputy sheriff and make known their intention to force McCloud to sail them to Cuba. However after Rocco's moll Claire Trevor slips McCloud a gun he takes them on in a surprise move out at sea which makes for an intense and exciting sequence. The picture ends with McCloud's dispatch of the baddies and turning the boat around he heads back to Key Largo and The Largo Hotel where a new life awaits him.With some remarkable ensemble playing performances are top notch. Bogart gives one of his best portrayals in a likable reserved manner. Here proving yet again that he remains one of the most enduring icons of the silver screen. But there's little doubt KEY LARGO is Robinson's picture! His snarling and totally mean spirited Rocco is the best thing he has ever done. Good too are those in support especially Lionel Barrymore as the irascible aging hotelier Lauren Bacall as Nora his daughter inlaw and Claire Trevor giving a great turn as Rocco's moll in her Acadamy Award winning best supporting actress performance.And holding the whole thing together is Max Steiner's great score. His main theme is a lovely gentle anthemlike cue which points up the sadness of George Temple's death in the war and the loneliness now felt without him by his father and widow Nora. Also heard are some great action cues and an appropriate swirling piece for the Hurricane sequence. 1948 was a bumper year for the busy composer. In twelve months the man scored an unprecedented eleven films which included such amazing classics as Treasure Of The Sierra Madre Johnny Belinda Silver River the exceptional The Adventures Of Don Juan and of course KEY LARGO.KEY LARGO remains a memorable and enduring classic from Hollywood's Golden Age.

Robinson and his hoods take everyone hostage in Lionel Barrymore's hotel there is a tension that does not let up for one second. Movie goers had to be on the edge of their seats in 1948.There is one scene however that I don't think viewers today can fully appreciate. Lionel Barrymore had been acting from a wheelchair for 10 years and movie audiences were used to that. When Robinson and his goons goad him to a futile gesture of bravado Barrymore rises from that chair and moves slowly towards the snickering Robinson. He swings and misses and falls down and Bogey and Bacall pick up Barrymore and bring him back to his wheelchair. The shock value of that scene for 1948 audiences would have a dimension that can't be appreciated now.Robinson's Johnny Rocco is based on Lucky Luciano who had been deported a few years back. He's evil incarnate and Humphrey Bogart as Frank McCloud is the jaded cynical former idealist who redeems himself and becomes the countervailing force for good. They play well against each other in a reverse from the 1930s Warner gangster flicks where Robinson was usually the good guy.Who could have known this would be the fourth last and best of the Bogey and Bacall teamings.".

	schema:headline " Edward G. Robinson at this best";
	schema:reviewBody "Key Largo is just one of John Huston's many memorable films that somehow always seem to transcend the intentionthe Hollywood intention being to make a few bucksand to this day still plays very well and indeed appears as something close to a work of art. It features what I think is one of Edward G. Robinson's finest performances as Johnny Rocco a sociopathic gangster holding the offseason personnel of a seaside hotel hostage as he concludes a counterfeit money deal.The story begins as Major Frank McCloud Humphrey Bogart pays a visit to the family of one of his G.I. buddies who was killed in Italy during WWII. He finds the welcome from the hotel's only guests chilly except for Gaye Dawn a funny and perhaps prescient Hollywood stage name played by Claire Trevor who is drunk and befriends him. After a bit McCloud discovers that the hotel's owner Nora Temple Lauren Bacall and her invalid fatherinlaw James Temple Lionel Barrymore have been tricked into allowing Rocco's gang to stay and now as a tropical storm begins to blow are being held at gunpoint. McCloud's delicate task is to keep the megalomaniac and murderous personality of Rocco under some control so that he doesn't murder everyone.Note that this is a splendid cast and they all do a good job. Note too that Huston adapted this from a play by the versatile American playwright Maxwell Anderson. So the ingredients for a good film are clearly in place and aside from some selfconscious mishmash with the Seminoles of Florida this is a success. Anderson's desire to explore the psychopathic personality some years later he adapted William March's novel The Bad Seed into a stage play finds realization in Huston's direction and especially in Robinson's indelible performance. The utter disregard for the lives of others and the obsessive love of self that characterize the sociopath reek from the snares and callous laughter of the very sick Johnny Rocco. I especially liked the crazed and thrilled grin on his face when he emerges from the hold of the boat in the climactic scene gun in hand imagining that he has once again fooled his adversaries and is about to delightfully shoot Humphrey Bogart to death. What I loved about this scene was that Huston did not think it necessary to contrive a fight in which the good guy Bogart beats the bad guy by fighting fair. What happens is exactly what should happen and without regard for the fine points of Marquis of Queensberrytype rules. Also good is Rocco beginning to sweat in fear of his life as the storm moves in while Bogey gives us his famous laugh and grin as he assesses the essential cowardice of the petty gangster.Lauren Bacall in one of her more modest roles does a lot without saying much and Lionel Barrymore is very good as the cantankerous old guy in a wheelchair. Claire Trevor actually won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her work and she was good as the alcoholic moll with a heart of gold. Robinson won nothing but he really dominated the picture and demonstrated why he was one of Hollywood's greatest stars.Bottom line watch this to see the gangster yarn meld into film noir with overtones of the psychoanalytical drama that characterized many of the black and white Hollywood films of the forties and early fifties.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Watching this version of Key Largo more than proves Welles' point the lighting becomes terrible in several key scenes particularly the closing ones on the boat to whereas before you could see what was going on now you can just barely tell a thing. That said it can't destroy the fine work that this film truly is.I was led to this film by my mother who called it one of her favorites from Bogie another being The African Queen and now I can see why. Leave it to John Huston the man who was bold enough to make a true adaptation of Dashiell Hammet's The Maltese Falcon to give us a tightly woven drama that never feels forced. Bogie's Frank McCloud is probably the most silent of all the strongsilent types he ever played barely saying more than is necessary for the scene he's in. Such reticience leaves some large blanks for the audience to fill though he says that he doesn't care one way or another I really don't believe him. The feeling I get the entire time he's in the clutches of Johnny Rocco's gang is that he's just waiting for his moment. After all you don't survive WWII's Italian campaign and not know when it's best to stay still and when it's best to make your play. That's why he threw away the gun offered to him by Rocco no way was Rocco's gang just going to let their boss be gunned down even if the deck was stacked in Rocco's favor. The murders of the deputy and the Indians on the lam just adds to the need to take care of business.I was a little disappointed to see Bacall in such a minor role it still had to be better than what she was given sans Bogie after this film from reports I've heard but her spitting in Rocco's face is an undeniably powerful moment. As for Edward G. Robinson one of Hollywood's original tough guys imported from Bucharest Romania he literally runs away with the part of Johnny Rocco the former bigshot with delusions of grandeur. He's a casually vicious ruthless fount of hate bitter over his fallen status and hungering for a comeback. But he still fails to draw an important lesson from his soused exgalpal times change and not necessarily for the better. He may have defied a ton of police in his day or gun down a deputy in this one but it still doesn't change the fact that the outside world nicely symbolized by the hurricane can and will eat him alive without the slightest trace of indigestion. All Rocco is is a dinosaur proud strong but too stupid to realize that his kind have become extinct.In fact that may very well be why McCloud was such a natural match for Rocco as an opponent. McCloud had changed his spots many times in his life to fit the job situation he was in while Rocco has never been anything else but what he is now. Small wonder that one can see the confrontation between them coming to full steam. This core element and all the others mentioned and not mentioned here help make Key Largo one of the great unsung classics of Humphrey Bogart AND Edward G. Robinson. Here's looking at you tough guys.".

But he still fails to draw an important lesson from his soused exgalpal times change and not necessarily for the better. He may have defied a ton of police in his day or gun down a deputy in this one but it still doesn't change the fact that the outside world nicely symbolized by the hurricane can and will eat him alive without the slightest trace of indigestion. All Rocco is is a dinosaur proud strong but too stupid to realize that his kind have become extinct.In fact that may very well be why McCloud was such a natural match for Rocco as an opponent. McCloud had changed his spots many times in his life to fit the job situation he was in while Rocco has never been anything else but what he is now. Small wonder that one can see the confrontation between them coming to full steam. This core element and all the others mentioned and not mentioned here help make Key Largo one of the great unsung classics of Humphrey Bogart AND Edward G. Robinson. Here's looking at you tough guys.";

Robinson as Rocco was a mass of contradictions Brutal with a gun safely in his hand dreaming of the glories he once knew in the good old days when he was a big shot all he has left are the memories He was a man whose criminal wisdom permits no ethics and few feelings He offers Bogart an empty gun to shoot it out with him... He is also a man afraid who sweats when the hurricane approaches and poses a threat to his safety... He detests Bogart because of his wartime heroism mocking and taunting him because his courage is something differing in Rocco's own unheroic life As war hero Frank McCloud Bogart was the most complex character of all Disillusioned tired of his warinduced killings unwilling to risk himself in any new test of courage One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for he is now a complacent shadow of his former noble self He like Barrymore seeks an idyllic world where there's no place for Johnny Rocco. However his pattern has been too well established He like Claire Trevor can be pushed only so far and then reason and restraint seem no longer acceptable as an alternative to action With such a cast Key Largo could not fall to hold the attention Yet for all its workmanlike craft it did not reach the level of Wyler's The Desperate Hours. Bogart as a disillusioned war veteran who could not rouse himself to action until the last few minutes left one frustrated looking for the vicious power that he was to show as the gangster in the later filmEdward G. Robinson commanding convincing was still not so coldly frightening a villain as Humphrey Bogart And one can imagine how the idea of the storming hurricane appealed at the time The violence and the drama outside as the wind tore at the palm trees and the waves threatened to swallow the little wooden hotel would surely underscore and heighten the tensions within... Not so! And not only because the studio storm was not always up to nature's level... What William Wyler realized was that the suspense of innocence trapped as hostages by wickedness was vastly heightened by the contrast with a quiet undramatic everyday setting No hurricane was needed to put the desperation in The Desperate Hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Humphrey Bogart and John Huston must be considered the artistic equivalent of De NiroScorsese.  Huston and Bogie made several films together this being one of their best.  But there is another combo that comes to an end in cinema's history  Bogie and Bacall appear on screen for the final time together.  It is their finest collaboration.  Edward G. Robinson Little Caesar himself returns to gangster form after years of playing the good guy Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY Welles' THE STRANGER and has one of the more memorable entrances in film villain history.  We see him in a tub smoking a fan in front of him.  He seems to be decaying in a way but Johnny Rocco is still to be reckoned with.  This is the Robinson we all love demented and wise sinister yet humorous.  The Largo Hotel is the setting and a hurricane of drama heroism and rain is coming.Huston stages the film much like the play it is based on yet we never feel confined.  There is enough colorful dialogue to go around.  Surprisingly much of it is not by Bogart who plays probably his most quiet role promoting his character through facial gestures more than words.  He plays off Robinson and his posse of mobsters perfectly in this way allowing Edward G. to dominate the majority of the film which is the point. Lionel Barrymore plays the chairridden owner of the Largo and his daughter Bacall is falling in love with Bogart naturally.  They are at the mercy of Rocco and his boys all of whom have some itchy trigger fingers.  Bogart is just buying his time to make his move.  The finale is extremely well done and foresees suspense endings to come.Lauren Bacall is one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the screen especially in black and white.  Her perfect features look sculpted in this light and her sensual stare is enough to make you melt.  Her smoky voice and attitude is an excellent match for Bogie's simple heroic character.  Film Noir becomes Florida Noir here as the lightening outside the windows of the hotel play games with the shadows and atmosphere of events inside. Robinson murders an innocent man with the look of a terrifying ghost lightening flashing on him and all.  The thunder substitutes for the sound of cars and streetlife normally heard in classic noir pictures.  KEY LARGO is a very good film dark and suspenseful in the most pleasant of locales.RATING 8 of 10".

The build up of tension between the main characters is set well against the backdrop of the impending storm seemingly threatening to cave their hotel in literally and figuratively. Frank's character arc from jaded passiveness to the restrained heroism he is inescapably drawn towards has been seen in other Bogie characters but usually those guys were either willing participants on the trigger end of their guns or they were fulfilling their own agendas as well. However Frank McCloud has no ulterior motives. Here there is a refreshing change from the usual Bogieisms Frank doesnt engage in any verbal bravado with Rocco there are no confident smirks on his face or promises to 'get even' later. As for Barrymore he was just simply an acting genius. Look no further than the scene with him getting out of his wheelchair in a futile attempt to fight Rocco as proof. Fantastic. E.G. Robinson delivers his vitriol so well onscreen you cant help but hate his guts and wait for his comeuppance. Both Barrymore and EGR were great at delivering speeches   extended lines of dialogue while 'flying solo'  you can almost here the room go quiet as they worked the script. Lauren Bacall's chemistry with her Husband was so natural and unforced even the scenes with no dialogue show how much they were in love  albeit  true she doesnt exactly carry the workload in this one. Some of the scenes with the Indians seem a little odd but it still works in the context of the entire movie. Don't overlook this great film!".

Appearing as as Rocco's henchmen are veterans Thomas Gomez and Dan Seymour and Harry Lewis as Toots a Wilmer type character from The Maltese Falcon. Monte Blue and John Rodney represent the law.Bogart and Robinson appeared together many times during the 30s with Robinson usually playing the hero and Bogey the heavy. This time their roles are reversed. This film was unfortunately the last time Bogart and Robinson appeared together. It's a pity because they always played against each other so well. I always liked Robinson better on the wrong side of the law. His Rocco is a slimy brutal villain. He even gets to slap Bogey around in this one.It is interesting to note the name of the boat that the gang make their getaway on is called Santana.

Claire Trevor plays a gangster moll Gaye Dawn and has a great opportunity.

	schema:headline " Post World War II pessimism !!!";
	schema:reviewBody "John Huston's 'Key Largo' is set in a Post World War II America and the film is unapologetic about showcasing the pessimism that had enveloped America and Americans after the war. It's about the loss of a selfrespecting identity. This is epitomised by the character of Frank McCloud played by Humphrey Bogart. This is not a very characteristic role for Bogart. McCloud is a war veteran who has now become a homeless drifter due to his lack of interest in a settled life. He is a sane version of Travis Bickle he might have been a vibrant hopeful man in his preservice days but after coming back from the war and watching an America that has further collapsed into corruption mob activity and evil he has slipped into a state of depression and deliberate indifference. Bogart gives a subdued performance with moments of tenderness reminiscent of the tenderness of Rick Blaine in 'Casablanca'. But McCloud also shows signs of selfishness and cowardly reluctance which are a consequence of his pessimism towards life after war. There is an ambiguity to his character that makes him interesting.Lauren Bacall doesn't give us the quintessential 'Lauren Bacall' performance either. Instead of being the 'Femme fatale' with the seductive allure and the sharp tongue her character Nora is a sweet kindhearted widow taking care of her fatherinlaw. There are genuinely sweet and charming moments between Bogart and Bacall. Nora's presence and her innocent sweetness has an undeniable effect on McCloud which makes him reconsider his moral stance and contemplate the idea doing something instead of continuing his reluctance about standing up to the gangsters.Edward G. Robinson is a dynamite in every scene he is in. Johnny Rocco oozes charisma and a sense of control. It takes a lot to be in the same scene with Bogart and go toe to toe with him in terms of exuding authoritativeness but Robinson does it effortlessly.Although Huston doesn't use too many attention seeking shots or too much fancy camera work one can easily see the noirish elements in the lighting and prominent shadows in the film. There are some carefully used tracking shots and extreme closeups for artistic purposes that work perfectly and the film on BluRay looks very pleasing to the eye. Huston's biggest achievement is maintaining a tone of suspense throughout the running time. The staging of 90 percent of the film in the confines of the interiors of Hotel Largo adds to the claustrophobia which the viewer feels along with McCloud Nora and Temple. The only flaw is that the shootout scenes are very clumsily directed and almost look comical now after all these years.'Key Largo' is thematically a film which wrestles the idea of whether someone should or shouldn't give a damn even if heshe feels an assertive action doesn't mean much in the bigger picture. A thematically potent core along with good direction and acting make 'Key Largo' an easy recommendation.".

The superb cast and directing by John Huston make this a must see film for fans of the 1940 classics particularly fans of stars Humphrey Bogart Edward G. Robinson and Lauren Bacall.Bogey and Bacall made four films in a space of four years this being their final appearance together. Bogey's character retired Army Major Frank McCloud seeks out the family of a war buddy killed in action. He finds Nora Temple Bacall and her father James Temple Lionel Barrymore as the owners of a seasonal hotel in Key Largo and comes to realize that all is not quite right in the serene setting. Bogey's response to an inquisitive Nora Temple is about to be tested  Life on land has become too complicated for my taste. Edward G. Robinson's appearance as mobster Johnny Rocco is suitably delayed in the film to build suspense and he breaks on screen with all of his classic nuance  the sneer the braggadocio the What's with you wise guy? sarcasm. Rocco suffers from a fall from past glory a time when he was regarded as the one and only a virtual emperor of the crime world. Now he's a two bit hoodlum holed up in a Key Largo hotel hoping to cash in on a counterfeit money scam. With him are a coterie of henchmen and an alcoholic moll superbly portrayed by Claire Trevor earning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance. Johnny Rocco is desperate to make a mob connection to unload his counterfeit money stash and refuses to submit to the might of an impending hurricane. Fueling Rocco's desperation is a stoic Bogart  You don't like it Rocco  the storm show it your gun why don't ya if it doesn't stop shoot it!. Helpless in the face of the coming storm Rocco's anxiety mounts and in a tense scene he confronts war hero McCloud by throwing him a gun to force a showdown. But Bogey's not buying it  One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for. In a damned if you do damned if you don't situation McCloud must decide to man a boat to Cuba for Rocco's gang to make a getaway. In the one improbable scene of the film Trevor's Gaye Dawn character secretly maneuvers Rocco's gun away from him and slips it into Bogey's hand while surrounded by all of the bad guys. How Rocco would not have missed his weapon until later on the boat is an element that is not suitably dealt with in the film.McCloud's resourcefulness while skippering the getaway boat is sheer cunning taking out one mobster after another with surgical precision. The desperate Johnny Rocco even shoots one of his own men rather than have his authority challenged. McCloud remains silent to Rocco's taunts causing the gangster to force his own hand and become a target for the heroic McCloud.As Bogey heads back to port and the hurricane fades the film ends on a feel good note as Nora Temple opens the shutters of the hotel and the sunlight streams in  all is well in the world again the symbolism is extraordinary.Bogey and Robinson appear in four other movies together Kid Galahad Brother Orchid The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse and Bullets or Ballots but this is the only one in which they share equal footing Robinson cast in the lead role in the other films over Bogart. For Robinson fans the Clitterhouse film is a blast and is recommended to see him in an offbeat role.Another point of interest for film buffs Jay Silverheels appears in an uncredited role as Tom Osceola one of the Seminole Indian brothers on the lam from the law in the movie's back story. For an actor as typecast as Silverheels Tonto in the Lone Ranger it's always a pleasant surprise and treat to see in an entirely different setting.Key Largo ranks right up there with Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Maltese Falcon and perhaps just a notch below Casablanca among Bogart's finest films and a true classic worthy of the name.".

Although the movie has a good plot it isn't welltold and some of things felt out of place. Richard Brooks did a much better job adapting the script of In Cold Blood and Elmer Gantry. I think that's mainly because those are based on novels and this one is based on a play.The story is about a WWII veteran Humphrey Bogart that goes to the island of Key Largo in Florida to talk with the wife Lauren Bacall and father Lionel Barrymore of his oldfriend from the war. That's when a gangster Edward G. Robinson takes control of the place and turns everyone into his hostages. At first I didn't really get what was that gangster doing in that place but it's latter explained that he's waiting for a hurricane and needs protection. But why that tiny island? I still don't get this but alright. This flaw is compensated by one of the best climax I've ever seen in a movie. I'm not gonna spoil it here but it's great.About the acting Bogart did much better jobs in other pictures. This is the final movie with him and Lauren Bacall together but I prefer their first collaboration in To Have and Have Not. Edward G. Robinson also gives a great performance but again he was better in other movies like Little Ceaser. In my opinion the members of the cast that gives the best performances are Lionel Barrymore and Oscar winning interpretation by Claire Trevor. They are both excellent.John Huston as always does a nice direction but I prefer much better his masterpiece of the same year The Treasure of Sierra Madre. That's where Huston proves the great director he is and Bogart gives an outstanding performance.Overral this movie has a fine acting along with John Huston's direction and an excellent climax but the badtold screenplay takes away the good things about it.7 out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have 4 Humphrey Bogart movies in list of favorites  The Maltese Falcon Casablanca The African Queen and Key Largo.  I know that compared to the other three it is considered a lesser work but it is my favorite Bogart. I am not going to write about the brilliance of all the performances in Key Large  Lionel Barrymore Lauren Bacall Edward G. Robinson and Claire Trevor.  Enough has been said about them all.  I wish to concentrate on Bogart and the loneliness of his character in the movie.Bogart often played damaged characters i.e. men who had been hurt badly hurt at some time in the past.  Frank McCloud in Key Largo is one of those characters.  He is not a tough guy like Sam Spade or a sharp character like Rick.  He is a nice man and a very lonely one.  Frank has no family he was an orphan.  He was an officer in the war but the war is over.  He has no job no family and no prospects.  He is tired tired of being alone and tired of the violence of the war.But Frank has one dream a borrowed dream. During the war one of his men often told him stories of his own life with his father and wife and their small hotel in the Florida Keys.  It is a tale of family closeness and love of clean salt air and colorful characters.  It is everything Frank has never had in his life.  After the war and the death of his friend Frank has nowhere to go and nothing to look forward to.  So he finally drifts to Florida to this family to tell them how much he respected and liked his friend.They Nora and Father Temple are very glad to meet Frank.  Just as Frank had been told about them they had been told about Frank in letters sent home from the war.  Into this comes Johnny Rocco and his goons and his moll. Frank is a decorated soldier and a brave man there are too many innocent lives at stake Nora and Mr. Temple and even Gaye Dawn the alcoholic moll. Frank cares about these people even Gaye and he does not want them to be hurt and perhaps more than anyone else there he knows the terrible devastation bullets can wreak on the human body.  This sets up the conditions for all the talk while they are trapped by the hurricane.  I will not say any more about twists of the plot because I do not want to include spoilers.Let me just say that in the end Nora and Father Temple realize that they need Frank as much as Frank needs them.  And so Frank is finally able to come home.  He finally has it all ... in Key Largo.".

I know that compared to the other three it is considered a lesser work but it is my favorite Bogart. I am not going to write about the brilliance of all the performances in Key Large  Lionel Barrymore Lauren Bacall Edward G. Robinson and Claire Trevor.  Enough has been said about them all.  I wish to concentrate on Bogart and the loneliness of his character in the movie.Bogart often played damaged characters i.e. men who had been hurt badly hurt at some time in the past.  Frank McCloud in Key Largo is one of those characters.  He is not a tough guy like Sam Spade or a sharp character like Rick.  He is a nice man and a very lonely one.  Frank has no family he was an orphan.  He was an officer in the war but the war is over.  He has no job no family and no prospects.  He is tired tired of being alone and tired of the violence of the war.But Frank has one dream a borrowed dream. During the war one of his men often told him stories of his own life with his father and wife and their small hotel in the Florida Keys.  It is a tale of family closeness and love of clean salt air and colorful characters.  It is everything Frank has never had in his life.  After the war and the death of his friend Frank has nowhere to go and nothing to look forward to.  So he finally drifts to Florida to this family to tell them how much he respected and liked his friend.They Nora and Father Temple are very glad to meet Frank.  Just as Frank had been told about them they had been told about Frank in letters sent home from the war.  Into this comes Johnny Rocco and his goons and his moll. Frank is a decorated soldier and a brave man there are too many innocent lives at stake Nora and Mr. Temple and even Gaye Dawn the alcoholic moll. Frank cares about these people even Gaye and he does not want them to be hurt and perhaps more than anyone else there he knows the terrible devastation bullets can wreak on the human body.  This sets up the conditions for all the talk while they are trapped by the hurricane.  I will not say any more about twists of the plot because I do not want to include spoilers.Let me just say that in the end Nora and Father Temple realize that they need Frank as much as Frank needs them.  And so Frank is finally able to come home.  He finally has it all ... in Key Largo.";

	schema:reviewBody "Key Largo is undoubtedly one of the best film noirs and indeed films of any genre. Memorable characters abound in this classic. Bogart as had become his screen persona IS the reluctant hero. Edward G. Robinson is unforgettable as arguably the ultimate gangster though Bogart himself and James Cagney would undoubtedly contest him for the title. Lauren Bacall's role isn't as prominent as in some of the other films she costarred with Bogart but nevertheless she is more than competent. I think Claire Trevor won a best supporting actress for her role as the lush dame in this film. The rest of the supporting cast is also top notch and is unusually memorable for secondary characters. That's a credit to both the screenwriters and the actors. One of my top twenty films of all time 1010.".

As a hurricane approaches the two end up confronting each other . As a storm of fear and fury in the sizzling Florida Keys and the events go wrong . It is starred by Frank McCloud Humphrey Bogart who travels to a rundown hotel on Key Largo to honor the memory of a friend . The dead soldier's father James Temple Lionel Barrymore was severely disabled by arthritis and was confined to a wheelchair runs a hotel in Key Largo with the help of his now widowed daughterinlaw Nora Lauren Bacall . But the motel is taken over by a bunch of mobsters led by Johnny Rocco Edward G Robinson his role was modeled on Al Capone who retired to South Florida shortly after the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and died there of complications due to advanced syphilis and his hoodlums Thomas Gomez  Harry Lewis  Marc Lawrence . Rocco is accompanied by his drunk moll Claire Trevor  her role was based on reallife moll Gay Orlova  gangster Lucky Luciano's girlfriend. Exciting and thrilling picture with a complex intrigue  nice character studio  suspense  a lot of killings and interesting deeds . One of the most grueling of even Bogart's mobster movies all done in gripping realism and well shot by the great John Huston . Interesting and moving screenplay by Richard Brooks  John Huston and based on the play by Maxwell Anderson . However  the film version of Key Largo has very little to do with Maxwell Anderson's original play  all the characters in the play had their names changed in the film version. This was very unusual for a play written by Anderson who was then one of the most highly regarded American playwrights and whose bestknown plays had on the whole been filmed faithfully . The picture has a Noir treatment though excessively stagy  but stars can quite compensate for some claustrophobic moments . This firstrate but slowpaced picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama and emotion . Twisted film Noir about gangsters  robbing  forgery  treason  troubled relationships and dark secrets . It is a tough and tortuous thriller that has a good realization  an original script  haunting atmosphere  intriguing events  for that reason madness and murder prevail . Exciting as well as rare film  possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller  serenity  baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances  attractive cinematography in black and white by Karl Freund and magnificent musical score by the classic Max Steiner . This is pure cinema from the first to the last shot where there's nothing left and each image has its sense and meaning . Stirring ending  in fact the final confrontation on a boat is actually the ending to the book To Have and Have Not which wasn't used in the film version . The ramshackle hotel where most of the drama unfolds was constructed on the Warner Bros lot along with the beach area. Exterior shots of the hurricane were actually taken from stock footage used in Night unto night 1949.Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever  his scenes with Lauren Bacall are awesome though underplayed compared to those they shared in The Big sleep  Dark passage and To have and to have not . This was fourth and final film pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall  a fifth film was planned several years later but Bogart died before it could be made . Additionaly  the subjective camera record Humphrey's impressions giving a topdrawer acting . It's splendidly played by Humphrey Bogart  he was in his best period of the late 40s and early 50s when he starred classic movies such as The Caine Mutiny Sabrina Beat the devil The African Queen Sirocco In a lonely place Chain lightning Knock on any door and The enforcer. Supporting cast is frankly well  such as Lionel Barrymore  Claire Trevor  Thomas Gomez  Harry Lewis  Marc Lawrence  Monte Blue and uncredited Jay Silverheels  famous Indian Tonto of Lone Ranger . The motion picture produced in enough budget by Jack L. Warner and Jerry Wald was well directed by John Huston  though being extremely theatrical. The main character Frank McCloudBogart describes having served in the WWII battle at San Pietro Italy similarly to directorcoscreenwriter John Huston had been involved in that battle as the creator of the documentary film San Pietro 1945 while he was in the U.S. Army's motion picture unit . Nice work by John Huston in demonstrating his skill at all areas  as technical  using all kind of resources for illustrating the interesting as well as dramatic story with an engaging screenplay  adding great actors  adequate filmmaking and enjoyable narration . The movie was filmed in only 78 days virtually all on the Warner Bros. lot except for a few shots in Florida used for the opening scenes . This film Key Largo or Huracn de Pasiones or Cayo largo is absolutely recommended . Rating  Above average  it is a nice tale with enough drama  thrills and turns to keep you guessing .".

And Claire Trevor's Academy Award was deserving. But I want to spend the rest of this review discussing Edward G. Robinson's performance. Robinson has never been a particular favorite of mine. But it's difficult not to enjoy him in Key Largo. To be a man of such slight stature on screen he comes across like a giant. His character Johnny Rocco dominates almost every scene  even scenes he's not in. Before we meet Rocco he's already on of the biggest characters in the movie. All his hired stooges have to do is point to the bedroom door and say something like He's in there taking a nap and Rocco immediately becomes the most important person in the movie. Robinson is amazing to watch as he demonstrates his dominance by threatening everyone even his own men. But Robinson saves the best for last. As the hurricane hits he changes and becomes like a frightened child. That Robinson was capable of playing the heavy so convincingly in one scene and the weakling so perfectly in the next is evidence of his wonderful abilities. It's really a joy to behold.".

But then who's got a bigger personality than Robinson when he's playing the gangster kingpin as he is here. He snarls threatens cajoles and pretty well dominates the screen while Bogie lowkeys it as the reluctant idealist a signature role he perfected in Casablanca 1942. But you've got to feel a little sorry for Bacall who mostly stands silently around like a loose appendage. Her role looks like an addon maybe to please husband Bogart. Of course it's Trevor who gets the plum distaff role and she looks the shopworn part to the proverbial 'T'. When she warbles her little ditty however her face lights up like girlish innocence restored. And oh yes mustn't forget Barrymore who for once avoids hamming it up in a well played part as the hotel owner.I'm not sure how much of that showdown aboard the boat I buy but I guess they had to find some resolution.

	schema:reviewBody "Stagetoscreen adaptations are always going to pose problems. Actors have to play it differently and the strongly visual nature of film has to compensate for theatre's emphasis on dialogue. Counterintuitive as it may seem  since both stage plays and screenplays are essentially just a story told in lines of dialogue and actions  many adaptations from one to the other are not so much a tweaking as a complete overhaul. However writer and director John Huston's reworking of the Maxwell Anderson play Key Largo apparently had more to do with changing the political slant. It still contains the small number of locations and lengthy dialogue scenes of a typical stage production. Instead it is the way Huston stages the action and the solid performances of the cast that make this workable for the screen.Huston had an expert handling of foreground and background and he often used it to preserve the length of the shot. For example in the scene where we first meet Lauren Bacall rather than change angle to a midshot of her she appears in the background and then walks towards the camera without a cut. Shots like these keep the action flowing smoothly especially in these more relaxed early scenes. Despite the sometimes highly elaborate long takes Huston rarely moves the camera and those moves that are made neatly follow the action and are never obtrusive. What is obtrusive is the positioning of actors within the shot  sometimes almost bizarre arrangements of people with closeups overhanging the edges of the frame. This puts the focus on the actors in a way that is very intense and exaggerated  like our experience of a stage play can be.The cast of Key Largo is predictable but worthy. Humphrey Bogart plays the same taciturn grudginglymoral lead man that had been his type since the Maltese Falcon. The twist here is that for most of the picture he is an inactive hero a mere observer yet one who is constantly thinking and emoting. As such it's one of his more satisfying performances. Lauren Bacall is plainer here than in her previous pairings with Bogie although I guess to have made her the sultry seductress would have seemed a touch indelicate given that she is playing his buddy's widow. Edward G. Robinson plays a mob boss yet again and I'm sorry to say this is him at his most average.As to the supporting players we see Lionel Barrymore at his most restrained and subtle although perhaps he was by now too frail to be so vigorously hammy. Claire Trevor was the picture's only Oscar nominee and indeed winner for a performance that is notable but overacted. For the record my vote for Best Supporting Actress that year would have gone to Ellen Corby in I Remember Mama. Finally an honourable mention goes to silent screen veteran Monte Blue who is quite impressive in his brief role as the sheriff.While the unevenness of the cast can be overlooked the one thing I feel really threatens to spoil Key Largo is the score by Max Steiner. He horrendously overworks the dramatic moments with blaring melodramatic arrangements inappropriate for both the scope and tone of the picture. And the stereotypical Red Indian theme he gives to the scene where we meet the natives is just an embarrassment. Steiner's failure to get Key Largo is sadly indicative of a recurring problem in postwar Hollywood. As the studio system began to crumble and the smart producers of the previous decades began to die out there were no guarantees on having a tight consistent team.".

Robinson plays a mob boss yet again and I'm sorry to say this is him at his most average.As to the supporting players we see Lionel Barrymore at his most restrained and subtle although perhaps he was by now too frail to be so vigorously hammy. Claire Trevor was the picture's only Oscar nominee and indeed winner for a performance that is notable but overacted. For the record my vote for Best Supporting Actress that year would have gone to Ellen Corby in I Remember Mama. Finally an honourable mention goes to silent screen veteran Monte Blue who is quite impressive in his brief role as the sheriff.While the unevenness of the cast can be overlooked the one thing I feel really threatens to spoil Key Largo is the score by Max Steiner. He horrendously overworks the dramatic moments with blaring melodramatic arrangements inappropriate for both the scope and tone of the picture. And the stereotypical Red Indian theme he gives to the scene where we meet the natives is just an embarrassment. Steiner's failure to get Key Largo is sadly indicative of a recurring problem in postwar Hollywood. As the studio system began to crumble and the smart producers of the previous decades began to die out there were no guarantees on having a tight consistent team.";

	schema:reviewBody "What would 1940's American cinema be without Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall? It's a rhetorical question of course. But in this 1940's Bogie and Bacall classic their presence is almost overshadowed by the combined talents of Claire Trevor Lionel Barrymore and the inimitable Edward G. Robinson. What a cast!Their story about being stranded in a quaint isolated Florida hotel with high ceilings and ceiling fans during a hurricane is well known. Most film buffs regard Key Largo highly partly because of its star power partly because of the ingenious story but also because of the excellent high contrast BW lighting that gives the visuals an Expressionistic cinematic style. When the electricity goes out and the only source of lighting in the Largo Hotel is the oil lamps the film oozes a wonderfully noir atmosphere. The howling wind outside combined with the threatening presence of gangsters inside adds a strange mix of tension and danger.Bogie plays Frank McCloud a WWII military man who seems to have lost his courage he's now branded a coward. It's a tough position to be in when you're in the presence of a gangster like Johnny Rocco. When Rocco demands that McCloud helm the boat to take the gangsters to Cuba McCloud's courage is tested again.The film's acting is terrific. Claire Trevor deservedly won an Oscar for her performance as Gaye Dawn the hasbeen nightclub singer and companion of Johnny Rocco. Thomas Gomez is great as Rocco's sidekick Curly. But my personal favorite performance is Lionel Barrymore as wheelchairbound James Temple the crusty and amiable owner of the Largo Hotel. That he is confined to a wheelchair adds immensely to the depth of his character.The only weakness in the story is the subplot about the Seminole Indians. That element seems awkward and out of place. Also the film's nondescript background music is too loud and intrusive. And it tends to be manipulative not unlike other noir films of that era.Those issues aside Key Largo is the perfect movie to watch late at night during a thunderstorm. The film has a ton of cinematic atmosphere. It proceeds at a pleasantly slow lazy pace. And it's got some of the greatest actors of that era including Bogie and Bacall.".

Bogart seemed incapable of giving a bad performance and he's just great here. Robinson doesn't show up until nearly 30 minutes inbut you always know he's there. He's OK but I think he played the gangster role once too often. Barrymore is given little to do but he is good. Trevor is superb in her small roleshe understandably won a Best Supporting Actress award for this. Surprisingly Bacall is terrible! She's stone faced throughout and gives a bad performance. Maybe she didn't click with the director Huston was not known for his tact and tended to be a screamer.Still it's a good solid dramaworth catching. I give it an 8.".

There lurks in all of us a beast capable of doing great evil that man's civilized self is forever trying to control.Henry Jekyll London society doctor is engaging in experiments to prove that theory. He's a gentleman in every sense of the word engaged to a proper English girl played by Rose Hobart here. It's funny but in none of the adaptions of this story is it ever explained what could be in the potion that Jekyll concocts and drinks. But drink it he does and Jekyll becomes the simian like Mr. Hyde evil incarnate itself.Another reviewer pointed out the film is actually based on a play adapted from the novel and done originally on stage by Richard Mansfield in London. In that play the character of Ivy a girl no better than she ought to be attracts the attention of Jekyll when he stops a man from assaulting her. He takes her up to her flat and she makes an effort to seduce him. He resists but the beast within remembers.This film becomes one of the first to deal with the phenomenon of stalking. Miriam Hopkins is a comely Ivy and Ivy herself is one of the most luckless characters ever created in fiction whether she was in the original story or not. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde made movie audiences and critics start to take Fredric March seriously as actor. Up to then he had played a variety of lightweight parts on screen. Even so Paramount after this still insisted on still casting him in those roles after he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. When he got free of that studio contract March got the parts he was so capable of. When MGM wanted to remake the film for Spencer Tracy they bought not just the rights from Paramount but the film itself. It was not seen for many years and the VHS version I have of it has an MGM opening logo but the cast at the end says Paramount. Kind of unusual to say the least.I do disagree with the application of the term science fiction to this story. Hyde is a beast. But he's not something created by nature or man nor is he an alien from another world. We all have a Hyde within us it's how well we control him in our selves and how well as a society we control the Hydes that would do us harm that deems whether we survive as a society or not.Hyde is very human with no superhuman powers and no created weaponry. Takes an extraordinary actor to play Jekyll and Hyde and do it well. Only the best take a crack at it like John Barrymore Spencer Tracy Jack Palance and Kirk Douglas. And March is one of the very best. See for yourself.".

None quite follow the original book whose tale is actually told backwards in a way. The book does not follow a series of linear events that lead to the socalled transformation. Instead rumors of a strange man surface between two characters in the very opening. We learn about Hyde first before Jekyll which is not the way any film adaptation has ever told the story.Still the present film has a lot going for it. At the forefront is Frederic March in the classic dual role of good and evil. When he first becomes Hyde I thought another actor was playing the role it's that good! Another distinctive aspect is the camera work which must have been extremely innovative for its time. The opening moments are shot with a first person perspective. The transformation is done relatively seamlessly considering CGI effects had yet to be invented. There are other moments of shadows and dark corridors. The atmospheric fog that permeates the entire film is worth the price of admission.As stated by other reviewers some of the dialog hearkens back to an earlier era of the Vaudeville Melodrama. Characters didn't just love each other they loved each other for eternity! Still a fine film all things considered dated perhaps in places but still March's performance is unbeatable and definitely deserved of the Academy Award for Best Actor.".

The answer of course is that this movie came out before enforcement of the Production Code at which time artistry in filmsboth style and substancetook a nose dive.This film is worth watching for its stunning camera work alone. It doesn't suffer from any of the awkwardness other films working in the early years of sound do. The camera's always moving there's terrific use of light and shadow and the scenes showing the transformation of Jekyll to Hyde are seamlessly filmed in what appear to be uninterrupted shots leaving you to ponder the sheer physical behindthescenes mechanics of them.But this movie isn't just more technically advanced than films later in the decade it's more adult in content too. No filming of this story ten years later I've not seen the Victor Fleming version for comparison would dare add the level of sexuality that this story does. Fredric March is very good in the dual role and when he transforms into Mr. Hyde you can see that it's everything within his power not to rip the dress right off whatever female he happens to be with and mount her right there.

Often hailed as the best of the many screen adaptations of the story director Robert Moumalin exploits the symbolic potential of the tale as well as boldly tapping into popular Freudian trends concerning sexual repression. The result is not a bythenumbers rendition but an effective interpretation with quirks and dimensions of its own. Yet the film belongs to Frederic March who scooped an Oscar for his sensational dual role. Although as Jekyll he unfortunately has to trade flowery romantic dialogue with Rose Hobart there can be no disputing the menace of his Hyde with his simianlike appearance top hat cloak and cane who turns cockney hooker Miriam Hopkins' life into a nightmare. It's a breathtaking transformation both physically thanks to stellar makeup and special effects and artistically and is undoubtedly the centrepiece of this excellent vintage classic.".

Often hailed as the best of the many screen adaptations of the story director Robert Moumalin exploits the symbolic potential of the tale as well as boldly tapping into popular Freudian trends concerning sexual repression. The result is not a bythenumbers rendition but an effective interpretation with quirks and dimensions of its own. Yet the film belongs to Frederic March who scooped an Oscar for his sensational dual role. Although as Jekyll he unfortunately has to trade flowery romantic dialogue with Rose Hobart there can be no disputing the menace of his Hyde with his simianlike appearance top hat cloak and cane who turns cockney hooker Miriam Hopkins' life into a nightmare. It's a breathtaking transformation both physically thanks to stellar makeup and special effects and artistically and is undoubtedly the centrepiece of this excellent vintage classic.";

First of all you have Fredric March whose tourdeforce performance as the goodnatured Jekyll and the monstrous Hyde earned him the Best Actor Oscar. Second the camera work by Karl Struss brilliantly captures the mood of the story. And lastly the transformation sequences set an enormous precedent for the later monster movies. It all blends together to form one of most amazing horror movies of the 1930's. Even today it still has the power to mesmerize and send chills down the spine of even the most hardened horror fan.".

	schema:headline " Renewed Sight for the Listening Camera";
	schema:reviewBody "As this film demonstrates director Rouben Mamoulian Applause 1929 and cinematographer Karl Struss Sunrise 1927 were two of the great innovators in renewing the role of the camera for the talkies. Lesser talents began the talkies much the same as silent films began with a static camera. The sound is still creaky as usual with awkward silences but it's not bothersome. The editing isn't always seamless here either and at times makes the film seem unpolished but that too is minor. This is the best version of Robert Louis Stevenson's novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in my opinion and that has very little to do with the actual story adaptation which comes more from the stage anyhow. It's the role of the camera that's remarkable.I don't mean to say that this adaptation is of little interest it's especially interesting when compared to the novella and its other adaptations. The 1920John Barrymore version features a more grotesque Hyde and a stiffer Jekyll. Here Jekyll is at first full of gaiety and youthful exuberance. That's more faithful to the novel but also reflects the filmmakers' intentions and the changes in Hollywood. The 1920 film was bolder in content in some respects it was a mood piece of horror and atmosphere. The fogy lamplit slums of London are still realized vividly in this one but much of the feeling in them is lost. On the other hand the mirror motif comes out more here which corresponds nicely with the doppelgnger or doubles theme inherit in the story. This 1931 film is of the classic Hollywood era. The added emphasis on the romance between Jekyll and Muriel is a result. This version is about more than the story though the major focus is in the camerawork.The film begins with about three and half minutes of long pointofview takes with a mobile camera from the perspective of Dr. Jekyll. It establishes the camera as an active participant in the film rather than merely a static recorder. Throughout the picture the camera continually movesfrom slight zooms dollies pans and tilts to dancelike tracking shots during the party sequence. Additionally some extreme closeups show only a character's eyes. A POV shot during Jekyll's first transition into Hyde turns into spinning memories which is in addition to the special effects that allow for transformations that are seen with fluent unbroken rhythm from the camera's eye.The camera positioning is varied as well and some shots are extraordinary just in their positions. The photography exploits the sets to greater effect occasionally and the filmmakers position props with the camera especially well and in rather thematic ways that apply to the story. Yet the photography is most brilliant when not subject to much scene dissection long takes that are unbroken and add more fluency to the already tight plot.One could say this is showy filmmaking even the transitional effects seem to draw attention to themselves lengthy dissolves that linger as superimposed images such as the image of Ivy's legs over the image of Jekyll and Dr. Lanyon's debate and wipes that create brief splitscreen shots. But the camera is the most essential part of filmmaking along with editing and it seems negligent to subject it to a role of impotenceto just recording an enacted play. This 1931 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a cinematic artwork and shows what film should be concerning the role of its most basic apparatus.".

A form of stiff melodrama where women still said things like Darling... I wish this moment would last forever and men replied Oh I love you... be near me always. And I love how the camera coyly veers away during the kissing scene. An odd dialogue gem is Dr.Jekyll Frederic March proclaiming We'll be so gloriously happy that even the French will be jealous of us. Look out too for Edgar Norton as Poole offering advice to Jekyll when told his fiance will be away for a month. I beg your pardon sir he says but may I suggest that you ought to amuse yourself? Yes the dialogue is overblown but in a wonderful glorious way. Like a great streamofconsciousness from the pen of a man who sees screen realism as just a petty distraction.But what really works is the innovation of the film almost dripping off the celluloid. I don't know if those wipes from scene to scene the fades and the firstperson perspective were originated here but they're used superbly nonetheless. Often the frame hesitates between wipes carving the illusion that so much is going on simultaneously that one screen cannot house it all. And the single take transformation As Hyde says What you are about to see is a secret you are sworn not to reveal  it's tinted lens effects were kept hidden for many years is absolutely magnificent even 70 years on.Every single shot is worked out with a mind to an unusual angle or a unique way of framing things but never so that it's showy. Often the main action will be taken via longshot the camera choosing to focus on a sole candelabrum in the foreground while the scene plays out. It's subtexts of bare backs cleavages thighs and garter belts are also quite racy for the time. Look how even when Jekyll has left Ivy behind her seductively rocking leg is merged with the next scene for nearly half a minute to indicate temptation is lingering in his mind. Outstanding.The sets too are unparalleled street settings often running to several levels and making a mockery of the rival studio's subrealist fare. The outdoor segments set to rain are exquisite and look out for an amusing scene  the first between Miriam Hopkins and Hyde  where they engage in an accidental spitting competition. As he says the phrase pig sty an unintentional ? spray of saliva coats his costar while a large globule of phlegm hits him in return as she says Buckingham Palace.Weirdly the Doctor's name is pronounced Geekul not the commonly held Jekull. I've always thought Jekyll seemed a creepier name than the passivesounding Hyde. Maybe that's the point and the duality of such a concept is passed forward by many shots of Hyde seeing his face via a mirror. March is not without the wit to add humour to his other persona who resembles more Dick Emery's comedy Vicar than anything truly horrific and is in equal terms expert in both pathos and menace. His physicality in the role also cannot be overlooked. Not only that but you get the real feeling that you're joining March on a discovery with each new turn of plot as much a surprise to him as it is to us. This is a real loving performance a far cry from the take the money and run sensibilities of The Wolf Man.Hyde has his violent moments threatening to glass a man with a broken bottle  His face was made for it  and intimating rape. It's a showstopping performance and there's even one scene where Hyde appears to break the fourth wall  yet he's looking through the camera and into the next room. Mere technicalities are beneath the thoroughly insane Hyde. I shall go only as far as the door and the sight of your tears will bring me back he hisses to a terrified Hopkins with doublemeaning menace.With it's literary script that encompasses both Bach and Shakespeare it's a lovably fluid fastpaced piece. Sometimes it's not always subtle  take the scene where Hopkins tells Jekyll he's got the kindest heart in the world and asks him for a bottle of poison so I can kill myself sir. But look at the anguish on March's face as the guilt of his alter ego's actions bleed through. If only all films could be made with such care and love in their craft. Absolutely Tremendous. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "While the titles Frankenstein and Dracula are the most popular surefire contenders for the most revolutionary horror film of 1931 I would strongly argue that the adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's story Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is another title to be considered. This film is not only significant in the fact that it's one of only two movies for there to be a tie between two actors in receiving the Academy Award for Best Leading Actor but it's revolutionary in its visual effects and Fredric March's portrayal of a ferocious twosided madman and the effect he has on the people around him as he jumps between sides.It's because of this film that many are familiar with the story of Jekyll and Hyde. And why shouldn't it be? The film uses the original Stevenson story only for inspiration and foundation and instead uses its own imagination to create something new and yet surprisingly powerful in its entertainment. Is it scary? No. Not by today's standards anyway. But is it haunting? Yes. It haunts you in the same way that Count Orlok haunted you in Nosferatu 1922. The vampire didn't scare you in that film. But the image of a tall pale rodentlike humanoid stalking about a castle hall after a petrified protagonist lingers on in your memory. As does the memory of Fredric March as she transforms from a handsome young scientist into an apelike monster that begins to hound and possess a helpless young woman played with great enthusiasm and energy by Miriam Hopkins most of whose performance had to be cut from the film due to censorship and therefore cost her the possibility of receiving an Academy Award nomination. Fredric March is equally brilliant as Jekyll and Hyde. The film also stars Rose Hobart as Jekyll's fiance Halliwell Hobbes as her suspicious father Edgar Norton as the comical stammering butler and Holmes Herbert in the one role that I think should have been developed a little more for the character does have impact in the last third of the story.Now I saw this film after I saw the 1941 remake with Spencer Tracy and for those not familiar with that film let me just warn you to see this movie first. The remake follows the same story almost as if it were by the book and recreates a lot of scenes but it does not deliver the same impact even though Tracy is almost as great as March in this film. It's only half the movie that this truly entertaining 1931 horror opus is.".

His stated goal is to make it possible for all people to be rid of their evil side for good so that it will trouble them no more this in turn will give the good side freedom to reach its full potential.Jekyll is engaged to a beautiful young woman named Muriel Rose Hobart whose father insists they wait for marriage. Jekyll is in love with and let's be honest hot for his fiance and wants to marry sooner but his intended does not want to hurt her father's feelings by going against his wishes so he agrees to wait for her.Meanwhile Jekyll has met a local tart named Ivy Miriam Hopkins spectacularly sexy and decidedly nonwaifish. He hears her scream  it appears although we don't see what actually happened that she has been hit and knocked down by a man  and he carries her up to the loft she lives in. After getting a good look at her handsome benefactor our Ivy decides to turn on both the poorme's and the sex appeal of which she has plenty especially in bed wearing nothing but a garter. The scene contains no nudity but innuendo and tension aplenty. When he finally tells her he has to go she calls out the words I have used as the title of my review to him.In the meantime his tries a new potion he has concocted on himself. This leads to his first transformation into Hyde who in this version is portrayed as somewhat apelike suggesting an evolutionary throwback always allowing for the theory of evolution. This character could care less about the mores of the society around him. Hyde's first emergence is cut short before he can cause any trouble by the arrival of his alterego's manservant.But Muriel and her father have gone away and Jekyll soon gives in to temptation drinking the potion again. This time he DOES go out and immediately seeks out what Jekyll wanted but denied himself  Ivy. He finds her at a seedy music hall where she performshangs out invites her to his table and comes on like the CroMagnon he is scoffing at men like his alterego who like your Ivy's legs but talk about your garter referring to the fact that Jekyll had warned Ivy earlier that her garter was tight enough to cut off her circulation.Ivy is soon and not exactly willingly shacked up with Hyde refusing to leave or try to find help for fear of him. But Hyde reads in the paper that his fiance and her father are coming back and informs Ivy that he will have to leave her for a time but If you do one thing I don't approve of while I'm gone . . . the least little thing mind you . . . I'll show you what horror means. Their goodbye scene is one of the most chilling in movie history perhaps as close as any filmmaker of this period would ever come to an actual rape scene.Jekyll is reunited with his fiance and future fatherinlaw and is able to convince the latter not to make them wait so long for their wedding.He goes home overjoyed but not for long. You see he sent Ivy fifty pounds cash as a way to try to make amends for his treatment of her as Hyde. But she appears in person. She doesn't want his money Hyde would only hurt her if he found out she had it she wants help getting out of the trap she is in with him at one point she shows Jekyll her back and although we are not shown the actual wounds she says Pretty ain't it? It's a whip that's what it is a whip!.Jekyll feeling more ashamed than ever of his behavior as Hyde gives his word to Ivy that Hyde will never come back she can keep the money without fear.Feeling better  after all he has made amends to Ivy he will soon be married to his fiance and he is rid of Hyde or so he thinks Jekyll goes for a pleasant walk in a park. But he sees a cat stalking  and although we are not shown this presumably killing and eating  a bird and this brings out the predator within himself again. After another transformation Hyde seeks out Ivy and after a horrific scene in which he confronts her over going to Jekyll for help kills her.Jekyll reads in the paper what he has done we are led to assume I think that he has no memory of his actions as Hydeand decides that the only peanance he can offer is to call off his engagement not to mention that he now feels he must leave Muriel for her own safety.But he transforms yet again  it's worth noting here that March is able to portray this transformation with his back to the camera as he peers in at the sobbing Muriel simply through body language  and goes back into his now exfiance's house. Hearing his daughter's scream her father comes running in and is killed by Hyde.It all ends in a police chase and the death by shooting of HydeJekyll.Worth a look definitely.Cheers.".

When he finally tells her he has to go she calls out the words I have used as the title of my review to him.In the meantime his tries a new potion he has concocted on himself. This leads to his first transformation into Hyde who in this version is portrayed as somewhat apelike suggesting an evolutionary throwback always allowing for the theory of evolution. This character could care less about the mores of the society around him. Hyde's first emergence is cut short before he can cause any trouble by the arrival of his alterego's manservant.But Muriel and her father have gone away and Jekyll soon gives in to temptation drinking the potion again. This time he DOES go out and immediately seeks out what Jekyll wanted but denied himself  Ivy. He finds her at a seedy music hall where she performshangs out invites her to his table and comes on like the CroMagnon he is scoffing at men like his alterego who like your Ivy's legs but talk about your garter referring to the fact that Jekyll had warned Ivy earlier that her garter was tight enough to cut off her circulation.Ivy is soon and not exactly willingly shacked up with Hyde refusing to leave or try to find help for fear of him. But Hyde reads in the paper that his fiance and her father are coming back and informs Ivy that he will have to leave her for a time but If you do one thing I don't approve of while I'm gone . . . the least little thing mind you . . . I'll show you what horror means. Their goodbye scene is one of the most chilling in movie history perhaps as close as any filmmaker of this period would ever come to an actual rape scene.Jekyll is reunited with his fiance and future fatherinlaw and is able to convince the latter not to make them wait so long for their wedding.He goes home overjoyed but not for long. You see he sent Ivy fifty pounds cash as a way to try to make amends for his treatment of her as Hyde. But she appears in person. She doesn't want his money Hyde would only hurt her if he found out she had it she wants help getting out of the trap she is in with him at one point she shows Jekyll her back and although we are not shown the actual wounds she says Pretty ain't it? It's a whip that's what it is a whip!.Jekyll feeling more ashamed than ever of his behavior as Hyde gives his word to Ivy that Hyde will never come back she can keep the money without fear.Feeling better  after all he has made amends to Ivy he will soon be married to his fiance and he is rid of Hyde or so he thinks Jekyll goes for a pleasant walk in a park. But he sees a cat stalking  and although we are not shown this presumably killing and eating  a bird and this brings out the predator within himself again. After another transformation Hyde seeks out Ivy and after a horrific scene in which he confronts her over going to Jekyll for help kills her.Jekyll reads in the paper what he has done we are led to assume I think that he has no memory of his actions as Hydeand decides that the only peanance he can offer is to call off his engagement not to mention that he now feels he must leave Muriel for her own safety.But he transforms yet again  it's worth noting here that March is able to portray this transformation with his back to the camera as he peers in at the sobbing Muriel simply through body language  and goes back into his now exfiance's house. Hearing his daughter's scream her father comes running in and is killed by Hyde.It all ends in a police chase and the death by shooting of HydeJekyll.Worth a look definitely.Cheers.";

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read Stevenson's famous novel but this film is adapted from a play which is supposedly a lot different anyway. The story is really not especially great. A scientist makes a potion that turns him into a total spazz. The spazz version ruins Dr. Jekyll's romance with Rose Hobart and tortures a loose woman played by Miriam Hopkins. The film turns out to be completely amazing however thanks to the lead performance by Fredric March and the elegant direction by Rouben Mamoulian. Every time I see March in a film I become more impressed by his range. Of course this is a perfect vehicle to demonstrate one's range and he excels as both Jekyll and Hyde though his Hyde is what most will remember. Looking at his filmography Mamoulian directed relatively few films for a director of his era not to mention talent. I need to see more most notably Love Me Tonight but he will always be a genius in my book for Queen Christina. His direction of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is beautiful and nearly flawless. A lot of the film is made from the direct pointofview of Jekyll and he uses a firstperson technique that works brilliantly. Between March and Mamoulian the general silliness of the story is completely made up for. March's female costars Hopkins and Hobart are quite good as well.".

	schema:headline " PreCode JekyllHyde With The Amazing Fredric March!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is viewed by many to be the best cinematic retelling of Stevenson's original work which is a tad odd as very little of the novella remains. The concept of the duality of human nature is still present in March's Dr JekyllHyde but a whole lot of sex and daring visual effects have been added to Stevenson's controversial Victorian work. The result? An excellent and entertaining film that will stay in the mind for quite some time.Fredric March one of the best actors of all time won the Academy Award for playing the dual roles. It's not hard to see why March is excellent in this one and plays both Jekyll and Hyde with enthusiasm and vigour. It's a very theatrical performance by today's standards. but what a fun performance it is! March shows his incredible acting range here.March's Jekyll is a repressed Victorian doctor who is interested in both separating the two sides of human nature 'good' and 'evil' from each other and quickly marrying his rich fianc Muriel Carew Rose Hobart. A slight hitch in his plans Muriel's father insists that the two lovers must wait eight months before they are married so they can wed on the anniversary of his own wedding. It's a rather laughable concept actually but it serves it's purpose as the precursor to March's wild rampage as Hyde. It seems the primary reason Jekyll wants to marry Muriel is to bed her and when he can't do that he takes a concoction of drugs and turns into the simian sexually uninhibited Hyde.March's makeup almost destroyed his wonderful looks forever so it deserves a mention here. Looking at through today's CGItrained eyes March's Hyde is ridiculously overdone and more comical than scary. Tracy's 1941 Hyde is a much subtler figure which suits the narrative better in some ways. However Mamoulian effectively conveys to the audience in his version that Hyde is having a lot of fun is liberated in his personal and sexual freedom hence the 'comical' aspects. March amazing in both comedy and drama plays him at first like a freewheeling puppy eager for discovery than as a real monster as he degenerates both in appearance and behaviour. The simian makeup suits the notion of Hyde being 'semievolved' in nature so it all works out in the end.Miriam Hopkins is the Cockney slut Ivy who Jekyll goodnaturedly attends to at first then brutalizes her as Hyde. March's first encounter as Jekyll with Hopkin's Hyde is a eroticallycharged provocative affair. Jekyll's primal instincts and his need to unleash them quickly are displayed in his overt sexual interest in Ivy. She's a girl who knows the value of sex too as she sexily strips for him after he makes a suggestive comment that her garter is perhaps too tight. For those interested in film history take note of these powerful scenes between March and Hopkins they would help bring on the Production Code in a couple of years. A sexually aroused Jekyll is grabbed and kissed by an explicit Ivy while she lies visibly naked in bed something that would be absolutely banished from films in just a few years.Hopkins turns in an excellent performance in this one very convincing as the 'Tart With A Heart' Ivy. She's a brazen sexual creature complete with brassy blonde hair and cleavage yet she's also sympathetic . Her situation with Hyde where she is 'kept' by him is borne as much out of economic necessity as it is out of total fear. And total fear is what Hopkins does best here her scenes with March ravishing her as Hyde are among the best in film history. She's a cheap tragic figure and provides an interesting contrast to the 'other side' of Victorian society reflected in Jekyll's fianc Muriel.Hobart is rather weak in a role that is admittedly poorly written. She has a onedimensional role and Hopkins is given much more opportunity to shine. Interesting to see March and Hopkins battle it out actingwise. Mamoulian builds an amazing atmosphere here with some studiobound yet very Expressionistic sets. Lighting is used to great effect and the camera work was revolutionary for it's time. The subjective camerawork at the beginning where we see the action through Jekyll's eyes was innovative a little shaky but innovative all the sameas were the wipes used constantly to juxtapose Ivy and Muriel. The garden party scene with March and Hobart has some oddly fascinating shots with Mamoulian focusing on the lover's eyes and foreheads when they are professing their love. Symbolism is used nicely throughout with a number of prominent statues and paintings depicting naked women. The fireandbrimstone hell imagery of Jekyll's lab is also a clever visual effect Jekyll is truly a man about to 'boil over'.The transformation sequences are amazing for their time and March acts them so well. Much of the dialogue spoken is melodramatic and rather hokey yet we have some great lines. There's some rather fascinating religious overtones to March's Jekyll who is looked upon as a Godlike figure by a number of characters. The crippled girl's cry with hands out to Jekyll 'I can walk sir!' is one of religious ecstasy and Ivy looks upon him as a saint who can save her from Hyde. Alas that cannot be. Hyde is a sinner as Jekyll is a saint and we know exactly what he does with Ivy when the scenes fade to black.I consider this better than 'Dracula' or 'Frankenstein' both 1931 films for Mamoulian's stylish direction the presence of viable female characters the brilliant camerawork and the acting of March and Hopkins.Not the original source material but a darn good film that uses the female characters and the addition of sex to underline the dual side of man.".

	schema:reviewBody "When speaking about horror films from the 30s almost invariably the conversation moves around Universal Studios and the remarkable movies it released on that decade. However Universal was not the only studio that released a horror classic and while 1931 is often remembered as the year of Tod Browning's Dracula and James Whale's Frankenstein it was also the year of another horror classic that deserves a mention Rouben Mamoulian's amazing version of Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. titled simply Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde the film was previously adapted with good results in 1920 with the legendary actor John Barrymore as the main character however Mamoulian's version is nowadays considered the definitive version of the novel and Paramount's answer to Universal's efforts in the horror genre.Adapted by Samuel Hoffenstein and Percy Heath the film successfully translates the theme and mood of the novel although like the previous silent version does some changes to the plot. Still the basic story is the tale of Dr. Henry Jekyll Fredric March a successful doctor who is convinced that he can isolate the evil in human's soul. As he drinks a potion he invents for this purpose he sets free all the evil in his persona becoming Mr. Hyde a brutish man who exists only to make evil. Now Dr. Jekyll will have to face the consequences of letting Mr. Hyde out.From the brilliant opening scene one of the most amazing uses of subjective camera the film becomes a captivating experience thanks to the very artistic style that Mamoulian gives to the film. A former Broadway director Mamoulian responds to Universal's famous expressionist art direction with a brave and intelligent use of the camera. It's amazing that in this his third film Mamoulian already shows a domain of this new language leaving an influential work still relevant to this day. The way the film is edited is also another of Mamoulian's impressive creations as he plays with the subconscious via transparent merging of images and a lot of sexual imagery a bold move even for a preHays code film.Hoffenstein and Heath's adaptation of the story has now become the best remembered version of the novel mainly because it translates remarkably well the story from paper written from the point of view of one of Jekyll's friends to visuals making Jekyll the lead with better results than the 1920s version. Just as brave as Mamoulian's bold use of sexual imagery is the sexual innuendo that fills the script and is also one of the films that are not only horrific in imagery but also in words. Hyde's words have a powerful psychological impact that more than 70 years later still give the chills when pronounced by March.And this takes us to Fredric March's performance as both Jekyll  Hyde. While it's certainly difficult to beat the legendary Barrymore March really succeeds in making an equally impressive performance by making his own interpretation of the character his Hyde seems less sinister but considerably more aggressive primal and brutal giving the final touch to Mamoulian's outstanding version of the novel. Another highlight is Miriam Hopkins' performance as Ivy Pearson a prostitute that becomes the focus of Hyde's most violent actions. Hopkins really transmits the fear that this man creates and in a frighteningly believable performance becomes our eyes in the chaos. Rose Hobart and Holmes Herbert complete the cast but none reach the high levels of perfection that both March and Hopkins achieve.Being a fan of the silent version with Barrymore I was expecting a very disappointing film so my surprise was huge at discovering that not only this film equals the first one in terms of acting it's an overall superior film in many other aspects. Mamoulian's film is a jewel on the level of the more famous Universal's films and possibly outshines them too as it's a proof that with inventive and creativity one can create a great film despite the lowbudget. The 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde really lives up to the hype of being the definitive version of R.L. Stevenson's famed novel.It's sad that Mamoulian was literally fired from the movie industry in the 60s after being one of the most inventive although less prolific directors. Still his knowledge as Broadway director and his enormous creativity played an important role in the films he directed and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is probably among the top 5 of his career. 1010. Definitely a mustsee.".

The 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde really lives up to the hype of being the definitive version of R.L. Stevenson's famed novel.It's sad that Mamoulian was literally fired from the movie industry in the 60s after being one of the most inventive although less prolific directors. Still his knowledge as Broadway director and his enormous creativity played an important role in the films he directed and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is probably among the top 5 of his career. 1010. Definitely a mustsee.";

	schema:reviewBody "Everybody knows the famous Universal classic monster movies Dracula and Frankenstein which both are also from 1931. Not nearly as many people known or have seen this movie that in my opinion is just as good and worthy of the 'classic' status as both of those two movies.This movie quite surprised me honestly. I expected this movie to be good but not that good as it turned out it was. It's a great story told with lots of creativity. It makes the story tense and compelling and the action even spectacular. The story itself on its own is already great but it becomes even better and more powerful through the way it is told in the movie.Above all the movie is a very beautiful one that is filled with symbolism and creatively put together sequences. The entire movie has some great looking costumes and settings and is brilliantly filmed. Especially the cinematography is fantastic. The movie is filled with sequences that are shot from Jekyll's point of view. It provides the movie with some very special moments although those sequences seem pretty random to be honest. The best moment with this is the begin sequence which lasts about 4 minutes although it obviously has some cuts in it and is shot entirely from Jekyll's point of view and it has some creative moments in it such as use of shadow and mirror look. It's not that realistic looking but it's creative and refreshing nevertheless.The story is about the eternal battle of good versus evil only this time set in the mind of one person. The sequences were the main character switches between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are well balanced with as a result that both characters which are the same but yet so totally different work out just as well. It makes the drama feel realistic and sensible and the 'horror' tense and unpredictable.The movie certainly benefits from Frederich March's performance as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He plays both the characters totally differently and at times it's hard to believe both characters are performed by the main character. He is very believable in both parts which are completely different from each other. He plays Dr. Jekyll sensible and Mr. Hyde deliciously villainous and monstrous. Also the other actors play fine. Rose Hobart perhaps goes a bit too overthetop but Miriam Hopkins on the other hand was great. Of course the make up effects and camera tricks are extremely outdated by todays standard but they are at least not as laughable as you would expect. Especially the make up for Mr. Hyde looks quite good.I also was surprised by this movie its sexual tension and references. Miriam Hopkins shows quite some skin and does some daring things. Overall the sequences with Hyde and Ivy the name of the Mirian Hopkins character are dripping with sexual tension. Quite amazing for an 1931 movie and it came quite unexpected for me. But it makes the movie all the more refreshing and original. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is far from your standard '30's monster movie.Normally '30's pictures end quite abruptly without a real bigbang and are a sort of a let down. Not Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It's ending is tense action filled and even quite spectacular.It's a very creative and refreshing movie from director Rouben Mamoulian who directed quite some good movie's in the '30's and '40's but still is a sort of forgotten director. Just like the other 1931 monster movies Dracula and Frankenstein this is an absolute mustsee that at least is just as good if not better at certain moments.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Fredric March shines in this early screen version of the enduring Robert Louis Stevenson story which explores the duality in all of us. Dr. Henry Jekyll March is a scientist advancing such an idea which doesn't sit well with his peers. Naturally when he dares to pursue such heretical fancies he will pay a price his Mr. Hyde is an ugly brute who completely gives in to all of mans' basest impulses and this gets him in deeper and deeper trouble. When watching this adaptation one can hardly fail to notice the style and innovation brought to the camera work the editing and the scene transitions as we get an early version of what's come to be known as split screen. The film even begins with what we know as the subjective camera technique where we see things from a characters' perspective in this case Dr. Jekyll and it's at least a couple of minutes before we switch to an objective view. The Expressionist cinematography was done by Karl Struss. The way that the transformation scenes are done would be revisited in such later films as The Wolf Man and the convincing makeup is done by Wally Westmore an underrated and overlooked makeup effects man from this period whose work can also be seen in Island of Lost Souls. Director Rouben Mamoulian and the screenwriters Samuel Hoffenstein and Percy Heath are able to inject their material with a ripe amount of sex as this was done in the preCode days. Musical performer and actress Miriam Hopkins shows quite a bit of leg for one thing. And in scenes where she must contend with the beastly Hyde there's an undeniable amount of uncomfortable sexual tension. The actors are all superb and it's very noteworthy that March should have won a Best Actor Academy Award for his performances as it's not that often the Academy acknowledges horror films for this aspect. March is believable every step of the way when he's Jekyll you can't help but like him when he's Hyde he just creeps you out. Hopkins is equal parts touching and saucy and Rose Hobart is appealing as Jekylls' bride to be Muriel. Holmes Herbert Halliwell Hobbes Edgar Norton and Tempe Pigott comprise the rest of the solid supporting players. With all of this going for it the '31 production of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is worthy viewing for fans of the classic black  white horror films who want to discover the kinds of things that filmmakers could get away with before the Code started stifling their creative efforts. This story has of course been done many times since but this would be the ideal adaptation with which to start. It's available on a flipper disc from Warner Bros. that pairs it with the 1941 version starring Spencer Tracy so one can have an interesting time comparing the two films. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "This take on the classic Robert Louis Stevenson story is classic in its own right and works on many levels. There's the obvious psychological component to the story with Jekyll representing the egosuperego and Hyde the id. We also have the theme of the scientist tampering with nature with an altruistic goal in this case to rid the psyche of the bad side become 'supergood' and achieve more but with a disastrous result that quickly gets out of his hands. But perhaps most importantly we have the sheer horror of a man unchecked by morality who is 'free' from constraint and who promptly rapes brutalizes and murders before running off into the foggy London night. He's not an unthinking animal however  he has all of his cognitive abilities speaks and uses logic to elude capture  and this combined with film sequences that are shot from JekyllHyde's perspective amplify the fact that this villain is within us all which is the greatest horror of all.As an aside isn't it interesting that while Dr. Jekyll clearly contains the two sides of man the good and the evil the female characters in the film seem to be neatly onedimensional Muriel his fiance 'good' and Ivy the dancehall girl 'bad'. And that after he's taken the potion he gets darker in addition to becoming uglier and needing some serious orthodontia? But I digress. Frederic March is fantastic as Jekyll and Hyde and won an Oscar for his performance. He plays the lecher without mercy and leaps around during some exciting chase sequences. The scene where he shows up in Ivy's mirror after she's been assured by Dr. Jekyll that he's gone for good is frightening. Dr. Jekyll thought he could make that promise before he realized that not taking the potion was no longer sufficient to stop the transformation to Mr. Hyde and that mere impure thought could now bring it about. It's hard to put the lid back on once Pandora's Box has been opened.Miriam Hopkins shows nice range as Ivy first absolutely sizzling in a scene where she tries to seduce Dr. Jekyll a scene ending with her swinging her bare leg from a bed giving him a serious ravageme look responding to his saying he can't return playfully with oh yes you can and imploring him to Come back soon won't you?....Soon...Come back. Yowza. Later she's suitably horrified by Mr. Hyde who does have his way with her and abuses her without mercy. she only shows the whip marks to Jekyll we neither see this happening or the marks themselves  but it's enough to make us shiver That dangling leg is left superimposed on the screen for some time while Dr. Jekyll walks off with a colleague exclaiming Can a man dying of thirst forget water? Do you know what would happen to that thirst if it were denied water? His marriage to Muriel has been delayed at her father's request the suggestion is he's sexually frustrated and after taking the potion he makes a beeline back to see Ivy.Aside from special effects that are outstanding for the time period and which hold up well today particularly the first transformation the film adds some other nice touches. Dr. Jekyll's organ playing is brief but adds a manic and morbid tone as the film cuts to a candelabra a statue a bust and a tight shot of his servant's face in succession. At one point Dr. Jekyll is in the park hears birdsong and quotes Keats' 'Ode to a Nightingale' thou wast not born for death immortal Bird! No hungry generations tread thee down  before seeing a cat advancing along the branch to silence that song. Later as Hyde strangles Ivy they slump behind a bed revealing in the background a replica of Canova's 'Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss' which director Rouben Mamoulian leaves us with until Hyde gets back up.The movie has some pretty dark content but it's asking questions about man's nature and this version is balanced and moves along well. Definitely a classic.".

What I found interesting is how great the special effects were as Jekyll transformed into Hyde. It was amazing considering that it was 1931. Miriam Hopkins was vivacious and appealed nicely to the dark sexual side of Hyde. This version gave a fleeting glimpse of skin that would not be seen post code. But that is not the appeal the real attraction is March who is stellar in his portrayal of both characters. The pennance Jekyll does as he laments his murder makes for a neat ending and his transformation as he dies back to the good doctor.".

	schema:headline " This is a sexy preCode version and explores a different type of Dr. Jekyll";
	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately NONE of the Dr. Jekyll movies I have seen do justice to the original novel by Robert Lewis Stevenson. The biggest problem with any of the movies is that in the original book the reader had no idea that Jekyll and Hyde were the same person until the end of the story they were much more physically different than in the moviesHyde was significantly shorter. This mysterysuspense element is missing from all the movies and probably can't be done anyway since so many people are familiar with the plot. It's really too bad as this really made the book so wonderful.I have seen several versions of the Dr. Jekyll movieseven the pretty obscure television version with Jack Palance. This Frederic March film is definitely unique though because it was made PreCode and as such is a much more sexual movieand this makes it better in some ways than the other Jekyll movies because the doctor's motivation for his experiments take on an added dimension. The film is all about the dangers of sexual repression as the good doctor is very very sexually frustrated. It seems he is ready to marry his lovely fiance NOW but her stuffy and asexual father won't allow them to marry until a suitable period has elapsed 10 months! When Jekyll's friends and butler suggest he go out and have a good time he truly can't as in his day a gentleman's reputation was superimportant. As a result he creates the Hyde persona so he can sleep around and not face public ridicule!! This is so so different from other Hyde films and is sort of like a combination of the classic tale with Freudian views of repression and sex! As far as the rest of the film goes it is very competently acted and directed except for one minor problem. Towards the end the film seems a little too melodramatic when Jekyll breaks off his engagement to his fiancethey just laid it on a little too thick. Otherwise an interesting and compelling psychological portrait about sexual repression.FYIOddly Jekyll's name is pronounced GeeKil throughout the film. It seems the more traditional Jekil that we are more familiar with was popularized in the Spencer Tracy version of 1941.PSAbout a week after seeing this film I also saw the 1941 version again for the second time. Overall the 1931 film is definitely better because it takes more risks and because the 1941 film seems like an almost direct copy at times.".

	schema:headline " A conservative view of science.";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1931 film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde takes the author's fable and utilises it on the one hand as a means to create a work of art. However on the other hand the author's fable is utilised as a means to take a conservative swipe at existentialist free thinking science. As such it suggests that science without the control of a moral code has the potential to morph into a hideous monster. But as Jeykll Fredeeric March suggests in a utilitarian statement science needs to make mistakes in order to advance for the good. By such a method science becomes a questionable subject for conservative values thereby forcing dilemmas relavant today as to whether genetic modification and cloning are synonymous with good or evil.This film adaptation of Stevenson's fable also suggests that all men are innate misogynistic monsters who are capable of domestic abuse rape and murder of women. But as Ivy Pearson intelligently portrayed by Mirriam Hopkins who gives just the right amount of fear to an otherwise histrionic part suggests women sex workers are a legitimised target for such evil. They are from a conservative perspective immoral undeserving nonentities and as such without society's respect and thus no protection. In this respect Hyde is an ironically justified character because he rids society of women who work in the sex industry. Ivy's character is juxtaposed with Muriul Carew's Rose Hobert virtuous 'lady'. Because she subscribes to man made moral values she gains the utmost respect of Dr. Jekyll. In this respect the film suggests that men's behaviour is subject to women's actions. Moreover it highlights the double standards men have regarding women.Another underlying theme in the film is that of drug addiction  opium use was prevalent in Victorian society which was according to the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle the narcotic of choice among English gentleman in the 19th Century as explained via his fictional character Sherlock Holmes. Here the film deals with the negative affects of drug addiction. Drug addiction as the film suggests makes monsters out of gentleman thereby making excuses for men's negative behaviour towards women. While this is a well made film its character Dr. Hyde's appearance has a B movie like quality which is comedic and is no doubt what influenced comedy adaptations of Stevenson's fable such as Abbot and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1953. This is not intended to detract from the artistic direction of the film by director Rouben Mamoulian which is brilliant in that it makes way for experimentation with the then new fangled cinematic technology. Of course 'experimantation' is within the heart of the film As such Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1931 is a blueprint if not a lesson in how to use cinematic technology imaginatively to create a masterpiece. Kudos also goes to actors Frederic March deserving of his Oscar and scene steelers Miriam Hopkins and Edgar Norton the latter as Jekyll's valet Poole.In sum Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1931 is a creative imaginative work of art which is cleverly utilised to critique scientific experimentation drug addiction and to examine ideas of morality while confronting society with its double standards towards women.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the German version of the film. Although this is not a great film I think it is quite goodespecially considering the obviously small budget and the young actors involved. I was taken in by all four main actors particularly Ioana Iacob and Alicja Bachleda. The camera loves them. The casting of the two male leads was just fine too. David Zimmerschied was perfect as a geeky Hitlerjugend. I also cannot follow the criticism that the actors are somehow overly theatrical or that the film is devoid of emotion. Actually it is quite an emotional film but the great losses both personal and cultural are not shown directly in the film except for the symbolic picture of Felix's house going up in flames right before the end. The personal loss really only comes out as a footnote at the end when the writer reveals the story's outcome to Gisela's lookalike. This loss is of course a very politically sensitive topic. Germanspeaking artists want to make sure not to overplay the sense of loss or wrongdoing for fear of playing into the hands of people on the extreme right and for fear of offending the peoples who suffered so heavily under the Germans during the war. That is a story for others to tell see e.g. I Served the King of England.The film does jump around at the beginning in a way that may confuse viewers and the narrative is a bit choppy in places. It would have been a good idea to flash dates or otherwise provide historical context so that we knew exactly when each scene was playing. The soft focus of the flashback was just a tad too romantic the colors in the film just a tad too bright. The heavy scent of nostalgia however probably is culturally authentic for Germans of a certain age in the former AustroHungarian empire. I do agree that some scenes somehow missed reaching their potential. The tension and attraction between Felix and Gisela just never seemed to reach the right temperature. Alfa on the other hand was really convincing and sexy as a highstrung noble lass torn between darkness and light. What is timely about this film is that it is part of a development since the fall of communism to tell the story of the price that Germans and Germanspeaking minorities paid for Germany's attempt to conquer Europe. See e.g. Nobel Prize in Literature given to Herta Mller. No single film is going to be able to tell the entire story. The Beheaded Rooster focuses on a very limited time and place and still has to leave out lots of details. I wonder how historically accurate it is. Did the Jews in fascist Romania not have to wear gold stars? How far were the Nuremberg Laws implemented? Were there no mass deportations etc? Nevertheless what is convincing about the film is the tension among different groups in the society the fluidity of a situation in which individuals may have had more freedom of action than often is believed in spite of the threat from above. I recognized myself in the younger characters Felix and Hans. The hunt and capture games in the woods the blood brotherhood the betrayal of friendships. These are universal themes. We also experience the political tensions within Felix's family. Granted the Nazi aunt is overplayed but these are not all clichs. The scene between the father and Felix at the dinner table when Felix appears to have become a zealot is good and dramatic. I think the relationship between Felix his father and his brother is wellplayed if understated. Also credible is the gradual realization by Felix that he was wrong about the Nazis. Maybe we should have seen more of the suffering of the oppressed minorities in fascist Romania. Maybe everything is just a touch too colorful or sweet. Who knows? This is Radu Gabrea's and Eginald Schlattner's story and I really enjoyedit. I look forward to reading the novel. Let's hear it for a new wave of smallbudget European films and the filmmakers who have learned to tell wonderful slow stories that we want to watch.".

The actors are very poorly directed so they play theatrically demonstratively and with grandiloquent mannerisms  which is understandable since Radu Gabrea is one of the socalled middle aged dinosaurs of Romanian cinema the '70s generation today deeply afflicted by obsoleteness.The saddest thing of all is that although dealing with the traumatic events surrounding the tragedy of an ethnic minority in the dark years of World War 2 The Beheaded Rooster remains devoid of any emotion.

Unfortunately 'Der gekpfte Hahn' almost completely fails on all plans. The film is directed by Radu Gabrea who as a young director in Communist Romania had an amazing first film in 1969 'Prea mic pentru un razboi atit de mare' too young for such a great war which precluded the theme of contrast between the innocence of childhood and the horrors of war. His career could not be continued at a sustained pace under the Communist regime he made very few films and this is the first that I am seeing for a long while. It is however a big disappointment. The history of the years 1940 to 1944 with the complex relations between the different communities coexisting in the city of Fagaras is described in a schematic manner the characters are more stereotypes than real life people they fail to move or to attract sympathy and the story telling flows painfully with characters showing up from nowhere and disappearing without trace. I hope that some these amazing pieces in the history of Romania will have a better chance on screens in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der gekpfte Hahn or The Beheaded Rooster is a coproduction between Germany and Romania from 2007 so this movie in the German language has its 10th anniversary this year. The director ans also one of the writers is Radu Gabrea a filmmaker from Bucharest who died very recently actually at the age of 79. He made several films in the German language too during his long career and this one here may very well be the most known. Still fitting with his own background the film is set in Romania and we find our how life changes for everybody when the Nazis come to the country and impose their views on the local population. Some reach out to them right away others may need some more convincing. This film is in particular a depiction of how the younger part of the population reacts to this new situation. Anyway sadly this is a mediocre work overall but I guess if there are so many films dealing with the subject of WWII and the Nazis then there is a also a great deal of mediocrity and the fact where this is set changes very little in terms of the film's quality level.It is not a bad movie by any means but it is a film that does not deliver anything new to the genre at all and beyond that also stays very superficial and shallow despite occasionally trying to make an impact. Unsuccessfully. The baity title and the scene related to it are the best example actually. Both offer really nothing apart from disgust and shock value probably although both try to make an impact certainly. I am sure if you try hard enough you can dig out a metaphor about the entire thing but you have to dig really deep here. The performances also weren't as good for the most part. Some serious cases of overacting and none of the actors really has the talent from what I saw to elevate the forgettable material. Then again the latter is also not helping the cast at all so it's kinda difficult to put any blame on them. The character transformation of the central character young Goldschmidt felt extremely rushed and as it is such a crucial component it hurts the entire film. Female characters were mostly underwritten or used in a way where they felt fairly stereotypical and generic unfortunately. The latter adjective is also an accurate description of the entire almost 100 minutes. For me the dragging was far more significant than the memorable moments. If there were any that is. Not recommended.".

One of the sisters the sympathetic and essentially goodhearted Agnes Harriet Andersson in a gutwrenching performance is dying from an indeterminate cancer and it is her slow journey towards death its effect on her sisters and Anna the maid and its aftermath that is the center of this story. Though why she and not her sisters should be afflicted neither the movie nor Bergman can explain and rings out as an injustice.The reason if the other two sisters are variations of monstrous people who are successful Karin Ingrid Thulin is what seems to be an icy control freak not a horrible woman but close who cannot stand human touch of any kind and we're privy to her torment in a flashback where she uses a piece of a broken wine glass to literally mutilate her vagina seemingly enjoying it as she shocks her husband while writhing in unspeakable pain. Maria Liv Ullmann shows less is more of an enigma and a hard character to pinpoint but she's equally manipulative if not flatly repulsive she not only tries to resume an affair with Agnes' doctor who points out she her internal ugliness is starting to show through her facial expressions as she apparently enjoys this criticism but she also fails to help her husband at a critical moment when he stabs himself in the stomach. Later on both sisters particularly Karin verbally express their hatred for each other in a powerful montage that leads to a moment of equally intense reconciliation that comes without the use of dialogue and is emphasized by the swell of music Chopin. Ingrid Thulin stands out letting the gamut of Karin's sheer rage our out of her visage while suddenly changing back to a softer self then to her steely image of selfcontrol and back to fury in a snap of fingers.There's a lingering question throughout the movie there must have been some extreme trauma some truly horrific event or events that must have set forth the deluge of pain that rips throughout the entire story right up until the end. Karin herself alludes to the tissue of lies that could mean anything possible sexual abuse by the unseen father a complicity between Maria and her mother and Agnes in the center rejected. Although Karin does mention the revulsion she felt towards Maria one can only wonder what it was that transpired which seems to have driven her into momentary lapses of insanity. In fact her selfhatred mirrors Agnes' intense suffering rather closely although both characters rarely interact and are on entirely different planes. In some ways it wouldn't be out of place to say that Agnes despite the unimaginable suffering she endures serves as merely a catalyst a materialization of the horror Karin herself has had to face. At least Agnes has experienced a form of love if selfless under the guise of Anna who comes to her aid gives of her breast in an almost saintlike passion. Karin only has the cold future of her own dismal life to face. And Maria isn't even alive but sadistically observing.Aside from PERSONA this has to be one of Ingmar Bergman's most powerful works one that hits an audience at a gut level cliched as though it may sound. The dominant color red only adds tension to the already tense scenes between the quartet of women and the men who only make pat but indelible appearances. Woody Allen would use these stylizations of the face looking dead at the camera telling a story of its own in INTERIORS another looks at three sisters neither of them sympathetic. Grueling sometimes unwatchable this is movie watching at its best.".

	schema:reviewBody "The idea of this film that is considered by many as Bergman's crown achievement came to him in his house at Faro where he lived by himself for sometime in a melancholy state of mind after a rather painful breakup. One image kept coming to him and it was a very vivid and persistent image of a red room red walls red furniture and four women sitting at the window in the room and dressed by the fashion of the beginning of the 20th century. He could not shake the image out of his mind and he knew that the only way to deal with it would be to start writing about the women  who were they what was their relationship their lives their fates?.. He also knew that should the movie be made of his writing the dominating color of it would be red. Bergman talked with affection and gratitude about his friend and long time collaborator Swen Nykwist who spent many days creating the passionate haunting red world of Cries and Whispers. The title came to Bergman from one of the reviews on a Mozart's sonata he does not remember which one. The sonata was described as sounds of cries and whispers Cries and Whispers is about pain death love lust hate and selfloathing. There are more than one scene in the film that I found unbearable horrifying and depressing. In the same time it is about beauty and power of life every minute of it  how little we appreciated it until it is too late. Typical Bergman's subjects Bergman's actresses giving amazing performances strikingly beautiful  it even hurts your eyes cinematography by Sven Nykvist  typical Bergman's masterpiece  what less do we expect from him? I admire the brilliance of it acting cinematography Bergman's simple but devastating approach to Death as an inevitable part of life. The ending is heartbreaking  with Harriet's face and her words from beyond the grave about appreciating every minute of life...Powerful and devastating film.".

The title came to Bergman from one of the reviews on a Mozart's sonata he does not remember which one. The sonata was described as sounds of cries and whispers Cries and Whispers is about pain death love lust hate and selfloathing. There are more than one scene in the film that I found unbearable horrifying and depressing. In the same time it is about beauty and power of life every minute of it  how little we appreciated it until it is too late. Typical Bergman's subjects Bergman's actresses giving amazing performances strikingly beautiful  it even hurts your eyes cinematography by Sven Nykvist  typical Bergman's masterpiece  what less do we expect from him? I admire the brilliance of it acting cinematography Bergman's simple but devastating approach to Death as an inevitable part of life. The ending is heartbreaking  with Harriet's face and her words from beyond the grave about appreciating every minute of life...Powerful and devastating film.";

It centres on three sisters one dying of cancer another trapped in a repellent marriage and the last engaged in an uncomfortable affair. Moving between these three women is the maid who tends the dying woman in her agony and in one stunning scene holding her to her naked bosom like a mother holding a child.It is not then a barrel of laughs. Bergman films are not often for casual viewing and I certainly won't be taking this one home to watch with my mother.Like a great classical composer Bergman uses contrast to enormous effect. Muted sounds which force you to strain to listen are punctuated with heartrending screams from the dying Agnes. The colour scheme is a disquieting red fading into pastoral greens and blues as the women reminisce about their younger life.The characters also contrast uncomfortably. The two younger sisters Karin and Maria are sitting the deathwatch for their sister but their task arouses no compassion in them. They are appalled and repelled by their sister's suffering but they will not hold her hand or comfort her. The mutual dislike for each other is palpable. This contrasts with the simple humanism of their maid Anna  whom they callously talk about firing once their sister is dead.Set in the late 19th Century the story flits intermittently between present and past fleshing out the motivations and the stories of the sisters. One of these flashbacks confronts the audience with one of the most disturbing image in cinema a repressed Karin cutting her vagina with glass to avoid sex with her husband.Only a director of Bergman's calibre could make such a film riveting. Yet riveting it is. Bergman gets sensational performances from his four main leads regulars Liv Ullmann Ingrid Thurin and Harriet Andersson and a majestic understated Kari Sylwan. To call this film Ibsenesque would be a slur on the originality of Bergman's vision. It is a testimony to his genius that this may not be his best film yet it is one of the most striking films in modern cinema. I cannot recommend it highly enough. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "How many masterpieces can one director make? In the case of Ingmar Bergman the answer would be plenty. This is one beautiful but very painful and at times horrifying film. I think I've yet to see another film that depicts the pain suffering and despair of dying to such vividness that like the characters one almost feels the need to look away. The story itself is fairly simple  a woman is in the final stages of cancertuberculosis and her two sisters and maid take care of her in her final days  but Bergman's unique narrative style and the complexity and depth of his script turn what at first seems a horror show into a profound meditation on faith love and mortality. Bergman's direction is simply too perfect. The way the film is conceived visually couldn't be more evocative of its themes. The intensity of the color red to convey the hell these characters are living and the chamberlike claustrophobic atmosphere it creates is suffocating and exhausting. Sven Nykvist's Oscarwinning cinematography is simply one of the most inventive and unique I've ever seen in a movie. Bergman's narrative strategy is incredibly thoughtful and effective it's like the scenes flowed into each other and despite the horror we are to endure there is such tact sensitivity attention to detail and a feeling of intimacy to every scene. It's simply glorious to behold appreciate and let yourself be taken by the emotions and insights this film has to offer. All four actresses give spectacular performances Harriet Andersson Agnes is searing physical pain personified Liv Ullmann Maria is so nuanced and real in her flight sensuality one extended scene that is a closeup to her face is astonishing in the incredible nuances of expressiveness and what the character is trying to conceal but can't Ingrid Thulin Karin is chilling to the bone and that one scene that is about mutilation in a very sensitive place is for sure one I'll never forget and Kari Sylwan Anna is pure warmth dedication and love. Bergman has a fame for depicting a bleak and pessimistic view of the world and I won't argue with that but I don't think his humanism is addressed very often. I had heard so many things about how depressing and horrifying this film is and it is indeed but it is not hopeless. Yes Bergman suggests that the world can a horrible place and the human experience is full of pain loneliness and cruelty but he also suggests that if we extend our love to one another and let ourselves be loved the burden won't be as hard to bare and that there will be moments that will bring us love happiness and grace as Agnes says in her beautiful and haunting soliloquy. Agnes manages to find solace and consolation even though she's living the most excruciating hell because she allows herself to love and be loved and her confrontation with death won't be as terrifying. Maria and Karin on the other hand as the film suggests will have to endure the pain and fear of dying in utter loneliness because they don't allow themselves to be loved and have lost the ability to love as well. The film is also bold and insightful enough to suggest that the most awful of circumstances in which a human being can be is paradoxically what strengthens one's faith and love therefore sustaining one's existence.A Masterpiece.".

Although it has not quite held onto that original evaluation it remains a very fine filma subtle and delicately performed drama as remarkable for its silence as for its occasional moments of dialogue. And in many respects it offers an extremely good introduction to Bergman's work.Like many of Bergman's films CRIES AND WHISPERS shows the director's preoccupations with memory communication time community and death. The story is bleak Agnes is dying and her sisters Karin and Maria have come to attend her during this final illnessbut they prove unable to communicate in a meaningful way with either Agnes or each other and Agnes' emotional care is left largely to her longtime maid the devoted Anna.As the film unwinds we are bought into the memories of each woman in turn. The dying Agnes played with powerful realism by Harriet Andersson not only grapples with increasing pain she recalls with regret the emotional separation that existed between her longdead mother and herself. Sister Maria Liv Ullman a mindless sensualist recalls an act of adultery that has poisoned her marriage Sister Karin Ingrid Thulin who is emotionally cold recalls an act of selfmutilation designed to thwart her husband's desires. Only the maid Anna Kari Sylwan with a peasant's directness actually works to be of comfort even going so far as to cradle Agnes' head on her naked breast and dreaming of comforting Agnes while her sisters fail.The film is ever so delicately tinged with subtle elements of lesbianism sadomasochism and incest and the emotional problems experienced by Maria and Karin are at least partly sexual in naturebut these are not the focus of the film so much as they are surface indications of a deeper internal turmoil. As to what that deeper turmoil is... Bergman might say it is the nature of life itself. We each stand alone usually in denial of our own mortality usually unable to reach each other in any meaningful way. A deep film and in spite of its occasional awkwardness a memorable and touching film. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

For those who grew up cinematically during the seventies she was a great expressive sensual flawless star of the screen one of Ingmar Bergman's jewels. Bergman himself of course was already a legend by the time this film was made a great master who did what he wanted and what he felt yet never lost sight of the audience.

	schema:reviewBody "Cries and Whispers is a film that will strike at least one chord with any viewer on its emotional placement the almost unflinching and absolutely masterful camera technique by Sven Nykvist and with the characterizations from the four female leads inparticular the dying Harriet Andersson. This is also a film that will be very hard to stomach for most it was at times for me with it's sheer display of constant despair and grief and the overall state of mind these characters hold. Ullman plays Agnes marked with Tuberculosis she lays on her death bed like a zombie writhing in pain for the eventual end with her two sisters Maria and Karin and the servant Anna at her bedside though seeming at a distance except for Anna. Bergman also views Maria and Karin's relationships with themselves and their husbands both rather brutal Karin has a scene with a shard of glass that had me gasp. The examination of these roles and the entire feel of the house which is always shown as red as blood make this in the realm of cinematic drama a shocker and a masterwork to be certain. There's only one aspect of the film that I can criticize many times in the film Bergman uses a red screen to fade in and fade out and then again a few seconds later and this seems to have not much purpose to the symbolic impact since the inside of the house conveys enough that these people are in a metaphorical house of hell already and the fadings don't add any weight to it. Nevertheless this is one director's great films a landmark in fact though this doesn't mean it's quite as accessible as The Seventh Seal or even the epic Fanny and Alexander. This is cinema for those who almost enjoy paradoxically their intestines ripped out and stomped on the floor only to find out it was just an unforgettable dream. Swedish movies rarely get this visceral. A".

Ingmar Bergman and his cinematographer Sven Nykvist use a palette of red red red red and red as a backdrop for their story of three sisters in circa1900 Sweden. Agnes Harriet Andersson is dying of cancer and her two sisters Karin Ingrid Thulin and Maria Liv Ullmann come to comfort her in her final days. Not that they're much comfort since the whole family is dysfunctional for reasons that are never clearly delineated. And they all have bizarre sexual hangups.I'm sure I'll be in the minority but I found that when it comes to dysfunctional families this movie pales in comparison to Bergman's later Autumn Sonata. There the characters are real people and it's easy to identify with them. Here they seem like little more than ciphers standing in for basic human emotions. It doesn't help that the film is grindingly tedious when it isn't being gratuitously creepy in the creepy old uncle way not in the horror movie way. What was the point of the dream sequence toward the end anyways? 510 for the story 910 for the cinematography which won Nykvist an Oscar  it's not just the overwhelming use of red that makes the cinematography interesting. Since I think story is worth more than cinematography at least to me I give it a six mainly because it is Bergman and I want to cut him some slack.".

Her dream's unrealityshot with calculated zooms and tracks that depart from the entombed staging of the otherscasts a modicum of doubt on the veracity of Maria and Karin's memories did their traumas actually occur or are they merely manifestations of the sisters' interior sickness? If the latter then the relative materiality punitive bloodletting and contained form fascinatingly evoke spiritual attrition whereas Anna's soul with its freer form generously courts death to help another achieve salvation thereby exorcising its own repressed scars. Even the eulogizing priest who prays that Agnes carry the message of human misery to God can't boast such purity of faith. Only simple pious Anna has the lightness of spirit to deliver her beloved Agnes into the next world and to carry within her Agnes's words of gratitude for the ephemeral joys of life.With Cries and Whispers Bergman gave the human soul an illuminating shape and texture contradicting the notion that his entire vision of human existence was draconian bleakness. In his images of suffering one encounters not a dead end but a fine light twinkling faintly with hope a spiritual optimism embodied by Agnes's final autumnal memory.".

Yes the film is generally wellmadewith lovely cinematography and decent acting. BUT the entire story is just amazingly awful and hard to watchunless you are into masochism. The story is about a woman dying from the ravages of cancercomplete with crying and extreme bouts of pain. At her side during her final days are her two sisters and her housekeeper who it appears has had a lesbian relationship with the dying woman. And during this wait as well as after her death they have a lot of flashbacks and fantasies. Some of them are interesting such as Liv Ullman's flirtations with the family doctor while others are inexplicably oddsuch as the other sister's fantasy involving the mutilation of her genitalia in order to keep her husband or anyone else from touching her complete with a lot of blood. At least I THINK this mutilation scene was a fantasyat times it is hard to tell. Given these plot elements I am AMAZED that so many see Bergman as one of our greatest directors!So if painful deaths from cancer deep depression bizarre fantasies and a VERY emotionally blunted script is your idea of fun give this film a try. If not then do something a little less painful and just hit yourself in the head with a 2x4!".

There is wretchedness there is depression there is crying and whispering here the movie delivers on its promise there is a woman masturbating? with a piece of broken glass very very ARTISTIC scene there is a fat maid daydreaming of zombielike resurrection and last but not least  yes  there is a suicide attempt as well. Only one suicide attempt? Well yes. You see Ingmar was in one of his better moods when he wrote the script for this reddish film. Apart from the wounded stomach of the selfstabber the mental agony pervading the minds of every character the cutup vagina that brokenglass business and the physical pain of the dying woman  there isn't much misery in Cries  Whispers. It is an uplifting film about the human spirit. Oh yes and the human condition. Gotta use that term. Always impresses the reader. Yes the human condition. Deep stuff. Whenever a drama is made by a European director  and it happens to be about the human condition  you just KNOW it HAS to be good. Because after all we are all human and we all have conditions. Right? Is that how it works? Sorry I'm not deep and intelligent enough to understand the full extent of the complexity that is to be found in a Bergman drama. Will someone explain human condition to me? I am so confused by these profound ideas My tiny mind cannot possibly comprehend the full extent of what Ingmar tries to convey in his redbrown movies. Cries  Whispers is so much more than just what appears at the surface. A bunch of dull women shouting at each other? No it's more than that. It's more Please explain someone!How best to describe this powerful drama this ultimate statement about the human condition and all that it entails? Red. Well redbrown. That is how I see this film. It is reddish and it is brownish. In other words no green or blue. I am informed by Roger Ebert a famous gourmet and filmcritic that Bergman sees the inside of the human soul as a membranous red. Well Fffffffascinating!... as Basil Fawlty would say. So the inside of the human soul is red. We've established that much. Now what is the inside of Bergman's fans' heads? I'll tell you what the insides of his fans' heads are full of baloney which they read from various pretentious critics that glorify Bergman's rather mediocre movies. This in turn puts some viewers under pressure to appreciate Bergman's crap more than they normally would. After all film critics know what they are talking about right? They finished their movie schools right? The truth is that even many film critics are under pressure to love Bergman. How can you do that job and not like Bergman? I mean come on! We can't take you seriously unless you consider him a genius!Back to the movie. There are some truly touching scenes when the fat servant girl takes her breasts out and slaps them on the dying woman's face. Did she do this to comfort her? To please her latent homosexual urges? To please Bergman's urges? Or perhaps she did this so that the movie can have its obligatory ARTISTIC NUDE SCENE. After all what pretentious European drama can be the movie monolith that it is if it doesn't have at least one scene of nudity mixed with perversion all nicely camouflaged as a message whatever meaning those brilliant movie critics attach to it. And where there is a message there must be ART right?However there is ONE thing that redeems this movie the tuneful beautiful Swedish language. Its soft sounds bang eversogently against my eardrums making me beg for deafness in all its silent glory.If you are unhappy with Ingmar's movies as they are which you must be just google Vjetropev Bergman Spoofs and this will lead you to my video clips with the vastly improved Bergman.

And I'm also glad because of that since there is no way really that this type of movie would had worked out in any other decade than the '60's. It's perfectly silly and laid back all as if it simply doesn't seem to worry about the fact that it's being a pretty silly and bad movie.Germans are not exactly know for their great humor but there are of course some exception here and there. And this movie does really feature some amusing comedy that is being quite cheap and predictable but it works out thanks to its fine timing and the handling by its actors. The actors all play their roles as straight as possible which is often something that can strengthen a movie its comedy actually.As for the movie and story itself it really is being a very typical crimemystery movie in which a murdered needs to be literally unmasked. There is really nothing specular or special about any of it and some moment really don't make that much sense but at least it has a pretty cool killer a person in a skeleton costume that kills people with his poisonous ring. But really it just isn't the story that makes this movie such an effective and fun one to watch it simply is its '60's atmosphere and tone throughout the movie combined with fine humor and plenty of deliberately silly moments.Simply effective as some great entertainment.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "You can say what you want about crime writer Edgar Wallace but one thing you can never fault is his imagination  and here once again director Alfred Vohrer has created a brilliantly entertaining film from one of Wallace's over the top novels. This film features all the things that make the Krimi genre great from the refined atmosphere all the way down to the bizarre plot line. The film's most striking element is undoubtedly the murderer who wears a skeleton costume and a bowler hat echoing the lead character in Umberto Lenzi's cool comic book crime flick Kriminal. The plot focuses on the death of a man named Sir Oliver. There is a disruption at his funeral when there are reports of the corpse laughing and soon after his brother Sir Cecil apparently quite a noble family begins to believe that Sir Oliver has come back from the dead and it's not long before several people are being picked off by a skeleton costumewearing killer with a bizarre murder weapon! Naturally Scotland Yard looks into the deaths...The thing I like most about this genre is the style and director Alfred Vohrer has once again ensured that his film is memorable. The atmosphere on display in this film is simply stunning the vibrant colour scheme is striking while the lighting is very well used. The plotting as ever is slightly confusing although there is not as many subplots in this film as there have been in other Edgar Wallace outings. The killer is a real masterpiece creation the suit does look slightly silly but the way that the killer silently creeps around and the way that the mouth moves on the costume are really great. The murder weapon is another original idea instead of using a gun or a knife like other murderers this one uses a ring with a scorpion's tail that delivers the victim with a dose of deadly and undetectable! poison. The film plods along nicely for most of its running time and we eventually boil down to the ending which is completely confusing to say the least. Still while this is not the best of the genre it's still a very effective little film and I'm sure Krimi fans will enjoy it!".

The undead may look a bit silly on still photos but believe me it's scary enough in the film. It inspired the title character of the comedy Der Wixxer 2004.

If you read the name of the director Alfred Vohrer the name of writer Ladislas Fodor and the name of lead actor Joachim Fuchsberger you will realize immediately that this is another West German movie adaptation of the Edgar Wallace crime novels. This trio worked on many of these. There is one unusual thing about this one here and that is the title. Usually it includes the name of the main antagonist mostly a nonhuman creature that is in fact a human dressing up so this film also could have been called The Laughing Corpse but it is not. The rest of it is the usual though. It runs for under 90 minutes there are several unrealistic plot twists unsuccessful attempts at humor especially at the very ending for example the sound effect when she injects herself the deadly poison and of course many characters with whom you can never be sure who's the good guy and who is the bad guy. And the women are also always the same in these films in the way they were written which is pretty tough as they are really just vehicles to the story or to make the police detective look good. No strong characters here in terms of females. As a whole I thought this was a pretty mediocre watch like basically almost all the other Wallace films. Kinda disappointing looking at how America and the UK dished out one good Bond film after the other during that era. I give Im Banne des Unheimlichen a thumbsdown.".

It looks really great thanks to a solid cinematographyjob by Reinhold Vorschneider and the talent of the director Benjamin Heisenberg.

It looks really great thanks to a solid cinematographyjob by Reinhold Vorschneider and the talent of the director Benjamin Heisenberg. But for all that the fascination that inspires the audience like city of god or paradise now is missing. That makes it a 810";

	schema:headline " A study in shades of ambiguity 'Benjamin Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle'";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a strange one directed at a languid pace and with the cinematography often taking the form of set pieces at a distance or shooting through things and observing the characters as if they are flies forming a pattern on a window. Anyone who knows any modern Germans will know that there are types who are quiet fastidious contemplative and silent taking their satisfaction in noncommunication and a kind of austere isolation. Such is the lead character in this film Johannes Mehrveldt played by Bastian Trost. Certainly it is easier to write a script for someone who says little as you don't have to type so much dialogue. In this case the script was written by the director Benjamin Heisenberg who although not a quantum physicist had a father who was a Professor of Neurobiology. Presumably that is where he got the background for this film which takes place mostly in a medical research lab where people are working on proteins viruses and infectious diseases. The title of the film refers to a 'sleeper' in the security sense that is a terrorist who has a normal job and is merely waiting for the opportunity to strike and create an outrage with a bomb or whatever. Trost I wonder if he is related to the Romanian surrealist Dolfi Trost 19161966 some of whose rare publications I have collected arrives at his new job in the lab presided over by an arrogant professor who rarely speaks to the minions who work under him. Trost's work is closely allied with that of another young scientist who is already there Farid Atabay played by Mehdi Nebbou. Nebbou is halfAlgerian and is the brother of the brilliant director Safy Nebbou unknown whether male or female who directed the wholly amazing ANGEL OF MINE L'EMPREINTE DE L'ANGE 2008 see my review starring Catherine Frot and Sandrine Bonnaire both in perhaps their most impressive form. Farid is some kind of Arab we don't know what kind or from where. He too is mostly quiet and contemplative. He has some unexplained association with a rather wild German girl called Beate played by Loretta Pflaum. She often furtively hugs and kisses Farid. Meanwhile Trost has met her and fallen for her too. They have a kind of relationship but it is far from satisfactory to Trost. He catches her crying over the obituary of someone in a newspaper but she claims not to have known the man and gives no explanation. Everything about her is ambiguous and mysterious including her relationship with Farid. We are told once in passing that her previous boyfriend had been an Iranian 'ein Iraner'. As we get to know Farid better he too becomes increasingly mysterious though at first he seems very open and genial. Early on Trost is approached by a rather dour and dumpy woman from the German security services who looks like she might be a cousin of 'Old PuddingFace' that ultimate Hausfrau Angela Merkel whose very name brings a lump to my throat or is that a dumpling that has got stuck and causes the choking sensation? The dour woman tries to recruit Trost to spy on Farid because he is 'of interest'. Trost refuses. But things get murkier and murkier as he and Farid and Beate sink into a kind of emotional despond of a triangular relationship which is so ambiguous that it is obvious that none of three of them really knows what it means. We are told that there has been a terrorist bomb outrage in Munich and the dour woman wants to know not only where Farid was on that evening but where Trost was. So Trost agrees to spy on Farid after all but does so very ineptly. Farid has one emotional outburst where he says in private to Trost that 'they' are profiling him have collected documents of his whole life and are clearly targeting him. Trost has little to say as has been the case for the whole film. When he is not with Farid or Beate or both he is back at his grandmother's house where he looks after her as she is dying. There is a rather funereal atmosphere to this film which moves slowly like a sleeper. The emptiness of the lives of Farid and Trost is shown by the fact that they spent so much time playing violent computer games. The camera dwells on the impassive but concentrating face of Farid as he kills imaginary people on screen. Once Trost uncovers on Farid's desk a detailed map of a locality as if it were a plan for a terrorist attack but he quickly covers it up and does not wish to study it. All of the characters are entirely lost in a twilight of ambiguity a lifefog where they are sleepwalking. Is Farid really a terrorist? Certainly the security services are convinced that he is. Is Beate his accomplice? Was the man whose obituary in the paper we were not allowed to glimpse a terrorist who had just been killed and with whom Beate had been involved? Was her previous Iranian boyfriend someone who had recruited her and introduced her to Farid? As for Trost does he believe in anything? He does not know. This film is interesting for those who have patience. Also if you watch it you will learn that the modern German expression for housetohouse fighting is Huserkampf. I really didn't know that. I thought it meant two houses fighting with each other over disputed lawn space in between writing about their plans for conquering the world something the Hausfrau still seems to envisage having already reduced Greece to a colony for instance. But everything in this film remains uncertain and is perturbed by the observers security services since it is impossible to know both the motives and the actions of any main character simultaneously according to the director's Uncertainty Principle.".

	schema:headline " A compelling movie from the Adenauer era boasting a great central performance.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Des Teufels General' is set in the months leading up to Hitler's declaration of war on America in December 1941. Curd Jurgens essays the titular general who observes the violent tossing of German society by the torrid and overwhelming waves of the Nazi's mortal storm.Jurgens portrays General Harry Harras a respected senior official at the Air Ministry. His position is one of authority and he senses the way the wind is blowing. He resists attempts to coerce him into becoming a party member and as a result becomes a subject worthy of scrutiny. The movie conveys with searing immediacy the spiralling path of distrust imprisonment humiliation and ostracisation that confronts Harras. This movie is a gripping character study of a cognacnursing general but it is more than just that. It emanates from the Americansponsored era of denazification and offers an intriguing take on German society under the National Socialists. Harras is shown to be chivalrous and a member of a military that has an appreciation of the past and a sense of tradition and camaraderie. There are echoes of 'Anna Karenina' as veteran soldiers dine and drink socially in pleasant surroundings. There is a subtle and effective contrast drawn between the boisterous but essentially civilised bonhomie of Harras and his colleagues and the dispassionate and uncivilised brutishness of the Naziestablished militias. Harras espouses the spirit of Goethe in several electrifying scenes as the degeneration of decency occurs and the thuggery of Nazism takes an iron grip on Germany working its way into longvenerated edifices of society. While with hindsight it seems possible that the movie downplays the extent of committed Nazism amongst the populace it must be remembered that Germany was undergoing seismic changes in terms of reintegration and structural and economic rebuilding under the Nazipersecuted statesman Konrad Adenauer. America had initially wanted to identify and prosecute criminally all those who had colluded significantly with the Nazis. This soon proved to be utterly unfeasible and would undoubtedly have severely hampered Germany's economic reemergence. Cinematic output of the Adenauer era desperately sought to impart the virtues of dignity and heroism. In alluding to the rampant rise of Nazism those remaining in society who were swept along are not exonerated. Rather the terrible allconsuming enormity of the force that ravaged Germany is acknowledged. In its depiction of Harras and his surroundings this movie is undoubtedly the product of a deeply scarred society simply doing its level best to move on and locate a measure of hope and honour upon which it can tentatively go forth. As for the acting special mention must go to Curd Jurgens who turns in the performance of a lifetime here. He literally becomes General Harras. Indeed it is hard to imagine anyone else being so effective in the role. For his masterfully nuanced interpretation Jurgens was the joint winner with Kenneth More of the Volpi Cup at the 1955 Venice Film Festival. He is ably supported by the lovely Marianne Koch and the imposing Viktor de Kowa whose character really is a repulsive individual. This is the first of Helmut Kautner's movies that I have seen and I was suitably impressed by it. His deft narrative style certainly appeals to me. His direction is concise and tothepoint and this contributes to several taut and tense scenes. The atmospheric and chilling evocation of social upheaval is realised with a sure directorial touch. From a brief skimming of his filmography 'Romanze in Moll' 'Der Apfel ist ab' 'Die letzte Brucke' and 'Der Hauptmann von Kopenick' strike me as being some of his most interesting movies. I greatly look forward to viewing more of Kautner's movies in the months and years ahead and I can but thoroughly recommend 'Des Teufels General' to those who read this.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Des Teufels General' is set in the months leading up to Hitler's declaration of war on America in December 1941. Curd Jurgens essays the titular general who observes the violent tossing of German society by the torrid and overwhelming waves of the Nazi's mortal storm.Jurgens portrays General Harry Harras a respected senior official at the Air Ministry. His position is one of authority and he senses the way the wind is blowing. He resists attempts to coerce him into becoming a party member and as a result becomes a subject worthy of scrutiny. The movie conveys with searing immediacy the spiralling path of distrust imprisonment humiliation and ostracisation that confronts Harras. This movie is a gripping character study of a cognacnursing general but it is more than just that. It emanates from the Americansponsored era of denazification and offers an intriguing take on German society under the National Socialists. Harras is shown to be chivalrous and a member of a military that has an appreciation of the past and a sense of tradition and camaraderie. There are echoes of 'Anna Karenina' as veteran soldiers dine and drink socially in pleasant surroundings. There is a subtle and effective contrast drawn between the boisterous but essentially civilised bonhomie of Harras and his colleagues and the dispassionate and uncivilised brutishness of the Naziestablished militias.

Jrgens was one of the most successful German actors at this point and in this film here he shows us why that was the case. He certainly elevates the material. Unfortunately this is not too big of a challenge as I must say the material by writer and director Helmut Kutner is not particularly good or memorable. I definitely believe Harry Harras a man who really existed deserved a better film made about him. If you know Graf Stauffenberg then you will know the general direction this film is taking. It is about a very successful German military general during the days of the Nazi reign and World War II but things take a turn for the worse for him when his loyalty to Reichsfhrer Adolf Hitler begins more and more to crumble. Catastrophe is inevitable for the Nazis and for Harras. The films runs for almost 2 hours and I felt there were many moments when it dragged so it should have been kept shorter I think maybe at 100 minutes max the runtime of most German films from around that era. As a whole I cannot recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".

His family environment is intolerable to him and in particular his stepmother torments him. He decides to poison those who annoy him first with antimony and later with thallium. He smugly thinks himself cleverer than all those around him but nevertheless he is caught and sentenced to 'rehabilitation' at a psychiatric institution.

I have some theories but this is certainly a film that should have found a larger audience at some point.This is pitch black British comedy near its best reminiscent of both Hitchcock and 'A Clockwork Orange'  its threepart structure is similar to that of 'A Clockwork Orange' given that the protagonist is free then confined then free again to illustrate the vanity of rehabilitation where it concerns psychopaths and we even hear excerpts from Purcell's Funeral Music for Queen Mary which Wendy Carlos incorporated into her electronic score for 'Clockwork.' Whether 'The Young Poisoner's Handbook' is paying homage or borrowing the movie itself is a highly individual work that should please anyone with a fondness for Orwell or Ealing.Hugh O'Conor with his wideeyed gift for simulating innocence is an ideal selection for the role of Graham Young the reallife poisoner of the British village of Bovingdon who slowly poisoned his stepmother to death with antimony sulfide finishing the job with thallium. Cursed with a banal home life and a sociopathic mind his selfdescribed gift for chemistry is put to obviously nefarious uses occasionally using friends as guinea pigs before the main attraction.The director Benjamin Ross makes a tremendously impressive debut here. His selection of music together with his fluid editing and camerawork often produce stirring and exciting results the 1960s small British town setting keenly observed with a very black wit. Graham's wicked stepmother played by the singular Ruth Sheen seen in many Mike Leigh films joyfully accepts her first dose of poison after finding a box of Velvet Victories chocolates on her bedroom pillow with a note reading To my darling mother xxxx. There's a vivid sense of the dustiness of the Young household the darkness of Graham's bedroom punctured by the eerie glow of his flasks the frustration of an overcrowded working class household where the telly's always running with the silliness of popular variety programs. The film also adroitly contrasts the selfimportant grandeur of Young's genocidal ambitions with the unglamorous pettiness of the actual crimes and the prosaic Bovingdon environment to which his perpetration of them was fortunately limited the real Graham Young had wanted to be known as The World's Poisoner but was instead given the considerably less flattering moniker The Teacup Poisoner. Absurdity and grimness are very skillfully balanced. A marvelous overlooked film.".

But can his love of poison be controlled?I first saw this in the cinema many years ago and held off writing a review because I wanted to be sure that I could give it a fair review  memory not that great you know.  So I watched it on channel 4 last week and was quite taken aback  I didn't remember it being quite that dark and disturbed.  The plot is quite like Kind Hearts  Coronets in the set up and delivery more in the delivery but is a lot darker and more cruel than that classic.  The comedy is of the very dark type and mostly comes from Graham's narration. His narration plays his acceptance of very shocking events as runofthemill things that happen in the background this juxtaposition works well and makes it funny.The actual poisonings are not always easy to laugh through while some of his mother's ordeal is played for laughs most of it is quite cruel and upsetting.  I think it worked well for playing the audience on the fact that we didn't quite know what this was  it was based on a true story yet was played for laughs as well as serious at times.  However this same ploy is to it's weakness as it is difficult to settle into for this same reason.  The director seems very assured and handles this better mixing inappropriate music with the action as well as directing it very flat and clinically.O'Conor is the perfect choice for the role.  Onscreen he is cold and cruel but it is his narration is where he excels  delivering perfectly deadpan lines.  The support cast are all OK but mostly play exaggerated characters on the whole  British stereotypes and such.  The film wisely leaves them as undeveloped this because if we cared too much for them or related to them then it would have been impossible to feel anything but revulsion for Graham.  As cardboard cutouts they seem less than Graham in terms of the film wonder how the real victims' families felt about this view.Overall this is a strange film but one that has enough going for it to be worht watching.  However it should be noted that it is quite cruel and upsetting  we are not allowed to feel anything for Graham's victims.  The humour is rarely laugh out loud funny and this will probably only be for those who like their comedy very dark.".

The humour is rarely laugh out loud funny and this will probably only be for those who like their comedy very dark.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director Benjamin Ross has done a terrific job creating a humorously warped view of life through the eyes of Graham Young alienated boy genius and serial poisoner.  Hugh O'Conor perfectly portrays Graham's carefully studied innocent appearance which Graham constantly feigns lest anyone find out what he is really thinking in his twisted calculating mind.  O'Conor manages the tricky job of looking innocent enough to fool the other characters but maniacal enough that the audience always knows what is going on.Through Graham's eccentric to say the least pointofview we witness the painfully mundane Young family the pitifully easy to fool psychiatric and medical community and the pathetically simpleminded middleclass.  Ross captures the comic disdain with which Graham sees his surroundings without disposing of the distance necessary to be horrified at Graham's experiments and the fate of his unwitting subjects.Because of Ross' careful tightrope walking between distance from and intimacy with Graham the audience can't fully fall under Graham's spell and sympathize completely with him.  There are some gruesome scenes of people reacting to poison but these are necessary to heighten the audience's horror at Graham's incapability to assess his own actions and to recognize his own evil.  Ross gives us an entertaining yet twisted glimpse into genius gone wrong without sensationalizing Graham as a hero.It is also very hard to go out for drinks or coffee after seeing this movie.".

After that he retreats into his den again until something better comes along.  And then he gets caught.Then there's that uproarious scene when he's out with a girl and he tries to get her in a conversation on disembowelment.  You can almost see her turn green as he gets into stride.  To him it's an innocent thing something he likes.  For her and for us the audience it's...sick.I thought that the rehabilitation sequence was a farce.  It's as ludicrous as the rest of this quirky gem of a movie with great performances by all the actors particularly Hugh O'Conor.  He says more with his eyes than most could with their lips.I mean the movie is funny not ha ha funny though dripping with corrosive irony.  Young is all at once twisted and innocent torn between conforming and that endless fascination with poison.  The comparisons between this and Clockwork are almost inevitable but unlike Kubrick's thriller this one has a more subtle menacing tone for the mind rather than for the eye.  It's not a laughoutloud film though it's undeniably hilarious.

	schema:reviewBody "This film seems to be a homage to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. It has a lot of deliberate quotes and shares similar themes and music. It's a kind of dialogue between the two directors a reply. Clockwork Orange was speculative fiction suggesting this is how society could become whereas The Young Poisoner's Handbook is retrospective and based on a true story in effect saying we are already there and were so ten years before Clockwork was made.The story is based on the actual life of homicidal poisoner Graham Young and doesn't do too much to hide that this is a biography not some grim fictional noir. Graham narrates the entire film and talks about how from childhood he really had nothing in common with his working class London family but early on determines he has a talent for chemistry and uses his experiments as an escape. By the time he is a teen humankind consists of just so many lab rats as far as Graham is concerned. And Graham isn't interested in curing people instead he wants to poison them. He turns his attention first to his stepmother not that his sister Winnie escapes his chemical wrath entirely when her prying eyes get to be a problem as he slowly poisons dear old mom. Graham's solution  poison her eye drops and blind her. Fortunately he only disposes of one eye. Like the Mafia none of this is personal for Graham it's really just an experiment.The great irony is that the law actually does catch Graham after he kills his stepmom and he ends up in a place for the criminally insane probably to be there forever as he is judged a sociopath. But one psychiatrist has other ideas. Graham interests him and he decides to cure him. The doc overestimates the ability of science to defeat sociopathy but Graham at first intending to con the doc just to get out gets tragically conned himself into believing himself eventually cured.So after nine years Graham is released. But that's the thing about prison. Inmates  even in psychiatric prisons  usually do well as long as you supervise their every move  when they sleep when they work and what they work on when they eat. The problem is when they get out and have freedom of choice as to their own path. I'd normally say watch and find out what happens but Columbine and cultural cowardice means you probably never will. After 1999 when some teens began to become lethal and to use the popular culture as a model for what form their killing would take the movie industry began to fear giving them ideas. Thus I have not seen this film on TV for 20 years and the DVD is long out of print and something tells me this is NOT on Criterion's short list.Artistically this film is full of good performances and the art design gets the drab look of early 60s London just right. From the crowded housing to the local pub to the frumpy furnishings meant entirely for utility not for decoration to the cheesy act that passes for early 60s British TV this film has England of the period nailed. It even hints of the sexual revolution that happened while Graham was in jail and thus missed out on that just increases his social isolation and misreading of social cues.I'd highly recommend this one if you can ever find it. It does pop up on youtube from time to time.".

The joy of the movie is strong supporting cast who react in quirky British ways to Graham and the mysterious illnesses going around. O'Conor gives an intense but restrained portrayal of the troubled lad and provides some good skin shots as well. Sher is a convincing professional trying to salvage some good from the unpromising inhabitants of the hospital. The acting is witty throughout.This movie in my view is a terrific deadpan black comedy. The first and last thirds are marvelous and fascinating to watch. The middle while Graham is in the asylum gets a bit serious. Graham is taken on his own terms in the movie utterly serious utterly committed to his calling tracking his doses noting the effects estimating the time of death for those he will finish out. He observes with a clinical detachment which is amusing and unsettling. He shows no remorse because he doesn't know what remorse is. Hugh O'Connor does a wonderful job as Graham. He looks like a choir boy with a sincere stare. This one will make you think but keep you well entertained nevertheless. Overall rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw a docudrama on Graham Young several years ago and I remember it being rather cliched in style with characters complaining of feeling unwell followed by a jump cut to their funeral with Young standing at the graveside with a smug expression . Despite its flaws the docudrama did at least stick to the true life story of Young unlike THE YOUNG POISONERS HANDBOOK which starts with a disclaimer that many events are fictionalised . Its no bad thing twisting the truth to this story because Id have felt extremely guilty laughing out loud as people were poisoned The one obvious problem is Hugh OConor as Graham Young . Hes very good in the role but if the Young family are working class then why does young Graham speak with an upper class public schoolboy accent ? Couldnt the director have told him to tone it down a bit ? Worse still  And theres no way anyone would have known this in 1995 when the film was made  Mr OConor looks exactly like Gareth Gates . If youve no idea who GG is let me explain that he was runner up in Britains POP IDOL contest last year . He lost out to Will Young  No relation I take it  in the final but Gareth was the real star who became an even bigger selling artist than Will  all the teenage girls loved him due to his choir boy looks and perfect manners and I cant hammer home enough the striking physical similarities between Mr Gates and Mr OConor . I spent the entire duration of THE YOUNG POISONERS HANDBOOK convinced that the star of POP IDOL was killing people which made me laugh even louder Yeah but I shouldnt have laughed .

	onyx:emotionText "I saw a docudrama on Graham Young several years ago and I remember it being rather cliched in style with characters complaining of feeling unwell followed by a jump cut to their funeral with Young standing at the graveside with a smug expression . Despite its flaws the docudrama did at least stick to the true life story of Young unlike THE YOUNG POISONERS HANDBOOK which starts with a disclaimer that many events are fictionalised . Its no bad thing twisting the truth to this story because Id have felt extremely guilty laughing out loud as people were poisoned The one obvious problem is Hugh OConor as Graham Young . Hes very good in the role but if the Young family are working class then why does young Graham speak with an upper class public schoolboy accent ? Couldnt the director have told him to tone it down a bit ? Worse still  And theres no way anyone would have known this in 1995 when the film was made  Mr OConor looks exactly like Gareth Gates . If youve no idea who GG is let me explain that he was runner up in Britains POP IDOL contest last year . He lost out to Will Young  No relation I take it  in the final but Gareth was the real star who became an even bigger selling artist than Will  all the teenage girls loved him due to his choir boy looks and perfect manners and I cant hammer home enough the striking physical similarities between Mr Gates and Mr OConor . I spent the entire duration of THE YOUNG POISONERS HANDBOOK convinced that the star of POP IDOL was killing people which made me laugh even louder Yeah but I shouldnt have laughed . Despite much artistic license this is still a true story of how innocent people were murdered by a psycopath and I hope no one else decides to make more black comedies featuring mass murderers . I hate myself for enjoying this movie";

As a movie this is a compelling black comedy that will be appreciated by anyone who is looker for something that isn't your usual bland and simplistic fare. I shudder to think how this plot and characters would have been handled in a mainstream Hollywood movie! I can just see Leo or Toby in the lead role an explanation for his psychotic behaviour and an uplifting heart warming happy ending.

At worst Asian action films can be unbearably slow and dull with uninteresting action scenes and horrible acting. At their best they can be like a wonderful ballet with astonishing moves and moods. OngBak falls somewhere inbetween these two.The story and setup in OngBak is nothing very original. The head of the village Buddhastatue named OngBak is stolen which spells bad luck for the village. So they send their best man to the city to find the son who moved away and they can search for the head together. Of course the villager is completely lost in the city and soon gets himself into trouble.So the story is nothing new neither is the setup which is more or less van Damme standard fare movies like Lionheart except in Thailand. We see some streetfighting and some tournamentstyle fighting in seedy bars. So what makes OngBak stand out? Well the fighting! I have seldom seen such wellmade fighting scenes. Both well choreographed and plentiful! The thaiboxing done here might be very stylized to look good but it really does the trick. The fights are simply put amazing! The lead actor really knows his moves and his acrobatics and many times you can really feel the crushing hits as kicks and elbows hit home. Also the pace is very high with almost constant fighting in the last half of the movie. And it all looks very very nice.So OngBak is definitely for those of you who are suckers for martialarts and fighting. Don't expect an original story or terribly solid acting. But expect a fun ride lots and lots of violence. And for me that's enough. OngBak receives a 710.".

Because they are the hardest parts of the human body. And god damn in Ong Bak he proper messes up everyone he comes across. Thai boxing is proper hardcore they don't mess about.In Ong Bak the story is pretty non existent basically some gangstas from the city come to our heros poor village and steal the Buddha's head statue and so Tony Ja commits to bringing it back and restoring peace. Now with that out of the way let's talk about the fighting as this is where the film excels. WOW this IS the most realistic fighting you will ever see. The only thing I can compare it to is Ultimate Fighting but ten times worse. Tony Ja will become a legend this is fact. His flexibility in fighting is so extreme and this film is basically just crammed up with the biggest most violent stunts you will ever see. For instance in a scene where Tony and his newly met friends run away from a group of hoodlums he gets away in style. This is done by jumping through the tiny gaps either backwards sliding underneath cars jumping feet and hands outstretched through a hope running across people's heads flippin kicking somersaulting absolutely everywhere. Remember when you first saw the matrix and you were like woah' well this is so much better. For starts the stunts in this film are REAL. Everybody gets injured. There are no wires pulleys fake punches fake blood. This is how it should be. Hollywood take note. The best scenes come where there is a kinda of street fighter style arena where the deadliest fighters compete to be champion. Tony gets accidently caught up in this and doesn't mess around by defeating the champion with a single powerful knee thrust into the opponents chest as Tony bends forwards and twists to avoid the ensuing punch from the opponent then unleashes the killer blow. Everyone in the arena is stunned and Tony gets booed for bad sportsmanship.. But don't worry about that has the biggest fights of his life coming up.You need this film in your life. I haven't seen anything as violent and hardcore as this ever before. But even though its hardcore and low budget the direction is slick. Double takes are often used for the incredible action so you can really appreciate for example taking out three men with a triple twisting back flip and smashing their heads in with your knees and elbows at the same time with pure accuracy. I have watched this four times now and cannot get enough. Overall the story line is weak and there are some hilarious cheesy moments but this all works perfectly well as instead of going god damn thats sick!' at the beginning you will end up saying ha ha! Did you see his elbow get torn backwards then snapped! Ha ha! This is genius!'.  It's like CKY2 with all the accidents but here it is intentional for someone to do themselves in. This is a film you will watch over and over again and show your mates everytime they come round. 1010".

He spent so many years doing stunts for other stars and it shows when he does his. It reminds me of the way Bruce Lee movies were made.

Tony Jaa is definitely more acrobatic than Jackie but if you look back at some of Jackie's films and then watch OngBak I don't think he's as GUTSY as Jackie but hey he's only made 1 film so I may be wrong. And he's a good martial artist but if you really look at some of Jet Li's films and then look at OngBak and pay attention to his hand to hand combat you'll see that he's actually not as advanced or nearly as OUICK as Jet in actual martial arts skills and hand2hand combat. There's a difference in being the next big martial arts star and being the next Jet Li or Jackie Chan. Anyway most people are just saying that cuz he's new and can jump high and do a bunch of flips. So don't label him as the next anybody. Just say There's Jet Li Jackie Chan and Tony Jaa.".

	schema:reviewBody "OngBak. A movie I had first heard about almost two years ago as a little blurb on the internet. A little less than a year ago I began to read more and more about it and some new actor by the name of Tony Jaa. I finally began to see clips online of the film and started to notice what people were raving about. While international DVDs had appeared in front of me left and right I held out for the big day to see it on the big screen fresh and with few spoilers. And that day was today. My expectations were already moderately high reading that this new actor is the next Jackie Chan and even Bruce Lee and how he too uses no doubles... but he also uses no wires which even Chan has used. Well all I can say is that after sitting in the theaters for nearly two hours my expectations were far surpassed.Tony Jaa's performance brought back memories of seeing Bruce Lee for the first time in The Big Boss Fists of Fury here in the US. Both characters were naive innocent and had left their home for the sake of family. Both characters in some shape or form had to hold back their extraordinary physical abilities for the sake of honor. And finally both characters were pushed beyond their tolerance level and became the most deadly fighters in their times. After seeing wire work martial arts in every direction after The Matrix it became very tired. While it still works in some cases it's just not aweinspiring... because we all subconsciously know it's fake. With OngBak we know that Tony Jaa is performing all of his stunts and martial arts with NO tricks. This makes the fight sequences more intense and realistic something which many fight sequences are lacking in today's film world.This being said the fights in the film are so intense and emotion driven that my heart was literally racing as each fight passed... I felt like I was going to pass out after the last fight. This is something that no previous martial arts film I have seen has ever done to me not even the Bruce Lee films. By the time I left the theaters I was shaking from the film's intensity. Now THAT'S what I call a martial arts film.And yes the plot IS flimsy... but the plot is basically there to set up Jaa's interaction with all of the characters he meets in his travels whether it is to fight or to aid his search for the head of OngBak. This is basically what I would call a journey film... kind of like Kill Bill. As for Jaa's acting he didn't have much to work with but what he was given he had enough charisma to make his character one you want to side with and cheer for in your mind.Overall this film is without a doubt mandatory viewing for martial arts film fans andor martial arts practitioners... and being both I can personally vouch for both groups. And if you get a chance to see it on one of the 380 big screens in the US do NOT pass up the chance to see it... it will be a movie going experience that you'll remember for years to come.".

Although the movie started a bit slow after about half an hour things began to pick up and the movie never looked back.OngBak is about a small town villager named Ting Tony Jaa who sets out to find the head of his beloved sacred statue which was stolen. Ting finds his long lost cousin from the village Humlae Perttary Wongkamlao who at first claims to not know Ting until he sees that his village did not send him alone but with a bag of cash to use as he sees necessary to get the statue head back. This is our first real look at Tony Jaa's talents as the first chase scene begins after Humlae takes off with the bag on his motorcycle. Amazingly Ting follows Humlae all the way to a pit fighter type of place where the real action begins.Although the plot is pretty thin it is more than made up for by Jaa's entertaining and seemingly impossible stunts. The movie plays up the stunts big as it claims no stuntmen no wires no CGI etc. With all that in mind this movie is pretty mind boggling. Comparisons to Jackie Chan are going to be inevitable and not undeserving. I can only imagine what the two of them could have accomplished if they did a movie together while Chan was younger. Simply amazing. 810".

The movie plays up the stunts big as it claims no stuntmen no wires no CGI etc. With all that in mind this movie is pretty mind boggling. Comparisons to Jackie Chan are going to be inevitable and not undeserving. I can only imagine what the two of them could have accomplished if they did a movie together while Chan was younger. Simply amazing. 810";

I'm not even that big of a fan of Kung Fu movies but this movie blew me away. It takes beating the living hell out of people and turns it into an art. Like I said everyone agrees the moves are beyond amazing.The other great thing about this movie is that it's laugh out loud funny. When you're not yelling out OOOHHH with the rest of the audience you'll either be laughing your head off or stunned into silence.Oh and one last thing that's great is that the movie doesn't waste any time falling into the lead guy has to have a hot girlfriend by the end trap....no time is wasted on some stupid romantic subplot it's all just high paced wicked action.Watch it. You'll still be smiling about it way after the credits have rolled.".

When an unscrupulous young man comes to the village to buy valuable goods he steals the head and returns to Bangkok where he gives it to his boss  a crime lord who presides over illegal pit fights and steals historical artefacts. Ting goes to Bangkok to join up with former villager Humlae who now is a street hustler and calls himself George. However once there he finds that the only way to get the head back is to kick and elbow people. Lots.Before I talk about the main only? reason to see this film let me at least pretend that it is meant to operate like a normal film and look at the traditional aspects that give a film value  plot acting characters etc. First off the plot is very basic so basic that really I could have done it in a sentence and still given you more than you needed to know. Happily it only really last 15 minutes before we are given the first of many many action scenes. Within this basic frame it is no surprise that none of the characters work or are developed to a point were we care about them  this is a given but why then did the film still labour under the idea that we did? I didn't care that much for any of them because none were written as people  only action figures or onenote characters ie the girl who is suffering due to crime the crimelord the middleman etc etc.With this perhaps it is no surprise that the performances are roundly average. Wongkamlao is pretty funny but can't do much more than that  but he looks like Brando at his best compared to the wooden and unconvincing Yodkamol. The rest of the cast fill their genre clich shoes well enough leaving us with the reason we are here  Jaa himself. Now as an actor he needs work  he can't really deliver a character seems unsure of how to handle comedy and despite having a good screen presence didn't convince delivering dialogue neither. However none of this really matters does it? I didn't come for plot narrative script acting or directing  I came to se people get kicked and by god that is what this film delivers.Without wires and without special effects the fight scenes had the cinema audibly reacting with gasps and groans as Jaa did things that did not seem possible but also delivered some very very brutal moves that made even the toughest in the room wince. Of course a film that relies solely on action is never going to be one that manages to win praise beyond the bounds of the genre but it helps that within that genre it blows away a lot of competition and justifies its UK wide cinema release. Rest assured it is stunning at times and although it niggles that the film is set around the action as opposed to vice versa it is forgivable when it is this enjoyable! Overall not a brilliant film by any means but one that really delivers in terms of what it sets out to do. Action fans will love it and those that thing martial arts started with the Matrix will find out just how much more compelling action is whenever it isn't being produced on a hard drive somewhere. With a plot so basic acting so poor and characters so thin it speaks volumes about the quality of the action that I was engaged and entertained from start well ten minutes in to finish.".

I guess if you know nothing about Buddhism or Thailand you might get something out of it I don't know. The real reason to watch this movie of course is for Tony Jaa. And don't worry you won't miss anything. Every time Tony does something cool which is often you get to see it two or three times in slow motion. I didn't mind it here because this is my introduction to Jaa but now that he's got a few movies under his belt he should probably cut back on that stuff.The fight choreography was a mixed bag IMO. There was a lot of pausing between moves which made it seem a bit oldfashioned. The opponents were pretty uninspired too I don't think much thought went into them.It's exciting to see a talented young martial arts performer like Jaa come along but for anyone who thinks Jackie Chan who Jaa borrows heavily from or Jet Li have something to worry about you're dead wrong... at least for now.

	schema:reviewBody "That Thai Warrior is WorowitPanom Yeerum AKA Tony Jaa and he's the reason for watching this movie. He's an amazingly gifted young Muai Thai kick boxer and stunt man who did all his leaps and jumps and dives. My favorite moment of all is the one where he's chasing through the streets and dives under a car slides out the other side and pops up again all in one smooth motion. Do you think that's easy? It's barely even conceivable. And he does all this without digital manipulation or the wires we've gotten all too familiar with in Chinese martial arts movies. Look for the real thing here no arty madeforwesterners romances  la Crouching Tiger or Flying Daggers. This is like finding a dirty little restaurant in San Francisco's Tenderloin that has really authentic Vietnamese or Pakistani food. No frills  just the joy of truly unmediated experience. The story something about the head from Ting's Jaa's village temple's Buddha statue or ONGBAK whose theft by a gangster's low level employee disgraces the village and must be restored is a mere formality just enough to get things going and give Ting a back story.Tony Jaa's face is pretty almost feminine and his body is stocky and incredibly flexible and strong. Despite a poster for the movie that shows his broad tapered back you may not notice how well muscled he is at first. None of this movie is about superficial show so much as it's about accomplishment. Jaa's expressions are intent and sensitive but unlike the Beautiful Boxer star Asanee Suwan whose character Nong Toom is supposed to be a crossdresser fighting to earn money for a sex change Jaa doesn't mug in an attempt to act and isn't called upon to do so.This was a relaxing way to end a movie marathon of three films in one day  the other two were the Kazakhstan charmer Schizo and the doc of US soldiers in Iraq Gunner Palace  because you don't need to take it seriously. In fact you must adopt a mindless attitude watching Ongbak which I couldn't for Sin City or Oldboy hence my difficulty with those two productions because it contains a lot of bonecrushing violence. Sometimes you can even hear the bones being crushed. The movie has been called insanely brutal and that's about right though all the brutality is pretty much in handtohand fighting and stays close to the kick boxing techniques. You have to focus exclusively on Tony Jaa's physical prowess and remember that this is just a movie  that people are not really being killed or their heads mashed in  but if you do so you will be amply rewarded. There are car chases battles competitions sexy girls and evil gangsters the kingpin of them all Khom Tuan Sukhaaw Phongwilai being a depraved cripple with a scary voicebox. It's not that there's no plot just that you'd waste your time taking it seriously.The other most purely enjoyable sequence in Ongbak comes even earlier than the street chase when Ting is demonstrating his training for his Buddhist teacher through adopting a sequence of ritualized positions. This is sheer physical grace like a dance broken into a series of sudden tableaux and you realize what a heap of actual ART there is in the martial arts. You can't fake this kind of thing and what impresses in this scene is not the moves and positions in themselves but the clear sense you get that Tony Jaa knows all this deep in his bones. More than just showing off a series of carefully memorized moves this sequence is like someone with a beautiful voice and perfect diction reciting a long awesome prayer. It's beyond words and beyond interpretation. It just IS.It's said that The Making of Ongbak is even better. Could be. Also it's said that Tony Jaa's going to be bigger than Jackie Chan and Jet Li. That's not too far fetched either. But even if this was only a unique moment in time it'd be a movie that's fun to watch for anyone who enjoys seeing the body in graceful powerful acrobatic motion. In the world of martial arts stunts it just doesn't get any better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jennifer Benson Leelee Sobieski is a seventeen years old misfit punk teenager that uses piercing tattoos wears only black clothes and dyed hair selfinflicts injures and has fixation for death. She misses a father and a normal mother since Mrs. Benson Carol Kane has trouble in the communication with her and feels absolutely rejected. While looking for a job she meets the fortynine years old Randall Harris Albert Brooks a lonely man who owns a shopping store and he hires her. They are opposites but with loneliness and lack of friends in common. They become close friends and their interaction changes their behavior for good while secrets and feelings are disclosed.This is the second work of the excellent underrated actress Christine Lahti as director that I see the other one is the short Lieberman in Love and also a surprisingly great movie. The original and the Brazilian titles are simply awful and vulgar and do not mirror this sensitive story of loneliness and friendship. Leelee Sobieski has another great performance in the role of a disturbed and rebellious teenager needy of love and care who changes her behavior when she meets her soulmate friend in a middleage man. I am not fan of Albert Brooks but he is great performing Randall Harris the man who touches Jennifer in the heart. In the end a toast to all special F words to friends family fate forgiveness and forever. Wonderful and touching! My vote is eight.Title Brazil Meu Primeiro Homem My First Man".

I think I'm happier that My First Mister does the climbing even though that makes the last part of the film more trite than the glorious beginning. Some stories dig and dig deep but to be a 'story' at all they have to end not just stop although for this film I would have chosen a less Hollywoodtiedup ending. But I didn't invest the money in a film that needs to pay the bills.I'm glad the medium and considerable talent using it could bring me this lovingly ambiguous event.Beyond that the film showed me a few things I enjoyed learning.From the story I especially took away the reenforcing message that if we let our lack of boldness rule we may be letting others down. Humility isn't thinking we have nothing to offer or even that we might not be the only person in the world to offer it. The happiness of the rest of someone else's life may depend on us. In fact a la It's a Wonderful Life it probably has. Ignoring this isn't humble it's cowardly.SPOILER In a mix of story and film I thought after the great day R and J spent together that J was going to be molested or in a car accident to precipitate the third act with a crisisI felt a TV moment coming on. So when we made it clear until R was late coming back from his jog did we know he jogged? I was actually holding out that a heart attack turns out to be leukemia would straight up kill him then J would have the burden of the third act entirely in her court Sobieski could have handled it say by having to do all the things a wife does after her husband's death while being treated as a child by ambulance personnel funeral home director clergy et al. Think of the scene where she wants to dress R's body but is pushed away by funeral home people and so can only leave a piercing stud attached to his clothesan icon of her lonely youth used as a symbol of her maturing love. Her kiss from death would play out in a social role she wanted but was not accepted in in ironic juxtaposition to how she had imagined it playing out beyond any accepted social roles. And the scene where she almost but doesn't cut herself and breaks down in shouldershaking sobs and her mother shows up at her partiallyopen apartment door with food hears her and enters into the darkness crossing into her own acceptance of the other side of life.But the TV moment came...by comparison listen to the deleted scene commentaries for Passionadaif only My First Mister had gotten the same chance at a new third act... Perhaps I'm learning that our imagined endings are still valid. Who's to say that we can't enjoy a film because of where it pointed us even if it didn't really go there?As for the strictly film aspects I still dislike nonstandard dissolves popping up in the last onethird of a film especially if it isn't strictly romantic comedy. Why in such a delicate film would an editor do something like that? But in the last supper scene the apparent discontinuity then toast then fading of individuals were inspiring. Did J really give that toast? To follow hinted continuity R and Nurse Patty had already moved to the sofa though they could have returned she didn't or perhaps she did but it wasn't really like that...such a beautiful suggestion of how we remember those evenings that were too good to be true in the face of realities too bad to accept.A hole well dug even if I didn't dig the whole as much as I might have.".

Ignoring this isn't humble it's cowardly.SPOILER In a mix of story and film I thought after the great day R and J spent together that J was going to be molested or in a car accident to precipitate the third act with a crisisI felt a TV moment coming on. So when we made it clear until R was late coming back from his jog did we know he jogged? I was actually holding out that a heart attack turns out to be leukemia would straight up kill him then J would have the burden of the third act entirely in her court Sobieski could have handled it say by having to do all the things a wife does after her husband's death while being treated as a child by ambulance personnel funeral home director clergy et al. Think of the scene where she wants to dress R's body but is pushed away by funeral home people and so can only leave a piercing stud attached to his clothesan icon of her lonely youth used as a symbol of her maturing love. Her kiss from death would play out in a social role she wanted but was not accepted in in ironic juxtaposition to how she had imagined it playing out beyond any accepted social roles. And the scene where she almost but doesn't cut herself and breaks down in shouldershaking sobs and her mother shows up at her partiallyopen apartment door with food hears her and enters into the darkness crossing into her own acceptance of the other side of life.But the TV moment came...by comparison listen to the deleted scene commentaries for Passionadaif only My First Mister had gotten the same chance at a new third act... Perhaps I'm learning that our imagined endings are still valid. Who's to say that we can't enjoy a film because of where it pointed us even if it didn't really go there?As for the strictly film aspects I still dislike nonstandard dissolves popping up in the last onethird of a film especially if it isn't strictly romantic comedy. Why in such a delicate film would an editor do something like that? But in the last supper scene the apparent discontinuity then toast then fading of individuals were inspiring. Did J really give that toast? To follow hinted continuity R and Nurse Patty had already moved to the sofa though they could have returned she didn't or perhaps she did but it wasn't really like that...such a beautiful suggestion of how we remember those evenings that were too good to be true in the face of realities too bad to accept.A hole well dug even if I didn't dig the whole as much as I might have.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was not ready for such a powerful intelligent and intricately detailed film. I had just assumed this would be another Hollywood schlockfest featuring the dry humor of Albert Brooks and Leelee Sobieski attempting to reconnect with a teeniebopper audience. I was wrong. This was such a strong film that dedicated itself to developing strong characters to giving us honest emotions and providing us a story that is not unfamiliar in the real world that it nearly left my jaw hanging on the ground. From the opening moments in which we are focused directly on the life of Jennifer aka J to the unrecognizable change to following Randall aka R My First Mister will make you laugh make you cry and make you realize that friendship is stronger than the clothes you wear or the amount of piercings on you face. Through the use of Brooks' every man persona and Sobieski's attention to detail with her character this film gives us a rare glimpse into Lahti's nearperfect film.What initially pulled me into this film was the untraditional Hollywood story that scribe Jill Franklyn unfolds before us. I assumed prior to watching the film that this was going to be a sexual film mocking the taboos of age in our society. From the completely baffling byline one could only assume that we were about to experience an early version of Thirteen but Lahti and Franklyn do something rather unexpected. The idea of sex is placed in front of us early in the film and prior to the climax but it isn't the central focus. By building this film around the premise of friendship instead of sex Lahti creates a unique and poignant film about other cultural taboos in our society. She eliminates the idea of sex and gives us two strongwilled characters that perhaps in another life may have had a sexual relationship but now are just seeking companionship and comfort. What brings a smile to my face with this story is the way that it is developed. Lahti nearly teases us with the idea of a sexual story several times but instead builds a solid foundation around friendship. She makes us the audience feel as if we are meeting two friends for the first time. By eliminating sex she pulls us deeper within the characters allowing us to see the true love that is obviously between these visual opposites. I use the word visual because we do not believe their connection at first because of the clothes that they wear. A Goth girl befriends Mr. Rogers? Society would tell us that this could never happen but the Lahti persuades us by giving us two of the strongest characters to play against each other in modern cinematic history.I realize that others would argue that there have been stronger matching in Hollywood long before Brooks and Sobieski which I would agree of classic Hollywood but recently basically 80s to present it is hard to find two actors that seem to compliment each other like a great cheese and aged red wine. Sobieski dove head first into her character giving J mannerisms and characteristics that seemed pure and researched. I felt as if Sobieski was one of those misunderstood Goths that I had class with in school. From the poetry the eye movements when speaking and the overall selfabusive negativity that she has against herself as well as those around her. She patiently waits for the right person to enter her insane life and finds that with Brooks. For those seeking his typical sarcasm and wry attitude My First Mister may disappoint. Albert Brooks contains himself in this film. He does so to the point that midway through the feature I forgot that it was funnyman Brooks. He amazingly transforms himself into an older version in a khaki color of J. The two play so well off each other that as an audience member you have the chance to enjoy both the acting as well as a very strongly developed story about family and friendship.I have talked about the story I have talked about the characters but none of this would have been possible if it were not for the brilliant direction behind the camera and the talented eye of minimal director Christine Lahti. At first I was unsure of how well she would be able to handle such a deeply emotional topic if she would clich the characters and fill their mouths with remedial dialogue that would be painful to both the eyes and ears but instead she remained calm cool and completely collective throughout the entire film. It was obvious that she had done her homework prior to each scene and before each take. She had the control of her actors which developed into some great onscreen chemistry as well as she knew how to tactfully take us to the next emotional level. Sure it wasn't perfect the ending seemed a bit tattered but Lahti remained focused and even cleverly changed the focus throughout the film with the greatest of ease. I was surprised to see that Lahti has not directed more after this project because it was obvious that her talent was behind the camera.Overall I thought My First Mister was a sensational film. We had a superb cast that complimented each other so well that we could easily forget that we were watching a film. We had a story that spoke emotionally and socially about friendship and family on more than just a June Cleaver level. Finally we had a director that was not afraid to take risks and do her homework. This story works on so many levels that to begin to unravel it would take more time than allowed. I suggest this film strongly because it will make you think twice about passing judgment on someone due to their clothes or piercing habits who knows where friendship could erupt! Grade  out of ".

The depression era setting was perfect for it and Ms Vargas. The rest of the actors including the lead male were just props for her role.

His smile is that of a shy and naf person thrown into a surrealistic situation. The commentators who have been lucky enough never to spend even 1 day in a concentration camp should be very wise to refrain from making those aberrant and abhorring remarks on the life on the 3rdReichconcentrationcampsplanet here in Israel we had a few years ago the famous or infamous Ivan Demianouk or Ivan the Red trial in Jerusalem  this Ivan played one of the savage and beastly part at Sobibor. So many details given by Mr. Lerner support the testimonies of the witnesses called to the bar at this trial. I am not sure but I think that Mr. Lerner was one of the witnesses.In any case I wanted to thank Mr. Lanzmann for making this movie without embellishments tricks or useless images. The testimony given by Mr. Lerner is more than enough and at the end the reading of all the transports made from all over Europe to the path of death at Sobibor is extremely true and important against all those who dare deny even the existence of the Holocaust  Shoah.I recommend this testimony to all especially those who research and study this terrible and dreadful period in the history of mankind.".

Knowing that they were doomed and led by an experienced soldier a Jewish captain of the Red Army a handful of inmates resolved to kill the few Germans in command of the large and brutal Ukrainian contingent that actually did most of the dirty work.Despite the horror of the situation and Mr. Lerner's subdued but dramatic recitation of his many escapes from German hands before landing in Sobibor both he and the audience can not resist a smile when he repeatedly emphasizes that the escape plot could never have succeeded but for the Germans' compulsive indeed fanatical penchant for punctuality.  That was the key to quickly killing them before any discovered what was coming down.

The technical accurateness of the film is stunning a hallmark of german sub movies. The warships are real german Tboats equal to WW1 destroyers a light cruiser and the last riveted german sub design based on a war type. The events in the film are based on specific real cases or as the rumour spreading in the village 'true to original'. E.g. the sinking of the cruiser en route to Russia resembles the death of Lord Kitchener whose ship was sunk either by a mine layed by a sub or by a subs torpedo unclear because the sub never returned home. The encounter with the Qboat and the scene with more men than Tauchretter emergency diving gear 'everybody or nobody!' happened several times in reality. So this film is probably the most realistic sub movie ever made. But the film gained a very bad reputation because nazi propaganda used it for its own purposes including glorifying heroic death. Goebbels ordered one cut to be made After the successful sinking of the cruiser the sub commanders mother Adele Sandrock refuses to celebrate with the officials because 'So many innocent people were killed just because they did their duty as our people do.They too had relatives now mourning the losses.So we should not gloat but thank god that this time our relatives will come back alive.'. This seemed unacceptable so this scene was removed. After the war it was put back and another scene got removed On one occasion when the commander is forced to hold a patriotic speech he says 'About once a century a country needs a great war like a cleaning thunderstorm to stay united and not to become decadent'. Both cuts I consider as questionable. While it is quite doubtful if any common person in WWI would have said that killing the enemy is nothing to celebrate so the film ist more moderate than reality instead of vice versa the opinion 'too long peace results in especially nasty wars' was common and has some of truth in it. Conclusion This film should be shown without cuts but maybe with some background information. It is in my opinion the best Sub movie made in Germany far superior to 'Subs westward ho' crude propaganda and 'the boat' even the books author complained about adulterationsto say nothing of Hollywood junk like 'U 571'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Betragen ungengend! is the seventh and final film from the West German Germanlanguage film series about the Lmmel a bunch of students who keep playing pranks on their teachers led by Pepe Notnagel Hansi Kraus. While Kraus was the star early on in the series the focus switched more and more away from him to veteran actor Theo Lingen who played the school's principal in all these movies. And in this last work it is all about him being forced to retire or retire voluntarily and spend more time with his family. But when it's about to happen the students realize that they actually love their principal. This 85minute film is my second least favorite from the franchise and only the sixth film is worse. Luckily here the action is once again at the school for the most part and it is also a bit about the pranks again. However I did not like at all that Knrz was depicted as a main antagonist here and suddenly powerhungry and mean. I always saw a likable slob in him in the previous films. It's fine they wanted to go for some character development but in my opinion it was not working out. So the franchise ends sadly on a low note after being really prolific with 7 films in under 5 years. Kraus had clearly grown up by the early 1970s. The thing I liked the most here was probably the music and the ending was actually kinda touching too. But 2 strong songs and Lingen's convincing way to close the franchise are not enough to make up for all the mediocrity. I do not recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".

It was amazing to see so young a boy be so believable in his role. I believe that Erika Eleniak could do a good job of acting if she were given a more challenging role. She shined in Under Siege. I wish she could land a role that would give her something to live up to. There were some rather predictable parts but that is the nature of movies like this. The one part that made me laugh was a shootout where three bad guys with 12gauge shotguns can't hit the person they are after. All three of them are blazing away but they only manage to take out light bulbs and a bunch of woodwork. That was lame. The director must not have fired a shotgun or he would have known that scene needed to be modified. Anyway there is a story here a mom struggling to save her son cops trying to catch some bad guys and a teen boy stuck in the middle of it all.

She ends up in the company of a mom the luscious Erica Eleniak and her teenage son Jeremy Lelliott and all hell breaks loose when the son finds the money. Plenty of people die there are some car chases and the ending features a decent cat fight between the two Eleniak and Du Page. I am with those who think Eleniak deserves better roles than she normally gets but better she is working than not at all. B movie stalwart James Remar plays an FBI agent who hooks up with Eleniak although he is given little to do. The focus is on the two extremely beautiful women which was fine with me. Du Page has a shower scene guys.".

Features your usual assortment of corrupt cops and mob tough guys chasing our heroes and trying to get the money back. Sure a routine plot but this one is better than average mostly because of superior acting. Erika Eleniak is totally adorable and convincing as the mother. She is no longer a sexy young thing but it looks like middle age is really going to agree with her. Best acting honors though go to Jeremy Lelliot who convincingly plays her son and carries the film. This character is the hinge for most of the story's development and a lesser actor in the role would have destroyed the movie.Oh and of course there is as always one of those Baldwin guys in some role or other. The Baldwins ought to get their own union  but they probably don't need it as it already seems to be a rule in Hollywood that you need at least one Baldwin in every movie. Feh!Anyway the dialogue and action really move this film along. Pleasant and diverting good for an evening's entertainment.".

First of all what rescues this from being standard direct to video fare is the direction of action film helmer Mark L. Lester. In addition the cast which includes James Remar and Adam Baldwin has some underrated talent in it. Most surprising of all is the dynamic between Julie Le Page as the hit woman with the lam and former Baywatch babe Erika Eleniak as a single mother with her troubled teenage son on road trip to her mother's place in Texas. Julie hits all the right notes as the manipulative sociopathic hit woman who regards the unwitting mother and son as ride over the state lines with a stash of a million dollars. The female characters are strong Julie physically and Eleniak as the mother fighting for her son's life and makes the film very compelling. The road movie through the desert crime caper is nothing new nor original Thelma and Louise anyone but the performance of the sexy Le Page and the twist of ruthless hit woman teamed up with single mom trying to do the right thing brings a very interesting dichotomy to what could have been an otherwise forgettable film.".

	schema:headline " A winner  including an Anti James Dean and a rotten rental car";
	schema:reviewBody "Betrayal is a B movie all right but it has a plot with interesting angles and delivers good entertainment some suspense and many hilarious moments. The main character is a teenager with a low IQ but a high sense of responsibility  in short an Anti James Dean. His mother a single mom is totally broke and he wants to help them get out of their misery. So he takes on a job delivering bags he does not know what's in them. Even the first delivery goes wrong because the boy wants to help a guy who is writhing and retching on the ground. It's a trap and the boy sees the bag snatched away from him because he showed empathy.He goes back to mom after a while the gangsters shoot into the house and the boy tells his mom everything and says that he is sorry. Mom says it's bad but that she is even MORE sorry than he this exchange seems to be inspired by Dr. Strangelove and is repeated several times throughout the movie. They decide to flee to granny who is living far away but have not the money to buy a train ticket. Luck strikes as in the queue in front of the railroad ticket office they meet a sexy young lady who says she had her driver's license removed wants to travel to the same destination and offers them to finance a rental car which is terribly unreliable as it will turn out. Big big coincidences but not entirely impossible or unbelievable.The sexy lady is of course a contract killer who carries millions in cash in her aluminum suitcase and is pursued by the police and the mob she stole the money from. Mom and son are used as a shield and the son gets some sexual education on the way. That this weird triangle works so well can be credited to the involved actors who do a good job. Especially Jeremy Lelliott is very convincing he is quite likable and displays the necessary goofiness for the part.A lot more happens in this movie coincidences abound and the good people win in the end. My favorite scene is the son's coming home to the deserted house he and his mom supposedly have left for an undetermined but certainly pretty long time. He carries the aluminum suitcase with its precious content and is pursued by the mob the corrupt police the honest police and the sexy lady who is a killer. But he quietly goes to the fridge takes out a ready to eat dinner and switches the TV on where just that moment just on that channel there is some news about the mob the sexy lady killer his mom and their exchange. Speak of an ideal situation. Life really should be that way sometimes.You single moms out there take an example from this movie do hide a revolver in the exhaust hood of your kitchen too  just in case. It might come in handy as Betrayal amply proves. And the gun will remain well greased over any length of time.".

What she didn't have Erika Elenkiak as the tough mother had too much of. Wearing too tight sweaters throughout the film making her breasts look over sized she didn't do too much acting. Only looking forlorn and confused. Did she not know what was happening? Adam Baldwin plays a small role thank goodness. With his usual non expressive face he wanders through this trite movie aimlessly. Then we have the son played by Jeremy Lellliott who spends most of the film crying.

That or if the writing had been strong enough a psychopath exploitation movie of the 60s and 70s. Instead Betrayal is poorly written and at times poorly acted.Here the stories of two groups of people collide. On the one hand is the seductive Jayne a ruthless hitwoman who settles a contract for a mob boss but then decides to run off with money meet her partner somewhere in Texas. She's quick with a gun and has a nuclear weapon between her legs so the henchmen have no easy task ahead of them trying to get to her. On the other hand you have a seemingly quaint mother and teen son who are heavily in debt. So the bonehead son and this is not his first of flubs having connections to street thugs decides to help his mother by delivering some cocaine for a gangster. Only he is jumped and the stash is stolen. And the gangster thinks that the son tried to rip him off though other than a driveby shooting he doesn't seem convinced enough to stick around looking for him. So his mother decides that now they have to flee to Texas to stay with her mother. So of course they cross paths with Jayne who concocts a story so she can hitch a ride with them. And now they have mafia crooked cops and the FBI on their tail... the chase is on.Only despite the forced meeting of the characters the movie might've been more enjoyable Bmovie fare if the events transpired in a more believable way. Given the scenes between the mother and son at the train station you'd think it was just another day they were going to visit grandma rather than the necessity to flee from a gangster looking for his stash of cocaine. There are also several opportunities for them to escape from Jayne just as there are opportunities for the hit men to kill Jayne. As the movie progresses things proceed almost haphazardly as though it were a light dress rehearsal.

Though D'Onofrio's accent was a bit questionable at times he was believable enough and George's character was never in question. The story however was so absolutely dreadful that I'm surprised that the two fine lead actors agreed to appear in it. I am absolutely shocked that the commentary on this movie has been primarily positive. I had the misfortune of stumbling across this movie on television recently and getting sucked into it forcing me to spend the better part of two hours wanting to rip the stuffing out of my sofa and eat it which probably would have been more pleasant than this pile of trash. WARNING MINOR SPOILERS BELOW This is basically the story of a woman who is too shallow to accept a simple life with a fisherman despite her love for him and is rewarded by him spending his life cheating on his wife to be with her. I don't find this touching or romantic in the slightest. I find it an appalling treatise encouraging women to go ahead and be golddigging status mongers your fisherman will come back to you in the end anyway. Oh yeah and if you decide to follow your heart and devote yourself to the fisherman expect him to turn his back on you for his socialite mistress. I would have loved it if George had her heart ripped out by Gavin finally telling her that she'd blown her chance and he was going to throw her back to the dogs like the shallow pretentious witch she was. Even George getting a good vengeful punch in the mouth by Josie's hand at the end would have been somewhat satisfying. END SPOILER CONTENT If the film's intent was to disgust appall and make the watcher feel like throwing a shoe through the screen in hopes of maiming George then it succeeded. Unfortunately I think it was supposed to be a gooey touching romance. Thank goodness real life usually isn't like this horrid commentary on man's values or I'd be ashamed to be living it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having long since broken things off with her boyfriend Annie and her new beau plan a romantic holiday on an ocean liner.  When onboard a disgruntled exemployee of the liner disables the computer controls and sets it on a collision course while he escapes with his goods.  Alex has to take him on and try to stop the ship as it races' out of control.As if Twister hadn't done it already Speed 2 basically showed us that the potential that was shown by De Bont's debut was clearly misplaced and he has yet to show he was really anything other than in the right place at the right time when it came to Speed.  The smell of desperation is in the air from the very start when Reeves declined to star although Bullock was more desperate and did it.  This caused Annie to repeatedly state that relationships built on etc etc never work out' all in an effort to explain it away and help the audience move on.  That the film is constantly harking back to a much better film is a big problem it would almost have been smarter just to move totally away than to retread.The plot is plain silly and never gets close to being involving.  To demonstrate this I never once gave a rats' ass what was happening  people got crushed by the boat and mangled in it's propellers unseen but the film or me never care and never lingers.  Likewise the supposed big climax is unengaging and smacks of desperation  bang for buck and all that.  The whole set up never really feels immediate or threatening even when the boat swings out of control it is difficult to feel terrified as the boat slooooowly goes towards the tanker worst come to worst people can jump off to safety.  The cruiser setting also is daft when seen beside the bus concept  the vast majority of the audience will ride a bus quite often very few of us can relate to an ocean liner!  The speed is a problem and it is almost laughable it works so poorly!The cast is another problem.  Bullock tries to repeat her sparky performance from the first film  when she manages it it only feels like an impression when she doesn't manage it she is cast as a shrieking beauty needing saving. However she also struggles from a lack of chemistry with Patric.  It is a shame as he is an OK actor but not used to a pure action role and not used to not having material to work with.

	onyx:emotionText "Having long since broken things off with her boyfriend Annie and her new beau plan a romantic holiday on an ocean liner.  When onboard a disgruntled exemployee of the liner disables the computer controls and sets it on a collision course while he escapes with his goods.  Alex has to take him on and try to stop the ship as it races' out of control.As if Twister hadn't done it already Speed 2 basically showed us that the potential that was shown by De Bont's debut was clearly misplaced and he has yet to show he was really anything other than in the right place at the right time when it came to Speed.  The smell of desperation is in the air from the very start when Reeves declined to star although Bullock was more desperate and did it.  This caused Annie to repeatedly state that relationships built on etc etc never work out' all in an effort to explain it away and help the audience move on.  That the film is constantly harking back to a much better film is a big problem it would almost have been smarter just to move totally away than to retread.The plot is plain silly and never gets close to being involving.  To demonstrate this I never once gave a rats' ass what was happening  people got crushed by the boat and mangled in it's propellers unseen but the film or me never care and never lingers.  Likewise the supposed big climax is unengaging and smacks of desperation  bang for buck and all that.  The whole set up never really feels immediate or threatening even when the boat swings out of control it is difficult to feel terrified as the boat slooooowly goes towards the tanker worst come to worst people can jump off to safety.  The cruiser setting also is daft when seen beside the bus concept  the vast majority of the audience will ride a bus quite often very few of us can relate to an ocean liner!  The speed is a problem and it is almost laughable it works so poorly!The cast is another problem.  Bullock tries to repeat her sparky performance from the first film  when she manages it it only feels like an impression when she doesn't manage it she is cast as a shrieking beauty needing saving. However she also struggles from a lack of chemistry with Patric.  It is a shame as he is an OK actor but not used to a pure action role and not used to not having material to work with.  He lacks charisma and is quite unconvincing.  Dafoe is awful he drags the film down as much as anyone. His villain is a joke and never threatens in the way that Hopper's did who managed to be funny and scary.  It is a bad impression all round.

The entire movie is filled with extremely bad timed jokes and unrealism beyond recognition... The killer being sandra bullock chainsawing open a fire door with people trapped behind that door as if there wouldn't be an emergency handle and what the  is a chainsaw doing near the cabins?!? After completing this task sandra keeps the chainsaw in the opening she just made. the people look at her and say she has to get out of the way with the chainsaw. she looks back doesn't respond. They have to ask AGAIN and then she's all like oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry sorry sorry. taking another 5 minutes to apologize before she finally removes the roaring blade....another great feature about this movie is the fact that people have to die 4 times before actually dying or other impossible things that somehow the actors can make possible with their magic wand or something. a nice example  SPOILER  The bad guy i didn't even bother remembering his name is flying one of those water planes. He isn't really paying attention as he flies over an oil tanker and hits the mast with a speed over 50 mph at minimum... Instead of crashing down or getting hit off course nooo... the plane instantly stops and gets stuck at the top of the mast. The bad guy naturally hasn't a scratch. Then suddenly the plane decides to explode taking the entire oil tanker with it. Of course there couldn't be any safety measures on board since oil isn't flammable at all. anyway my conclusion is that speed 2 is a blown up piece of poo and should have never been made. this is one of those movies just to get people in the seats leaving them to die of boredom in the theatre. and was probably a career killer for sandra bullock too....".

	schema:reviewBody "Let the screenwriters and director go down with the ship I say. As the sun sets slowly in the West Speed 2 Cruise Control sinks without a trace. The sequel to 1995's surprise driveabus hit has barely caused a ripple at the box office. The threadbare script is mostly to blame. It consists almost entirely of simplistic exclamationpoint dialogue like We're gonna crash! We're going too fast! Do something! This isn't happening! We gotta get him outta here! There's not much time left! and the ever useful Oh st!There is indeed not much time left for characterization or interpersonal drama. Speed 2 gets off to a winkydinky start with Sandra Bullock taking yet another disastrous driving test. Bullock's natural charm can go only so far however and you keep wanting to throw her a life preserver or a new script. As people drop dead around her she must continue to whine about the ruination of her vacation. Bullock doesn't get a lot of help from blandish costar Jason Patric who plays her cop boyfriend. The nasty computerliterate villain who likes to attach bloodsucking leeches to his body is certainly quirky. Willem Dafoe who's pretty quirky himself does what he can with the overriding vagaries of his character's madbomber motivation. The action bits are fairly frequent but seem anemic when compared to what else is available to fans of such. Director Jan De Bont fared much better in 1996 with the flying cows and funnel clouds of Twister. Speed 2 ends up with some highly anticipated destruction as the cruise ship plows into the island of St. Martin. No matter as I hear the whole thing was computergenerated anyway. This cruise is no carnival and could have used a cameo by Kathie Lee. Would loved to have seen Dafoe slap her around a bit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Possibly the worst film ever made.  Not just from of the content of the film but because the film makers wasted over 100 million dollars making the film whose best aspect is that it shares the same title as the original.Speed 2 consists of a two hour sequence of a bad story supported by a lot of shallow acting and shocking dialogue.  The first half has the feeling and depth of an episode of the love boat.  Sandra Bullock displays the full range of her acting ability as she did in the first film but this time the direction and script don't come to the rescue.  Teaming up with Sandra is Jason Patric who is relatively uknown in big money holywood circles and he shows you why.  His acting is flat shallow and uninteresting and most of the time you could care if he was water skiing naked off the back of the boat. From here the bad guy Willem Defoe starts to do his stuff and the show falls into a ramble of shodily put together events which seems to have little to do with each other or the script.At this point the director probably could have saved the film by playing off the acting skills of Willem Defoe in a headtohead type matchup of skill and wits.  But the director chooses the special effects path for the film to take and wastes the characters of Willem Defoe and Tumuera Morrison and instead of running away to a speay climax the film slows to a halt with a scene that explain where the majority of the film budget disappeared to.All I can say is  How dare people waste the sort of money that goes into a such as this!! Was it made as a joke by some hollywood producer to laugh in the faces of smalltime unsigned film makers who could make 50 decent films for the price of this one ? I guess we'll never really know since all we have as an answer is the two hours of awfullness that sombody called a film.".

	schema:headline " Another one of those sequels";
	schema:reviewBody "You all know what I mean. No one has any original idea so they find a movie that was popular a few years back that did not necessarily need a sequel and then they make one with little thought going into it. Speed 2 Cruise Control is not only one of those movies it might be the worst movie I have ever seen that did that. The film stars Sandra Bullock reprising her role from the original Speed and a new male lead played by Jason Patric taking over for Keanu Reeves who smartly bailed out. The villain is played by Willem Dafoe who once worked for the company that made the cruise ship's autopilot and was fired when he became sick. With revenge on the mind he takes control of the cruise ship and plans to crash it all to get revenge and steal some jewelry.As part of their anniversary Alex Patric and Annie Bullock go on a Caribbean Cruise. The film's antagonist John Geiger Dafoe takes control of the ship and forces the crew and passengers to abandon ship on threat of blowing the ship up. A small group of passengers and crew are left on board and it's up to Alex Annie first mate Juliano Tempura Morrison and the small remainder of the crew to stop the cruise ship before it is forced to crash.A line that Bullock's character uses to describe her relationship with Alex is We know nothing about each other. Ironically that is how it is with the majority of the characters including the two leads. The most we know about our leads is that they are in a relationship Alex is a cop Annie is a terrible driver and any other detail that the audience might remember from Annie that we learned in the first Speed. The only character we get to know is Geiger and he is not very interesting. In the first Speed we got to learn a little bit about some of the more minor characters on the bus such as Stephens Alan Ruck but in Speed 2 Cruise Control at the most we either get to see who their family is or are told what their job is. We get nothing beyond that. The only character who might be a little memorable is the little girl named Drew Christine Firkins due to her being able to take care of herself better than most of the adults in the movie and her creepy line asking Alex to wait for her. Another problem with the film is the actors and the acting. Throughout the whole film the actors seem uninterested and to not be on their A game. Bullock is the most obvious example of this. While Bullock is a good actor she was not trying and sounded more like a whiny child than a person who has been in a similar situation before and can be cool headed. The next biggest problem is that the film is a one and a half hour story that is told in two hours. There is a chase between Alex and Geiger at the hour and ten minute mark where it could have ended the entire film then and there. However the movie keeps going the remainder of the time being filled up with the cruise ship having to avoid an oil tanker and then it crashing into a harborside town.With a story that overstays its welcome boring characters weak usage of comic relief lacking any tension with a clich ending and being overall stupid Speed 2 Cruise Control is a prime example of movie sequels with little thought put into it. I will say that one positive thing is that it does not feel like it insults the audience but that is about it. My advise? Watch Speed and stay as far away from this as you can.".

This moving movie deals with some desperate passengers threatened who are saved by Jason Patric and Sandra Bullock  based on the characters created by Graham Yost.

The couple on Caribbean cruise holidays hops on board but the captain Bo Svensonis killed and the valiant cop takes the wheel . Mindless overlong and tiring film is packed with thrills intrigue suspense tension and lots of interminable action. Silly relationship between two main characters Patrick and Bullock based on risked circumstances work out pretty bad . Willem Dafoe steals the show as psycho mastermind  Jason Patric is regular as brave intrepid police and of course Sandra Bullock does her usual role as feisty woman . Ample support cast who play the cruise passengers as Temuera Morrison Colleen Camp  Lois Chiles Glenn Plummer  Tim Conway  among others . Ridiculous argument by Jan De Bont  McCormick and Nathanson that dispenses absurd excitement as well as entertainment. Packs colorful and atmospheric cinematography using Steadicam or handheld camera by Jack N. Green . And stirring and exciting musical score fitting to action by Mark Mancina . The picture is middling realized in his secondtime as director by Jan De Bont a successful cameraman Basic Instict Die Hard and Paul Verhoveen's ordinary photographer and occasionally director Speed  Twister. The film will appeal to Sandra Bullock fans. Rating  Below average .".

Silly relationship between two main characters Patrick and Bullock based on risked circumstances work out pretty bad . Willem Dafoe steals the show as psycho mastermind  Jason Patric is regular as brave intrepid police and of course Sandra Bullock does her usual role as feisty woman . Ample support cast who play the cruise passengers as Temuera Morrison Colleen Camp  Lois Chiles Glenn Plummer  Tim Conway  among others . Ridiculous argument by Jan De Bont  McCormick and Nathanson that dispenses absurd excitement as well as entertainment. Packs colorful and atmospheric cinematography using Steadicam or handheld camera by Jack N. Green . And stirring and exciting musical score fitting to action by Mark Mancina . The picture is middling realized in his secondtime as director by Jan De Bont a successful cameraman Basic Instict Die Hard and Paul Verhoveen's ordinary photographer and occasionally director Speed  Twister. The film will appeal to Sandra Bullock fans. Rating  Below average .";

This success prompts movie studios to make a needless sequel in the hope that the name alone will draw big bags of currency. These sequels are often bad because the originals did not leave any space for another movie. Speed 2 Cruise Control is a sequel in name only. It cost nearly four times as much as Speed although its earnings were significantly lower. No link exists in setting and plot and the premises are completely different.Sandra Bullock reprises her role as the lovable Annie Porter this time with Jason Patric playing her boyfriend. The dialogue explains that she broke up with Keanu Reeves' character from the first film for a number of reasons but the real reason is that Reeves did not want to make a sequel. A bald Joe Morton and Glenn Plummer have cameos but aside from that and a few humorous references to Speed there is no connection.Annie and her boyfriend Alex Shaw Jason Patric decide to go on a Caribbean cruise aboard the luxurious Seabourn Legend and have the bad luck to be on the same vessel with John Geiger Willem Defoe. Geiger spent years designing the computer systems on the ships and can take control from his laptop. He is bitter because his exposure to the computers gave him severe copper poisoning and the company fired him when they found out. He now takes several prescriptions and carries a jar of leeches to suck the copper from his blood. Apparently nobody learned from George Washington's death.After murdering the Seabourn Legend's captain Geiger sets off a series of smoke bombs conveniently hidden in his golf clubs and gives the first mate Temuera Morrison fifteen minutes to evacuate. This proves to not be enough time but Geiger restarts the engine anyway and sets it on a collision course with a colossal oil tanker.Willem Defoe The Man with the Golden Laugh comes through with a rock solid performance once again. He is funny charming and extremely weird. Take for example when he vents towards the ship's captain. He sates That's what really infuriates me you don't even know what I'm talking about! in a voice of anguish that does not sound normal. Nothing about Geiger is normal. I felt sorry for him but not enough to justify his actions. After seeing this and SpiderMan my dad wondered out loud if Defoe could go into public places without getting funny looks.The action onboard the ship is the film's best in concepts execution and intensity. Director Jan de Bont establishes many of the ship's sets so the layout seems familiar when the action starts. It is in the final half hour that the operation falls apart and loses its recommendation. It involves a nutty boat chase and a crash scene that is supposed to be amazing but is undermined by fake effects and jokes that seem inspired by Abbott and Costello.Another turn off may be the absurdity of the stunts such as the sequence with the seaplane or the bit where Shaw floats mere feet away from one of the liner's propellers and eventually stops them with a cable. Speed 2 embraces its goofiness with pleasure but overkill proves to be its undoing. It is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made but it too often crosses the line into farce.".

If not for them this movie would have 0 on Rotten Tomatoes instead of the 3 it does have. I can see them liking some aspects and some parts but both guys actually thinking this was a good movie is beyond me. Honestly I found this movie worse than Batman  Robin. Batman  Robin tried to be cheesy and kiddie but it accidentally crossed the line between fun and stupidity. That movie's weirdness just got old after a while and was actually fun in many parts. Speed 2 was not comical and did not become old after a while. Here's what happens Sandra Bullock and Jason Patric go on a cruise were madman Willem Dafoe uses crazy computer schemes to blow everything up. Sounds good and fresh right? The first halfhour actually is good. People having fun on a cruise Jason Patric going to propose to Sandra Bullock. When the movie switches gears by becoming more of an action movie as Dafoe hijacks the ship that is when everything becomes very bad very quickly. If the movie would have stayed the way it was the first little bit I would have liked this movie just as much as Siskel and Ebert. But nobody knew a ship being taken over would not work that idea hasn't been done a whole lot and when it has been done it turns out to be a success. The main problem with is the acting and dialogue the two are in conjunction in this case. Sandra Bullock is one of Hollywood's best actresses who does a mega crappy job in this. Jason Patric started off okay but the gear switching made him just as bad as his onscreen girlfriend. Everybody else in this movie is just as bad. The saviour is Willem Dafoe. He was the only reason I did not just turn off my TV. Dafoe is an awesome actor who nails this as an insane computer hacker. But even he got stuck with some poorly written dialogue. Some of the destructive scenes on the ship and filming techniques are actually pretty good until a dumb character blurts out laughable material. But eventually even the disaster scenes become boring and the CGI becomes funny too.".

The man has aspirations to escalate and move on up into the cell phone industry something a close companion informs both him and us of the dangers and sheer risk of going anywhere near but a selfpromotion is what he wants and his lust to subscribe to a Capitalist ideal in escalating and moving up a rung into a richer sector for himself and his family is what he wants. The film coming to resemble a fascinating deeply involving drama about the man having to raise the money to get this dream going the lengths he has to go and how it affects not only his wellbeing but those around him.The film is a satisfying blending of gritty realism with black comedy with certain escapist absurdest elements. It isn't everyday you encounter a film that contains a Bollywoodstyle musical number describing how the Islamic world is now rife with Western infused ideologies complete with musicians unbeknownst to the characters but directly addressing us as well as a tense and unnerving encounter at a border checkpoint as Kalachnikov wielding guards sniff over a truck whose driver is trying to smuggle items across. Director Ben Hopkins whom through his name doesn't strike me as being particularly Turkish balances all the elements and content perfectly demonstrating expertly an ability to portray life in a foreign nation under a foreign culture at a set time some fifteenodd years ago. Hopkins has an eye for catching the hardships and lifestyles the majority of his characters lead and how they affect them. The urgency applied to the film given what's at stake and what it is that is to be undertaken means to his characters displays an acute sense of awareness on Hopkins' behalf of a specific country and its specific people going through very specific changes at a specific time  in short it's nigh on masterfully directed. The lead is indeed Mihram a conversation with fellow business accomplice Mustafa Sahin in a dingy little outdoor corridor set away from the main street the film's point of no return as he undertakes this business mission. Behind the lead metal shutters appear cold and shut off what is behind him so we cannot see the sense that they resemble a closed shop front or a previous establishment which has since gone out of business and been shut down at the front gently resonating with us as what is spoken about plays out. Leading off into the distance and into brilliant white daylight manipulated so as to catch our eye at the end of this tunnel is a path into the unknown a road down which it itself is dark and dingy but offers a fleeting glance at salvation in the process. The placing of the two characters here and having them speak of what they speak about foreshadow's Mihram's passage or journey ahead which could very well end in either disaster or a considerably betteroff existence as exemplified by the looming shutters thrust down upon a local business or the high life representative by the bright light.Hopkins' setting of the film in a dusty warm humid period of summer in 1994 Turkey allows ideas linked to the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe of around the time to play out more effectively and in a fresher manner Mihram is most probably one of the first to unleash himself upon this newfound opportunity of more global supply and demand. The explosion of a newfound sense of identity or of 'self' within the depths of Eastern Europe at around this time appear to enable people such as the man we follow in Mihram to partake in a more generalised more Western way of living born out of the collapse of former ways of life. Indeed in one sequence on an isolated and somewhat barren rural hillside an elderly woman berates cell phone company employees for overseeing maintenance on a large pylon in her vicinity the pylon of which is more broadly linked to Mihram's overall Capitalist goal in that he chases a cell phone enterprise and one of which is intrinsically linked to an elderly more traditional person's disregard for both the fresher mindset and the globalised ideas that arrive with these ideas.The central point of interest is what gallivanting off on this trek does to our lead The Market A Tale of Trade effectively an hour of a man put through a wringer of Western approaches to business and the cold hearted calculated criminally minded characteristics it either brings out in him or given whatever early perception you have of the man accentuates. One particularly distressing scene unfolds in a hospital the walking through a child's ward so as to get to somewhere in which the stealing of some medicine is possible  an allowing of the lead to observe whom it is he is effectively taking from so as to hopefully garner an advance in his own life. Was Mihram this home owning family man whom has a youngster of his own always this kind of person? Or have fresh ideologies implemented on both his nation and those republics around Turkey veered everybody off and away from the equal distributing Communist mindset into greed and individualism. The blackly comic humour abound in his bumbling attempts to do what he is trying are blended in majestically the film a thoroughly nourishing slice of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "An admirable film both in intent and execution but one which somehow never had the devastating impact it's tragic story would seem to deserve. Part of a long line of films showing the incredible hardships kids who are orphaned and left to the streets face e.g. 'Pixote' in this case there is a powerful political facet as well. A middle class Kurdish journalist and his wife are gunned down in front of their young children a boy a girl and an infant by Turkish paramilitary troops seemingly bent on silencing political opposition. The children are left to fend for themselves ending up out on the street before long. They are ignored by most before finally settling in with some other street kids and a prostitute who treats the young girl with kindness. This leads to a plot twist I won't give away here but one with considerable punch. So why wasn't I more blown away by this wellmeaning film? I think it's because I felt a sense of slickness and manipulation. The film is shot with a certain reserve. Instead of handheld camera or a feeling of verite there's a distance in the pretty but almost Hollywood like cinematography. Unlike 'Pixote' or DeSica's best work I could feel the strings being pulled and so found my heart resisting. Also while the 10 year old Senay Orak is truly amazing as the sister much of the other acting in the film feels stiff and unnatural. I was always aware I was watching a movie not real life.I feel awful not loving the film more. It's heart is surely in the right place in bringing a tragic social and political situation to light. I wish it could have moved me to the tears it seemed trying so hard  too hard  to do. Nonetheless it's good enough that I would urge people to see it and judge for themselves.".

	schema:headline " Does Min Dit live up to the hype?";
	schema:reviewBody "Min Dit literally 'I Saw claims to be the most controversial movie which travels into the uncharted territories of the booming Turkish film industry which has turned out to be multifaceted complex and highly innovative over the last decade. Some of the recent Turkish movie makers are regarded as brave cineastes who don't dodge politically or socially sensitive subjects. For that matter Miraz Bezar seems to have won the hearts of some critics already with his directorial debut hailed by some as the most controversial movie of the Turkish cinema. However does Mind Dit actually live up to the hype? That's the question. We know that a lot of mainstream critics have been delivering eulogies for the movie. The very fact makes the impression that the movie may have been heavily hyped up given the fact the total viewers that the movie attracted at the box office was a bit more than 24.000. But you know what they say 'You must judge each film on its own merits without any preconceived notions about what it's like ' Regardless of the box office failure and the adulation of critics I decided to see this movie Germanbased Kurdish filmmaker Miraz Bezar holds to a notion that he can shed some light on the immediate history of Turkey through the eyes of kids. Tenyearold Glistan Senay Orak and her brother Frat Muhammed Al lead the story. Two nonprofessional child actors were casted by the director after he had met them on a bus trip to the East of Turkey. When their politically active parents were killed by paramilitary forces and their aunt is gone missing soon after that the two siblings were forced to take care their each other and their baby sister. The problem with Bezar's story starts here actually. Just like the previous examples he preserves the old notion of 'evil Turk' especially in the representation of Turkish security officers in the region. The gendarmerie officer Bezar creates is not only reflected as a murderer but he is also an adulterer. His examination of family life of a Turkish officer hey look he doesn't just kill Kurds but he also shags Kurds displays a silent undertow of racism. By showcasing a group of juvenile Kurdish delinquents Bezar seems to tell you that these kids had no choice to be a part of prostitution organized larceny and violence. The movie shows their father as a simple journalist who tries to make his living. This has never been the case within the region. They have always been highly politicized families. You can ask any public officer teachers doctors engineers about their experiences in the region. Just a 7 year old kid starting the primary school asks you which party you've just voted. This sounds like a shock to you because you would never expect a kid to be so involved in politics. Another wrong impression the movie gives is that it sounds like those people would be so much better off without the security personnel there. The camera focuses on choppers of the Turkish army and to a foreign eye the movie makes a haphazard or even an ignorant analogy with Afghanistan Iraq or Palestine. Some foreigners would even assume Turkey is the invader in the region. Do you know what happens when Turkish soldiers do not happen to be at the right place at the right time? You can Google 'blood feuds in the Southeast of Turkey' and you can learn how every year in blood for blood vendettas pass from Kurdish generations over land disputes grazing rights or matters of family honor. It's such a common thing a Kurdish family kill off another Kurdish family over a petty grazing field that violence doesn't make the news anymore.You want another example? In the last earthquake that Turkey experienced in Van a city close to the border tens of relief trucks have been plundered. They carried away tents and clothing desperately needed elsewhere and sold in the black market. When the reporter of CNNTURK Turkish branch of CNN asked the mayor about the plundering which the news channel was giving a live coverage of you know what Mr. Mayor said? He said We don't seem to have enough security here  I believe sensible Kurds saw the better picture of events when the supposedly proKurdish terrorist organization manipulated the confusion of the earthquake to wage fresh attacks against security forces rather than to help their own kind in such dire need. At another scene in the movie you see Frat a boy who is having problems with his math homework. The guest of the house who is being hidden from the police helps the kid Do you have problems with Turkish? and translates the simple problem into Kurdish. What do you understand from this scene? A foreigner would assume Kurds can't study because the medium of education is in Turkish. Somebody should ask the director whether he was taught in Turkish in Germany? Surely he must have had some education in German right? If you want to have a patina of racial fairness and balance about your movie you need more than a kid who can't just divide 360 with 3. Every year thousands of Kurdish students walk into medical schools law school etc in this country. If you want to say age old Turkish only and antibilingual education movements share restrictionist elements you need more than victimization of a race. If this ethnic conflict were as simple as Bezar reflected it would not end on one of these days. Lots of democratic reforms have been made over the last 1015 years. Prime Minister Erdogan's latest statement that Kurdish might be taught in school as a selective course won't end violence. As long as some Kurdish people ask for a separate country  as the kids around the bonfire sing for it in the movie no democratic reforms will be enough. If that were so Turkey wouldn't be losing more soldiers than ever now.".

Prime Minister Erdogan's latest statement that Kurdish might be taught in school as a selective course won't end violence. As long as some Kurdish people ask for a separate country  as the kids around the bonfire sing for it in the movie no democratic reforms will be enough. If that were so Turkey wouldn't be losing more soldiers than ever now.";

	schema:headline " What we can learn from this film";
	schema:reviewBody "The real question that The Naked Gun poses is not why it's one of the funniest spoofs ever made but why virtually no subsequent movie in this genre has been any good at all. I used to adore this sort of movie when I was a kidAirplane Top Secret and the sixepisode Police Squad show which became the basis for the Naked Gun series were among the funniest films I knew. When I first saw The Naked Gun in the theater when I was eleven I was in uncontrollable laughter for the first few minutes. That was my standard of great humor at the time.But the following decades gave us a variety of similar spoof films some of which involved one or more of the ZuckerAbramsNielsen team and none of these films were even remotely in the league of their predecessors. These included Hot Shots Loaded Weapon 1 Jane Austen's Mafia Spy Hard Wrongfully Accused and Scary Movie. These films would typically feature some funny stuff but you'd walk away indifferently wondering what the overall point was. Seeing a ponytailed Leslie Nielsen imitating John Travolta's dance sequence in Pulp Fiction is funny for a second but there's nothing enduring about such humor. An entire movie filled with such scenes doesn't amount to much. What's the big deal about such jokes anyway? There's nothing intrinsically funny about making references to other films even if you do it in a silly way. At what point did the genre go wrong and become such a dreary uninspired affair? Is it that I've just outgrown this sort of humor?I have another theory. When I first watched The Naked Gun at age eleven I had not seen many of the movies it was spoofing such as the early James Bond pictures. I was vaguely familiar with some of the clichs it was making fun of but many of the political and sexual jokes went right over my head. And the celebrity cameos meant nothing to me. So what was it about the film that appealed to me so much that made me laugh till my sides hurt?The answer is simple it was the film's utter silliness. Think of the scene at the beginning when we discover that Ayatollah Khomeini secretly sports a mohawk underneath his turban. Or the opening credits where the police car goes on the sidewalk inside buildings on a roller coaster and so on. None of this makes any sense of course it's just an exercise in pure absurdity. I loved The Naked Gun for pretty much the same reason I loved the Three Stooges or Bugs Bunny cartoons. Even as an adult I appreciate unsubtle cartoon humor when it is handled effectively. As long as it makes me laugh who cares that it's not sophisticated? For example the scene where Lt. Drebin breaks into a building and tries to be as quiet as possible but then inadvertently sets off a player piano is masterfully filmed.Thus The Naked Gun is farce as much as it is satire. As I grew older I would gain a greater appreciation for the oneliners like You take a chance getting up in the morning crossing the street or sticking your face in a fan. To be sure many of these jokes are dumb. They're supposed to be. That's the whole point. What I understood even at age eleven was that the movie was essentially playing games with the audience. When Lt. Drebin looks in a drawer and says bingo I knew immediately that the drawer would reveal a bingo board. I was used to this sort of humor because I'd seen it in the earlier ZuckerAbrams films where the jokes had a definite logic to them and trying to predict them in advance was part of the fun. They have far more to do with audience anticipation than with trying to make us laugh at bad puns.The modern spoof films have forgotten all this. They've forgotten that making a good spoof requires a measure of invention even if much of the plot is ripped off from elsewhere. Car chases may not be original but The Naked Gun is as far as I know the first film in which the chase is conducted by a student driver. This type of cleverness is largely absent from the modern spoofs which assume that they have no reason to be creative when their ideas are based broadly on other films. They've forgotten that the most effective way to make fun of a clich is by coming up with an ingenious twist. Even the characters in films like these matter and Lt. Drebin is crafted in the grand tradition of other inept lawmen like Inspector Clousseau. This is what gives the film its own personal stamp that makes it more than an exercise in movie references.".

Airplane did disaster films this one does police dramas.Frank Drebin Leslie Neilsen is a respected cop with gravel for a brain. He is part of a police force called Police Squad who the security of Queen Elizabeth has just been handed to for her visit to Los Angeles. Frank bumbles through several hilarious scenarios in trying to foil an assassination attempt on her and catch the attempted murderer of his best friend Nordberg OJ Simpson. Meanwhile he starts going out with the beautiful Jane Spencer Priscilla Presley.This movie goes from one hilarious situation to another from commandeering a car that's being used for a drivers test to trying to save a valuable pen from a fish tank. Leslie Neilsen's comedic timing is brilliant. His facial expressions during the slapstick sequences are priceless as are his deadseriousness of delivering one liners. Some of his quotes are so hilarious that I have trouble figuring out how he could have possibly kept a straight face during filming. This is another classic in the same style as Airplane which means hilarity. This gets a 910.It is rated PG13 for Crude and Sexual Humor and for Some Language.

Leslie Nielson has never been better and probably wont ever be this good ever again.  He brings an insane type of humor from a cop that hasn't been seen since Clouseau.  The supporting characters are good also including Priscilla Pressley George Kennedy Ricardo Montebaum Nancy Marchand and odd to see him in a movie today OJ Simpson.  There zany characters and added with a great script make this a treasure in cinema comedy.  One of the best films of the 80's.  A".

Det Nordberg was gunned down investigating a case in the docks and Drebin's investigation begins with the company that Nordberg was undercover with  that of pillar of the community Vincent Ludwig. As Frank falls for Ludwig's PA the beautiful Jane Spencer he uncovers proof of a dastardly plot by Ludwig  but who will believe him?If there is a man woman or child on this earth who can say hand on heart that they just don't find Airplane Naked Gun Police Squad and the like funny then I would very much like to meet the sad sack just to discover what it takes to elicit a smile from them. Needless to say this sort of film is very much my type of thing but not to the point where I cannot spot a good one from a bad one. In fact one of the big downsides of this film is that it did create many copies that just couldn't do it as well  so we have had spoofs of all sorts of genres recently but too many have more hits than misses.It is to this films credit that it has a very high hitmiss ratio and I enjoy it so much because the laughs keep coming. The material is very silly but it is the constant straight face that it delivers it with that is perfect and makes it work. Other films of the ilk have been overly silly without keeping this straight face. However our characters here seem oblivious  apart from the odd one who gives the other a funny look etc and this makes the goings on even funnier. The plot is silly but that doesn't matter as you will be laughing too much to really care. Having seen it so often I have stopped roaring the way I did the first time but I still chuckled all the way.The writing and direction is spot on  delivering sharp lines that make me laugh due to their sheer unexpectedness or the way they are so very out of place as well as sight gags that are imaginative and clever. However lets not forget a delivery by a very talented cast who make the material work. Praise goes to Nielsen in the lead he may have worn his role thin over the years with typecasting and shall we say 'less than perfect' material but give him the tools and he'll do you a job. He can be straight he can dither or he can just be a clown and he does them all here  his delivery is great whether it's action or reaction shots. Likewise I felt the rest of the cast did well even if most of them are given reaction shots to Drebin. Presley is straight and funny for it while Kennedy seems to fit into the material with ease. OJ doesn't have as much chance to be funny and seems a little stiff in the scenes he is in but he is still good  just pales a little when next to the others. I love Montalban and he uses his ooze really well in this film  and his reaction shots are very good. The support is all good but it is Nielsen doing his now timehonoured turn as spoofmaster than steals the show.Overall I love this genre and consider this film indeed the series to be up there with Police Squad and Airplane. It is not as hilarious as Airplane but it has way more hits than misses and is relentlessly funny. As a film it isn't perfect but anyone watching this who complains about plot holes lack of character development or lack of narrative really have missed the point.".

The first one is still the best but Naked Gun 2 12 and Naked Gun 33 13 were very funny too. That's why The Naked Gun series is the funniest movie series ever made.

So how did The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad get the ultimate movie rating from me? By being so ridiculously overthetop hilarious that it moved me to tears from laughing so hard and literally knocked me off of the couch when I saw it the first time. I remember the first time that I watched The Naked Gun. I was home alone it was on HBO and I figured that it might be a funny movie to kill a night with. I was chuckling during the opening scene but what really got me going was the scene in which O.J. Simpson attempts a drug bust on a ship. I laughed uncontrollably from that point forward at one point falling off my couch from laughter. The jokes are nonstop there is not a single serious moment in this movie and the gags are so rapidfire that you don't notice the unfunny ones because you are too busy laughing at the next one. The whole movie is hilarious but two scenes stand out as absolute classics to me the ship scene with O.J. Simpson and the climactic baseball scene. I have seen the movie a dozen times and those two scenes still have me hysterical every time. A mustsee film for anyone who likes slapstick humor or just has a sense of humor in general. Leslie Nielsen is superb. 1010!".

	schema:reviewBody "The writing team of David Zucker Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker became a famous success after Airplane! made nearly 24 times its budget. Although Kentucky Fried Movie exceeded its own 33 times it was their second film that gripped the attention of the critics and the public alike. They parlayed its success into the six episode show Police Squad. After Top Secret! they went back to their shortlived television show and made the first of three Naked Gun films. Bringing back the show's star Leslie Nielsen and their signature machine gun paced humor they crafted their finest work.Why did I spend 100 words giving the background to this movie? The answer is that there is not much else to say without spoiling the hilarious content. I grew up on Abbott and Costello Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges the first two are legendary and the third has a fiercely loyal following to this day. It has been difficult ever since for a comedy to impress me. There are only two comedies I have given a vote of ten stars. The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! is even better than Spaceballs.Inept Lt. Frank Drebin Leslie Nielsen of Police Squad returns from abroad to the news that his partner O.J. Simpson when he was still funny has been shot. We see it happen in the first of many sequences where we think the joke is over and then see it go on and on using wildly outofplace props. Meanwhile Vincent Ludwig Ricardo Montalban one of the most respected citizens in Los Angeles has concocted an elaborate scheme to assassinate the visiting Queen of England! Thankfully Lt. Drebin's boss Oscar winner George Kennedy and the rest of Police Squad have been assigned to protect her. That means Drebin must cross horns with Ludwig to prevent international disaster from culminatingat a Major League Baseball game! I am a huge baseball fan and the climax is the most sensationally funny scene I have ever watched. I even saw my hometown team although Zucker Abrahams and Zucker clearly had no idea how bad the Seattle Mariners were at the time. They do prove that you don't have to know baseball to make it into the Television Booth.From an acting standpoint The Naked Gun is about as good as it gets. Comedy is an entirely different discipline than dramatic acting. That is why you hear about certain actors simply as comedians. Some critics and acting teachers believe comedy is harder. Nielsen is the king of treating outrageous scripts like they are The Ten Commandments. He has been in many bad comedies but with the right script few are better at making even the best jokes funnier than they already are.Also notable is Ricardo Montalban. He publicly mentioned that he took the part for money to buy a new Chrysler. I immediately thought of Sean Connery upon reading this. After Thunderball Connery grew uninterested in playing James Bond possibly from the strain of four films in four years plus the deplorable Japanese media's behavior during the shooting of You Only Live Twice. In both that film and the later Diamonds Are Forever a role he only took for the cash his boredom is unmasked in the two worst lead performances of the series.Such is not the case with Montalban. His facial expressions during the seventh inning stretch of the baseball game and his conversation with a terrorist whose name I would never wish on anybody look like they come from a man enjoying the part. The ability to keep external factors off the screen or stage is one of the fundamental cores of acting that has been lost on many talented thespians through the years. Montalban is not one of them. Other actors should take notice.".

The great thing about The Naked Gun is that in addition to being genuinely funny it's a smart little film. Perfect example Raymond Chandler fans will get a kick out of the reference to Farewell My Lovely. Upon his first meeting with Priscilla Presley's character Leslie Nielsen as Lt. Frank Drebin notes in the voiceover She was giving me a look I could feel in my hip pocket. This line is lifted directly from Chandler's novel but it's so subtle and fits into the film so well that viewers who know nothing of Chandler won't feel left out. This along with Nielsen's lovably goofy performance is what separates the work of the Zucker brothers from knockoffs like Loaded Weapon. Sure you've seen The Naked Gun already...but see it again and you'll pick up on things you didn't notice the first time. Single best moment of the film O.J.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to hand it to the Zuckers and Abrahams. This is really funny a sendup of every crime movie you've ever seen something about a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth during her visit to Los Angeles. It borrows from every place. There's a scene lifted directly from Don Siegel's Telefon. Some of the firstperson narration quotes Raymond Chandler Her hair was the color of gold in old paintings. Most of the jokes are original though and half loony. Some don't work  a car pulls into a parking space at the docks and knocks a screaming man into the water. Others are so outlandish as to be almost surreal.In the opening scene Detective Nordberg a depressing but still effective O. J. Simpson creeps up gun drawn to a door behind which a dozen hoodlums are negotiating the purchase of a horde of dope. He takes a deep breath and kicks against the door. The door doesn't swing open. Instead Simpson's foot crashes through the panel and he must extract it and fiddle with the knob. By the time he gets the door opens and announces that everyone is under arrest the gang has their own guns loaded cocked and aimed at him. They shoot him six times. Instead of slumping to the deck he caroms around the walls shouting in pain when he bunks his head against some pipes when he puts his hand on a red hot wood stove when he leans against a wall of fresh paint when a window slams down on his hand when he steps into a bear trap and so on.Simpson winds up in the hospital. While preparing to visit him Lt. Frank Drebin Leslie Nielson asks how he's doing. Nielson's boss George Kennedy tells him solemnly The doctors say he has a 5050 chance of living though there's only a ten percent chance of that. In other words there is a ten percent chance that Simpson has a fifty percent chance of living. To put it more simply that's 120 or p  .05. I'd be happy to clarify this further by using base8 math but I don't know how.The doctors tending Simpson tell his wife We think we can save your husband's arm. Where would you like it sent? I don't think I want to go any farther with the plot because it's really insignificant just a frame to hang a lot of jokes on. And I don't want to give any more of the jokes away.Well one more. The voices tell me to do it. Nielson makes a harrowing escape across the facade of a tall building hanging on to decorative human figures as he goes breaking off the penis of one of the male figures before he crashes through a window and into the bedroom of a halfdressed shrieking woman and dizzily brandishes the brokenoff tool. The mayor charges him with searching without a warrant breaking and entering arson and assault with a concrete dildo. You'll have to see the movie to get the rest of them. It's ribald and hilarious.".

Most of the jokes are original though and half loony. Some don't work  a car pulls into a parking space at the docks and knocks a screaming man into the water. Others are so outlandish as to be almost surreal.In the opening scene Detective Nordberg a depressing but still effective O. J. Simpson creeps up gun drawn to a door behind which a dozen hoodlums are negotiating the purchase of a horde of dope. He takes a deep breath and kicks against the door. The door doesn't swing open. Instead Simpson's foot crashes through the panel and he must extract it and fiddle with the knob. By the time he gets the door opens and announces that everyone is under arrest the gang has their own guns loaded cocked and aimed at him. They shoot him six times. Instead of slumping to the deck he caroms around the walls shouting in pain when he bunks his head against some pipes when he puts his hand on a red hot wood stove when he leans against a wall of fresh paint when a window slams down on his hand when he steps into a bear trap and so on.Simpson winds up in the hospital. While preparing to visit him Lt. Frank Drebin Leslie Nielson asks how he's doing. Nielson's boss George Kennedy tells him solemnly The doctors say he has a 5050 chance of living though there's only a ten percent chance of that. In other words there is a ten percent chance that Simpson has a fifty percent chance of living. To put it more simply that's 120 or p  .05. I'd be happy to clarify this further by using base8 math but I don't know how.The doctors tending Simpson tell his wife We think we can save your husband's arm. Where would you like it sent? I don't think I want to go any farther with the plot because it's really insignificant just a frame to hang a lot of jokes on. And I don't want to give any more of the jokes away.Well one more. The voices tell me to do it. Nielson makes a harrowing escape across the facade of a tall building hanging on to decorative human figures as he goes breaking off the penis of one of the male figures before he crashes through a window and into the bedroom of a halfdressed shrieking woman and dizzily brandishes the brokenoff tool. The mayor charges him with searching without a warrant breaking and entering arson and assault with a concrete dildo. You'll have to see the movie to get the rest of them. It's ribald and hilarious.";

It's also a near masterpiece by it's director Ruggero Deodato who never came near the quality of this film again. It's a horror film in the most literal sense. It's not scary in the slightestit doesn't attempt to make you jump. Despite it's scenes of horrendous violenceit's not even a simple 'gross out' a la Braindead. What Deadato attempted with this film is to disturb the viewer provoke a reaction and make him or her THINK. The film has a powerful message about man's cruelty and violenceand Deodato just tackles it totally head on. Thisand the fact that it is so well madelets face itsome of the socalled 'video nasties' seem laughable noware probably why the film has had so much censor trouble. Even if you hate itit sticks with youit's horrifying images staying in the mind for ages.And they are indeed many. People being ripped open and eatenincluding even a penis being partially torn off. A woman having a foetus torn out of her and it buried in mud. Another woman raped with a dildo and than having a mudball with nails on thrust between her legs too. A brief fake documentary showing disturbingly realistic executions. The list goes on. You would be forgiven for thinking that this is just exploitative nastiness. However and this is just one of the many things that separates this film from the many other films of the cannibal subgenrewe are being shown this stuff to get us to thinknot just about mankind's violence to each other and his ignorance of other races but also about violence in the news and oddly enoughthe glut of 'reality'shows on TV today also make the film pertinent. And it also toys with our sympathies in a devilishly clever way. Cannibalism seems horrible to most of us but at the end aren't we almost pleased to see the protagonists eaten by the natives when they have spent the previous half hour mistreating and abusing them?The film is oddly structuredwith the second half being basically the 'film' which the characters in the first half of the film find. The second half has the most powereven if there are shots which couldn't actually have been taken by the filmmakers. Deodato actually shows great skill in many of the gory effects scenes by showing just enough of the effects to be effective but not dwelling on them so the fakery starts to showand the climatic orgy of cannibalism is all the more shocking because much of it is only partially glimpsedmaking more of an impression. Riz Ortolani's often bleakly beautiful score is superb and even the dubbing of the good if not greatactors is not bad.The one thing about the film that is hardest to defend is the animal cruelty unless you see the UK DVDwhich removes it. In one particularly notable scene a large turtle is dragged out of the water and in what seems like real time is disembowelled. It probably is sickening that animals were killed for a filmyet this IS how the natives of many places surviveby killing animals and eating themand is this really any more sickening than the way chickens are couped up in factories stuffed with food and basically bred to die? Answers on a postcard please.Cannibal Holocaust is quite simply essential viewing not just for fans of extreme cinema but for adult fans of cinema full stopas long as of course they can stomach it!".

To call this movie depraved and sick would only give it half the credit it deserves because Cannibal Holocaust' is meant to be sick as it shows how sickening our own society is but in the most morally corrupt way imaginable. Featuring numerous repulsive acts such as a real live turtle flaying a foetus being ripped from a woman's body rape castration and impalement the film sets about to portray the civilised' documentary filmmakers as no better than the primitive cannibals. Even though the actors are barely competent enough to do their job it becomes almost enjoyable in a very sadistic way to watch them suffer at the hands of those they have wronged. However from a moralistic standpoint even watching this movie is wrong. I don't think this is the type of movie you either love or hate on an entertainment basis but you either agree or disagree with how it presents its case. Cannibal Holocaust' is certainly nothing short of an endurance test in viewing as the senses are raped by the foul imagery constantly portrayed within. Filmed on a shoe string budget with virtually no production values evident Cannibal Holocaust' has a disturbing realistic grittiness that is almost unparalleled by any other movie and a huge influence for The Blair Witch Project' almost twenty years later. I feel that because the movie is so badly made and the very fact it was produced is more damning to society than the events portrayed within many people feel that it is nothing more than a senseless bloodbath with no redeeming features and a hypocritical storyline  and to an extent they are probably right! Whether the viewer appreciates or despises this movie is totally dependant on the viewer and it is unfair for anybody else to make judgements on that person based on their opinion of this movie. Cannibal Holocaust' is not about a sharp storyline great acting or superb special effects though the unsimulated effects are generally good. Instead it is about humanity in general. If you believe you can cope with violent and repulsive imagery and scenes of unbelievable cruelty then go ahead and watch it but otherwise it is certainly one to avoid. Some people will probably find the moralising over such repulsive subject matter offensive and I can't say that I blame them. However there is a message there and this movie makes an extremely bold statement. The question is though whether it was right to make the statement in this way? From an artistic standpoint it holds no real value but remains an interesting movie. My rating for Cannibal Holocaust'  610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cannibal Holocaust is not the campy little horror flick I expected. It's a serious and wellmade movie and it's an experience you'll hardly ever forget. According to IMDb's trivia section the movie can only be seen completely uncut in the ECUltraBit DVD which means that I've seen a tamed down version and that my friends is insane! Cannibal Holocaust is easily one of the most graphic movies I've ever come across. The violence is incredibly realistic. It's no wonder that director Ruggero Deodato was taken to court to prove that he hasn't slain real people for his motion picture. I still think the real animal slaughtering in the movie was unnecessary. Screw you for that Deodato! It's hard to tell if there really is a message or if the moral is just an excuse for all the gore. In a strange way the violent scenes somehow speak for themselves and do deliver some kind of message but that's open for discussion.If ever a movie deserved the label disturbing it's Cannibal Holocaust. It's controversial but totally worth watching if you can take some seriously sick images.".

It does have some really well done gruesome scenes but the real censorship came from the cruelty to animals. Let's just say this film doesn't have no animals were harmed during production scrolling the end credits. The animal killings include a pig being shot in the head from close range a muskrat being slit open for no reason a giant turtle being split open in an overly long scene and a monkey getting his brains bashed in which required two takes so two monkeys were killed during production. These were real killings and not faked. A lot of the actors on the set protested this but the show went on. In fact one of the lead actors feared for his life thinking this might be a snuff film and might meet the same fate. As much as this bothered people is it really that different then buying meat in a supermarket? At least it made me think. The movie centers around found footage of a group of documentary filmmakers. The filmmakers are in South America searching for a tribe of flesheaters hoping that this documentary will win them fame and fortune. The movie was marketed in a way that made viewers believe all the documentary footage shown in the movie was actual footage of a group that really went to South America to do a documentary. Some questionable acting gives it away. And you thought The Blair Witch Project was an original idea didn't you!?".

	schema:headline " A brutal cinematic masterpiece that you will not want to watch again but will still feel that urge to watch it again";
	schema:reviewBody "Cannibal Holocaust is very deserving of it's controversy but it is definitely not tacky and for pure shock value something I half expected I discovered this movie while reading about the August Underground movies and was way more intrigued by a controversial movie with meaning and plot. It's in your face it at least seems real and is real in some parts. Never have I ever seen such convincing special effects in a movie and this was a lowbudget 70s movie CGI will never recreate it. But beyond the special effects there is a message and meaning and very engaging story.I'll break down the review into sections.Plotstory 910 Think of The Blair Witch Project except not trying to put itself off as real. A group of 4 documenters go into the amazon jungle to film the savages and cannibals that live there. They do not return and it is up to an anthropologist to find them or at least what was left of them. Throughout the movie we learn of the documentary crew's tendency to push and bribe people into committing extreme acts of violence through actual footage from people being killed by soldiers in Nigeria. The movie portrays it as if it was a documentary shot by the crew in which they payed the soldiers off to kill innocent people execution style. As the story progresses the viewer is forced to try and comprehend who exactly are the real savages. Not to mention the social overtones of how modern society ties into all of this. It loses a point though because the dialog sometimes is very iffy even though you can tell they were trying to be realistic but this hinders the actors especially with their lack of experience.Acting 710 This is where the movie suffers. It gets better as the movie progresses and things get more intense this may be do to the actual moralities of the actors and how they felt about the movie showing through in their characters. But when it starts out I'm almost reminded of campy bmovies. The cinematic presentation and pure intrigue is what kept me going. Again though the script writing obviously provided some challenges for the actors.Cinematography 1010 Speaking of cinematic presentation this movie does it beautifully even from the opening shot from a helicopter flying over the rainforest. The studio and moviestyle aspects of the film are very convincing and very welldone. Hollywood couldn't do better with a 10 million dollar budget. The creativity and use of closeups really pulls you in and you begin to question the reality of even the part of the movie that is presented as fictional. And that doesn't even cover the great mockumentary work. The director's understanding of how documentaries are made and how they work is extremely convincing. the use of normal scenes of the crew kind of doddling around really help to present a feeling of reality. And the aspects of limited film and the amateurishspontaneous filming style are almost convincing enough to make the viewer think they used real footage to build a fictional movie around.Audio 1010 Again I'm reminded of Apocalypse Now. The music is melodic and somewhat peaceful adding a real eerie tone to the serious and macabre theme of the movie. It is very 70s though and I would not expect to here the same soundtrack in a new movie although some of the musical flavors are indeed timeless. And there are some more intense scores in the film but they are not overintense like most Hollywood today. Then we get into sound design which is very convincing the tearing and the screaming all sound real or as I would expect them to sound. The new mixing with stereo is well and really helps immerse the viewer.On the animal violence This is something that I thought would disturb me. The animal scenes in Amorres Perros disturbed me even though they were not real but this was real and I wasn't that perturbed by them. People have said that the killing of the animals is useless and doesn't help the plot of the movie but I feel otherwise. It brings into light that you do have to kill to survive. The documenters kill 6 animals one is a spider which some may not count I do on screen and 1 is killed off screen. And it obviously irks the actors a little bit note when you see vomit it is indeed real. But the animals are eaten. And all of this adds to the reality of the documentary. It would have been hard fake some most of that. Plus think of the meat industry today. Hundreds of thousands of cows and pigs slaughtered and millions of chickens and turkeys slaughtered every day in gruesome ways just so we can eat them. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Our society frowns upon killing animals but that burger doesn't magically appear. Blood had to be spilled for our dining pleasure.".

But after watching it in completion I was bowled over ..I wasn't expecting to be challenged by its visuals as well as with the sociological lessons and questions it raised.The film is real genuine and honest to the subject topic 'Barbarity' can be innate in all humans.It can be argued that humans coming into the homosapiens stage of evolution survived and expanded because of what is now considered barbarous savage ways. Savagery was a survival tool. We came from barbarity...and to an extent we still are savages.Though the acting is poor in most places ...the film director portrays cannabilism and barbarism ...and portrays it rather intelligently.Obvious connotations can be made to Blair Witch Project. I'm sure the crew that made BWP was inspired by this movie.The film follows a Professor investigating the disappearance of an American film team 3 guys and girl that went into the jungle of South America to film a documentary about the native cannibals.The Professor with a couple of jungle assistants venture into the jungle to trace the lost Americans footsteps. He manages to get on the trail and slowly uncovers the grizzly ways of the jungle tribes! By carefully befriending these natives he captures the lost film reels and returns back to his skyscraper clad conurbation.In amongst the film there is the media business cogs turning. The dilemma of TV executives battling with the Professor to air the once lost footage on TV for the viewing public. The professor is reluctant.The professor seems the only person possessed with moral understanding and compassion throughout the film ..everyone else it seems is after ratings fame money or blood.The film commences its ending by playing back the raw footage of what the expedition team filmed...and it is shocking. Questions arise Who is committing the real 'evil' savagery here?As for the animal cruelty scenes Yes they are real and shocking. But should it be anymore shocking than the beef burger that is served up in McDonalds. Cows are slaughtered everyday. Perhaps one needs to watch a bovine neck getting slit before they take it for granted they are eating a nice juicy steak on their plate. The film portrays the reality of human meat consumption...and yes all kinds of animals are killed for the human appetite especially in the wild  someone will do it! For those who dispute this film on these grounds 'Can you handle life?' This stuff still goes on regardless of whether u see it happen or not.This film is absolutely brilliant. A cult classic. I can see it making a revival...but don't know when...perhaps in some years time.".

	schema:reviewBody "What haven't I heard about Cannibal Holocaust? Only that it's one of the most disturbing movies of all time and still to this day manages to shock it's audience. Honestly I'm surprised that it took me this long to watch it but I found the film on Google because I was cautious on paying 20 dollars for a film I never saw. Cannibal Holocaust thankfully is much more than just shocking but actually has a great message to it. The film isn't as shocking as I'm sure it was when it was released but it is a jaw dropper. Mainly due though to the real killings of the animals which is a bit too much to handle. At the time the director was also accused of murdering the three lead actors talk about motivation however he made the actors break the contract of silence since he wanted the audience to think that this was a real film in order to prove his innocence. Before the Blair Witch Project there was no film like Cannibal Holocaust I don't think a film has even touched it's ground since then.There is a television documentary about a missing United States film crew who disappeared on an expedition to the Amazon to make a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team was Alan the director Faye script girl and two cameramen Jack and Mark. Harold Monroe an anthropologist has agreed to lead a rescue team and flies to the Amazon to meet his guides. There the team meets hostility and learn that the film group had caused great unrest among the people. The Yanomam invite Monroe and his team to their village where they are treated with suspicion. A group of Yanomam women take him to a shrine which he learns holds the bones of the missing American filmmakers. Monroe confronts the Yanomam about this. After playing a tape recorder for them he trades it for the first team's surviving reels of film. Back in New York executives invite Monroe to host a broadcast of a documentary to be made from the recovered film. Monroe wants to see the raw footage first finding out who might be the real savages after all.Did the animal killings bother me? The turtle scene definitely did I understand that the meat was used for meals but it was a bit too much for me to handle the brutality of the killing. I won't go into details just if you're an animal lover like I am then fast forward through that part too. However what I did appreciate about the film was how realistic it did look the director did a great job of finding locations actors and the over all feel of the film as you feel dirty and embarrassed watching such horror on the screen. While I may not agree with the animal killings this message of who are the real savages really got to me. I loved that this wasn't about just grossing people out but showing how crazy people can get over money and power. It's really sad and it's weird to think that the documentary crew that went into the project that you thought were originally the victims of such violent tribes were actually the one's who are wild animals and in some sick way deserved the justice that was served to them. While it's a hard movie to watch I would say that it was worth it again not for the faint of heart but a true classic and I'm sure will still shock for many generations to come.810".

I would be lying if I said that the violence in the movie is insignificant to it's underlying message because it's not. There are real animal killings which are pretty brutal to watch but on the lighter side the animals killed were eaten by cast and crew after filming so they did not die for the viewer's entertainment or whatever.Cannibal Holocaust can be called ahead of it's time due to the fact that makes you question watching reality as entertainment and where to draw the line. Also themes of consumerism the media and what it means to be civilized are present within the killingsflesh eatingrapesexual assaulttortureand other such extreme things filmed. I would compare this to Clockwork Orange in the means that there is a message in the madness.And it was quite obvious where the Blair Witch creators got their inspiration from this movie.".

Atrocity is the name of Deodato's gameand the genius of this monsterpiece is that Deodato horrifyingly delivers the goods at the same time he coruscates his audience and himself.This is a hard movie to recommend to any but those who would find it anyway but it must be said that Deodato here created the most rigorous critical almost philosophical movie in the Italian horror canon. The audience's lust for Third World exoticism and envelopepushing violence are gratified and held up to the painful light of dayand not necessarily in that order. The overwhelming feeling of this picture is of a pornographer pleading Stop me before I shoot again.The conceit of the moviean academic's journey into the Amazon to find the remains of a Western film crew devoured by cannibalspermits Deodato more Pirandellian boxes within boxes than a double bill of BLOWUP and THE PLAYER.

	schema:reviewBody "What you have in Cannibal Holocaust is a story about a group of people from NYU that go to document a culture of cannibals and never come back. Not that the story matters. Having watched I think three cannibal movies now this is three more than the average healthy adult's lifetime recommended dosage it has become clear to me that they are nothing more than exhibitions of movie violence and sickness. And in that area the movie succeeds brilliantly. It is so tasteless and so disgusting that it's amazing that things like this ever get made.And not just for the animal mutilations or the feces flinging yeah that really happens in this movie. It's not just a tshirt for smartass teenagers or the orgies of misogynistic violence but of course there are tons of naked natives in the movie many of them obviously underage. But I guess that is just not a concern in whatever country the movie was distributed from. I am guessing we are meant to be impressed by the feeding scenes since logic would lead you to believe that that is what a cannibal film centers on. If so maybe that explains why all the natives must smear their food all over their faces before they eat it although I am at a loss to explain why women are regularly mutilated dismembered fornicated with and THEN eaten. It becomes clear early on that surely someone in the group of NYU people must snap unable to take what they're seeing anymore and of course it does happen.One guy since the natives 'distrust' them maybe it was all that shooting? decides to strip naked to become like them. Evidently this man has never seen the whiteness of his naked self before but the island girls don't seem to mind. As soon as this awkward white guy strips off his khakis a whole group of naked girls run up to him and start grabassing for a little while. Hey maybe cannibals aren't so bad after allOh but minutes later the group are forced to eat human as is to be expected. The natives gleefully shove entrails in their faces as they inexplicably turn into savages for the purpose of this bizarre plot. Why the instant and total descent into barbarism? I have no idea the movie isn't intelligent enough to explain such a thing all it knows how to do is show you something that you would be much better off never seeing.A giant turtle is torn apart alive with bare hands while the cameraman zooms in for an extreme closeup so as not to miss a single revolting detail a monkey gets its face cut off a backwoods amputation is cauterized with a hot machete and when the poor amputee immediately dies the rest of the crew forget seconds later laughing and joking in the subsequent footage. This is of course all documentary footage that they're watching of a past film crew. It seems that these mental giants went into the village and started screaming and shooting their guns and burning the village and then wondered why they were massacred. It is not exactly a massive intellectual surge when one of the new crew says these people probably think WE'RE the savages!Yeah what tipped you off? The burning of their village or the fornicating in the ashes? Clearly this is meant to be the movie's thinly disguised message. White people are savages at least as much as the people that we think of as savages. Oh and in case you didn't happen to catch that message when it smacked you in the head numerous times like a ton of bricks at one point the civilized people grab one of the native girls and rape her trying to show her the errors of her ways. Clever.These people are nothing like any manner of civilized people they are absolute degenerates and should be imprisoned. They even shout for joy when they find a woman impaled on a pole. What the hell is this garbage?But in watching a movie like this it seems to me that it is the people that would make and distribute something like this that are the savages. At least horror movies are FUN even bad ones. And this is not a bad horror movie. It's not a horror movie at all I don't know what you would call it but it is truly horrible. A mother gives birth to an infant in the movie for example. The baby is taken away from it's mother drenched in blood and then buried in the mud while the mother is beaten to death with rocks. There is a point in the movie where the utterly talentless writer evidently unaware of how breathtakingly obvious his story is has one of his characters spoonfeed you the real meaning of the movieToday people want sensationalism. The more you rape their senses the happier they are.This sentence betrays a staggering lack of understanding of filmgoing audiences but at least it is a flawless description of the thought behind the movie. Too bad you have to watch it to learn that you should never have watched it".

	schema:reviewBody "Cannibal holocaust. A group of 4 filmmakers and their guide take a trip to the rain forest a.k.a. the green inferno to shoot a documentary about the native cannibal tribes. After a short period of shooting they discover that the footage they have shot so far is not spectacular enough so they decide to stage the whole thing. Their misbehavior is put at an end when they come across one of the real cannibal tribes of the region. When the home front discovers that the crew shows no sign of life they decide to send out a rescue mission. These people an anthropologist and his guides retrieve the original footage that the missing crew has shot and they bring it back to the US...I decided to wait for the uncut European version of the film because i am not a fan of censorship each individual should be able to decide for himself what he wants or doesn't want to see but this can ONLY be the case with FICTION. This film however contains actual footage of animal killings a snake is beheaded a spider is squashed a monkey is scalped a turtle is beheaded and afterwards eaten a pig is shot in the head...and this is not the essence of a horror film. Horror movies are supposed to be fictional stories with great special effects and effective story lines that entertain or scare you with their originality. Movies like this one give the horror scene a bad name and why...? This film is famous for it's great special effects the special effects in this movie are so bad that every scene that contains one of these so called effects is shot out of focus the filmmakers get away with it because they can use the excuse that it has been shot using small portable cameras. The only times the gore is convincing is when they use actual guts from real animals and make it look like it came from a human body. The story line of the movie is completely unbelievable with footage of rape and torture that are just thrown in without adding any originality whatsoever the mere reason they put this in is to shock the viewer even more they didn't succeed the makeup effects are weak just some guys painted white and wearing wigs made out of straw and the acting is probably the worst acting in the entire history of cinema. The only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it contains some great images of the untouched fauna and flora of the rain forest. This is however not the reason why i have bought this film. It is said that Deodato regrets that he has made this film and he should be it is a total waste of time and money.".

Their misbehavior is put at an end when they come across one of the real cannibal tribes of the region. When the home front discovers that the crew shows no sign of life they decide to send out a rescue mission. These people an anthropologist and his guides retrieve the original footage that the missing crew has shot and they bring it back to the US...I decided to wait for the uncut European version of the film because i am not a fan of censorship each individual should be able to decide for himself what he wants or doesn't want to see but this can ONLY be the case with FICTION. This film however contains actual footage of animal killings a snake is beheaded a spider is squashed a monkey is scalped a turtle is beheaded and afterwards eaten a pig is shot in the head...and this is not the essence of a horror film. Horror movies are supposed to be fictional stories with great special effects and effective story lines that entertain or scare you with their originality. Movies like this one give the horror scene a bad name and why...? This film is famous for it's great special effects the special effects in this movie are so bad that every scene that contains one of these so called effects is shot out of focus the filmmakers get away with it because they can use the excuse that it has been shot using small portable cameras. The only times the gore is convincing is when they use actual guts from real animals and make it look like it came from a human body. The story line of the movie is completely unbelievable with footage of rape and torture that are just thrown in without adding any originality whatsoever the mere reason they put this in is to shock the viewer even more they didn't succeed the makeup effects are weak just some guys painted white and wearing wigs made out of straw and the acting is probably the worst acting in the entire history of cinema. The only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it contains some great images of the untouched fauna and flora of the rain forest. This is however not the reason why i have bought this film. It is said that Deodato regrets that he has made this film and he should be it is a total waste of time and money.";

And we going to see why...For much this film is one of the best ever made ??? for me and for much others this is just a exploitation film that go to the extreme. Disguised as a social film if you see the real intentions of Ruggero Deodato it was only to make a Cannibal film but not as a social commentary if only as a horror film. I can say that this film is not even bad. Of course that its wonderful that movies treat social topics about different cultures about media abuse and domination For that you can see Shock Treatment or Network Cannibal Holocaust seems to bring that message but really don't. Its only another gore film that don't have any intent more than give repulsive moments the film don't have any intelligent horror. This film don't going to scare you it goes to make revolve your stomach.Cannibal Holocaust for me is trash is not cinema and is not art. Not even a regular soundtrack by Riz Ortolani can save it. And much time i get surprised seeing all the people who defends a movie like this. Of course is likes and i respect them. And believe me i always try to don't say bad commentaries of films so quickly but i don't see any reason to save it.At all if you want to see an horrible film totally inhuman with real animals which suffer until death It is worth to clarify that all the polemic of real human deaths was just rumors and is not truth this is the film for you. If you want real art a real social commentary a real horror film or just a good film... don't even think about it... don't watch it.Soldier warned don't die at war.Sorry for the mistakes...well if there any.".

	schema:headline " Trite badly mad movie infatuated with it's own pompous sense of selfrighteousness";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a bad movie. DO NOT believe anyone who claims any of the followingThe gore effects are so realistic! This movie has a powerful message! The music in this movie is so haunting it's amazing! The acting is so excellent!This movie falls apart under the weight of its own pompousness. Filled with an annoyingly high sense of selfimportance and selfrighteousness the entire movie plays out like some twisted morality play that takes itself far too seriously. The acting is pretty terrible from start to finish particularly the doomed film crew. Yes I know that Italian films are filmed without sound and dubbed in post. It doesn't matter. I've seen many Italian films using that method that featured excellent performances. There is not one performance in this movie that comes anywhere near acceptable much less decent. The performances are so bad that I couldn't even be compelled to dislike the film crew. I just didn't care. The music is annoying Phil Glasstype garbage and it sounds like two pieces were written and Deodato alternates between the two. Anyway the same music is featured over and over again with no variation another element inspiring apathy. It's one thing to have a theme that plays throughout a film's score but to use the same piece of music ad nauseum is another completely. The music becomes gratingly annoying by the end of the film and when the movie ends the end of that awful music is just one reason you are glad the movie is over.Apparently I'm the only person to ever see this movie and think the gore effects are incredibly unconvincing. The gore effects fooled me never for a second nor did they even inspire me to suspend disbelief or become squeamish like the eyesquishing from Kill Bill 2.

The music in this movie is so haunting it's amazing! The acting is so excellent!This movie falls apart under the weight of its own pompousness. Filled with an annoyingly high sense of selfimportance and selfrighteousness the entire movie plays out like some twisted morality play that takes itself far too seriously. The acting is pretty terrible from start to finish particularly the doomed film crew. Yes I know that Italian films are filmed without sound and dubbed in post. It doesn't matter. I've seen many Italian films using that method that featured excellent performances. There is not one performance in this movie that comes anywhere near acceptable much less decent. The performances are so bad that I couldn't even be compelled to dislike the film crew. I just didn't care. The music is annoying Phil Glasstype garbage and it sounds like two pieces were written and Deodato alternates between the two. Anyway the same music is featured over and over again with no variation another element inspiring apathy. It's one thing to have a theme that plays throughout a film's score but to use the same piece of music ad nauseum is another completely. The music becomes gratingly annoying by the end of the film and when the movie ends the end of that awful music is just one reason you are glad the movie is over.Apparently I'm the only person to ever see this movie and think the gore effects are incredibly unconvincing. The gore effects fooled me never for a second nor did they even inspire me to suspend disbelief or become squeamish like the eyesquishing from Kill Bill 2. As for the animal slaughterings I'm no member of PETA but these are completely unnecessary.

The animals died. All for a movie. And that's shocking for all the wrong reasons.So I was forced to give it a 1 and if it was possible a 0. People have made the argument that the pain and suffering incurred by the animals were warranted because of the pain and suffering that goes on in the wild everyday amongst the predators and their prey. This is a bad analogy. Predators kill and eat their prey because they have to. They need to kill and eat to live. The filmmakers tortured and killed these animals to make a 70's horror movie. See a difference? The fact that the tribe ate the animals afterward is inconsequential  it wasn't necessary.

However when Lt Commander Block comes to him with an offer of a second chance to take part in secret mission Sleepy Weasel Topper takes it up and signs up for training and briefing with the other pilots. However with a difficult love interest and his old fears resurfacing can Topper hold it together? Can the mission succeed? Can Admiral Benson get it together? Only time will tell.The spoof genre is one that appears easy to do but things like Scary Movie Spaceballs and others all show that it is not as easy as it appears  it is not enough to simply ape films unless it is done cleverly and funnily as well. Hot Shots succeeds in this area by managing to make such fun out of serious films that it is hard not to laugh  in fact I watched Top Gun recently and found it impossible not to laugh as I remembered Hot Shots! Of course it is not just the fact that it spoofs movies but also that the dialogue is really really funny  totally off the wall and takes you by surprise at times. A fine example of this is the dialogue given to Admiral Benson such as 'they ran out of material before they got to the knee so don't give me any sht'! This continues throughout the film and it rarely misses. Just like Top Gun the romance aspect isn't as funny as the other bits but even then it is still good. Some individual lines aren't as sharp as others but generally the film has enough great dialogue and funny movie spoofs including quite a few Tom Cruise movies to be consistently funny even after repeat viewings.The cast is often important in this type of thing and those who have suffered the Wayans brothers mugging in their 'spoofs' will know exactly what I mean  people like Leslie Nielsen make it look easy but it really isn't. And that is why the cast here should be largely praised for their straight delivery that serves to make the material even better. Although not the star of the film every scene he is in is stolen by Lloyd Bridges  so great in Airplane he gets the best lines here and his character is hilarious. He is supported well by Sheen who proves really able in sending himself up and he has done well in other spoofs since then. The rest of the cast is made up of very familiar faces who all seem in tune with the material provided  Elwes is fun Cryer and O'Leary embrace their onenote characters. Golino is a bit dry in her delivery and doesn't help her already weak part in the film. Minor roles for Swanson Stiles Dunn and others are also good value for differing reasons and there are a few good cameos in there as well.Overall as with all these things you need to be in the mood but the strength of the material and the high hit ratio makes it easy to enjoy this film. Much more fun that Top Gun and consistently funny with regular laughoutloud moments this is a great spoof that is only just short of the greats like Airplane and Naked Gun.".

It's relaxing and a good laugh always makes you forget about everything else.Now that was besides the point. Getting back to Hot Shots I can say only one thing  excellent.

Maybe it's a little unfair to remember Charlie Sheen only for this role he's a very good actor but he was so...funny in it that I can't help it. The movie itself is very well glued together the scenes are dubbed with the perfect soundtrack to make you laugh 'till you fall off your chair and the comedy techniques are as somebody said before me classic  no fartburp jokes or toilet humor.Overall I'd watch it anytime.".

Of course it isn't as funny as I remember but that's the thing with these spoofs  with the large number of gags on screen there should be something to make you laugh. And sure enough Hot Shots! does have several moments to make it worth your while. But due to its pedigree with classics like Airplane! and The Naked Gun it does suffer by comparison. Luckily it isn't as bad as recent spoofs like Meet The Spartans so the chances are you'll enjoy this.Before finding the benefits of a webcam and Tiger Blood Charlie Sheen used to be an actor. Here he is as Topper Harley the US Air Force's best pilot recruited back into the fold by Lt. Commander Block Kevin Dunn to assist in a top secret mission to destroy a nuclear weapons facility. But Topper has baggage  his father was an equally talented loose cannon responsible for the death of one of his colleagues which is something Topper feels he is bound to repeat. But feuding with fellow pilot Lt. Gregory Cary Elwes Topper begins to fall for his therapist Ramada Thompson Valeria Golino. But will his feelings wreck the mission or is it the underhand attempts at sabotage that may cost the lives of the team? Like most spoofs there is a machinegun regularity to the gags whether there are spoken or visual. Sadly not all of them hit the mark. There isn't a sense that you can't take your eyes and ears off the screen like you get with Airplane! where a momentary lapse in concentration means you miss some hilarity. Another issue I have is that the funniest actor on screen by some margin is Lloyd Bridges as the insane Admiral Benson. Giving the late Leslie Nielsen a run for his money is no easy feat but Bridges perfectly captures the straightfaced lunacy that the spoof genre requires. Sheen Elwes and Golino simply can't match him but this movie still has enough to carry it through.Maybe it's because I'm older now but Hot Shots! isn't as good as I remember. The jokes aren't as funny and the visual gags seem a little unimaginative but there are still some moments to enjoy. I also like the fact that it tries to spoof Top Gun which if we're honest about it kinda ran like a parody anywhere. Despite its age Hot Shots! remains a comedy that most fans of spoofs will enjoy. It's no classic but considering how most spoofs these days are about as funny as a fifty mile hike it remains a strangely amusing spoof of almost any military action flick you could mention. And if you're too young to have watched this the first time around then maybe it will do you some good to see Sheen before he became a rock god from Mars with Adonis DNA. This film is winning but isn't it an open goal anyway?".

I'll still be buying Part Deux if i see it in the shops though it's probably worth it.So the bottom line is Don't Shop For It Argos it! no wait that's not right.....hold on i'll get it......AH!

Such great and humble Men and Women from Bill Billy Doc Richard Lloyd Charlie John Christie and Valeria et al. In fact Billy had me shoot a spoof of Bill's nonexistent Ego where the cast all played along in the video. Went to Lloyd Bridges home and shot a very dramatic clip of Lloyd talking about Bill and his devotion to family meaning also his Film Family. Charlie joked in his clip that Bill was so uptight and difficult to work with and that Bill who is bald had hair at the start of the picture! All great people! And I got to flirt with Valeria while we were eating a couple of times since I spoke a little Italian  Phil Bautista Austin TX".

In fact Billy had me shoot a spoof of Bill's nonexistent Ego where the cast all played along in the video. Went to Lloyd Bridges home and shot a very dramatic clip of Lloyd talking about Bill and his devotion to family meaning also his Film Family. Charlie joked in his clip that Bill was so uptight and difficult to work with and that Bill who is bald had hair at the start of the picture! All great people! And I got to flirt with Valeria while we were eating a couple of times since I spoke a little Italian  Phil Bautista Austin TX";

	schema:reviewBody "Takva  A Man's Fear of God is one of those films that playfully enact conflicts of fundamental importance for the world we live in. Takva starts off with humble Muharrem an introverted single man living in Istanbul being drawn into the inner circle of a Muslim brotherhood he has adhered to ever since his childhood days. When the erudite and strikingly pragmatic leader Sheikh Cemal appoints him as his financial organizer Muharrem gets endowed with all the amenities and trappings of a modern world businessman. He has to collect rent and administer the order's finances. His naive will to live a life according to what he thinks is the will of God clashes not only with his unfulfilled sexual desires but also with the mechanisms of power within the order. The brothers' lifestyle may be conservative but they run an organization that is fully intertwined with the present day social political and economic life of Turkey. For Muharrem who hardly understands any of this business this means that every step he intends to make for the greater glory of God draws him ever deeper into the quagmire of corruption lies and hypocrisy. The authority he is endowed with now makes him haughty and difficult to deal with while his accumulated frustration increasingly throws him into literal fits. Everything escalates when he comes face to face with the woman he desires... The plot for this great film is based on an old folk tale from Turkey about a man who refuses to marry the daughter of his spiritual master although he clearly loves her. In Onder Cakar and Omer Kiziltan's adaptation the narrative serves to expose the inner mechanisms of puritan Muslim orders and throw light on the mental setup of its loyal members. The film is pure fun to watch due to countless instances of great irony a remarkable love for detail and breathtaking scenes of ecstatic rituals. While the filmmakers were very careful not to ridicule the milieu they're depicting their critical approach accounts for a film that substantially helps understand the way political Islam works.".

	schema:headline " Can there be true righteousness in the absence of temptation...";
	schema:reviewBody "... seems to be the question at the heart of this Turkish film about a simple man living a simple life until his world is turned upside down when he is suddenly exposed to the modern world in the service of his religion. Muharrem is at the center of this character study. He is a very nondescript looking man of about 40 who has been in the service of sack dealer Ali Bey and his family since childhood. He is called an apprentice but he acts basically as a stock boy and runner of errands. He has been stuck at this point since he was a child with no hope of being more than he is and he seems fine with that. He lives a simple life in simple quarters and rigidly adheres to his religious sect's rules without question.What changes everything is when the leader of his religious sect selects Muhareem to be the organizer of finances for the group. With absolutely no training in this area and no prior exposure to the modern world and culture he is thrust into a position of authority wandering about town collecting the sect's rents. When he is handed a cell phone to call Rauf  his superior and adviser  in case he has questions during his rounds he looks as though he has been handed a piece of biomedical equipment that he must somehow assemble.Muhareem finds himself morally challenged and psychologically troubled when he is exposed for the first time to power money and sex. The power comes in the form of regard that he's never had before from people who have previously treated him as though he was invisible. His new sexual temptations come in the form of things as simple as having to walk past a long line of female mannequins dressed in lingerie on his way to collect some rent moneys. Muhareem has never seen such sights before and soon he is having disturbing dreams. Also he begins to see an equally troubling change in his own personality that seems to be required for him to do his new job correctly but goes against the grain of all he has ever believed to be righteous.This film is set in Turkey and the sect in question is the Sufi branch of Islam but it could easily be set anywhere in the world and involve any religion  the themes are universal. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like all great works of art Takva is a simple story a man corrupted in an incorruptible world of a religious order of Sufi ecstatics. And like all great works of art the story is at once utterly banal and profound beyond measure. A humble selfeffacing Muharrem a devoted member of an Istanbul dargah is brought into a seemingly irresolvable inner conflict by the humility of his spiritual leader Cemal who acts on a dream that came to him from God and appoints Muharrem the order's property administrator. The man's simple world and relationship with God is destroyed by an incomprehensible chasm that develops between his understanding of his faith and the leaders' whom he deeply respects and depends on. The story told by lesser masters than Cakar and Kiziltan would probably end up a silly remake of a Fortyyear old Virgin in Istanbul. But in their hands Takva God's omnipresence in the lives of the protagonists is not just a believable story but a masterful narration of a selfassured purpose told at once with a great deal of human care for and at the same time with a stoic detachment from the predicament of a simple man's soul. The end effect is a brilliantly balanced irony. On the level of the plot  there is the unconditional respect for God's will in the two order's leaders which forces them to appoint and keep Muharrem against their better judgment observing his fear of God is that of an eunuch and there is the unconditional respect for God's will by Muharrem based on his straightforward demand for purity and compassion. On the micro level the writing has dashes of clever insight into human interiors a sigh from master Ali Muharrem's employer now I am the idiot's secretary  and the order's counsel Rauf's revelation in take this watch brother it keeps time precisely it is made by the heathen. The ecstatic chants and movements of the dervishes' dhikr as a background make the movie an extraordinary experience.".

The answer is related with the stages of knowledge or purity that one has to qualify to become a Perfect Human Being or insani kamil in Turkish. This concept or ideology is rooted with Islamic tradition. Many Sufi or Mevlevi order has this process for their dervishes which may take a lifetime to achieve this goal or even never be able to reach that level of perfection.Different than being nun or monk which requires leaving mainstream society and living in the monastery with prayers last step of this difficult and lengthy process of purifying one's soul from earthly desires is to be able to return to the real world after so many years lived in contemplation and yet not being disturbed with its appeal to commit sin. I believe in the last few minutes head of the order explains this a little bit. And apparently Muharrem failed to accomplish last stage before achieving perfection.".

Rather I would like to claim that it gives just an impression of the life Turkish religious orders society and the mind of a devout religious man who previously led a uncritical life without real challenges and without deep thoughts about practical life and religion. Therefor he's unprepared for both of it.I would guess that one could find his state of mind also with a range of uncritical believers of many religions who although ardently believe stay shallow in their intellectual penetration of their believe and worldly life. They stay rather caught in conservative dogmas which where made to control man and are far away from a healthy human experience.Not everything shown in Film should be taken at face value. The depiction of the ritual life gives an impression of the ecstatic quality of such gatherings but is exaggerated in their frenetic appearance. There may have been reasons for this depiction but one should rather try not to confuse it with the an authentic account this account one should rather get in contact with real orders.The protagonist has high values which he fails to satisfy. This puts him in a moral dilemma which is very instructively set in contrast on one hand to worldly every day people and merchants with their cheating and accommodation with an imperfect world. On the other there is a religious order which although is directed towards spirituality is of course also involved in worldly enterprises and has of course it financial interests. Nothing gets euphemised but the problems of both  profane and spiritual  get expounded in a way that a psychological profile of shallow but devote believer meets social criticism not only hitting the Turkish Islamic milieu of its setting but also similar ones in other regions and religions.".

It is the Islamic concept of Godconsciousness.Someone having taqwa has the constant awareness of God's omnipresence in his life and he is supposed to be in total submission to God.The movie tells the story of Muharrema simple mindedunobtrusive middleaged man who lives alone.While he runs the errands in the place he works he spends most of his time in the local dargaha Sufi shrine built over the grave of a revered religious figureby engaging himself with total abstinence and dhikra form of devotionin which the worshiper is absorbed in the rhythmic repetition of the name of God or his attributesMuharrem's uneventful life starts to take a bit different course when he is given to dutyby the leader dervish of the religious brotherhoodto take care of the financial matters like collecting the monthly rents for the religious order. Muharrem is obliged in the very matter he refrains from. He finds himself obliged to engage in worldly matters.The more he gets himself into this the more he vacillates because he notices that the religious order rented a shop to the men who take alcohol and in another example he oscillates to take the rent from a family who has barely any money. The more he gets himself in money matters the more dreams he has about sex alcohol and money.

When he follows her he notices that she is the very daughter of the dargah leader. At the end of the movie we see him pretty numb in his bed. Taqwa sheds a light on the innerworkings of political Islam. Religious brotherhoods surely provide unity among Muslims but most of these brotherhoods seek after only their interests. This is more like a business industry. They own shops flats private schools courses. They do shopping at the places they own they buy their own products they commercialize their own system. The rest is actually the romance. Not so many of them really seek after total obedience to God or something. They just believe they do. That does not make them so harmful or something but this does not make them so different from their nonreligious counterparts eitherlike atheistic uberleftistmason counterparts.".

It is the Islamic concept of Godconsciousness.Someone having taqwa has the constant awareness of God's omnipresence in his life and he is supposed to be in total submission to God.The movie tells the story of Muharrema simple mindedunobtrusive middleaged man who lives alone.While he runs the errands in the place he works he spends most of his time in the local dargaha Sufi shrine built over the grave of a revered religious figureby engaging himself with total abstinence and dhikra form of devotionin which the worshiper is absorbed in the rhythmic repetition of the name of God or his attributesMuharrem's uneventful life starts to take a bit different course when he is given to dutyby the leader dervish of the religious brotherhoodto take care of the financial matters like collecting the monthly rents for the religious order. Muharrem is obliged in the very matter he refrains from. He finds himself obliged to engage in worldly matters.The more he gets himself into this the more he vacillates because he notices that the religious order rented a shop to the men who take alcohol and in another example he oscillates to take the rent from a family who has barely any money. The more he gets himself in money matters the more dreams he has about sex alcohol and money. He wetdreams of sleeping with the same woman every time.A day when he really feels suffocated he takes to the streets and he sees the same woman in a jewelery store.

When Dante and Randal of Clerks fame get a restraining order to keep the punchy Jay and his hetero lifemate Silent Bob from selling drugs in front of the Quick Stop convenience store their lives are suddenly empty. They find new purpose when their friend Brodie informs them a movie is being made featuring two infamous characters based on their likenesses. After visiting one of the creators of the Bluntman and Chronic Holden McNeil they set out to get what fat movie cash they deserve and hopefully put an end to people slandering them on the Internet. Along the way they learn the rules of the road from a hitchhiking George Carlin ride with a group of gorgeous jewel thieves and incur the wrath of a hapless wildlife marshal for liberating an orangutan named Suzanne. The quest takes them from New Jersey to Hollywood where a showdown involving the police the jewel thieves and the Bluntman and Chronic ...";

A fitting conclusion to his New Jersey Trilogy that now consists of five films instead of the originally planned three forgoes the serious religious overtones of Dogma and the Sexuality issues brought forth in Chasing Amy to go for pure Laughs...............and it succeeds.The film's main plot revolves around the familiar duo of Jay Jason Mewes and his Heterosexual Life mate Silent Bob and their attempts to thwart a movie based on a comic book about Jay and Bob.  It's essentially a road picture as the guys make their way from Leonardo New Jersey to Hollywood. Along the way they meet international Jewel Thieves Steal a Monkey  Meet The Scooby Doo gang  Try and Beat up Ben Affleck and Matt Damon and much more.As Silly as all this sounds it's done in such a way that's smart witty and still has a touch of class about it.  And that's pretty hard to do considering I can't even tell you some of the content of the movie without being censored heavily.If you are at all familiar with Smith's movies Clerks Mallrats Chasing Amy and Dogma you will get a kick out of the countless cameos and connections to his other films.  For Example Jason Lee reprises two roles one from Mallrats and one from Chasing Amy as does Ben Affleck.  Matt Damon appears as himself playing Will Hunting in a fictitious sequel to Good Will Hunting entitled Good Will Hunting II Hunting Season. There are two highlights of this movie that I need to talk about.  First Being Jason Mewes as Jay.  This guy is for real by far and away he has put in the best performance of all his five film appearances  as Jay  He carries the picture and is side splittingly funny.  It is my hope that he can now get other roles in movies besides the loveable Dope smoking Jay. Secondly I want to address Kevin Smith's Directing.  To all the people who say Smith can't direct need to see Jay and Silent Bob. His use of motion should silence everyone who claims there are no moving shots in a Smith film!!!  It's almost become fashionable to blast Smiths direction because that's the Thing to do. With all the great action and movement in Jay and Silent Bob'  Smith can finally shrug off all the criticisms of the past.What can I say to sum up? It's a brilliant movie for everyone not just Smith fans. You will laugh and laugh some more. Do yourself a favour and go see it as soon as you can!".

I know a lot of people complain because the movie is toilet humor vulgar language and sex jokes. But so what? Kevin Smith took on serious topics before this is his chance to kick back. If you go into this movie expecting to be enlightened then there is something seriously wrong with you.In the film Jay and Silent Bob discover that Miramax will be making a movie based on Bluntman  Chronic the comic based on themselves. Soon after discovering the insults people are slinging about the movie on the internet Jay and Silent Bob head to Hollywood to shut the movie down and protect their good names. This movie ties together all of Smith's other Jersey crew films with appearances by characters from Clerks through Chasing Amy.While it is true that you won't get all the jokes unless you've seen Smith's other movies that won't stop a person from enjoying it if they haven't. When I first saw Jay  Silent Bob Strikes Back in theaters I had only seen Dogma beforehand and I thought it was hilarious. Everyone in this movie puts on an awesome comedic performance though I think my favorite comes from Will Ferrell as an inept wildlife marshal. If you don't mind some distasteful humor you've got to see this movie.".

When the get a restraining order they find out that the comic starring their likenesses Bluntman and Chronic is being turned into a Miramax movie. However they aren't being paid for it so what to do? Travel crosscountry to Hollywood from New Jersey to stop the movie from getting made what else?Crude inappropriate and extremely funny. If there's ever a movie that you should watch with your drinking friends and not with a date or family this is the one! It has jokes about genetalia bodily functions innuendoes and more and I haven't laughed this hard at a movie for a long time. Call me immature but I like this type of stuff ones that actually have substance behind the crude jokes not like Old School.Mewes was fing hilarious when he fing say the fing fword every fing word. It has over 230 fwords along in this movie with the total number of curses probably around 300. I have never heard so many but I laughed. I'm not ashamed to admit it Mewes cracked me up with his stylish arrogance and foul mouth. Smith who was laconic for almost the entire film expressed everything with his eyes which were funny. There were more cameos than a movie of The Simpsons with Ben Affleck Matt Damon George Carlin Jamie Kennedy Chris Rock Tracy Morgan Joey Lauren Adams and many many more.There were many potshots of American movies. For instance when Jay and Silent Bob meet a drug dealer played by Tracy Morgan he says that Miramax accounts for about 75 of his income. Also everyone onscreen looks at the camera when they mention No one would pay to see a Jay and Silent Bob movie' and when Ben Affleck says that one reason you do a picture is because you owe a friend a favor. As the Bluntman and Chronic movies premieres someone says Well it was better than Mallrats.'Are you easily offended? Does the mention of various body parts upset you? If you answered yes to either question Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not your movie. If you answered no sit back and enjoy the ride!My rating 710Rated R for nonstop crude and sexual humor pervasive strong language and drug content.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether or not you enjoy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is going to depend a lot on whether or not you enjoy director Kevin Smith. I for one think the guy is a genius.  If you don't mind my lauding his name read on. First a little background for the uninitiated.Kevin Smith's movies Clerks Mallrats Chasing Amy Dogma and now JSBSB are a world created by the director himself in the sense that all are interconnected by characters plot points and subtle references. The one constant though is the entity known as Jay and Silent Bob a pair of pot dealers who have more or less spent their entire lives standing in front of the QuikStop convenience store.  Jay Jason Mewes is the longhaired guy we all knew in high school his endless stream of fourletter epithets almost endearing because the goofy guy just doesn't know any better.  Silent Bob played by director Kevin Smith Jay's selfdescribed hetero lifemate' stands by without speaking a word and provides some sort of moral counterpoint for the duo. In Smith's Chasing Amy' Banky and Holden Jason Lee and Ben Affleck respectively created a comic book entitled Bluntman and Chronic' based on their reallife buddies Jay and Silent Bob.  Fastforward to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.'Banky has sold the rights to his comic to Miramax pictures leaving Jay and Silent Bob in the dark about the business deal.  Jay and Bob with help from Holden discover via the Internet What's the Internet?' asks Jay that a movie based on them is about to start production. Realizing that they won't see a dime of the money and even more upset by their defamation on Internet message boards they decide to truck across the country to stop the film from being produced.It's important to note that while the comedy is crude slapstick and even resorts to fart jokes it's not dumb comedy it's satire at it's finest reminiscent of such selfdeprecating masterpieces as PeeWee's Big Adventure' and Blazing Saddles.' After the fairly serious Chasing Amy' and the spiritually overtoned Dogma' we see that Smith has decided to get together with his buddies and put together one big inside joke. Fortunately he's decided to let a few of us in on it.  The viewer's enjoyment of the movie is going to depend completely on his or her knowledge of Smith's previous films and characters. Smith's friends show up in cameos from Chris Rock to Will Ferrell to Alanis Morrissette to Carrie Fisher to Mark Hamill Smith is an infamous Star Wars fanatic. You can literally see a man's childhood dream coming true when at one point Smith's Bob gets to carry on a lightsaber duel with Hamill.Local interest In one of the many subplots a group of female jewel thieves bring Jay and Silent Bob to our very own Boulder Colorado to steal a monkey from a medical testing facility. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is a comedy and doesn't try to be anything else.  The only thing I felt was missing was one of Jason Lee's  inspired monologues bitterly bemoaning the state of society.  Some of Shannon Elizabeth's screen time could have been cut I felt in favor of some trademark Smith dialogue.Smith now intends to focus his time on more dramatic pursuits and we are given this as the fifth and last film in his socalled Jersey Trilogy.' The bottom line is Smith loves his fans and this film was created for the loyal.  A fitting sendoff for Jay and Silent Bob this film gets an A.'".

After the fairly serious Chasing Amy' and the spiritually overtoned Dogma' we see that Smith has decided to get together with his buddies and put together one big inside joke. Fortunately he's decided to let a few of us in on it.  The viewer's enjoyment of the movie is going to depend completely on his or her knowledge of Smith's previous films and characters. Smith's friends show up in cameos from Chris Rock to Will Ferrell to Alanis Morrissette to Carrie Fisher to Mark Hamill Smith is an infamous Star Wars fanatic. You can literally see a man's childhood dream coming true when at one point Smith's Bob gets to carry on a lightsaber duel with Hamill.Local interest In one of the many subplots a group of female jewel thieves bring Jay and Silent Bob to our very own Boulder Colorado to steal a monkey from a medical testing facility. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' is a comedy and doesn't try to be anything else.  The only thing I felt was missing was one of Jason Lee's  inspired monologues bitterly bemoaning the state of society.  Some of Shannon Elizabeth's screen time could have been cut I felt in favor of some trademark Smith dialogue.Smith now intends to focus his time on more dramatic pursuits and we are given this as the fifth and last film in his socalled Jersey Trilogy.' The bottom line is Smith loves his fans and this film was created for the loyal.  A fitting sendoff for Jay and Silent Bob this film gets an A.'";

	schema:headline " The funniest film of the year!";
	schema:reviewBody "Writerdirectorcostar Kevin Smith bids farewell to the Jay and Silent Bob characters in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back the first of the five movies featuring them in which they are the stars. He couldn't have come up with a better sendoff for them. True there's no big ideas behind this film like there were in Dogma or Chasing Amy but really the grand ideas in those movies came from the main characters not Jay and Silent Bob. They were there for comic relief mainly. Therefore it makes sense that Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back would be pure slapstick comedy. Think about it do you really want a foulmouthed oversexed stoner telling you how to live your life?So anyway it's a pure slapstick humor road movie. But unlike most slapstick comedies of late this one's actually funny...extremely funny. Jay and Silent Bob find out that a movie is being made from a comic book Bluntman  Chronic that was based on them. They set off for Hollywood intending to stop it. Kevin Smith manages to pack so many jokes into what could have been another predictable boring road comedy that it's head and shoulders above the competition. I'm gonna have to go see it again to make sure I didn't miss any jokes. Smith once again is showing off his incredible writing skills. Some people may not believe that any movie full of crude Rrated humor is well written but it is. Not only is it incredibly funny but there's an intelligence and wit behind it that is unmistakably Kevin Smith's.I was also pleased with the quality of acting in the movie especially Jason Mewes Jay. In past View Askew movies Mewes has been funny despite not doing a particularly good job of acting. The one thing I was worried about was whether or not he'd be able to carry a film mostly by himself since Silent Bob is mostly well silent. But he definitely proved that he has grown enough as an actor to be able to head up a movie. Kevin Smith Silent Bob does his usual decent job. Since he doesn't say much mainly just reacts he can't to a great job but he's still very funny. He's the perfect companion or should I say hetero life mate for Jay who's the complete opposite. There are no real other big parts in the movie but there are tons of little cameos. Really I think it'd be easier to list the people who DON'T appear in it. Some of the highlights include a scene with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon playing themselves on the set of Good Will Hunting 2 Hunting Season a scene with Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek as themselves playing the stars of the Bluntman and Chronic movie and a scene with Mark Hamill parodying Star Wars. But really almost all of the jokes are highlights.For people who have seen the other films in Smith's New Jersey Chronicles series Clerks Mallrats Chasing Amy  Dogma there are quite a few injokes that you will find hilarious. In addition to playing himself Affleck also reprises his role as Holden from Chasing Amy Jason Lee reprises his roles from Chasing Amy and Mallrats and Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran reprise their Clerks roles. Many others from the View Askewniverse appear as well. However this movie is not only for fanboys. I saw it with a friend who hadn't seen any of the other four movies and he thought it was hilarious too. The majority of the jokes will be understood by anyone. The injokes are like a little bonus from Smith to his fans but they are not the focus of the movie.Kevin Smith also does a good job directing. Lately it seems to have become popular to attack Smith's directing ability but I think he did a good job. In his earlier movies his directing was simply decent not good not bad. But he has made a lot of progress. This is one of the better directed comedies I've seen. Not Academy Award stuff but most other comedy directors are pretty boring it seems.I want to briefly comment on the GLAAD protests of the film citing large amounts of homophobia. I am gay and I didn't find the film offensive. I think a lot of people are just taking the film way to seriously. It's not a serious film. People forget that Jay is basically a moron so you can exactly take everything he says as the truth. Smith has said it's supposed to be a satire and it works. Especially considering that in past films Jay has admitted to sometimes fantasizing about guys. It's a satire lighten up people. There's actually a funny scene where James Van Der Beek chastises Jason Biggs for calling something gay and also there's a funny disclaimer at the end.Which reminds me stay for the credits. There's plenty of funny stuff and Alanis Morissette shows up at the very end. All in all Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is an extremely funny movie plain and simple. Just don't take it seriously because again it's not a serious movie. There's still a few months to go but I think this will prove to be the funniest movie of the year...actually of the last many years. Quit reading this and go see it!Rating 1010".

For the ammount of talent this directorwriter has to work with he can come up with a lot better  I know I can. Nowadays it seems like if you have 23 funny scenes you can wrap a movie around it. What we have here is maybe two with a whole lot of riffing by Jay which to me has become pointess and boring since Mallrats. Maybe I'm just getting older but swearing gay jokes and farting just kind of get old after 34 films you know? At least the series is finally over and we'll see if Smith has any talent or not. Judging from this fluff I have extreme doubt.What ever happened to the clever sharp dialogue? That's all his film's had before. None of them sans Chasing Amy had any plot but were full of juicy monologues and oneliners not to mention plenty of satire and ontarget observations of our society. But that's been slowly receding and I think Kevin Smith fans have got to be brainwashed here now because this is NOT a good movie. I loved his first 3 movies and I know the universe of the characters and I found all the references to his other films fans critics the interent to all be very lazy and poorly handled. I feel cheated by the one guy who I thought wouldn't sell out but he did it a long time ago... one starNot worth your money...".

	schema:headline " It was OK...";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start out by saying that like most people here I am a Kevin Smith fan.  I thought clerks and chasing amy were great movies from a brilliant director.  Superb acting great jokes and great characters.Unfortunately his newest movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back has none of those things.  First of all let me point out that these characters are not the same Jay and Silent Bob many of you will remember from Clerks.  They were annoying drugdealing losers who played a small role in the movie. Somewhere along the way however they became lovable goons that are the center of a movie.  I'm not sure these characters are well developed enough to be the main characters.Anyways on to the movie.  This movie starts out SLLLOOOOWWWWW...It was too bad that they bring back lots of great characters like Randall Dante and Brody but only for quick cameo shots.  None of them offer anything to this movie.  It takes a while but finally the jokes start rolling.  Sadly Kevin Smith kind of gave in to the American Pie movie style which is just making lewd comments and sexual jokes.  There is no intelligent insightful dialogue as you are used to from his other movies.I think that the one bright spot of the movie was Chris Rock's character. He displays the charm and wittiness that you have come to know from characters like Banky Randall Hooper X etc.Overall i would give this movie 4 stars out of 10.  There are some funny spots but they do not really start until about halfway through the movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let me start out by saying that like most people here I am a Kevin Smith fan.  I thought clerks and chasing amy were great movies from a brilliant director.  Superb acting great jokes and great characters.Unfortunately his newest movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back has none of those things.  First of all let me point out that these characters are not the same Jay and Silent Bob many of you will remember from Clerks.  They were annoying drugdealing losers who played a small role in the movie. Somewhere along the way however they became lovable goons that are the center of a movie.  I'm not sure these characters are well developed enough to be the main characters.Anyways on to the movie.  This movie starts out SLLLOOOOWWWWW...It was too bad that they bring back lots of great characters like Randall Dante and Brody but only for quick cameo shots.  None of them offer anything to this movie.  It takes a while but finally the jokes start rolling.

The titular characters are really not interesting enough to carry an entire movie especially seeing that one is silent.  After 90 minutes the voice of Jay was an inch away from giving me a seizure.  Crude and stupid in all of the bad ways this film puts a black mark next to the name of a filmmaker who really isn't all that talented in the first place.

Any negative reviews you may read are surely written by critics who weren't big fans of Smith's previous efforts especially Mallrats. JSBSB is a movie for the View Askew fans. The film contains many references to Clerks 1994 Mallrats 1995 Chasing Amy 1997 and Dogma 1999 as well as the Clerks comic books and the Jay and Silent Bob comic book Chasing Dogma that bridges the gap between Chasing Amy and Dogma actually a great deal of the film's road trip comes directly from this book.JSBSB the fifth film in the New Jersey Trilogy much like The Hitchhiker's Guide fivepart trilogy is filled to the brim with crude humor that usually turns off most movie critics but it's crude humor with Kevin Smith's familiar wit. It's written for Jason Mewes to really shine in his performance I never thought I'd say that.The major part of this film that stood out for me is the craft. The craft?! What the hell could I be talking about? As many know Kevin Smith's movies are notorious for having almost zero camera moves. This is Kevin Smith's most technically superior film probably because it's his highest budget. There are camera moves and excellent camera angles. In Smith's last film Dogma as well as this one he utilizes the 2.351 aspect ratio. Why in the world he feels that he needs to use such scope in these films is beyond me.Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not a real movie. Chasing Amy is the closest Smith has come to that. For the View AskewKevin Smith fans this is his best film. It will certainly be interesting to see what kind of movies Smith decides to make now that his New Jersey Trilogy has come to a close and he doesn't have the familiar characters to fall back on.".

Actor 1 says a line Actor 2 says a line and so on. You see poor poor Kevin Smith never learned how to edit. Even in that famous story about how he had an argument with Ben Affleck Chasing Amy about the line  What do you use for foreplay? A baseball bat? Kevin demanded that Ben not say that again. In editing you can see the edit jump and the sound stop at Ben Affleck saying the line wha Why? Because Kevin will take his ball and go home.".

	schema:reviewBody "It pains me to say it but this is the only Kevin Smith film I didn't like. I even loved Mallrats which was heavily criticized. The movie started off on a pretty good note the Scooby sequence ranks with the best Smith moments but that's exactly what this movie is an all around crappy film with some good even memorable scenes injected every now and then.I think the main reason this movie failed was that it was EXTREMELY pretentious. I've never met Smith and I've only seen a few interviews. I love the guy as a filmmaker and NO ONE loves Clerks Mallrats Chasing Amy or Dogma more than me. I connected with those four films big time. But with THIS film it's as if the fame has gone to View Askew's head. There's a sort of we're so cool feel to a lot of the characters but none more so than Silent Bob. When SB started shouting in Jay's face I cringed and sank in my seat because it was SUPPOSED to be funny and it was supposed to make us think Wow Silent Bob is not only talking but he's also shouting. But instead I just thought to myself Oh come ON! I'm no mindreader but I definitely sensed that the film was done with an underlying albeit probably unintentional arrogance about it.I heard this was going to be the last of the Jay  Silent Bob series. I was bummed about that until I saw this. This fragmented film although it's supposed to be silly proves that the Jay  Silent Bob series was running on fumes. It was as if Smith ran out of things to do or say. Mind you I'm not saying it should've had a serious message. There wasn't a really dramatic message in Mallrats yet I loved it. Jay  Silent Bob Strike Back is not a total crap film but it's definitely the one and only View Askew film I was really disappointed with and I think the film's pretentiousness has a lot to do with why it failed.".

This is possibly the first thriller without any thrills. In fact it should be renamed Two Irritating Slappers Stuck On A Yacht.The film begins promisingly. Patsy Kensit Su and Liz Hurley Lou perform an appalling musical number in a club and then Liz performs an impromptu strip flashing her boobs. Unfortunately the comedy ends there. Su and Lou pick up a drunken German skipper an embarrassed looking Juergen Prochnow for what I assume was a threesome and decide to sail with him to Bermuda. Shortly into the trip Su becomes jealous of the relationship developing between Lou and the skipper and generally behaves like an idiot. This jealousy then escalates into general insanity.Kill Cruise doesn't even have the decency to be a mildly amusing Dead Calm rip off. That film exploited the claustrophobic atmosphere of a yacht to magnificent effect. Kill Cruise doesn't even bother in fact nothing really happens. The most thrilling moment is probably when everyone falls asleep and the ship hits some empty oil barrels. Now that will have you on the edge of your seat. The finale itself is so anticlimactic that it borders on being shameful. The twist is utterly nonsensical and the epilogue is so stupid and irrelevant that it almost defies belief.The only reason I give this film 3 stars instead of 1 is out of sympathy for Juergen Prochnow who does his best despite the ridiculous material that he has to work with. The only other thing the film has going for it is the opportunity to laugh at the amazing lack of acting ability displayed by Liz and Patsy. What a sorry pair.Kill Cruise really is an exercise in futility. If you are going to make a thriller please provide some thrills. And if you are going to disguise your dull epic as a character study then at least flesh out the characters and try to make their actions vaguely believable. This is one cruise you will be happy to skip.".

This is a slow moving but very unusual  interesting character study of three people on a small boat traveling from Gibralter to Barbados. The acting is superb especially Kensit  Prochnow both of whom have much charisma the changing small group dynamics are very interesting for viewers who like character studies  there's quite a surprise in the plot. Notice the double standard of Kensit's character as she first has sex with a man in exchange for something she expects but never gets  then disapproves her friend's Hurley's going a bit too far after their burlesque dance routine. It's this same ambiguity that drives her character throughout the movie. Hurley is shown seminude briefly a couple of times so that may either peak your interest or turn you off not for younger viewers. Stick with it during the slow moments it's worth it. I rate it 810.".

But even Patsy Kensit and Elizabeth Hurley did well portraying two selfabsorbed airheaded and talentfree bimbos who hitch a boat ride with him expecting a relaxing pleasure cruise. I've been on a oneweek cruise with two other people on a similar vessel sailing off the coast of Maine and can tell you that the movie accurately portrays the claustrophobic conditions on board which can lead to personality clashes. If some of the personalities are psychotic as in this movie the tension would become unbearable to the point of explosion. And anyone who thinks that personalities like those portrayed in the movie don't actually exist has led a very sheltered life.The sailing scenes are realistic  the motion of the boat the feeling of vulnerability in the open ocean how danger or an emergency can appear suddenly the necessity for even the inexperienced to pitch in and help.

But I found the film so fascinating that I watched it from beginning to end. Being on a yacht with Paty Kensit and Liz Hurley sounds like your idea of paradise? Well the washed out skipper of a yacht is duped into a four week trip to Barbaidos with two young women who make a living stripping and turning tricks in a decidedly seedy Gibraltar. Everything seems fine at first but then the sexual tension rises the skipper seems to have a dark secret and paradise turns into hell. The film has an overtone of aggressive sexuality from the very beginning that tries to assert itself against the burned out skipper and does so in the end but with disastrous consequences. I liked both the feel of the run down part of Gibraltar and the clautstrophobic atmosphere on the yacht. Kensit is great as the slut from hell who becomes more and more unstable throughout the journey. Hurley seems to be the sensible one who turn into a complete psychopath. While the acting is very good my only misgiving about the film is that this change comes too suddenly and does not really seem plausible. I'm not sure if secnes were cut from the film but I certainly do not believe the rumour of a full frontal nudity lesbian love scene which wouldn't really make sense. The film is also a showcase for Prochnow's acting talents which he unfortunately squandered with later roles as stoch villain. Well worth watching!".

The language here is listed as German on IMDb but there are also versions with English language out there. The writer and director is Peter Keglevic and this is possibly his most known work. The film is basically a 3man show consisting of Jrgen Prochnow and British actresses Patsy Kensit and Liz Hurley. Prochnow was of course very known through Das Boot. Kensit was also a bit of a star when this was made over 25 years ago but for Hurley it was a bit of a breakthrough film as she wasn't famous yet.This is the story of a captain who agrees to sail from Gibraltar to the West Indies because two young women want him to. Off they go and basically the entire action takes place on the boat. You can imagine that with two women and one men you will see scenes of jealousy misogyny sex and of course survival. I would not say it was a great film in terms of any of these factors but it was very much worth watching and a pretty decent thriller. You see both women your choice who to prefer depending on if you like blondes or brunettes in bikinis most of the time which is an additional treat too. But then the last 12 minutes or so start and that's where the film goes really down in quality. The sudden plot twist involving Hurley's character came absolutely out of nowhere and I felt it made so little sense that it almost destroyed the entire film and everything before it. This ending is also why I would only recommend this movie to really the biggest fans of survivals movies. Everybody else should skip it or they will be as confused and disappointed as I was. Then again maybe I overrated the film a bit in general before the last scenes already because I like Prochnow and Hurley. Thumbsdown overall.".

While my drama instructor tried to avoid using the word motivation because of possibility of clich I can think of no word better. There was simply no logical reason presented for the goings on in this film. The motivation is missing. Of course it was only one dollar in the bargain bin. Perhaps I shouldn't complain too much.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this DVD because I mistakenly thought that the premise had some interesting mysterysuspense possibilities that the attractive wellrecognized cast would deliver entertaining performances and that even if the plot and acting failed there still might be enough to make the film one of those movies that is fun to watch because of how bad it is. To my immediate and mounting disappointment as the film droned on none of this was true. Save yourself from this fate. The onestar rating was invented for a film like this.The plot is undeveloped incoherent nonsense. The film opens with a loud dark confusing sequence at sea where the sailor is caught in a storm and someone dies. There is never any serious attempt to explain or develop this story. Later the now downandout sailor suddenly agrees to ferry two loudmouth fringe bar singers and their bothersome dog on a 4week trip to Barbados. During the trip one of the singers takes an unreasoning dislike to the sailor picks one childish fight after another with him rummages through his possessions and comes up with a theory that he killed the person on the earlier voyage because of a love triangle of some sort. The sailor later explains away the theory to the other singer who seems friendlier to him and then the whole murder theory is just dropped as if it were a mistake. After many tedious labored pointless scenes of the three on board quarreling facing several trumpedup ultimately boring seafaring adversities and doing various routine chores like hosing dog poop off the deck there is a lastminute psychotype killing on board that comes out of nowhere and explains nothing. The film ends with a cryptic message on screen about the fate of the survivors that again gives no meaning to anything that has come before.The film is a complete failure not only as serious drama but as light entertainment. By no stretch of the imagination is it sexy funny or fun to watch. The superficial loser characters could not be less interesting or attractive. The sailor is so grouchy withdrawn and brokendown the hostile singer so exaggerated in her disagreeableness the other singer so vapid and vacuous the petty quarreling among the characters so constant and annoying and the tone of the film so dark that there is not an ounce of chemistry or lasting good cheer among the characters. Not only is the characters' behavior a total drag there is nothing erotic about the situations scenery or wardrobe. This includes an early short embarrassing scene in a bar in which one singer supposedly strips but clearly does no such thing and a splitsecond glimpse of a perfunctory sleepy love scene that packs no punch whatsoever I do not know what DVD version others saw but if the one I saw contained any nudity I must have missed it by blinking leaving me only the actual pathetic substance of the film to judge.Sadly some movies have absolutely nothing redeeming about them. This is one of them. The only thing to do when this happens is to come right out and say so. There is nothing inappropriate about this. It is just the way it is. Reciting all the movie's flaws but then giving them a pass for no reason at all straining to conjure and contrive tidbits that are supposedly worth watching or engaging in speculative wishful thinking that edited scenes or possible explanations exist that like magic would somehow make sense of this mess only compounds the waste of time and money from a film like this and even worse contributes to the impression that moviegoers are suckers.Yet this is all that the wouldbe positive reviews of this film have been able to do. Someone who looks to a movie like this for a supposedly serious portrayal of personalities is the one who is living a very sheltered life not someone who takes this useless piece of fiction to task for it glaring flaws. The simplistic observation that spending a long time in close quarters on a boat can lead to cabin fever and that it can be even worse if the people are psychos is hardly the stuff of true meaning or entertainment value with or without claimed realistic sailing scenes. The suggestion that including a psycho in the cast means that anything goes and that all standards of quality coherence or enjoyability go out the window has no place in any credible effort at movie reviewing. When the best a review can say is that a film is not totally worthless and that it manages to leave the audience with nothing more than a feeling of emptiness and no that's not all movies are about why bother to pretend it has any real value? Of course there can be fluff entertainment that is enjoyable. But that does not mean that anything on a screen qualifies. And it makes a mockery of any serious use of the terms to say that this film is a personal drama character study or psychological study of lesbian jealousy or anything else. What is on the screen here makes perfectly clear beyond any doubt that the movie does not deserve any of these obvious and unsuccessful efforts to make excuses for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one film whose concept you can see coming a mile away but you wonder how hasn't it been done before. Mind you you do feel glad that no one else has because this is one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time.Samantha Carina Lau is a highpowered executive of the Hong Kong division of a brassiere manufacturer. In a meeting with directors she is told of a surprise plan to break with condition to hire two men to come up with the design of the Ultimate Bra. In come Johnny Ching Wan Lau a men's briefs designer and Wayne Louis Koo a serial womaniser who become the focus of attention in the firm as girls flock to them and they learn the secrets of what makes a good bra. However this comes to the dismay of Lena Gigi Leung the firm's top designer who ensures that they really do get their hands dirty and learn what it takes to be a top bra designer.The story is wonderfully written and very imaginitive. One would immediately want to draw comparison to Hollywood's What Women Want but there are very few similarities in the gags. The compulsory crossdressing for the female experience has to come about but the way it was done was very amusing and different to What Women Want and what added to the humour was that whole scene was obviously very naturally and spontaneously filmed.The dialogue was excellent especially Johnny's. All the characters really developed well making you relate to them and the whole story isn't very cheesy. The script was simply brilliantly thought out with lots of dilemmas and problems thrown in the way of the characters and it was interesting just to see how they'd handle it.All in all I have to recommend this film because it is simply very funny. Enjoy it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer follows Julie Jennifer Love Hewitt who is still suffering from the memories of her friends' murders by a vengeful fisherman who she and her friends had accidentally hit with their car and disposed of his body thinking him to be dead. Her college friend Karla Brandy Norwood wins tickets to the Bahamas via a radio station contest so she Karla Karla's boyfriend Tyrell Mekhi Phifer and a friend Will head off on vacation. Meanwhile Ray Freddie Prinze Jr. Julie's exboyfriend has an encounter with the fisherman again and heads to the island to save Julie. But soon enough bodies begin to pile up on the mostlydeserted island which is currently in it's storm season all around Julie and her friends and it seems the fisherman has returned.I considered the original I Know What You Did Last Summer to be a fairly good slasher movie that evolved during the late '90s. It had a nice revengelaced premise about teenagers who had to pay the consequences for their mistakes at the hands of a psychotic fisherman and it was very well done in comparison with most slasher movies of that era. This sequel popped up only a year later and while it may be very unoriginal it's still entertaining. In terms of story the idea was well put together and the tropical stormy Bahaman island was the perfect setting for this film to take place and a nice change from the gloomy coastal town the previous film was set in. I knew a sequel was coming after the first film succeeded well with audiences it was nearly inevitable. The violence factor is much more gratuitous in this sequel it's gore galore for this movie which wasn't surprising. It seems that way for a lot of horror movie sequels.Also being no surprise this film is almost beyond clichridden. Typical horror setups scares and character stupidity is present throughout the course of the movie. It's unrealistic a lot of the time and there are plot holes everywhere so in that sense it's a bit of a mess. But on the other hand despite all of the unrealistic events I have to admit that this is an extremely entertaining movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprise their role and Brandy Norwood and Mekhi Phifer play her lively friends. Jennifer Esposito whose career hadn't quite taken off yet also plays a worker on the island who the gang teams up with when the fisherman begins to off the island's population. The acting was nothing more than average at best but it was tolerable nothing too bad I have seen much worse. But besides what can you expect from this type of flick? The film ends with one of those gotcha! jump scares quite similar to the ending of the original and puts a close on this series unless you count the 2006 directtovideo sequel that follow this on a rather silly but fitting note. The entire movie is a little farfetched but so what?Overall I'd advise anyone who is tired of your runofthemill slasher movies to avoid I Still Know What You Did Last Summer like the plague because I can guarantee that they will be sorely disappointed. But for those who enjoy some cheap horror entertainment every once and awhile this clichd little slasher sequel is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours but don't expect to take any of it seriously. 610.".

The surprise twist at the end did catch me off guard although others have commented that they figured it out in advance.The movie supposedly takes place on a Bahamian island. Having visited the Bahamas many many times the first view of the socalled Bahamas in the movie was a little bit of a shock since these previously perfectly flat islands had now grown mountains and hills along with rock formations jutting out of the ocean. And then when I saw the Bahamian resort I was further shocked to see that Mexican architecture had been exported to the Bahamas.It seems the film makers should either have gone to the Bahamas or made the location in the film be Mexico where it was actually filmed. Of course Mexico has no remote lightly populated islands like the Bahamas does so I guess that wouldn't have suited the story. And the Bahamian government probably wouldn't let them film there due to the potential bad impact on tourism.Despite these quibbles the movie held my interest and had enough eye candy to keep me watching the screen. I would rate this movie about a 7.5 on a scale of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't bother.Unless you are very easily entertained and have not seen any decent horror movies to compare this to. I would say the first one was OK having seen it in the theater with a screaming audience made it more fun but not in my list of top 20 horror movies. This sequel makes the first one look like a masterpiece. I figured out who the killer was about 15 minutes into the movie. The only slightly amusing part was Jeffrey Combs who starred in the classic ReAnimator and many Stuart Gordon films. He is amusing but too good for crap like this! I Hope they at least paid him good money the poor guy. Also why did she flip out when she was locked in the tanning bed?

I would say the first one was OK having seen it in the theater with a screaming audience made it more fun but not in my list of top 20 horror movies. This sequel makes the first one look like a masterpiece. I figured out who the killer was about 15 minutes into the movie. The only slightly amusing part was Jeffrey Combs who starred in the classic ReAnimator and many Stuart Gordon films. He is amusing but too good for crap like this! I Hope they at least paid him good money the poor guy. Also why did she flip out when she was locked in the tanning bed?

But I Still Know what you did last summer has possibly the worst one I have ever seen. What it lacks in gore it definitely makes up for in logic...oh wait no they have NONE! Here's the situation the murderer has fallen through a ceiling or something and he's unconscious. One of the girls has a great big fire axe in her hand. What would most sensible humans do? That's right swing that axe lots and lots of times making sure his head and body are separate entities and why not his limbs as well. BUT NO! She doesn't do anything of the sort instead she uses the axe to break into a greenhouse and then...THROWS IT AWAY. Clever girl! She may be dead but at least she got the moral highground. N.B. If you're ever stuck in a slasher situation KILL the murderer when you get chance and use a bit of logic. Then again if that happened the film would last about 15 minutes which would definitely have been a good thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer surprised me. I could see from the trailer that this second movie would have a different feel to the original the first being more of a psychological thriller but still it caught me totally offguard. I Still Know... took a brave step away from the feel of its predecessor and dared to be different  which is most probably why so many people disliked it. The opening scene displays a similar amount of emotion and tension that was visible ten minutes into the first movie but then in Love Hewitt's own words the movie goes crazy. In a good way...Britishborn Danny Cannon's directing is topnotch and his build up of atmosphere and suspense throughout the movie is wellpaced. His style and obvious knowledge of Horror movies as with the original is a great benefit and there are quite a few 'jumps' that work well.With Williamson unwilling to return to script a sequel my main fear was that the script would be appalling if written by a newcomer. Thankfully Trey Callaway's script is both inventive and witty and matches Williamson's style almost seamlessly. Although the characters are not quite as well developed we are given enough interesting and chilling set pieces to keep things at an entertaining level.The setting of the deserted tropical island is an inspired idea and the isolation of the central characters adds muchneeded suspense. This smart move helps to bring a new sense of unease and isolation to the film. By now the overall feeling of unease apparent in the first has dissipated but the atmosphere of the island is overpowering and the suspense almost unbearable as Ben creeps ever closer to conquering Julie.Another good point  as with the first I Know...  is that all the characters are genuine and likeable. While they are a little underdeveloped what we do see of them helps the viewer to understand and like them. Between Karla's happygolucky attitude and barmaid Nancy's dark sense of humor there is something quite special here. The acting is again of a high standard and I was surprised at how well Brandy made the jump from TV comedy to fullfledged movie horror! Even supporting actors such as Matthew Settle who played Will Benson and Jennifer Esposito were extremely enjoyable giving this movie a sense of realism that isn't all too apparent in many movies these days. The presence of Ben Willis is one that still sends chills down the spine and Muse Watson's portrayal of a coldblooded killer is unlike any other onscreen slasher in this day and age. Another welcome face and one that spiced up the movie a little with his pompous hotel manager is Jeffrey Combs who is brilliant as the tightlipped manager and his death is a truly memorable and shocking moment his subdued Duh! still cracks me up.The only disappointing thing about I Still Know... is the final epilogue scene. While the final shock worked effectively in the first movie and gave a great final scare here it is rather predictable. Although it is handled well and Love's final scream is one that is chilling to the extreme it simply leaves the movie feeling unfinished.MY VERDICT A worthy sequel that is given way too little credit for trying to be different. While it may not suit everybody's taste the great performances from all the principle cast in particular Love Hewitt who it was great to see back! an original setting and artistic directing set this one above most teen slashers and is one that should not be viewed alone on a dark night.".

One of my friends bought me the Blu ray of this for Christmas and I thought 'see what I think this could be good' Just watched it last night oh dear is all I can say.To be honest it was nice to see Jennifer Love Hewitt again. But I thought she died in the first film? Oh no wait it was a dream. So I thought 'OK fair enough' The character connections were OK but I felt more for Jennifer Love Hewitt. The acting was OK I suppose but nothing Oscar worthy.The story was very weak and very predictable. The main character's friend wins a competition to the Bahamas so she invites Jennifer Hewitt along with two other friends. So now you immediately know the killer is at large and is going to follow them there. Now this familiar. Where did I see this before? Oh yeah Jaws The Revenge. You clearly know the writers have watched that before hand and thought it would work for this. Well trust me it doesn't. When they enter the island it happens to be stormy season and they are the only ones left on the entire island. Are you joking? was this idea stolen from The Shining? which is my all time favorite film in the world.The filming was fine and the cinematography was fine I'll be honest.Now the twist is the main downfall of this film. You find that the killer has an accomplice. Who is it? its one of the main character's friend's who just happens to be his son. Wow that also sounds like Scream. The killer then takes off his hat ans speaks for the first time. To be honest he should of stayed muted because his acting was laughable. This was the time I put my hand on face in disbelief. The end its all happily ever after or is it? Yes folks an opening for another sequel.Please do not bother with this movie its atrocious. But if your looking for a good time with friends and feel like taking the mick out of a film watch this. I Know What You Did Last Summer fans if you watched the first one and not this one please stick to the first one. Don't bother wasting your money time and effort.".

Don't get me wrong gore does have its place and that is basically where it is incorporated into suspenseful moments.

However replacing Sarah Michelle Gellar with Brandy was a big step backwards.Oh and as for the end scene... a little suspense but hard to credit. By this stage I was rolling my eyes and waiting for it to end.So if you like films with very little suspense a bit of gore one twist that you could guess from the outset anyway ridiculous nonsense storyline and fairly lame acting watch this you will love it.

THESE are the ones that will live throughout the movie.6 Why in the world did Long John Silver kill ... oh I don't know ... the first ten or so people he offed?7 The supposed huge plot twist was about as obvious as the fact that this movie is a poor poor attempt to duplicate Scream.8 How the HELL did Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brandy get into the supposed great college they are enrolled in? That is when they're not skipping out to go to exotic tropical island locales.9 Does everyone ever believe a character in a horror movie who warns them of danger?10 How many times did Hewitt walk alone through an apartmenthotel room looking for someone she couldn't possibly have stopped if she had found them?11 Did Mekhi Peiffer have one line where he didn't sound like he was thinking with his groin?12 This movie will go toe to toe with Meet Joe Black for the top spot at the box office this weekend.13 People who like this kind of movie make me seriously reconsider universal suffrage.14 As many times as I correctly predicted what would happen half an hour before it did I was looking for myself to be listed as director.15 Then I remembered a three year old could have predicted the plot.16 I'm damn glad I didn't pay to see this load of crap...17 ... cause it is officially the single worst movie I've ever seen.18 I spent more time writing this review than the screenwriter did writing the story.19 I'll give it a 2 out of 10 ...20 ...

THESE are the ones that will live throughout the movie.6 Why in the world did Long John Silver kill ... oh I don't know ... the first ten or so people he offed?7 The supposed huge plot twist was about as obvious as the fact that this movie is a poor poor attempt to duplicate Scream.8 How the HELL did Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brandy get into the supposed great college they are enrolled in? That is when they're not skipping out to go to exotic tropical island locales.9 Does everyone ever believe a character in a horror movie who warns them of danger?10 How many times did Hewitt walk alone through an apartmenthotel room looking for someone she couldn't possibly have stopped if she had found them?11 Did Mekhi Peiffer have one line where he didn't sound like he was thinking with his groin?12 This movie will go toe to toe with Meet Joe Black for the top spot at the box office this weekend.13 People who like this kind of movie make me seriously reconsider universal suffrage.14 As many times as I correctly predicted what would happen half an hour before it did I was looking for myself to be listed as director.15 Then I remembered a three year old could have predicted the plot.16 I'm damn glad I didn't pay to see this load of crap...17 ... cause it is officially the single worst movie I've ever seen.18 I spent more time writing this review than the screenwriter did writing the story.19 I'll give it a 2 out of 10 ...20 ... I'm being generous if only Hewitt would shut the hell up and just get naked.";

What are they going to call this one. i know what you did 3 summers ago. anyways i think that you should only go see this movie before 6 because i would not pay the full price. well that is just my thought.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm looking at all of the positive comments made for I Still Know What You Did Last Summer and I have one question Where are your brains? This movie was absolutely horrendous an insult to the intelligence without any wit logic or reason for being.Let's start with all the holes in the plot How did Ben Willis know where Julie's boyfriend Freddie Prinze Jr. was going to be driving? Why did Ben Willis pay so much money to drag Julie and company all the way to the Bahamas only to kill everyone else there and especially if he had access to kill Julie the whole time she was at school? Are there really exact days that resorts in the Bahamas have a hurricane season? How could the filmmakers believe that audiences are so witless as to not know that the capital of Brazil is NOT Rio de Janeiro? If Ben had access to Julie's room the WHOLE time why didn't he just kill her? Why did that voodoo guy return to the hotel after we saw him start to escape off the island? Why didn't Julie ax Ben Willis when he was trying to break through the door? And what is with that pathetic ending?Oh there are so many questions I had about this movie and to no avail. After awhile I realized that I was putting more thought to the film than the makers did! The filmmakers were so bankrupt of imagination that I guess they had to settle for just killing everyone off that wasn't essential to the story a la Friday the 13th. This movie has no reason for being only to pocket the money of those unfortunate enough to sit through this mess. If the movie was a bore to sit through the ending was infuriating. It totally demonstated that the filmmakers have absolutely no regard for the audience and Jennifer Love's character all along. Nothing is worse than the old is a dream sequence or not? routine. The surprise in the film was only a surprise for people who lack the intelligence of putting a 10 piece jigsaw puzzle together.".

The continuation of the story about a 'hook man' that likes to kill teenagers gets very predictable. But watching Jennifer Love Hewitt suffer her flashbacks is enough to tide you over until the next slashing. The setting is attractive and some of the gore is down right nasty. If stabbing slashing poking and ripping people up is your thrill...this is your flick.Brandy did a real nice job while Matthew Settle was pathetic. Freddie Prince Jr. committed robbery by taking a salary for what little he did. Also in the cast were Mekhi Phifer Muse Watson and Red Westfamed Memphis Mafia member.If Ms. Love Hewitt was not in this movie do you think anyone would by tickets to see it? Probably not.".
