	schema:reviewBody "No this isn't a masterpiece of a movie. Far from it. But I didn't find it quite as horrible as some reviewers. This movie is based on the Polan Banks novel Carriage. I haven't read the book so I can't comment on whether this adaptation is accurate. It does feel like there are some missing details that often get cut in an adaptation to keep a movie's running time to a modest length. However this movie runs quite short at 1 hour 15 minutes and they certainly could've included more than they did.I wasn't as confused as other reviewers about Barbara Beaurevel's Ava Gardner forbidden past. It involves the fact that she is Carrie Crandall's granddaughter. Mrs. Crandall is known as a notorious woman in New Orleans. She married a gambler who promptly left her. She had a daughter Barbara's motherwho she then gave another name and sent to be raised in a convent in order to protect her. The attorney Mr. Toplady who is sent to find Barbara in order to pass on the inheritance that has been left her states that Mrs. Crandall would do anything to provide for her daughter. I think it is only natural to assume this meant she became a prostitute or Madame. With this being New Orleans and the fact that she hooked up with a gambler  this is not too farfetched. Barbara's mother then met and married affluent Mr. Beaurevel Barbara's father. What I wonder is what ever happened to Barbara's parents? Why is she in the care of her Aunt? Again these are items probably explained in the novel but cut from the movie.Ava is perfectly lovely as usual. There are a couple times when her acting was quite good. I liked when Mitchum's character walks away from her on the terrace at the dance. Watch Ava's very subtle but effective facial expressions an almost undetectable raise of an eyebrow and a few lip quivers. She could've easily overacted her hurt and anger but is wonderfully subtle and yet still powerfully conveys the emotions.I did find it hard to believe Mitchum in his occupational role as do good medical researcher  willing to work for low pay for a good cause. Its obvious he was a street kid from New York who had to gamble his way through college. Its hard to believe he would have acquired noble aspirations and not just gone after money. Plus he is such a notorious cad is most of his roles  its hard to buy his noble speech to Ava at the end  if you do all these things you might turn out to be quite a woman. But otherwise I do like the chemistry between the two characters.I think there are some interesting elements to the plot  I like the unexpected event towards the end. It adds an unexpected twist. But apart from this the dialogue itself is quite weak. My other complaint is that the musical score is rather forgettable and could've done much more to enhance the mood and feel of New Orleans and the grand ole' South. But I still think the movie is worth a look especially for Ava.".

There are a couple of good lines. The plot is slim and the movie is not long. Only 71 minutes for those with a short attention span.We're never told exactly what Ava's forbidden past is but it has to do with her grandmother. Was she a prostitute?

	schema:reviewBody "Ava Gardner's beauty in My Forbidden Past as any film is intoxicating. I had read Howard Hughes was particular about accentuating women's breast's even so far as designing bras and his handiwork shows here. Ms. Gardner  Ms. Carter MitchumMark's wife are stunning!I actually liked the movie because you will notice something new every time you watch it. The street people each had a song for their wares. Even the servant the great Clarence Muse who turned out the porch lamp hummed a tune that could be heard through the house. You got the feeling that yes jazz COULD be born here! There were poor of both races in the streets 'hustling' as we would say today and Ava bought a memorial candle from a poor white kid who also sang of his wares. In what I remember of countrylike Saturdays in NY ghettos in the 50s and 60s there were peddlers singing as they sold their wares through the streets of Harlem Brooklyn and the South Bronx be they crabs lobsters fruit or shaved flavored ice. So that alone gave the movie an air of realism for me. Just as the Gershwins' represented the South Carolinian enclave of Catfish Row with it's street peddlers in Porgy  Bess. Seems like a lot of minority extras got paid in this movie too and that kept some grits on the stove for families like mine. Mitchum's character seemed to be a guy who toughed his way up from the streets of NY to make something of himself in the world. He backed off of Ava's character because beside standing him up before she gained her fortune she spelled trouble which he'd already seen enough of. After the kiss he gave her in town and after he made it clear at the ball that he would be faithful to his new wife Ava gave the camera a look that would send a shiver down Cagney or Gable's spine. You knew she would make him feel her hurt. 'Hell hath no fury...' said Mitchum. What wonderful actors they both were! I was just a little puzzled at why Mitchum's wife was 'putting the make' on sad old Melvyn. Vincent Price in that role I could understand. But Mel struck me as comical of course she WAS a golddigger so... I guess it makes more sense in the book. I give the movie 2 thumbs up for settings and background and another thumb up for Ava's beauty I'll find an extra thumb somewhere she deserves it! Mitchum's wife Janis CarterCorrine wasn't bad either. Costuming was excellent! I was although a little perplexed at the outfit Gardner wore when she came to let Mitchum know of his wife's rendezvous with Douglas. Gaudy almost to the degree of clownish it seemed as though she had another stop to make that night or really thought she should '...look the part' as Rhett said to Scarlett in Gone with the Wind as he helped her choose the dress she wore to Ashley's birthday party. When Mitchum opens the door and she walks in he must've first thought she was Emmet Kelly wearing a torpedo bra forgive me Ava. One entire layer of pancake could have been removed in that lighting. Still loved the flick  especially the costumes.".

Hence when Barbara falls in love with industrious yet selfmade researcher Mark Lucas Robert Mitchum trouble is bound to occur. Robert Stevenson's film boils up to a satisfying courtroom climax in which an inevitable deus ex machina allows a happy ending to take place.Despite the fact that the film remains relentlessly studiobound with only a few second unit shots denoting time and place it makes a creditable effort of portraying a world riddled with hypocrisies where Lucas is treated with as much disdain as the African American servant Clarence Muse working for the Beaurevel family. Douglas makes an eminently hissable villain with his thin pencil mustache and courtly manners that do not prevent him from making a pass at Lucas' wife Janis Carter in a selfinterested act of revenge for Lucas' falling in love with Barbara. Mitchum looks uncomfortable in the cloistered surroundings of a research laboratory but becomes a formidable adversary for Douglas. Gardner doesn't have much to do except proclaim her love for Lucas in a series of closeups this task she accomplishes competently.

Melvyn Douglas as a layabout lady's man who would boink his own cousin if he thought he could enrich himself? Quite different from the bland but trustworthy best friend of the leading man he often plays. Ava Gardner may not be playing against type but she is just so beautiful here  shiny hair perfect bone structure just one touch of Venus!Dr. Mark Lucas Mitchum a poor researcher at Tulane and Barbara Beaurevel Gardner a member of one of New Orleans' oldest finest and poorest families are in love but Barbara is always meeting him in secret. The reason is not exactly clear unless she worries for her social reputation but then again what is so awful about being a medical researcher? Or maybe it is because her family wants her to marry a rich suitor. Mark goes away on a research trip for two months and comes back with a wife. This cuts Barbara to the core. Mark appears to have done this on the rebound because he has no satisfactory explanation. The wife is a cold fish who apparently would dump Mark if she found a richer or more exciting option. So why these two are together is puzzling.Barbara wants to get Mark back and for some reason she thinks getting her grandmother's inheritance which has just been sitting around collecting dust for years is the way to do that. Again why? Mark apparently cares nothing for money. Maybe the best revenge is living well? But I digress. Barbara with no more than her startling physical similarity to her grandmother successfully collects her 900K inheritance from the trustee. But there is a catch. Grandma was a notorious woman. Grandma married a gambler who left her and their child for parts unknown. The insinuation is that Grandma became a prostitute or madame in New Orleans in order to get by. Like that has never happened before??? Oh the horror! So Barbara must keep her heritage and the source of her new found wealth a secret. And strangely nobody outside of the family ever asks where the money came from.Barbara does think she has found a way to get Mark back and strangely enough it does require cash. But then her plan unexpectedly turns to tragedy. I'll let you watch and find out how this plays out. I'd recommend this. I'd actually rate this at 6.5 if possible. Sure the script is moth eaten and the production code prevents the spelling out of the details of the original story Carriage but Ava Gardner commands your attention as a woman scorned. It seems hard to believe but she MUST have been scorned at one time to get the facial expressions down so pat. Melvyn Douglas injects some of his trademark wit into his largely despicable character so that he is more than just a two dimensional clich.".

Ava Gardner may not be playing against type but she is just so beautiful here  shiny hair perfect bone structure just one touch of Venus!Dr. Mark Lucas Mitchum a poor researcher at Tulane and Barbara Beaurevel Gardner a member of one of New Orleans' oldest finest and poorest families are in love but Barbara is always meeting him in secret. The reason is not exactly clear unless she worries for her social reputation but then again what is so awful about being a medical researcher? Or maybe it is because her family wants her to marry a rich suitor. Mark goes away on a research trip for two months and comes back with a wife. This cuts Barbara to the core. Mark appears to have done this on the rebound because he has no satisfactory explanation. The wife is a cold fish who apparently would dump Mark if she found a richer or more exciting option. So why these two are together is puzzling.Barbara wants to get Mark back and for some reason she thinks getting her grandmother's inheritance which has just been sitting around collecting dust for years is the way to do that. Again why? Mark apparently cares nothing for money. Maybe the best revenge is living well? But I digress. Barbara with no more than her startling physical similarity to her grandmother successfully collects her 900K inheritance from the trustee. But there is a catch. Grandma was a notorious woman. Grandma married a gambler who left her and their child for parts unknown. The insinuation is that Grandma became a prostitute or madame in New Orleans in order to get by. Like that has never happened before??? Oh the horror! So Barbara must keep her heritage and the source of her new found wealth a secret. And strangely nobody outside of the family ever asks where the money came from.Barbara does think she has found a way to get Mark back and strangely enough it does require cash. But then her plan unexpectedly turns to tragedy. I'll let you watch and find out how this plays out. I'd recommend this. I'd actually rate this at 6.5 if possible. Sure the script is moth eaten and the production code prevents the spelling out of the details of the original story Carriage but Ava Gardner commands your attention as a woman scorned. It seems hard to believe but she MUST have been scorned at one time to get the facial expressions down so pat. Melvyn Douglas injects some of his trademark wit into his largely despicable character so that he is more than just a two dimensional clich.";

Seventy minutes makes for a fairly sketchy story which My Forbidden Past certainly is. It's the story of a young woman Barbara Beaurevel Gardner in love with a doctor Mark Lucas Mitchum who goes to South America for two months. He wants her to come along and be married on the ship but her cousin Paul Douglas keeps her from doing so and never delivers the letter to Mark that says she'll wait for him. When he comes home he has a wife Janis Carter.Having inherited a huge amount of money from her scandalous grandmother I'm guessing she ran a gambling establishment and was maybe a prostitute Barbara offers Paul 50000 if he can seduce Mark's opportunistic wife.I have to admit that I wasn't interested in any of these characters. Ava is beautiful and that's about it. Hughes apparently borrowed Ava Gardner for this film. She wrote in her autobiography that he was always after her and gave her an expensive ring. She threw it out the window only to regret it later on when she had no money. I'd say this film evens things out. Robert Mitchum didn't seem terribly interested to me he sort of meanders through. Janis Carter is very good  beautiful and feisty. For some reason her energy doesn't seem out of place but Melvyn Douglas' does. I think he knew it was a bad script and just went for it full out where Carter was still trying to build her reputation as an actress.Disappointing.".

He goes as far as keeping Gardner's doctor lover Robert Mitchum from receiving a goodbye letter she wrote to him and he leaves New Orleans only to return years later with a beautiful wife Janis Carter who is quickly seduced by Douglas. The scandal leads to murder with Mitchum accused of the crime and a shocking revelation in court which threatens to destroy many lives.Unfolding in just over 70 minutes My Forbidden Past is certainly not a classic but is definitely enjoyable. It's lavish trash made on a medium budget and never gives the audience time to become bored. There's a great costume ball where Mitchum and Carter are presented to New Orleans society where Douglas's nefarious means to an end are revealed and where Gardner's determination to win back her former lover becomes her one and only goal. Then there's her visit to her grandmother's grave the shock of a young boy as he realizes why she is there and Watson's reaction to the scandal which would bring her great personal humiliation. Watson's grand dame character is both imperious and understanding but the understanding part of her could never survive the scandal that her old world moralities has desperately tried to keep hidden. The plot twist which leads Mitchum to being accused of criminal intent is presented pretty violently and the final courtroom scene is almost identical in revelations to the ending of Lady For a Night.While this will get a mixed reaction from classic film fans you can't deny the chemistry between Gardner and Mitchum the irony of 30's hero Douglas being so despicable here and the lavishness of the sets costumes and early twentieth century society where the old south strived to remain intact even though the world and history had greatly altered the way that life back in the land of cotton had moved forward since the end of the civil war some 35 years before.".

To do this the Peasants are tricked into helping them with the promise that they will receive a large share of the gold when the destination is reached.

I was most surprised at the amount of comic relief present in the movie. When watching a Kurosawa film I always expect it to be a serious affair so the comedy in this movie made for a surprise which was on the whole a good surprise as like most things in Kurosawa's films it works. The film has become most famous recently for the many parallels that it has with the masterpiece 'Star Wars' and it has become well documented that this film was a major influence on said movie which is shown most clearly by the fact that a lot of the story is shown through the eyes of two bumbling people that aren't all that relevant to the central plot and the style of editing which George Lucas adopted many times in his epic trilogy.The plot follows a princess who must be escorted across enemy lines by her general. Two greedy peasants join the escort on the promise of a reward of gold. Like Star Wars the plot here is relatively simple and it's the way that the story is portrayed not the story itself that makes this movie great. Despite it's simplicity Kurosawa gives it the style of an epic and it really feels like one. Kurosawa regular Toshir Mifune heads a great ensemble cast all of which do well in their roles. Kurosawa had a great talent for pulling great performances out of everyone in his films and he shows that talent excellently here. The cinematography is excellent and the master director has managed to capture some truly stunning landscapes which serve in adding beauty to the picture. This film is of course in black and white and that is Kurosawa at his best in my opinion. While I loved 'Ran' and it's vibrant colours black and white allows Kurosawa to blend atmosphere into his films and they're always the better for it. On the whole Kurosawa is a genius  and this is one of his best films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hidden Fortress is the Kurosawa film with the lightest tone. It's almost the most mainstream and entertaining. So for those who may have found other Kurosawa films to be too deep and poetic if this applies to you you're a fool you'll be more likely to enjoy this. Even though there's a lot of comedy mostly provided by the peasants The Hidden Fortress still has all the power and uniqueness that all Kurosawa films have.There are some amazing locations used. The rock slide provided for some real amusement. Toshiro Mifune gives a much more toned down and subtle performance than we normally see from him. What Mifune offers in Hidden Fortress is true screen presence. Without even saying a word he has your full attention. I love how Kurosawa plays the characters as well. The Princess is not a damsel in distress. In any American or British film of the 50s she would have been nothing more than that. In this she's quiet for most of the movie but then she'll come out of nowhere and show more power and confidence than The General. The peasant characters of Tahei and Matakishi are more than comic relief. They are primarily used for a laugh but I thought there characters were unique as well. The story is told from their point of view and they are essentially heroes yet they do nothing but complain. They're greedy and selfish. These aren't characteristics that would normally be used for heroes but Kurosawa makes them likeable to the audience. Some people have said this movie needed more action. I think the action it has is more than enough. The chase scene that leads into The General's encounter with his nemesis remains one of the best sequences Kurosawa ever Directed. The choreography in the swordfight holds up against most of The Seven Samurai's fight scenes and it still tops the type of fights that have become tedious and repetitive in modern day movies. That fight is a great example of how to nail the Hero vs. Villain energy. Akira Kurosawa can do no wrong.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Hidden Fortress is the Kurosawa film with the lightest tone. It's almost the most mainstream and entertaining. So for those who may have found other Kurosawa films to be too deep and poetic if this applies to you you're a fool you'll be more likely to enjoy this. Even though there's a lot of comedy mostly provided by the peasants The Hidden Fortress still has all the power and uniqueness that all Kurosawa films have.There are some amazing locations used. The rock slide provided for some real amusement. Toshiro Mifune gives a much more toned down and subtle performance than we normally see from him. What Mifune offers in Hidden Fortress is true screen presence. Without even saying a word he has your full attention. I love how Kurosawa plays the characters as well. The Princess is not a damsel in distress. In any American or British film of the 50s she would have been nothing more than that. In this she's quiet for most of the movie but then she'll come out of nowhere and show more power and confidence than The General.

	schema:reviewBody "Any Kurosawa film is worth watching but the focus of interest shifts from project to project. This time around his concern is the new aspect ratio of 'cinemascope' copied and renamed by Toho. Kurosawa is first a visual storyteller who scripts in pictures each one dramatically framed. All his life until here that frame was the same but all of a sudden it changed.It is a matter of there being three territories where there was formally one. The new territories are on the left and right which in the original cinerama were actually two additional cameras. One really needs to study his framing in the old format to understand how significant this challenge was. He was master  indeed largely the creator  of a visual grammar and the rules had changed.As with all his scripts the story reflects his own challenges. So we have a story about three territories and a journey that spans them all. The 'middle' territory is under attack and our characters must leave their fortress and go all the way from left to right to survive. Notice the symbols he uses for these three klans. The two hapless peasants represent to the story what actors represent to the 'real' enterprise of filmmaking relatively ignorant goldchasers likely to turn on each other and liable to go where they are not supposed to. The story is told from their perspective. The gold in the story is hidden in sticks. The gold in the film is hidden in similar harvesting of nature by the eye.Mifune's pride and Kurosawa's control were much like that shown here between Mifune's samurai and the peasants. Mifune would eventually run away from Kurosawa's  probably much needed  overbearing command. Mifune would end up wealthy and celebrated in Japan. Kurosawa not so.At the end of the story the peasantactors are on a grand stair that mirrors a similar stair we saw earlier which was the scene of a huge conflict in turn mirroring the battle on Eisenstein's Odessa steps in 'Potemkin'. But this second time we are at peace the frame is serene. Kurosawa has wrestled this new eye and mastered it. Kurosawa did not respond to the wide format like his American peers who preferred awesome panoramas. His approach to framing had always been layered usually three layers of activity in fore middle and background. Here he was able to relax the axis so that the layers did not have be so much on top of one another. And he reinvented his strategy of panning of motion compare a running sequence here to the famous woodcutter's running in the beginning of 'Rashomon.' Look at how he panned the General's attack on horseback. He still does diagonals but fewer less steep and with less static import. He now has more natural horizontals in his greytonegreystone arrangements so has to create more artificial verticals.Obligatory Star Wars commentI am sure Lucas' film school professors would have explained the relationship of story and visual challenge this way. So that is the real template Lucas took in conceiving his project. His goal was a similar marriage of the visual space with story Joseph Campbell inspired myth. His hidden gold is that miraculous alchemical element in Jedi blood.".

The peasants bear a striking resemblance to Vladimir and Estragon in their infighting negotiable affection for each other and their seeming inability to make any real progress toward any goal whatsoever. They are truly a venal pair loveable only in their humanity and humor. I saw The Hidden Fortress on the Criterion DVD. Beautiful print but no commentary outside of a brief interview with George Lucas distancing himself from the film's alleged influence on Star Wars. It would have been nice to hear interviews with surviving cast and crew or a knowledgeable historian. Criterion also made a terrible choice in not translating more of the credits. Only Kurosawa and Mifuni had the honor of an English translation. Surely Misa Uehara Minoru Chaiki and Kamatari Fujiwara deserve to have their names known to we who lack basic Japanese. The Princess and the peasants help make this movie what it is. I gripe too much though. Without Criterion and NetflixI would not have been able to see this movie at all.Again The Hidden Fortress is a great movie that also happens to be great fun. Highly recommended".

	schema:reviewBody "Set during the Sengoku period 1460s1600s Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress stars Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara as Tahei and Matashichi a pair of squabbling peasants. The duo roam the Japanese countryside doing their best to avoid bands of marauding soldiers.Hidden's first act watches as Tahei and Matashichi are manipulated by Rokurota Makabe Toshiro Mifune a cunning samurai general. Promising the greedy peasants mountains of gold he uses them as camouflage in his attempts to transport a princess Misa Uehara across enemy lines.What you make of another's kindness is up to you Kurosawa has character's say. Kindness is something the film's princess learns as she witnesses firsthand the sacrifices of her bodyguard General Makabe and the suffering of the peasants who live outside her castle walls. Kindness is also something General Rokurota must grapple with. He's a rival warrior with whom General Makabe fights an extended battle. During this battle Makabe's objective is not to kill but to frustrate to deflect to guide his belligerent opponent away from a fixation upon military solutions.The Hidden Fortress is one of Kurosawa's more playful films. Part comedy part adventure part action epic the film boasts glorious widescreen photography a jaunty plot some fine compositional work and the shortest short shorts ever worn by a princess. Aesthetically the film's the bridge between Eisenstein Ford and later imitators like Lucas and Leone. Indeed George Lucas would lift chunks of Hidden Fortress for the plot of his Star Wars especially Kurosawa's notion of a tough imperious princess.Though a bit longwinded a number of Kurosawa's action sequences still pack a punch. One sequence in particular recalls Eisenstein's Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin. Elsewhere Kurosawa stages a sequence in which General Makabe  cool tough and resourceful  pursues enemy scouts all the way back to their base a scene which would influence the speeder bike chase in George Lucas' Return of the Jedi. Lucas would help a financiallystrapped Kurosawa get his 1980 film The Shadow Warrior produced. Indeed Lucas would be indirectly responsible for two of Kurosawa's greatest epics The Shadow Warrior and Ran. Every good apprentice lends their master a helping hand.810  See Throne of Blood and Twilight Samurai.".

Summarizing it is a perfect movie with fantastic locations and costumes and magnificent choreography of fights. I intended to use the saying Hide stones among stones men among men said by Makabe to the peasants as the title of my review but I noted that another IMDb user had the same idea. I read on the cover of the DVD that George Lucas inspired his franchising Star Wars in this movie. This was the first time that I watched Kakushi toride no san akunin which was unknown for me and I really recommend it to any audience.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure that it is helpful knowing that George Lucas found inspiration for his Star Wars' films in Kurosawa's historical epic The Hidden Fortress' 1958. Oh there are a number of matters of content that seem quite similar. Though Kurosawa's story takes place in sixteenth century Japan and Lucas sets his in space in the future the basic struggles are the samethe restoration of power to a princess and her clan. Some would compare Toshiro Mifune's General Rokurota Makabe to Harrison Ford's Hans Solo in Star Wars' 1977 though there may be more  commonality shared with Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker. And the two peasant farmers pawns in the turmoil of sixteenth century Japanese civil wars are easily identified as precursors of the Star Wars' droids R2D2 and C3PO.However when all is said and done the comparisons are only superficial. It may be more constructive to note some aspects of humor and character that are utilized in general. Kurosawa has always been willing to develop exaggerated characters. The peasant farmers with their quick shifts between cowardice bickering  and thievery are good examples of this. Certainly the first two of these traits were incorporated in the character of C3PO the mechanical humanoid but R2D2 shows none of these characteristics. There is however an overall sense of humor that permeates both The Hidden Fortress' and the Star Wars' filmsas well as a strong sense of nobility in the central characters Rokurota and Skywalker.That said The Hidden Fortress' seems to me to have clearly been made by a superior filmmaker. Both are good at telling the story. The Star Wars' films rely heavily on special effects to the extent I think that these are the central features of the films. The Hidden Fortress' while a relatively light weight work for Kurosawa involves much more subtle character development achieved by means of acting skill revealed through visual composition and unenhanced camera work.This was Kurosawa's first use of Tohoscope a Japanese widescreen process. And he uses the screen frequently to develop character. Over and over again he uses the wide screen to develop and reveal character. The peasant farmers are certainly more complex than the droids though they are simplistically exaggerated. Kurosawa chose to explore the situation of these piteous beings buffeted about in the feudal wars of sixteenth century Japan in visually reinforced  wide screen long shots in those final scenes on the plains.The code of the samurai is central to an understanding of The Seven Samurai' 1954 Yojimbo' 1961 and Sanjuro' 1962 and even Rashomon' 1954. These are all great films centered around the samurai class in Japan's past. From the ninth century samurai warriors followed a strict code of ethical behavior known as bushido' which remained orally transmitted for generations. Briefly it is a way of life in which the warrior's honor and purpose are tied closely to the needs of his master. In this respect he was to be selfless. His was not to understand or concern himself with politicsonly to defend with honor the family or clan he served. For such a man the ideal was to be without fearto always move forward in his employer's interestwithout fear of deathonly fear of dishonor. Toshiro Mifune's character in The Hidden Fortress' is a military general but his devotion to the creed and to his princess can be explained relative to this code. His daring too extends from that. So too his reputation reflects  that of an accomplished samurai. An especially strong scene in this regard is the duel scene in which Rokurota's skill and bravery are what are prized and respected by his opponent.Above all The Hidden Fortress remains a great adventure permeated with humor and nobility. While the force in the Star Wars' sense is never mentioned it remains a tacit part of  Rokurota's nobility.".

The most interesting thinks to look for are the similarities to Sergio Leone films  A man who obviously was greatly influenced by Kurosawa.  What Leone may not have known is that those long shots of unmoving fighting men waiting to make a thrust or cut with a sword is very true to the actual way that Samurai fought.  Cowboys on the other hand generally shot from behind trees and rocks.  For an interesting comparison watch Hidden Fortress followed by The Good The Bad And the Ugly.

I've already watched this movie 6 times Star Wars 3. I just can't recommend it enough. Hidden Fortress  Rashomon are 2 of my favorite KurasawaMifune collaborations. Rent them both  have fun!".

The story though was hard to get and the characters unsually for Kurosawa rather stereotypes than human beings. Especially the stupid and greedy peasants got on my nerves after a while acting like clownchildren all the time without any character development. Mifune is great as incarnation of manliness though and the androgyn princess is also an interesting figure kind of Japanese styled hunt goddess Diana sweet and small on the one hand rude and imperious on the other. Could have been a great movie since it has everything Kurosawa usually needs to develop his great psychological character studies... I missed something like the great monologue of Mifune in the Seven Samurai where he is first mocking the farmers for their ridiculousness but then turning his speech into a stirring accusation against the class of the Samurai that suppressed the formerly free farmers and made them what they are small weak and afraid all the time....Hidden Fortres instead with its all time noble strong and good Mifune as opposed to the all time greedy weak and unloyal farmers seems to give rather a reason for mastery of the one over the other since it does not try to explain its characters.As key scene however the fire dance with its song a man's life goes with the firea worm's life drops into the flamesis so electrifying and has such a tense atmosphere that it alone compensates for the rather conservative plot development....".

You have the forerunners of R2D2 and C3PO in the form of two greedy slaves who attempt to escape from a conquered province.  Along the way they meet a military general who is trying to smuggle the defeated princess out of the province and into safety.  Sound familiar?I think part of the film's greatness is the excitement that it builds up without the typical fight scenes.  In fact there are only 2 fights that I can remember but nevertheless they are fantastic.  The tension comes from whether or not our heroes will be captured by the villainous army.  And they come so close it makes your pulse rise and your heart beat faster. In addition the John Fordtype cinemetography excentuating the landscape is beautiful.  As in all Kurosawa films nature becomes a character in itself as important as the actors.  Probably the best part of the movie though is the honor that these warriors possess.  They are governed by codes of conduct that Americans haven't seen in YEARS.  It's a nice change to see two great generals fight to the death with the loser being spared.  And he gets angry about living!!!  I only wish there were more movies like this one.".

THE HIDDEN FORTRESS is certainly that it's a humourfilled adventure filled with action and spectacle. It's also one of my less favourite Kurosawa movies.I like darkness. I like dark violent movies that explore the depths of the human soul. Comedy has never really appealed me to me  my tastes in humour are very subjective  and this film has a lot of comedy. In fact pretty much every scene featuring the two cowardly peasants is played for laughs and their appeal quickly wears thin. I began looking forward to the few moments they weren't around and dreading their return to the fray.Still the rest of the story is a lot of fun. Toshiro Mifune enjoys himself in a lighter role for a change and gets to take part in some forthetime spectacular action scenes his duel with a rival general is particularly engaging. The scenestealer of the piece is Misa Uehara playing a princess who disguises herself as a mute for much of the production. Uehara is exceptional when given the opportunity to throw off the shackles surrounding the roles usually given to women in historical dramas and an intriguing forerunner to the later femme fatales who would populate Japanese samurai cinema come the 1970s.The story involving the transportation of some gold across enemy country is solid but the plot does take a great deal of time to get moving. I wasn't very involved for the exceptionally longwinded introduction but things get a lot better in the second half when the genuine threat of discovery and death adds suspense to keep things moving along nicely. THE HIDDEN FORTRESS may not be an example of Kurosawa at his most profound but it's a fine example of the director at work in a different nonserious genre for a change.".

	schema:reviewBody "It might not quite compare with Kurosawa's greatest movies but The Hidden Fortress is good entertainment with an interesting story and characters. Toshiro Mifune is enjoyable to watch as always and although most of the story is played for action andor humor it does have a couple of powerful scenes as well.  The story of a defeated general trying to lead his princess past the enemy to safety is given plenty of twists and turns that give all of the characters some good moments.Along with all of the action there are some pretty good characters with Mifune as the general a big part of holding everything together in his interactions with all of the others.  The rather spoiled princess learns quite a bit about life and the two greedy farmers learn  and often quickly forget  some lessons of their own.  There are also some good scenes with an enemy general.  Most of it works well and it's an entertaining movie.".

This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune  being an international breakthrough one . Steeped in japanese style and transports us to Medieval Japan and the world of Samurai . The impressive flick blends drama  humor  violent fights  emotion  slaughters with high bodycount and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking .The film confirmed Kurosawa's greatest strength and his innovative handling of genre . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right  as the impact of the action and combats on this trailblazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged swordplays occur on and off throughout the plot . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a general Samuri who attempts to protect and save his princess. This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune . Kurosawa's treatment is in part eclectic  there are reminiscences of Nicholas Ray's Johnny Guitar  John Ford Westerns  Serguei M Eisenstein's Potenkim 1925 and part truly idiosyncratic as the Shakespearean relations between heroes and clowns . Akira also uses a traditional style including the concept  symbols  plotting and utilization of Noh theatre music .

	schema:headline " Nowhere near Kurosawa's best actioner despite Mifune's fine job";
	schema:reviewBody "Frankly I'm baffled by other reviewers who have given Hidden Fortress such high praise.  As a longtime fan of Kurosawa I do not believe that Hidden Fortress should even be mentioned in the same breath as The Seven Samurai Throne of Blood or Yojimbo.  Indeed other than Mifune's stalwart performance there is little beyond the cinematography to reveal this as a Kurosawa film at all.  The film's structure is not the trouble it is a fairly standard action plot revolving around warring clans and defeated soldiers trying to make their way out of enemy territory.  As mentioned the look of the film is typically Kurosawan with dramatic settings adventurous camera angles and dramatic vistas.  No the problems with Hidden Fortress are with the supporting characters and the plot devices.  That and the fact that it is at least 30 minutes too long.First the characters.  Ostensibly the film's main characters are not Mifune but Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara playing a couple of ignoble peasants who sold their homes to buy weapons and went to war to make their fortunes.  Now defeated they are trying to make their way home while endlessly bickering with each other.  For a parallel with their performances look no further than Lou Costello of Abbott  Costello and Curly from the Three Stooges.  Witless shrieking when excited or afraid and as broadly played as would fit on the screen.  The other irritant is the character of the princess who is played with mindnumbing amplitude by Misa Uehara.  She seems unable to deliver a line of dialog with any subtlety or grace instead preferring to stomp and flounce shouting her lines like an amateur Katherine Hepburn turned up to 11.  It is perhaps of little surprise that her acting career spanned just three years.The other main problem is in the plot devices. MINOR SPOILER ALERT I lost count of how many times the good guys led by Toshiro Mifune escaped from impossible situations.  The most egregious were when they were pursued in the forest by the enemy soldiers.  Each of the men were supposedly carrying 200 to 300 pounds of gold on their backs over mountainous terrain but they were able to escape from soldiers just a few hundred feet behind them.  Despite the hundreds of shots fired at them at close range and bullets splintering the trees all around them none of the main party were shot.  That brings up another point this is set during the Muromachi period when the state of the art in weaponry were smoothbore flintlock muskets which took at least a few minutes to reload yet the volleys come thick and fast from relatively few soldiers and with amazing accuracy and range although not accurate enough to hit any of the 4 main characters!  Also the princess could not stand out more from her surroundings if she were painted pink.  With her bizarrely shaped eyebrows shortshorts and skimpy shirt she hardly was likely to blend into the crowd as they tried to make their way incognito across enemy territory.  Why not put her in a hat and peasant's clothing?  As for the supposed Star Wars connectionI find it tenuous at best.  The stupid greedy and untrustworthy pair of sidekicks little resemble R2D2 or C3PO whose worst flaws were fear and occasional distrust.  None of the other three main male characters resemble the three male leads from the original Star Wars film.  A far more accurate comparison would be between Hidden Fortress and Hayao Miyazaki's MononokeHime whose princess seems to have been lifted directly from Hidden Fortress.  Kurosawa made so many great films it is a shame to see so much unworthy praise heaped on a film thatlacking Mifune's presence and Kurosawa's name would be regarded as a generic adventure flick.".

Indeed other than Mifune's stalwart performance there is little beyond the cinematography to reveal this as a Kurosawa film at all.  The film's structure is not the trouble it is a fairly standard action plot revolving around warring clans and defeated soldiers trying to make their way out of enemy territory.  As mentioned the look of the film is typically Kurosawan with dramatic settings adventurous camera angles and dramatic vistas.  No the problems with Hidden Fortress are with the supporting characters and the plot devices.  That and the fact that it is at least 30 minutes too long.First the characters.  Ostensibly the film's main characters are not Mifune but Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara playing a couple of ignoble peasants who sold their homes to buy weapons and went to war to make their fortunes.  Now defeated they are trying to make their way home while endlessly bickering with each other.  For a parallel with their performances look no further than Lou Costello of Abbott  Costello and Curly from the Three Stooges.  Witless shrieking when excited or afraid and as broadly played as would fit on the screen.  The other irritant is the character of the princess who is played with mindnumbing amplitude by Misa Uehara.  She seems unable to deliver a line of dialog with any subtlety or grace instead preferring to stomp and flounce shouting her lines like an amateur Katherine Hepburn turned up to 11.  It is perhaps of little surprise that her acting career spanned just three years.The other main problem is in the plot devices. MINOR SPOILER ALERT I lost count of how many times the good guys led by Toshiro Mifune escaped from impossible situations.  The most egregious were when they were pursued in the forest by the enemy soldiers.  Each of the men were supposedly carrying 200 to 300 pounds of gold on their backs over mountainous terrain but they were able to escape from soldiers just a few hundred feet behind them.  Despite the hundreds of shots fired at them at close range and bullets splintering the trees all around them none of the main party were shot.  That brings up another point this is set during the Muromachi period when the state of the art in weaponry were smoothbore flintlock muskets which took at least a few minutes to reload yet the volleys come thick and fast from relatively few soldiers and with amazing accuracy and range although not accurate enough to hit any of the 4 main characters!  Also the princess could not stand out more from her surroundings if she were painted pink.  With her bizarrely shaped eyebrows shortshorts and skimpy shirt she hardly was likely to blend into the crowd as they tried to make their way incognito across enemy territory.  Why not put her in a hat and peasant's clothing?  As for the supposed Star Wars connectionI find it tenuous at best.  The stupid greedy and untrustworthy pair of sidekicks little resemble R2D2 or C3PO whose worst flaws were fear and occasional distrust.  None of the other three main male characters resemble the three male leads from the original Star Wars film.  A far more accurate comparison would be between Hidden Fortress and Hayao Miyazaki's MononokeHime whose princess seems to have been lifted directly from Hidden Fortress.  Kurosawa made so many great films it is a shame to see so much unworthy praise heaped on a film thatlacking Mifune's presence and Kurosawa's name would be regarded as a generic adventure flick.";

I know this because I used to study and teach Soviet combat tactics. And the incident at the beginning of the movie would not have been something that could just be hushed up.

	schema:reviewBody "It troubles me to see how many low votes and negative comments that Iron Eagle II has received. I think it is an entertaining film that has a good mix of action drama and even a few laughs. It really bothers me that the movie is among the worst 100 movies as voted by the users of this site especially when I didn't see either Aces Iron Eagle III or Iron Eagle IV on that list. I don't really mind the third installment of the series although it doesn't have the same feel as the previous two. However the fourth in the series should never have been made because of its poor plot and cheap budget. Maybe there aren't enough people that have seen this movie to even vote on it but believe me it makes Iron Eagle II look Oscarworthy by comparison.I also don't like the fact that the Iron Eagle films are remembered as Top Gun ripoffs either because the first part preceded the Tom Cruise blockbuster. People complain that the MIGs in the film are actually F4 Phantoms but what is often overlooked is that the MIGs in Top Gun are actually F5 Tigers which have been used as enemy trainers in the actual Navy program.With that being said I do have to say that there are some flaws with the movie that do bother me slightly. My biggest problem with the whole thing like several others have noted is that they kill the hero of the first film Doug Masters in the opening sequence of Iron Eagle II. Like another user said he barely gets to put up a fight before he gets shot down. Since he became a fullfledged Air Force pilot I'm not sure why the filmmakers couldn't have used the character for the mission later in the film. It would have been better to blow away his wingman Cooper whom the audience wouldn't have gotten a chance to know. Also I'm still a little unsure of whether he was killed by the Soviet missile or if his plane had a malfunction after his hot dog maneuvers. The biggest slap in the face really is that the actor that played Doug Jason Gedrick wasn't even credited for his role. He definitely was the hero of the first film not Lou Gossett's Chappy character but maybe he wanted to try something different as an actor.There are basically two other problems I've noted. The first is that they don't ever name the Middle Eastern country that poses the nuclear threat although they don't name the enemy nation in Iron Eagle either. The makers of the films probably don't wish to cause controversy by doing so is my guess. The other problem is that it is very unlikely that there would ever be a joint U.S.Soviet Union mission especially in 1988 during the end of the Cold War era. That's not an irritating problem though. It's actually an intriguing concept although not necessarily original.Regardless of the film's flaws which no movie is exempt from Iron Eagle II is far better than the votes and comments it has received. It certainly is worth at least one viewing anyways. If anything watch it for the sheer beauty of the dogfights and because Lou Gossett Jr. is a good actor and Chappy is one of his best characters alongside Fiddler in Roots and his drill instructor character from An Officer and a Gentleman.".

Another one of those many films made in the 1980s to capitalize off the fear of the Cold War. The direction is mediocre and the screenplay is sophomoric. With that said some of the flying sequences are welldone and Gossett's performance is not bad at all. However he does look a lot more impressive with subpar players around him. Never really wins its wings by the time it tries to fly. 2.5 out of 5 stars.".

In an attempt to tell a more serious or adult story Furie reject everything about the first film that made it work. Instead he chose to take all the fun out of the film with in the first few minutes of the picture. The first film was more of a Teen movie it stood out because of that fact. It was fun and energetic but this one is dry and slow. As a stand alone film it's sort of boring. As part of the Iron Eagle franchise it's down right depressing. First it's about the US and Russia teaming up on a mission to stop some terrorist from launching a nuclear bomb but it never really is clear why one or the other can't just take on the mission by themselves. The characters seem either cardboard flat or outright dumb. The biggest mistake they make is the under use of Louis Gossett Jr. His character doesn't seem to really have a place except standing around and barking orders. He never seems to have the same energy as he did in the first film. The ending was fine if not reminiscent of Star Wars. The contrived Love story didn't work at all for me it felt like they were again trying to take the story into more adult territory and in that lost the point of what makes the first one so good...".

In this sequel to Iron Eagle the young pilot from the first film is tragically shot down likely by Middle Eastern antagonists. Colonel Chappy Sinclair is back on active duty and this time he's been selected to train a group of young pilots with a twist this time joining his group of American pilots is a group of jet pilots from the Soviet Union. In the era of Gorbachev's Perestroika this is a pilotpilot program if you will. It's Chappy's job to whip all these rookies into shape they're all somewhere between sullen and cocky but then the terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula threaten to start using biological warfare on key targets in America and the Soviet Union so it's up to Chappy and his relatively green crew to stop them! The first IRON EAGLE was a profitable film likely in the aftermath of the TOP GUN. Cruise never followed up his film with a sequel so its just as well that this movie did. The filmmakers definitely threw a curveball in making Chappy the main character this time. But Gossett is such an engaging actor he manages to elevate the Bplot and dialogue at least a few notches higher than it would normally be. The action sequences on the battlefields are very good and believable though apparently some stock footage was used. The supporting actors hold up well especially Clark Johnson who may remind viewers of Will Smith's performance in Independence Day. There's some unnecessary tacit romance between a male American pilot and a Soviet female but the film wisely avoids any blatant mush and keeps it strictly about the action.Definitely an enjoyable renter but try to find at a discount to buy.".

Col. Sinclair almost retorts at the idea to get back to classic dogfights in the air but slowly accepts the mission. And like the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers this mission involves rivalry..but on an international scale. A joint mission. A combined squadron of several American fighter pilots and Soviet Union fighter pilots with the help of the Soviet premier is told that a renegade Middle Eastern country which is like Bilyad fictionally made in the first Iron Eagle is making things even worse for world peace that both of these countries are trying to make.The fighter pilots who are called to this mission are warned that this country had already built a nuclear weapon facility in a remote desert near the Caviar Gorge. The facility's personnel had made this facility like an impenetrable fortress with 50millimeter automatic antiaircraft cannons and a surfacetoair missile canopy with a nearby building compound that houses the guidance system for the surfacetoair missiles.The facility's personnel is determined to launch its intercontinental ballistic missiles from this facility and target missiles at both the USSR and the USA if they perceive even the slightest of military threats.I like the part when Col. Sinclair figures out with the help of the Soviet officer in charge of the Soviet fighter pilots how to take out the antiaircraft defenses around the facility and how the fighters would have to fire Maverick missiles right into the ventilation shafts Sinclair calls them ducts which are protected by cannons that lead directly to the facility to ensure its explosive destruction of it.My favorite quotes in the movie was What is point zebra?...Enemy air space...the point of no return!".

Being blunt I chalk up IEII as another shining example of poor cashin sequels. The first Iron Eagle wasn't a blockbuster but it was mildly well received and this sequel feels like a money grab. A real disservice to the original.Anyhow the second of the sequels finds Gossett putting together a bunch of virtually unknown Canadian actors. Some who play Americans and some who play Russians.

I guess the producers of this movie figured they could write a movie with airplanes in it name it Iron Eagle and it would be another sleeper hit. Those idiots could not have been more wrong.I was excited when I heard about this movie and eagerly tuned in to watch when lo and behold you see the hero from the first Iron Eagle Jason Gedrick get KILLED in the first 5 minutes! Then you think well maybe he's still alive after all in the first movie you thought Lou Gossett Jr's character was killed and yet he turns up alive and well at the end! Alas the very next scene after you see Gedrick's plane explode they cut to a military guy saying No the kid's dead and buried... thus removing all doubt that the entire rest of the picture will be without him. I sat stunned for the next 10 minutes mouth agape missing several key plot points while I sat there thinking to myself They really killed him? That's it? You mean they really KILLED HIM?!?. Then that's when I started getting upset and hating this movie and everything about it....that clinched it....This movie continues to be the only movie I have ever walked out on...I watched up to the point where his fly buddy that is up there when he gets killed sits down with the Russians to plan the attack to take place later in the film and then I couldn't take it anymore...I never saw what happens next nor do I ever care to find out.....The reason Gedrick didn't make this movie is because he was busy making the Oscarwinning movie Rooftops note HUGE amount of sarcasm hereat the time it was made. Maybe if Gedrick actually starred in this movie all the way through instead of being deleted from it it could of had a slight chance of being a halfway decent film.Damn you stupid producers of this movie for making such vile filth  if I could exact an equally torturous punishment upon you it would be having you watch the Spanish language version of Rooftops with French subtitles in it's entirety six times back to back without a break.......".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by John Glen best known for his work on the James Bond series Iron Eagle III is a decent enough aviationactionBMovie.  Louis Gossett Jr.'s Chappy is back in action this time flying vintage World War Two aircraft instead of modern jet fighters.  It's a good change of scenery even if the German Me109 and Japanese Zero are actually American aircraft in disguise a P51 B stands in for the Me109 and a whitewashed Texan shemps it as a Zero.The plot is all to familiar A heroic group goes rogue to take on the drug cartel.  Except this time the cartel happens to be under the command of an ExNazi.  John Glen is a competent action director and makes the most out of what was no doubt a budget considerably smaller than the typical 007 film. The acting is mixed and we receive different levels of performance from the different actors. Gossett probably tuns in the best performance of the group.Fans of aviation movies will no doubt find at least some elements of the movie pleasing.  It does feature some beautiful aircraft most notably the British Spitfire and American P38 Lightning.  An authentic Me109 and Zero would have greatly added to the film but at least the Spitfire and Lightning are the real deal.  At one point the WWII planes take on some lower end jet fighters and some humor and nostalgia ensue. As one pilot in the movie likes saying technology is no match for seasoning.  It's a fun concept to see the propeller driven dogfighterswhich by the end of WWII were approaching their twilight as electronic warfare began to develop taking on that which made them obsolete and defeating them.Apart from Gossett there are a few recognizable actors in the film. Sonny Chiba plays the pilot of the Zero. Mitch Ryan of Dharma and Greg fame plays General Simms.  Tom Bower as DEA agent Crawford is also recognizable as you've probably seen him in bit roles in other movies.Second to Chappy the most featured character in the movie is Rachel McLish's Anna.  Her greatest asset is her physical presence on the screen. Her most remarkable scene is her first when she escapes from her chains muscles popping out everywhere.  Her dialogue isn't the best to work with and her delivery is adequate nothing more.  But that's not to say I didn't enjoy watching her.  After all this is an action movie not a drama.  The video cover box makes her out as Rambo with an X chromosome but her character is more vulnerable than that which I suppose is a good thing since it adds realism.All things considered Aces Iron Eagle III is an enjoyable Bgrade action movie.  The producers were wise to change the scene for this movie as Iron Eagle I and II featured F16's.  Iron Eagle III isn't perfect but at least it's not a complete rehashing of the first two moviesa commendable effort.".

The video cover box makes her out as Rambo with an X chromosome but her character is more vulnerable than that which I suppose is a good thing since it adds realism.All things considered Aces Iron Eagle III is an enjoyable Bgrade action movie.  The producers were wise to change the scene for this movie as Iron Eagle I and II featured F16's.  Iron Eagle III isn't perfect but at least it's not a complete rehashing of the first two moviesa commendable effort.";

I like the idea of four different men from different countries coming together as one to fight on the same side. One huge flaw in this movie is the plot there's no way old WW2 fighters no matter how good they look could take on modern jet fighters...it could be done maybe if the modern fighters had no wings!Overall a good entertaining TopGun style movie if a little unrealistic.610".

	schema:reviewBody "The third entry to take off the runway Aces Iron Eagle III happened to be the only feature from the series not to have director  writer Sidney J. Furie involved and he was replaced by director John Glen who would be well known for his contributions to the 007 cycle. However Louis Gossett Jr. would return as everybody's favourite pilot Charles 'Chappy' Sinclair. Everything about this one is fairly farfetched lively and overthetop but for me it would have to be the most enjoyable of the series. Far better than the tepid last film. This bgrade effort plays out as if Top Gun met Rambo in a drug war but with a twist as the planes used here are vintage aircrafts manned by veteran fighter pilots of different cultures. America England Germany and Japan are teaming up to battle corruption in an American Air force base and a German drug lord played by Paul Freeman with venomous aplomb living it up in South America. Gossett Jr. seems to be having a good time in the role along with other actors Hortz Buchholz Sonny Chiba and Christopher Cazenove. The chemistry between the four simply crackles. Also bodybuilder Rachel McLish would appear for some flexing of her muscles and to kick some ass  doing her best impersonation of Rambo. There are some more recognisable faces turning up Fred Dalton Thompson Mitch Ryan Juan Fernandez Tom Bower J.E. Freeman and a comical turn by Phill Lewis. Streaming through it is a comicbook tone where it balances out its serious side honour and pride with some clowning humour witty exchanges aplenty and a wicked death here or there death by bell anyone. Again like the other films in the series it's slow to start off  characters gelling plans are being schemed and investigations are occurring but when it takes flight. It's time to go up against the odds. Director Glen comes to the stage constructing blistering action setpieces of genuine excitement which wouldn't be out of place in a Bond presentation and stellar airborne sequences  especially the cat mouse scenes with the oldschool planes up against the F16s. Maybe unbelievable but it gets the blood pumping along with Harry Manfredini's soaring music score. Senselessly clichd but fun action escapism.You want miracles. Why don't you call the pope.".

It shows the U.S. inside a ring. That's how it looks on an enlisted man's uniform. A colonel an officer would have just plain U.S. without the circle around it. Have a look at his boss's the general lapels. He has the correct ones.";

While the film is not exactly horrible it's fun and it has a nice pace and energy it's Sonny Chiba that really drew me in. In one of his few American film appearances Chiba turns in a performance that in some ways raised the bar a little that was then subsequently lowered very single time Rachel McLish opened her mouth. It was funny to watch her shot a gun as she tried to hold it like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone yet also sort of flinching too. If only she could of acted even a little she might of had a career as an action star but she flat out sucks! If she had any less emotion in her voice she might have been suspected of being a robot. Gossett Jr. tries his best to keep the film moving and for it's time and budget it worked alright. Overall it felt like a made for TV ripoff then a actual sequel.

Reluctant to concede to the fact Buffy soon learns that Merrick speaks the truth and so begins to take her new life seriously while trying to maintain the sense of normality her life had once been.

When I began watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV series and saw Joss Whedon's true vision for the story I realize he must have been furious at how the studio basically rewrote his script. If you are a Buffy fan and you have never seen the movie it is worthwhile from a historical standpoint to see all of the contrasts.The movie's Buffy played by Kristy Swanson is a tall large girl as opposed to Sarah Michelle Gellar's petite Buffy. In the movie Buffy's mother is a boozing socialite with little time or patience for Buffy and their family appears affluent as opposed to TV's allAmerican middleclass mom Joyce. Also in the movie all victims of vampires become vampires themselves and when vampires are staked they do not turn to dust as they do in the series but leave behind a pesky corpse. Of course the watcher who first tells Buffy of her calling is not the Giles of the series but regardless of that he does not have any of the characteristics of a watcher as we have come to know them on the series. Also the lead vampire played by Rutger Hauer is not the least bit scary. Instead he is more like a villain out of the equally campy Batman TV series.There is also no mention of vampires lacking a soul. There are a few moments in the movie though that have at least the ring of Whedon's brand of humor. What comes to my mind in that category is after Buffy has staked a large number of teen vampires that have invaded her high school dance the principal is going around putting detention slips on all of the staked teen vampires' corpses as punishment for disrupting the event. This seems very much like something principal Snyder of Sunnydale high school would have done.".

What comes to my mind in that category is after Buffy has staked a large number of teen vampires that have invaded her high school dance the principal is going around putting detention slips on all of the staked teen vampires' corpses as punishment for disrupting the event. This seems very much like something principal Snyder of Sunnydale high school would have done.";

No this is Time Capsule Cinema a voyage to the neon panoply of early 90's California in the self described Lite Age.Kristy Swanson is lovely as the wise cracking eponymous star nicely alternating between clinical sarcasm and tenderness in what is essentially a limited role. Donald Sutherland and Rutger Howard are hilarious as ancient figures who just happen to be hip to the slangy nature of late 20th century teen dialog. Luke Perry David Arquette and Hillary Swank far from her best role but my favorite film of hers! and a few others are fine as the assemblage of irreverent teenagers eye rolling to the max! A highlight of the film is Stephen Root playing the principal regaling Buffy with a cautionary tale of his experiences with LSD in the 60's...I was at a Doobie Brothers concert...Oh and by the way that's PEE WEE FREAKIN HERMAN as the fanged creep Lefty. Boy he got outta jail just soon enough. Paul Ruebens is phenomenal of course and it may be his presence that allows me to shamelessly enjoy the rest of the film through my rose colored glasses of guilty nostalgia!Too many serious films reek of Los Angeles you can almost taste the soy burgers and smog when they take place elsewhere. This makes it difficult to differentiate the cast of actors from the characters they are paid to represent. This film revels in LA's lack of charm and sophistication. I half expected an InNOut Burger commercial to pop up half way through. Not enough comedies are as unselfconscious as this one content to poke fun at themselves till the vampires come home!710 CAMPY FUN".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I have to say my review of this movie may be somewhat coloured by my adoration of the television series. Despite sharing a few superficial elements  a character called Buffy who slays vampires and who has a watcher  the two are quite distinctive even if Joss Whedon penned them both.Buffy here is very much played with a tongueincheek. It's Clueless meets Dracula. Buffy and her cohorts are shallower than an evaporated puddle and Buffy can only learn to grow up when heaped with the responsibility of being the Chosen One destined to slay vampires. The vampires in question are just people with white faces played up in quite a camp manner and bare little resemblance to the sharp wise smart vampires favored by both the TV series and other movies.There's no acting of any note and the plot is wetpaper thin. The direction isn't memorable... so what stops the movie getting a 0 or a 1? The humour. The movie is played for laughs taking a bit of a dig at pop culture and vampire lore. There's some great lines in it  particularly the kill him A LOT! line. Watch the coach at the basketball game for similar humour and there is an unforgettable vampire staking towards the movie end that's very amusing.The movie looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget adding to the camp tongueincheek parody feel and has none of the production values we'd see Whedon employ later on. What it does have is a sometimes very amusing line in black humour offset somewhat by an irritating need to follow the Clueless mould of teenagers which was admittedly the trend at the time. It's not an awfully bad movie but it's not really all that good. In the end it's a 5.510 from me.".

It is a definite spin on the vampire genre but neither cornball or excessively violent.. instead the movie plays it as a subtle comedy. The only truly hammy scene comes when Paul Reubens gets staked and then it was so deliberate I can't fault it but rather cherish it.Very sharp cinematography. One clear homage to Lost Boys. Scenes that I will never forget simply because they could never happen in real life thinking especially of Benny.Lastly Kristy Swanson definitely in fine athletic form with some of her own cartwheels and a clear transformation from valleygirl into someone who suddenly sees the big picture.".

I've always loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer The Movie and I just thought they were going to play the movie on TV but when it was a TV show I was shocked. But I was hooked.Onto the movie. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is about a dumb blonde bimbo who lives with her rich but neglectful parents in sunny L.A. and is the most popular girl in school with her snobby friends and basketball star boyfriend. But all that changes when Buffy finds out that she is the chosen one who is destined to kill the vampires. Donald Sutherland plays Merrick her watcher and trainer who is always in a trench coat and hat. When Buffy finally excepts her fate she starts to loose it all her friends her cheer leading activities her boyfriend and life in general. She is also risking her life every single night and can't tell anyone about her being a slayer because it might endanger their lives. But there is one man Luke Perry or as we know him to be Pike. He is just your typical stoner teen but when he meets Buffy and his best friend is turned into a vampire everything changes. He Merrick and Buffy team together to fight the forces of darkness and one armless Pee Wee Herman.This is just a fun movie. No it's Oscar material but it's just a good movie to watch for a good laugh. You have to admit the death of Pee Wee's character was just too hilarious. The acting come on! It's a teen flick and we've got a very young Hilary Swank. We all have to start somewhere. Just have fun and watch the series too! 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Just so we all know where I stand I have never watched a whole episode of Buffy and have only ever seen bits and bobs of a couple of episodes.  So my views here are not coloured one way or the other.  This is of course the original film that sees Buffy turn from highschool cheerleader into slayer. So any complaints that Buffy is portrayed as an air head are void  she's meant to undergo this transformation.The plot of this is essentially just that  Buffy is awakened to her destiny by Merrick and goes on to fight the lead vampire Lothos while dealing with the usual high school woes.  This was setup as a stand alone movie but is a good lead into the TV series that we all know and apparently love.  It's hard not to compare it to the TV series even though it's quite unfair.  But it just seems so cheap and unprofessional compared to the glossy series  although it does look cheap even when NOT compared to the series.  For the most part the effects are rubbish and the whole thing feels more like a sitcom rather than a film.The performances are roundly poor here.  Swanson is annoying as Buffy  I know that she has to be an airhead blonde who becomes the Slayer but her character is just so annoying in the way the LA school children can be Clueless etc.  If you get past this then she's actually quite good.  The rest of the cast throws up a lot of surprisingly wellknown faces although not all for the good.  Sutherland is OK as Merrick Buffy's tutor but really he's such a good actor that he can sleepwalk through stuff like this  it's a tad beneath him I think.  Perry is soso as Pike and does bring some comedy  but outside of the comedy he has nothing to do but his 90210 prettyboy role which is boring and irritating.  David Arquette is good as one of the vampires but Rutger Hauer......what can I say.  About 10 years after Blade Runner and he's doing this  actors beware never rest on you laurels of one great role!  Hauer is terrible as Lothos  he tries to be an upperclass suave vampire that uses seduction as a weapon but he doesn't convince at all.  His attempt at comedy is lame as well.  Of the rest of the cast the only other thing of interest is Ben Affleck popping up prefame as a basketball player.Overall this tries to be a goofy comedy and loses any sense of horror or tension that it could have had.  The whole thing feels cheap and the performances are average at best.  I've never seen the show but it's got to be better than this.".

For the most part the effects are rubbish and the whole thing feels more like a sitcom rather than a film.The performances are roundly poor here.  Swanson is annoying as Buffy  I know that she has to be an airhead blonde who becomes the Slayer but her character is just so annoying in the way the LA school children can be Clueless etc.  If you get past this then she's actually quite good.  The rest of the cast throws up a lot of surprisingly wellknown faces although not all for the good.  Sutherland is OK as Merrick Buffy's tutor but really he's such a good actor that he can sleepwalk through stuff like this  it's a tad beneath him I think.  Perry is soso as Pike and does bring some comedy  but outside of the comedy he has nothing to do but his 90210 prettyboy role which is boring and irritating.  David Arquette is good as one of the vampires but Rutger Hauer......what can I say.  About 10 years after Blade Runner and he's doing this  actors beware never rest on you laurels of one great role!  Hauer is terrible as Lothos  he tries to be an upperclass suave vampire that uses seduction as a weapon but he doesn't convince at all.  His attempt at comedy is lame as well.  Of the rest of the cast the only other thing of interest is Ben Affleck popping up prefame as a basketball player.Overall this tries to be a goofy comedy and loses any sense of horror or tension that it could have had.  The whole thing feels cheap and the performances are average at best.  I've never seen the show but it's got to be better than this.";

	schema:reviewBody "I graduated in 1976 from a high school in North Dallas and this entire movie is so spot on it's scary. It is my favorite film. I've seen it hundred's of times and every time it's like watching it for the first time. Only someone that was there and lived through those days could have directed such a movie. I drove a 70 dark blue Chevelle SS 454 with a 4speed over 400 HP and all of the goodies Wooderson described. Starting that car up listening to the roar of that engine and burning out in 1st gear while in a thick cloud of blue smoke in front of the high school at 3PM while wasted......doing over 80MPH in 2nd gear....oh yea! I feel sorry for the teenagers today that drive the limp wrist fluffs of metal that pass themselves off as cars these days. I was a stoner like Pickford smoking weed nonstop. Some mentioned that the heavy drug use was not too common. Well at our school it was beyond common. Before school during school in the bathroom and football field and after school. Our school had a smoking area outside the cafeteria where everyone went to light up. The opening scene with Aerosmith Sweet Emotion slowly building up and Pickford driving his Goat and girlfriend in the school parking lot kills me every time. I cannot imagine a better opening scene for the movie. That was pure genius. The funny thing is Linklater did not show getting licks from the coach or the principal. For all the uninitiated back then all a coach or an asst. principal had to say was Smith I want to see you back at my office now. Our coach had a paddle he personally made that he kept on his wall over his desk. It had about 30 holes drilled in it and it was covered in black electrical tape! When that one came down you knew it! Now with all the PC people coach would go to jail for assaulting the poor boy Hell back then it was called character building. As I remember from the 7th grade on licks were given out. The soundtrack. Best ever. Might as well be back at White Rock Lake or Lake Ray Hubbard on a Friday night getting wasted. Head East was a nice touch. Every time I listen to that soundtrack I remember things I have not thought about in 25 years. The man that portrayed Pickford's dad was dead on. Accent demeanor along with the big caddy and the tennis playing wife in the miniskirt and puffed up hair. Some of the reviewers mentioned they did not think it was too realistic showingmixing a lot of sexual activity among the freshman girls. That is another point I must dispute. Maybe at their school in their town of 500 or their strict upbringing but at our junior high and high school the freshman and younger girls were pretty wild. I mean really wild! This is coming from someone who lost it at 12. So insinuating things about a 15 or 16 year old freshman is pretty tame. 15 and 16 year old's were the world travelers to us 13 or 14 year old guys. There is something about this movie that pulls me back over and over again. It's hard to describe. I'm not sure what it is. Am I a Wooderson that enjoys reminiscing? Am I someone that prefers simpler times? Am I someone that is so sick of PC people that a movie like DC is like a breath of fresh air? Was there something magical in the air back in 1976? The country was celebrating 200 years of freedom. Now within the last 30 years it seems that most of those freedoms have been slowly whittled away with and all that is left is a former shell of the old. Especially after 2001. The best scene? To me it's a tossup between the opening Sweet Emotion GTO in the school parking lot and the Emporium scene with Hurricane playing in the background while The Past Wooderson The Present Pink and The Future Mitch walk into the Emporium while the camera films every little nuance in slow motion. The cockiness of Woods the mellow Pink and the innocence of Mitch. Put that scene on slow motion and study their faces and the reaction shots of their peer's faces as they acknowledge their presence.Your own personal time machine if only for an hour and a half. Slip the DVD in turn the lights down low take a couple good strong hits and wash them down with a few Tallboys. Use your imagination and for the briefest of time you are back in 1976. I wish they made more movies like this instead of the sugar coated pablum coming out of Hollywood nowadays.Remember this?Howard Hughes died Robin TrowerBridge of Sighs Jeff Beck Kawasaki Z1 Kawasaki 750 triple 2stroke 45 cents a gallon gas 104 octane gas Frampton Comes Alive Bad Company  Shooting Star Elvin Bishop  Fooled Around and Fell In Love Jimmy Carter Dirty Mary Crazy Larry 1969 Dodge Charger 440 2 Lane Blacktop 3 finger lids windowpane Diamond Dogs J.

	schema:reviewBody "Dazed and Confused which takes place during the 70s was one of the best movies of the 90s. It really is phenomenal how much talent was in this ensemble if you want to see Adam Goldberg Matthew Mcconaughey Milla Jovovich Joey Lauren Adams Parker Posey or an almost completely unrecognizable Ben Affleck playing the sort of role he would almost never play again an ahole before they were stars look no further. And of course this was an early movie for director Richard Linklater who had made the relatively unknown Slackers previously and who would go on to make School of Rock which was almost as good as Dazed and Confused.Taking place on the last day of school in a small suburban town Dazed and Confused is a brilliant ensemble piece rivaling anything done by Robert Altman that covers the broadest spectrum of teenagers imaginable. We see the nerds the potheads the jocks and the cheerleaders as well as the incoming freshmen as they celebrate the beginning of summer. Some celebrate less than others of course freshman hazing is a big part of the movie both male and female. The dialogue is fresh and unexpected lines about George Washington's proclivity for marijuana why you just gotta love high school girls I get older they stay the same age as McConaughey's character says and the herd mentality when a fight breaks out demonstrate how alloverthemap the dialogue can be and it's always affecting and usually quite funny. Of course it's the acting and the characters that really steal the movie and it really is amazing how many people in this movie went on to bigger things. As I said before Affleck was the most surprising but Mcconaughey had the most memorable role as an older dude who can't seem to let go of his youth a slick slimeball who chases after underage jail bait. And he has never been funnier or better than he was in this. Eventually his character will wake up and the kids aren't going to want to hang out with him and the girls aren't going to want to sleep with him anymore and he's going to have a rude awakening. But for the time being he's all macho cool swagger and Mcconaughey pulled off the part perfectly. Parker Posey is also excellent playing a senior bitch but only because she's supposed to be unleashing a humiliating hazing on the incoming freshman girls.You have to give props to the writing. It's not a long movie but it covers so much ground that it feels big. At one point a character says that the 70s obviously suck. That may have been but it's never looked cooler than it did in Dazed and Confused. And the soundtrack must be mentioned too. The 70s was a decade full of musical highs and lows and thankfully the soundtrack highlights the highs while ignoring the lows and we have songs by Aerosmith ZZ Top Dr. John War and other seminal 70s rock figures curiously missing Dazed and Confused by Led Zeppelin but that's forgivable. Brilliant there's not a single clunker and it adds to the free easygoing atmosphere of the movie. Dazed and Confused is quite possibly the best teen movie ever made and from the point of view of someone who grew up in the 80s anyway the best movie about the 70s ever made.".

Eventually his character will wake up and the kids aren't going to want to hang out with him and the girls aren't going to want to sleep with him anymore and he's going to have a rude awakening. But for the time being he's all macho cool swagger and Mcconaughey pulled off the part perfectly. Parker Posey is also excellent playing a senior bitch but only because she's supposed to be unleashing a humiliating hazing on the incoming freshman girls.You have to give props to the writing. It's not a long movie but it covers so much ground that it feels big. At one point a character says that the 70s obviously suck. That may have been but it's never looked cooler than it did in Dazed and Confused. And the soundtrack must be mentioned too. The 70s was a decade full of musical highs and lows and thankfully the soundtrack highlights the highs while ignoring the lows and we have songs by Aerosmith ZZ Top Dr. John War and other seminal 70s rock figures curiously missing Dazed and Confused by Led Zeppelin but that's forgivable. Brilliant there's not a single clunker and it adds to the free easygoing atmosphere of the movie. Dazed and Confused is quite possibly the best teen movie ever made and from the point of view of someone who grew up in the 80s anyway the best movie about the 70s ever made.";

	schema:reviewBody "Dazed and Confused has a lot in common with Fast Times at Ridgemont High both movies contain a lot of future stars playing teenagers both have lots of terrific Rock tunes on the soundtrack and both derive laughs from their characters and situations and not through jokes pratfalls and other typical Hollywood clichs. One difference between the two films is that Dazed and Confused is a periodpiece filmed in 1993 it takes place in 1976 and directer Richard Linklater does a marvelous job capturing the habits the styles and the attitudes of the era. In that regard maybe this movie is more inspired by American Graffiti than Fast Times at Ridgemont. But it doesn't matter because to me DC is the best of them all.This movie seems to be as personal to Linklater as it is to me and its not so much about plot or big scenes as it is about realism and the overall flow...and it flows beautifully. The movie follows a group of high school juniors and another group of 8th graders next years seniors and freshmenthrough the events surrounding the last day of school in Austin Texas in 1976 the whole film takes place in approximately 24 hours. We observe the hazing the partying some introspective banter and many familiar rituals as the characters prepare not just for the summer but for the next school year and beyond. This was the same general time period I was in high school so this movie had a special impact on me. At this point I need to mention Wooderson McConaugheyin his film debut a key character he's that 20something dude that still hangs with the high school crowd. Did every town in America have a guy like this or what? Wood Dawson Slater Pickford these guys all remind me of guys I grew up with in my hometown. The greatness of this film is that it rings so true...the way the jocks party with the freaks or grits' as they were also called where I grew up the way they just aimlessly cruise around in muscle cars until they find out where the party's at or the mailbox bashing here it was beer bottles thrown at signs or even the bottle cap flipping...we did that all the time! The only thing i didn't see was a bong. besides the one Slater was making in shop class..HEY we did that too! Yeah thats right joints are better for cruising anyway.This is the kind of movie to rent on one of those Friday nights where you have to work early the next day. I first rented this movie on one of those very nights. Its a great Friday night movie and why not? No heavy handed plot lots of partying and good music and it makes you feel good. Speaking of the soundtrack...Linklater makes great use of period music We get the gamut of 70s poprock including Aerosmith Ted Nugent ZZ Top War Dylan and even Black oak Arkansas remember them?....Jim dandy to the rescue! This movie really took me back.Dazed and Confused is also a bit of a curio because of all the young actors who were all unknown at the time who went on to star in other movies. You will see Matthew McConaughey his best performance ever Ben Affleck Parker Posey she's a riot Adam Goldberg Joey Lauren Adams and Milla Jovavich oki'm reaching now among others. My only complaint involving the cast is that Wiley Wiggins' as Mitch Kramer mannerisms are a bit irritating but other than that everyone does a tremendous job. This movie has become like a fascinating time capsule about that postrevolutionary decade of the 70s a decade filled with great music movies and television seriously what the heck has happened to entertainment in this country?... so its worth viewing for historical and social aspects as well as its entertainment value.But anyway I hope you enjoy one of my personal favorites...a really cool funny and realistic look at what teenage life was like in so many towns in America in the mid70s.It may be set in Texas but it could just as easily be Ohio.".

Shot in and around Austin Texas the film failed at the box office in 199394 but has gone on to achieve a welldeserved cult status. I never even heard of the film until this year when I saw most of it on TV and promptly decided to pick it up the DVD when I got the chance.To my mind Dazed and Confused is one of the best high school comedydramas along with 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The difference between these two films is that Fast Times contains more goofy antics whereas Dazed is more of a docudrama with amusing flashes. In other words although Fast Times is generally realistic excepting the overthetop parts with Spicoli Dazed and Confused is more like a slice from real life.What makes Dazed work so well is that it gets the LOOK of the midtolate 70s just right particularly the hair  clothing styles. Secondly the actors pull off the material expertly. In fact a large part of the film's success is the excellent casting choices. Both are no easy feat. Speaking of the actors you get a few upandcomers here Matthew McConaughey Milla Jovovich Ben Affleck and one or two of lesser note as far as future popularity goes.All the standard school archetypes are here the jock who parties on the side the bullies the hot sister and her little longhaired brother the black dude the hot feminist teacher the streetfighter the cool guys the geekier crowd the babes the guy who graduated years ago but still hangs around the mentors  mentees etc.And then you have the standard school experiences like parties at friend's houses keg parties fleeing bullies dealing with coaches  teachers flirting the possibility of sex hanging out meaningless conversations fights smoking pot at school or in your friend's bedroom etc.Like Fast Times Dazed and Confused is a joy to watch  whatever your age  because it successfully takes you back to the high school years with all its joys  agonies.Some don't like it because it's more of a sliceoflife film than a plotdriven contrived story. The plot here is simple It's the last day of school and the youths want to celebrate. If they can't party at their friend's house because the dad catches wind of their plans they'll have a party at the park or wherever but they WILL party. The rest of the film involves their interactions within this context.I've heard some complain that the film conveys a terrible message. What message? There is no message. The message is that school's out and it's time to celebrate! Besides there are a few positive points that can be mined from the proceedings the arrogant bully gets what's coming make a stand and fight when you have to even if you get beat up ultratight pants must be put on with pliers  the help of a friend be true to yourself etc. But  really  this isn't a movie to look for deep messages its simple purpose is to take you back to the school years  in this case 1976  and all the fun  painful experiences thereof.No review of Dazed and Confused would be complete without noting the excellent soundtrack. You get some great rockmetal of the 70s like Sweet Emotion School's Out Stranglehold Do You Feel Like We Do Love Hurts Paranoid Rock  Roll Hootchie Coo Rock  Roll All Nite Slow Ride Cherry Bomb Tuesday's Gone and many more.GRADE A".

	schema:reviewBody "Dazed and Confused is a lot like the time in which it takes place. The film doesn't have much of note to say but you get the sense that it has a good time just being there. By 1976 Vietnam was in the rearview mirror as were much of the struggles of the previous decades. It was almost like people were sick and tired of caring about things and just wanted to get wasted. Notice how nobody seemed to care when their teacher was trying to tell them about the 1968 Democratic Convention or our aristocratic forefathers. There is a certain innocence about the period that our uptight and violent world of today could use right now.Our film shows us the trials and tribulations of kids just looking to get high drunk or just save their butts from being paddled on the last day of school. Not much of note happens in this film. We just see kids doing what kids are still doing. They are all just out to have a good time. There are plenty of familiar faces in this cast but nobody really outshines anyone else. The film is paced in a manner that doesn't let us get to know too much about the characters. We spend a minute or two with one group of friends then we see what another group is up to. The most memorable scenes in the film are more painful than funny. We see next year's freshman class girls and guys get pummeled by the seniors. We see the destruction of property. We see a fight or two break out. Plenty of beer and pot are consumed by all. And there really isn't much else to it.Linklater films the action from a completely neutral vantage point. There is nothing at all pretentious or preachy about any of the subject matter. We see some cool cars tight jeans long hair and just about anything you would associate with this time frame. The film lacks the humor of Porky's or The Hollywood Knights. It also lacks the tragic desperation of The Last Picture Show. That said this film is still worth taking a look at. Especially if you were in high school at the time. I was just a toddler in 1976 but I could still relate to these characters and their need to party.7 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must concur with the other reviewers who have commented on the eerie accuracy of this film. I too attended high school in Texas in the 1970's and this film is so flawless in recreating this time and place it lends the impression you were being documented without your knowledge. If you are of an age and background that permits you to relate to Dazed  Confused on this level it will give you an unusual affinity for the film. This is exactly how we dressed and wore our hair those are the cars we drove the music we loved that looks exactly like my high school with only slight variations in paint colors those seemed to be my teachers and all of these people were the people I knew then. There is no question but that the author of this piece had to have been one of us.As someone who was there I hope I can clear up or offer some insight into a few of the points people have raised about the film. The drug use well it was the 70's. In my high school really hardcore drugs such as heroin were virtually unknown we talked about it but never saw it but both marijuana and LSD were as common and available as sand in your shoes. My generation had a very permissive attitude toward these substances. My own clique would never have had the brass ones required to actually partake on campus as getting caught would not have meant a detention but a trip to jail on the other hand it was not infrequent to find us stoned in class. But we did leave campus to blow a joint absolutely usually in either the home of one of us who lived nearby or a van that belonged to another of our group parking at the shopping center down the street. In DC we see Slater and some of his friends smoking weed right in the schoolyard that didn't happen in my school. There wasn't a single teacher at my high school who would not have immediately recognized the odor of marijuana and sought out the source. With the clarity of thirty years hindsight I remain of the opinion that we frankly had a healthier attitude on this subject than do socalled role models of today. Bad drug problems are bad drug problems but the recreational use of marijuana is substantially less detrimental than either alcohol or tobacco which both get a free pass because they're legal. Marijuana also failed to serve as a gateway drug in our clique none of us were led by it into harsher substances. I'm glad I'm not in high school today.One point of particular discussion I have noticed here on DC's IMDb page is the movie's rather brutal depiction of hazing busting the freshmen. Several have reported that this did not occur at their school. You were lucky and be glad of it. I attended high school in Dallas in the 1970's and this absolutely was a part of our life. I like all girls was spared the brutal whippings that Mitch and his friends have inflicted upon them by the seniors but it absolutely happened to incoming freshmen boys and was generally sanctioned or at least overlooked by the adults in charge. For the record YES IT IS ASSUALT AND BATTERY. Dang! What else do you call violently beating someone with a board until they cry? Battery plain and simple. Outrageous mean spirited and cruel and frankly the homoerotic assfixated nature of this hazing paints a far more unflattering psychological portrait of those dealing out the punishment than of those receiving it. As girls we were at least not physically assaulted but we did undergo some nasty initiation rituals but usually only those of us trying to get into an organized club not just all of us en masse simply because of our age this is also depicted quite accurately in the film what those poor girls endure from that bitch to get on the cheerleading squad God love 'em. And it is likewise plainly obvious in the film just as it was in real life the senior boys learned this bizarre monkeylike behavior from those bastions of simian progress their coaches roles universally filled by academic failures who represent the Wooderson's of the future.As disturbing as the hazing is it belongs in the film because it was there it was real it was a part of our lives in that time and place and I felt a delicious satisfaction when that one kid's mom met O'Bannion at the front porch cocking a shotgun. I don't think so creep! You go girl! As both Mitch and Sabrina deal with the initiation rituals in a manner that is respected by their older peers and grants them access to the cool clique it is too intrinsic to the storyline to be removed or whitewashed. I might add this is the only movie I have ever seen that captures this.In summation this is a movie directed at a rather specific audience. My friends who are of dramatically different age or grew up in a different part of the country do not generally relate to this movie nor enjoy it on the same level although they often find it entertaining. But if you like the filmmaker were a Texas high school student in those amazingly permissive 1970's and didn't particularly hate your life at the time I think you'll absolutely love it. Highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "I must concur with the other reviewers who have commented on the eerie accuracy of this film. I too attended high school in Texas in the 1970's and this film is so flawless in recreating this time and place it lends the impression you were being documented without your knowledge. If you are of an age and background that permits you to relate to Dazed  Confused on this level it will give you an unusual affinity for the film. This is exactly how we dressed and wore our hair those are the cars we drove the music we loved that looks exactly like my high school with only slight variations in paint colors those seemed to be my teachers and all of these people were the people I knew then. There is no question but that the author of this piece had to have been one of us.As someone who was there I hope I can clear up or offer some insight into a few of the points people have raised about the film. The drug use well it was the 70's. In my high school really hardcore drugs such as heroin were virtually unknown we talked about it but never saw it but both marijuana and LSD were as common and available as sand in your shoes. My generation had a very permissive attitude toward these substances. My own clique would never have had the brass ones required to actually partake on campus as getting caught would not have meant a detention but a trip to jail on the other hand it was not infrequent to find us stoned in class. But we did leave campus to blow a joint absolutely usually in either the home of one of us who lived nearby or a van that belonged to another of our group parking at the shopping center down the street. In DC we see Slater and some of his friends smoking weed right in the schoolyard that didn't happen in my school. There wasn't a single teacher at my high school who would not have immediately recognized the odor of marijuana and sought out the source. With the clarity of thirty years hindsight I remain of the opinion that we frankly had a healthier attitude on this subject than do socalled role models of today. Bad drug problems are bad drug problems but the recreational use of marijuana is substantially less detrimental than either alcohol or tobacco which both get a free pass because they're legal. Marijuana also failed to serve as a gateway drug in our clique none of us were led by it into harsher substances. I'm glad I'm not in high school today.One point of particular discussion I have noticed here on DC's IMDb page is the movie's rather brutal depiction of hazing busting the freshmen. Several have reported that this did not occur at their school. You were lucky and be glad of it. I attended high school in Dallas in the 1970's and this absolutely was a part of our life. I like all girls was spared the brutal whippings that Mitch and his friends have inflicted upon them by the seniors but it absolutely happened to incoming freshmen boys and was generally sanctioned or at least overlooked by the adults in charge. For the record YES IT IS ASSUALT AND BATTERY. Dang! What else do you call violently beating someone with a board until they cry? Battery plain and simple. Outrageous mean spirited and cruel and frankly the homoerotic assfixated nature of this hazing paints a far more unflattering psychological portrait of those dealing out the punishment than of those receiving it.

I'm well aware at how well Dazed and Confused was received getting 55 ratings from the majority of viewers. I guess that means I just missed something about it and it didn't work for me.It's about the last day of school in an American High School back in 1976. The older students are looking forward to generally beating up the younger kids as is tradition... apparently  all I can say is that this didn't happen to me at school in Britain during the eighties and nineties and I'm glad it didn't!.I found most of the characters either unlikeable or boring. I found it hard to root for someone who enjoys bullying people smaller than them which is most of the older kids just as I found it harder to identify with the younger ones who just sort of spent most of the film running away or waiting to take a hiding. Plus there's no real story. What you have here is a collection of scenes with numerous different characters all doing their own things on the last day of school. There's also too many characters. Many don't really have much impact and aren't really fleshed out enough to be believed in. I think it would have benefited with a smaller cast. Although the cast is pretty impressive  maybe not when this movie was made but in retrospect there are a fair few Hollywood Alisters all here in the younger prefame days.However as much as I didn't really like it I had to give it credit for getting the 'look' of the period right on. It really could have been filmed in the seventies for the way it was presented. Plus the soundtrack was right up my street. For once a film set in the seventies didn't have a single Abba track involved and there was far more use of some 'classic rock anthems' such as Alice Cooper hooray!.I didn't hate it I just didn't like it as much as everyone else apparently did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not what you might expect from a movie like this but Dazed and Confused does deliver on many levels. Taking the setup from the classic American Graffiti and switching the setting to postVietnam in 1976 this is a comingofage story about a group of teenagers that for the most part represents what the entire young generation of that time was feeling and going through. The film covers one last day of school filled with many happenings including hazing freshmen playing mailbox baseball and getting shot at as well as drinking lots of beer and smoking lots of marijuana. Writer and director Richard Linklater seems to have a good grip on the material and handles it with real sincerity and even sympathy towards some of the characters. The ensemble cast is wellcast and deliver the good dialog with a great sense of realism. Headlining it are a young Ben Affleck as a crazed senior determined to make the freshmen's summer miserable Milla Jovovich who I don't think utters more than five lines in the whole movie and Matthew McConaughey as an older guy who still hangs out with the high schoolers but is so cool and organizes the gettogethers.This movie is very funny in some parts but it is also very deep. It doesn't achieve classical status like American Graffiti or The Breakfast Club but it is a strong and realistic portrayal that speaks to all people at that age where life is either far ahead or right around the corner. Indeed there are many scenes with some brainiacs talking about President Ford and his political beliefs then switching to deciding whether or not to go to a party. Also I credit Linklater for not pulling an American Pie and becoming exceptionally crude and vulgar with this material. Yes many teens do talk like this but not all teens rip off their clothes and have wild sex with each other.All in all a very good movie that gives a real sense of what it was like to live in the 1970s and what it's like to be young in this country.".

Parents cared what time their children came home what they'd been up to and if they'd been drinkingsmoking. That is not to say that there wasn't any drinkingsmoking  it was just on lower level and not nearly as widespread as depicted.And many of the pranks shown in the movie occurred but were easily remedied in the real world. My father's mail box was hit only once. It's concretefilled replacement collected broken bats for years afterward. And our equivalent of paddling was promptly discontinued when a freshman stabbed his assaulting senior with a knife. Problem solved.But this is the way with movies. A narrow reality is shown often with few if any consequences for actions. Those not having lived in the time view it and get nostalgic over what they missed out on. In reality the only thing they missed out on was a figment of someone's imagination. One thing particularly note worthy of this movie is the quality of acting. I don't think that there was a bad performance in the lot. Perhaps some could have been better but none were bad. And others have noted the music selections were great. Now there is a reality that is sorely missed today  the great wealth of artistic talent that was the '70s.

	schema:headline " A 1970s period film that's just good fun";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1950s has American Graffiti and now the 1970s has Dazed and Confused. Both are welldeveloped depictions of life in America during those decades with a focus around high school growing up and making important decisions about what to do and how to live life. Both also gather a killer soundtrack from each decade and the result is more about evoking nostalgia and showing those too young to know what life was like.Director and writer Richard Linklater does good work with this film about high schoolers mostly incoming seniors on the last day of school. He's written characters that are fun and easy to identify by stereotype sometimes and identify with. The plot is just one giant misadventure involving alcohol marijuana high school hazing and a variety of rebellious activity. It never settles comfortably around one character giving you enough to get to know them and be interested in what happens to them but not enough to truly understand them or care about them. Linklater's focus appears to be showing the many ways that teens handled life and how they felt about it in 1976 through mishaps and comedic moments.The cast is a lot of fun especially because a lot of actors when they were a bit younger appear in the film Ben Affleck Matthew McCounaughy Parker Posey Adam Goldberg Joey Lauren Adams Big Daddy Anthony Rapp RENT and even more. Nobody's a show stealer but that's because the film isn't designed that way.Dazed and Confused is just fun. At the very least the soundtrack will have you rocking out a bit. There's no slapstick gutwrenching humor you just laugh and enjoy. There's nothing moving about the movie but you enjoy the characters and what happens to them. It's a very sound movie no pun intended but it works I guess in that it's just well put together. It's not bad at all if you don't like it it's probably because you wanted more from it.".

	onyx:emotionText "The 1950s has American Graffiti and now the 1970s has Dazed and Confused. Both are welldeveloped depictions of life in America during those decades with a focus around high school growing up and making important decisions about what to do and how to live life. Both also gather a killer soundtrack from each decade and the result is more about evoking nostalgia and showing those too young to know what life was like.Director and writer Richard Linklater does good work with this film about high schoolers mostly incoming seniors on the last day of school. He's written characters that are fun and easy to identify by stereotype sometimes and identify with. The plot is just one giant misadventure involving alcohol marijuana high school hazing and a variety of rebellious activity. It never settles comfortably around one character giving you enough to get to know them and be interested in what happens to them but not enough to truly understand them or care about them. Linklater's focus appears to be showing the many ways that teens handled life and how they felt about it in 1976 through mishaps and comedic moments.The cast is a lot of fun especially because a lot of actors when they were a bit younger appear in the film Ben Affleck Matthew McCounaughy Parker Posey Adam Goldberg Joey Lauren Adams Big Daddy Anthony Rapp RENT and even more. Nobody's a show stealer but that's because the film isn't designed that way.Dazed and Confused is just fun. At the very least the soundtrack will have you rocking out a bit. There's no slapstick gutwrenching humor you just laugh and enjoy. There's nothing moving about the movie but you enjoy the characters and what happens to them. It's a very sound movie no pun intended but it works I guess in that it's just well put together. It's not bad at all if you don't like it it's probably because you wanted more from it.";

Apart from the beating of the freshmenwhich I've never experienced I've been to better and more interesting parties than the one in this film and I've never thought that those parties where film material. Style over substance all the way. The best thing about is the music but I find it hard to believe that in 1976 they only played songs that were later to become classics. I guess they also played songs that were forgotten as well.And it is not a comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am wondering about all the other reviews that say this is exactly like real life in the 70's. I found this movie to be very unlike real life in 1976 to a severe extent. I graduated high school in 1973 so it should be almost exactly my time but there are many things wrong here. The movie has stoners wearing polyester print shirts which were actually the costumes of the disco set. In real life they would all be wearing blue denim jackets with DISCO SUS buttons on them and never disco clothes themselves. The movie has them smoking bongs in a convertible in plain view of cops something never done in the 70's when people still went to jail for 2 joints and always smoked dope where the cops couldn't see us. It shows stoners always getting into fights. Not like real life only greasers and jocks got into fights stoners were too stoned to fight at all. They never talk about music in this movie the most you hear about music in this movie is the one guy who talks about getting Aerosmith tickets but in real life all us stoners talked about was music. That was like 80 of our conversation. Jethro Tull Deep Purple Captain Beyond. I think most of the people in this movie were the lower intelligence set the smart stoners didn't knock over garbage cans or go around paddling people in the posterior with wood paddles. It never happened. In real life the football players were dumb jocks with short hair big muscles dated the dumb straight cheerleaders who made money at the bake sale to buy uniforms. Jocks were straight and never smoked dope or even cigarettes. They were scared of the stoners because they didn't have any idea what we were doing. Once in a while a stoner got on the football team but never fit in with the jocks and when the stoners found out he was on the team we thought he was maybe a jockhippie which was a rare thing. But this movie has skinny little hippies playing football!! Never happened ever. And it shows hippies with late60's Camaros with 454 engines in them and Dodge Chargers with a 440 and a 6pack. Bzzzzzt!! Those were the greasers! Hippies drove beat up Volkswagens and Chevy Novas with 6 cylinders. This movie is not realistic at all. I think this movie is ABOUT the 70's but it lampoons them and it seems the people who made the movie were not really there.".

This is what the movie is highly based on along with the drinking and drug culture that every generation has to deal with.I think the must crucial point in the movie is towards the end when Randall Floyd is confronted by his coach in the early hours of the morning after a night of partying.

	schema:reviewBody "On the few occasions when I bash the snot out of a movie I usually try to have fun with it. I won't even bother this time. So get set for a review as brutal dry and miserable as the movie we're talking about.Contrary to everything they tell you Dazed  Confused isn't a comedy. At least I sincerely hope not. The only people who could possibly find humor in the disturbing paedophiliac rape scenes which compose much of this movie's vapid plot are probably the same people who laugh at images of prisoner abuse at Abu Gharib. Let me describe one of these funny scenes. A high school freshman played by an actor who looks like he's 12 flees in mortal terror from 6 hamfaced seniors played by actors who look like they're 28 and on steroids. They catch him. Hootin' and hollerin' they bend him over the hood of a car doggy style. The camera angle gives us a close up of the kid's contorted face grimacing while from behind in slow motion the hamfaces howl and laugh as they violate the prepubescent kid in the posterior with a paddle. If you were too dense to miss the rape symbolism at one point they tell the kid to squeal like a pig bringing to mind Ned Beatty's somewhat uncomfortable anal experience in Deliverance. Gee funny stuff. In the 1st hour the same scene is repeated two more times with two more kids. At one point a car of girls pulls up and one girl shouts hey take it easy on the kid to which hamface 5 cockily opens up the trunk of his car to reveal 200 beers to which the girls suddenly start oohing and begging like trained seals. Are you laughing? I wasn't nor was my date nor was the entire theater. Good thing because I probably would've punched anyone who was.The sick feeling I got when watching Dazed  Confused was a lot like the sick feeling I got when watching Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange except that Clockwork is a powerful intentionally unsettling film with a purpose while DC is just a mess. Clockwork was a brilliant dark satire of societywe're never supposed to believe or even expect that the story would ever be remotely true because it's so nightmarish.To those reviewers who are raving about how spot on this movie is I don't know what Archie comic book world you crawled out of but it certainly wasn't mine. In what alternate universe does every 17yearold high school senior own a Pontiac GTO which cost 4500 in 1976 roughly 8000 by today's standards have the cash to buy 200 beers and 6 kegs have no job other than hootin' hollerin' and smashing windows and basically walking around stoned  drunk 24 hours a day? While yes these things were known to happen in the 70s it was only about as frequent as you'd expect today generally describing the 0.05 bored rich kids whose mommies  daddies were buying them cars while the rest of us were schlepping around in our rusty Dodge Darts because that's all our parttime jobs would cover minimum wage 2.35hr in 1976.It quickly becomes obvious that this movie wasn't trying to give us an accurate portrayal of the 70s so much as it was a series of gratuitous 70s clichs. Aging baby boomers could feel like their existence was validated while younger GenXers could feel like they're getting a cultural education. Wrong on both counts. What Dazed  Confused amounts to is simply a bunch of idealized nostalgia the same way the 50's was idealized by the creators of Happy Days. At least Happy Days was funny  entertaining so we accept it. But Dazed  Confused failed because it took itself too seriously and had an inherently bland script leaving with us with nothing but phony contrived situations to entertain us. Contrast this against Napoleon Dynamite which was similarly set in a high school 20 years in the past but featured not only a funny selfdeprecating approach but a memorable script full of great oneliners. In the case of Napoleon we accept the nostalgia because it's such a great satire of itself.Now let's talk about the soundtrack of Dazed  Confused. Think of every classic rock clich that's been played so many times on the radio that even diehard classic rock fans would switch the station. Now string these songs together almost randomly with no significance to the story as if trying to compensate for lack of cinematic content with crowd pleasing candy rock and there's your wonderful soundtrack. Does anyone on the planet actually like the song Rock  Roll Hootchie Koo anyway?The 70s offered so many better songs which we actually did listen to back then. It is particularly irritating that the movie would take its title from the great atmospheric Zeppelin song Dazed  Confused while not acknowledging it once in the film. Not mainstream enough I guess.If you want a cool nostalgic 70s trip with poignant music not just the regurgitated radio crap check out the films of Gabrielle Salvatores with obscure yet awesome songs like Deep Purple Child in Time or the movie Fear  Loathing in Las Vegas with Jefferson Airplane's incomparable White Rabbit or for you serious 70s rock fans the movie Buffalo 66 with great songs by bands like Yes  King Crimson. Leave this I Love the 70s radiohappyrubbish to the posers who think this was what life was like back then.As a comedy this movie fails. As a drama it's just plain disturbing. As a rock  roll movie it's annoying as hell. Watch a documentary about paedophiles in prison for more entertainment value than Dazed  Confused. And for the love of Pete if anyone tries to tell you this is a cult classic please belt them in the chops for me.".

Clockwork was a brilliant dark satire of societywe're never supposed to believe or even expect that the story would ever be remotely true because it's so nightmarish.To those reviewers who are raving about how spot on this movie is I don't know what Archie comic book world you crawled out of but it certainly wasn't mine. In what alternate universe does every 17yearold high school senior own a Pontiac GTO which cost 4500 in 1976 roughly 8000 by today's standards have the cash to buy 200 beers and 6 kegs have no job other than hootin' hollerin' and smashing windows and basically walking around stoned  drunk 24 hours a day? While yes these things were known to happen in the 70s it was only about as frequent as you'd expect today generally describing the 0.05 bored rich kids whose mommies  daddies were buying them cars while the rest of us were schlepping around in our rusty Dodge Darts because that's all our parttime jobs would cover minimum wage 2.35hr in 1976.It quickly becomes obvious that this movie wasn't trying to give us an accurate portrayal of the 70s so much as it was a series of gratuitous 70s clichs. Aging baby boomers could feel like their existence was validated while younger GenXers could feel like they're getting a cultural education. Wrong on both counts. What Dazed  Confused amounts to is simply a bunch of idealized nostalgia the same way the 50's was idealized by the creators of Happy Days. At least Happy Days was funny  entertaining so we accept it. But Dazed  Confused failed because it took itself too seriously and had an inherently bland script leaving with us with nothing but phony contrived situations to entertain us. Contrast this against Napoleon Dynamite which was similarly set in a high school 20 years in the past but featured not only a funny selfdeprecating approach but a memorable script full of great oneliners. In the case of Napoleon we accept the nostalgia because it's such a great satire of itself.Now let's talk about the soundtrack of Dazed  Confused. Think of every classic rock clich that's been played so many times on the radio that even diehard classic rock fans would switch the station. Now string these songs together almost randomly with no significance to the story as if trying to compensate for lack of cinematic content with crowd pleasing candy rock and there's your wonderful soundtrack. Does anyone on the planet actually like the song Rock  Roll Hootchie Koo anyway?The 70s offered so many better songs which we actually did listen to back then. It is particularly irritating that the movie would take its title from the great atmospheric Zeppelin song Dazed  Confused while not acknowledging it once in the film. Not mainstream enough I guess.If you want a cool nostalgic 70s trip with poignant music not just the regurgitated radio crap check out the films of Gabrielle Salvatores with obscure yet awesome songs like Deep Purple Child in Time or the movie Fear  Loathing in Las Vegas with Jefferson Airplane's incomparable White Rabbit or for you serious 70s rock fans the movie Buffalo 66 with great songs by bands like Yes  King Crimson. Leave this I Love the 70s radiohappyrubbish to the posers who think this was what life was like back then.As a comedy this movie fails. As a drama it's just plain disturbing. As a rock  roll movie it's annoying as hell. Watch a documentary about paedophiles in prison for more entertainment value than Dazed  Confused. And for the love of Pete if anyone tries to tell you this is a cult classic please belt them in the chops for me.";

Dazed and Confused is for the survivors of the 1970s that group of Americans who came of age when bellbottoms love beads mantras and marijuana were the fashion drinking and driving hadn't become taboo and safe sex was used only to avoid pregnancy or VD. As the United States reached her bicentennial Vietnam was over  if the memories still lingered  and the shortlived disco craze was building to a frenzy that Saturday Night Fever would both exploit and exacerbate.This movie begins on the last day of the 197576 school year and finishes less than twentyfour hours later. For Randy Pink Floyd Jason London and his friends it's the end of their tenure as high school juniors and with the final bell of the last period they have reached the ultimate goal for teenagers  they are seniors. At the local junior high school Mitch Kramer Wiley Wiggins and his cohorts have a serious problem to consider. They are members of the incoming freshman class and as part of a timehonored tradition they are about to be totally and painfully humiliated by the new seniors.Dazed and Confused explores the beginning of the 1976 summer from the varying perspectives of an unusual group of characters. Just about every type is represented the timid nerd looking for a way to break out of his shell the mindless jock the overaged twentysomething guy who likes hanging out with teenagers the blond bombshell the stonedoutofhis mind pot addict and the timid newcomer. Writerdirector Richard Linklater Slackers is only partially successful in his attempts to avoid making his characters into caricatures. Most of what works with the youthful population of Dazed and Confused is due more to the performances of a fine cast than the writing.There isn't much to this picture. The storyline is minimal and the characters' personalities are as hazy as the marijuanadrenched atmosphere. What Linklater does exceptionally well is open the door on an era seventeen years in the past. This is 1976 from the music and cars which combined cost a huge chunk of the 6 million budget to the people and their attitudes. You'd have to climb into a time machine to get a better view.Comparisons with American Graffiti are warranted remembering of course that this is the next generation. Both have similar aims but while Graffiti's plot may have been no less insignificant than that of Dazed and Confused its characters are better defined. At times Linklater seems too wrapped up in getting everything right about the time period. While the directors of both films care about their protagonists George Lucas does a better job of transferring that feeling to the audience.The cast is one of new or barelyrecognizable names and face Michelle Burke who went on to do Coneheads is among the few who might tweak the memory. None of the principals can have a clear memory of 1976 unless they're a lot older than they look yet they play their roles like they lived through it. Most memorable of all is Wiley Wiggins' Mitch who performs almost every scene including one where he buys his first sixpack with an affecting blend of charm and realism.Dazed and Confused is irresponsible and politically incorrect and almost worth applauding on those grounds alone. Overall however this is light entertainment  nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy. This film was made to celebrate a dead culture and those who were part of it or are merely curious will find a path into the past through it. Unfortunately due to the weakness of the script they won't find anything substantial there.".

He has created crazy characters that are funny and often exaggerated versions of people or of people's reactions to situations witness the magiceye poster guy for an example of exaggerated humour.Lee is fantastic this is the role he was made for  he reacts in an exaggerated way to everything and really hams it up.

	schema:reviewBody "The second movie in Kevin Smith's 5 film View Askewniverse series is Mallrats  a charming comedy about two losers who after being dumped by their girlfriends decide to spend a day at the mall.  and try and win their girls back. Jason Lee and Jeremy London play the dumpedanddepressed duo of exboyfriends who both succeed in bringing to life the characters of . Shannen Doherty and Claire Forlani  the two exgirlfriends also perform well here. It's been said  not just by critics and fans but by Kevin Smith himself that Mallrats is a bad movie  and by far the worst of his 5. Personally I rate this 3rd... with Dogma in front and Chasing Amy last  I found this movie to be funny charming and completely entertaining. Ben Affleck's character was also funny to watch. Jay  Silent Bob appear to add the cartoon comedy flavour while Stan Lee cameos in an hilarious performance of himself.I liked the script and the way that the movie was paced although at times seemed like the scenes were stretched further than they should be. The sets were good and the lighting and cinematography is good also. I don't really have any major gripes about this film it's just that there are better movies in Kevin Smith's series.".

Soon however thoughts turn to getting their ladies back and the dynamic duo will have to fight mall security a fashionable male Ben Affleck and a game show producer Michael Rooker in order to succeed.Writing a fair review of Mallrats is one of the hardest things for me to do and it is no surprise that I have not done so in all the years I have been writing reviews. The film came out when I was fourteen and I went to see it with my cousin at the local mall after a rousing bus trip. We had seen the ambiguous advertisements in the back of comic books for months and just knew this was something we had to see. Once in the theater we were practically alone  there were only three other people including a younger woman and her grandmother both of whom walked out early on.For whatever reason I identified with this film. I had not yet seen Clerks and I did not have the background in film to really understand all the references to Jaws or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or Apocalypse Now. But the potty humor mixed with the intelligent dialogue even about scatological topics hit home with me and even now  seventeen years later  it remains my favorite film despite my knowing full well it is not critically wonderful and often sexually crude.I have given the film a high rating because I simply cannot get enough of it. I have the trading cards that were sold at the time I have visited the Eden Prairie Center where the movie was filmed it is in Minnesota not New jersey strangely enough. But I want to stress this my high rating does not by any means indicate this is a critically beautiful film. Read the reviews of the professionals at the time Ebert Maltin and others and you will see that it was more or less expected to bomb although I think in hindsight many more people found the film to their liking.Are there flaws? You bet. Watch Jeremy London for example. A horrible horrible actor. Even with these odd scripted conversations he comes off as forced and if you watch him while another actor is speaking you can see him physically preparing himself to speak his lines. He cannot become the character of T.S. Quint he can only be Jeremy London. Shannon Doherty likewise just does not seem to hack it... she is a better actress than many but this film just did not work for her. She comes off as a reject from Empire Records and some lines she delivers make it seem she is not familiar with the subject matter.Despite the flaws I am still praising this film. Watch Clerks first even though this one takes place first in chronological order. If you like Clerks try this one. Then try Chasing Amy. All three are great. Personally I think Kevin Smith's films went downhill after that although Red State is redeeming. He may disagree and I know many of the fans do. But if you do not mind intelligent potty humor Mallrats is for you.".

That sort of brought down the film a little. The film was already on the right track with its funny characters and funny situations. There was no need for toilet humour.London and Lee play the two friends. London is okay while Lee is very good. He pretty much steals every scene. Doherty and Forlani are adequate. Lauren Adams is brilliant in a brief role and Affleck is good as the evil Salesman. Mewes and Smith are alright though some may feel that they go a little over the top.So all in all you'll meet some very weird and notsoweird characters and exaggerated situations but I think you'll at least have some good laughs.

Many of the pop culture refs and the satire of young adult life make this film even cooler! And how the hell did he get Stan Lee to appear? And he was surprisingly really good!This is Shannen Doherty's best role mainly because she's hardly ever on screen Jason Lee's best role and Jeremy London's best role not to be confused with twin brother Jason who was the awesome Randall Pink Floyd in Dazed and Confused...though Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams were both in Dazed as well...Look for an amusing role played by Ethan Suplee Seth in American History XOverall this film just plain rocks! It's got great quirky writing great direction solid acting a threenippled topless clairvoyant a hilarious love connection parody a 15 year old nympho played by the amusing Claire Forlani Stan Lee...what more could one ask for?? It's not his best it has flaws but it's still classic Smith! An easy 710!".

This is the second film in the New Jersey series by Kevin Smith. This entry is miles better than its predecessor Clerks.I loved how Kevin Smith did this movie. Kevin Smith is a comic book geek so I'm glad he made a movie to portray that taste. Comic book lovers will truly enjoy all the references and parodies within the film. I know I did. That's what made the movie even more enjoyable to me. The appearance of Stan Lee was the cherry on the ice cream for me. Aside from that this movie is just paced and styled better than Clerks was. This was non stop laughs whereas Clerks was more of a satirical black comedy. Also a lot happened throughout the film even though it only takes place within a day and within the same mall rather than Clerks which was slow moving and downright boring in some parts.I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Jason Lee is hilarious as comic book fanatic Brodie Bruce. Jay and Silent Bob have a lot more to do in this film than in Clerks and they make some of the funniest scenes in the movie.Overall Kevin Smith had his practice with Clerks so he had the resources to make a better film and he certainly did.

They get dumped by their girlfriends  really they should get dumped by the entire world.  They are selfcentered in the extreme immature in the extreme and incredibly annoying.  The whole movie is based on a single gimmick  take an actual conversation transcribe it into Microsoft Word then use the thesaurus tool to replace every adjective with more obscure ones.  That's it.  It goes on without pause for the entire film  people talk about nothing in this clever way.  I just saw the film last night and I honestly can't remember a single topic of any conversation that took place.  Needless to say the two main characters are beyond shallow.  They don't have any personalities other than that they like video games comic books and they just will not stop talking  ever.  Even though they never say anything.  We're supposed to be impressed by the clever use of oddball words for instance calling a pool table a gaming table. Man wouldn't you just love to sit through two hours of people doing this?  Let me tell you it makes Pauly Shore and his screwball take on Valley Girl talk seem enjoyable by comparison.There are other characters  Shannon Doherty puts in a cameo.  She's really the only likable character in the movie and says about the only funny line. Some other girl who's name doesn't deserve to be remembered plays the other loser's girlfriend.  She recites a few lines of dialog at the beginning a few more towards the end.  Another girl named Gwen starts out all right she's like Kelly Bundy from Married with Children except twice as slutty but by the end of her part she's speaking via the thesaurus as well.  Jay and Silent Bob?  Jay is a stoner who acts like he's got to go to the bathroom really bad  Bob is just a fat idiot who spends the whole movie pointing his hand at things and trying to use the force to move objects. There's also a comic book writer who shows up to inject a large amount of padding into a scene.  The head doofus asks him if that guy from the Fantastic Four who was made out of rock well was his youknowwhat made out of rock as well?  Is that wacky or what?  Ha ha.  This goes on and on.Overall this movie is flat out unwatchable.  The special features on the DVD are a joke as well.  It's advertised as having over an hour of deleted scenes.  The first ten minutes of these deleted scenes consists of a film of an unused script.  Actual film of the script you know hold the camera in front of the paper and slowly pan down.  About two thirds of the scenes are the writer talking about the scenes.  There's supposedly a trailer on the DVD as well  good luck trying to find it.".

I waited for the director to show that he had some idea of what film making is all about. That never happened. I thought that at least the writing would eventually show that there was some reason why this film was made but when the credits finally mercifully rolled no reason whatever had yet appeared.I'll say this for the movie though it didn't score a perfect '10' and so achieve the distinction of being a total loss. There was one scene where for between three and ten seconds something approaching reality actually took place. That was when T.S.'s old girlfriend kicked him in the groin.I just hope that audiences and the motion picture industry don't hold this movie against the cast. Perhaps just perhaps a few of them may actually have the ability to entertain. If so in this movie they never got a chance to show it.If Mr. Smith decides he wants to produce and direct another film I'd strongly advise him to get a fifth grader to write his screenplay.

But after all the mayhem they manage to get up to in the mall they just can't get their exgirlfriends off their mind. So the two team up with the help of Jay and Silent Bob to come up with a plan to win them back. Though they got the likes of T.S' girlfriend's dad and that of a scummy store manager to overcome before winning back their girls.Don't you just love the selfloathing slacker generation! After the huge and promising success that was Clerks for directorwriter Kevin Smith. Obiviously there was pressure to repeat that winning formula with his follow up. Even though Mallrats is a more bigger and polished studio bound production of Clerks set in the mall it just didn't take off at all. It came and went by with little interest. Maybe it doesn't hold that fundamentally cunning humour and smarting realism that made the low budget film Clerks originally quirky and fresh. I'm not a big fan of Smith's work as I've only caught his first three flicks and I still think his third film Chasing Amy is the best. But this commercially mainstream project isn't all a failure because the film still does come up with an entertaining tale of laidback characters with a muster of jokes setup in a mall. Definitely much more crass and juvenile are the gags this time and somewhat the humour tries to be funny than naturally being it. But what compensates it is that there was a continuous roll with one after another so if one didn't work out there's another that would hopefully evoke a laugh. The film is actually made up of little episodes that happen throughout the day with something endlessly popping up and many characters deciding to make a scene. It's all over the place you can say. There are some memorably comical sequences like that of the Stan Lee cameo the Easter bunny and that of the cheesy date game show. But there's one lewd segment involving chocolate pretzels which will make you barf.What makes this quite fun is that of the lively performances of Jason Lee's selfabsorbed Brodie and the always reliable pairing of Jay and Silent Bob. Also adding to the enjoyable mess are Shannon Doherty Claire Forlani Jeremy London Joey Lauren Adams Priscilla Barnes Michael Rooker and a slimy performance by Ben Affleck. The spontaneous dialog is selfconscious with its referential gags and it's filled with a carefree attitude and pure nonsense amongst the stemming wisdom and frankness. Especially those facts considering that of the mall's customs and the respect it deserves. Heck! I should know as I had a friend that persistently visited the mall everyday just to be there for the sake of it. Though I thought it turned into moralistic babble in the dying stages. But these things don't take away from sarcastic interplay and skits that are generated throughout the running time even though it really seems like an eccentric melodrama with humorous overtones at times. A nice bubblegum rock soundtrack crops up to mould itself within the context and the camerawork has a professional touch too. The best way to take it is to see it as good undemanding fun!Smith tried outdoing himself here but sometimes it doesn't work and it seems more conventional than his other films but that doesn't stop this from being alluringly amusing and satisfying when you comes to the ending credits.".

The only decent movie he's ever made was 'Zack and Miri' and that was because he deviated almost entirely from his usual style. Mallrats however is typical of his style. The writing is bad the jokes are bad the setups are bad and the plot is bad. It's nearly unwatchable. You have zero sympathy for the protagonists who are hopeless losers and the secondary characters are no better. Oh but that's the point some would say... it's suburban nihilism. Its the essence of '90s teen angst and slacker culture. It's brilliant! Nope sorry. Not buying it. I was a teenager in the '90s. I lived through it.

There are like 2 or 3 funny lines throughout the movie but that's it. The acting is OK the dialogue is realistic but that doesn't help this film so much.

T.c is meant to be the' straight guy' to Brodie's wiseass but he just angers me. All he does is whine Thats all Dante did but...The script 'Clerks' had a brilliant script the dialouge was well observed and real without being meaningless. 'Mallrats' script isnt bad but its not as clever or as well realised as clerks.Jay and Silent Bob IMHO these two characters cant carry a film on their own JASBSB is a prime example of this. In mallrats they're normally supporting roles are made to be more main more involved in the story. IMO they are weak characters and Mewes' acting is extemely poor.While this film isnt terrible it is the 2nd worst film in the new jersey trilogy. JASBSB is the worst.".

In fact there was so much riding on this follow up to Clerks that there was talk of a sequel Mallrats 2 Die Hard In A Mall. Alas the film didn't do well in theaters and a Mallrats 2 never materialized then again the sequel to Clerks hasn't come about yet either. Film eventually found its audience on video and provided Ben Affleck with an early film credit before he hit it big and started a good working relationship with Kevin Smith that has lasted to this day.Jason Lee also became a Smith regular after this film and made appearances in Chasing Amy Dogma and Jay  Silent Bob Strike Back.Jason plays Brodie a fan boy of grandiose proportions and buddy of Jeremy London's TS. TS is dumped by his girlfriend Brandi Claire Forlani for being obsessive and unreasonable in light of her doing her father's 70s throw back love show pilot to get him out of trouble for accidentally sending the original girl to her death via drowning. Brodie is dumped by his girlfriend Rene Shannen Doherty for being a loser who only plays video games reads comic books never takes her shopping where she wants to go and refuses to introduce her to his mother. Brodie deals with this the only way he knows how  going to the mall which is where he spends most of his time anyway and he drags TS along with him to share in their mutual misery. There they hatch up a plan to wreck the love show so that TS can reconcile with Brandi whom he truly loves and in fact wanted to ask her to marry him on a trip to Universal Florida that they had planned but was dashed because of the show Brandi's dad does not like TS. Brodie also succumbs to the temptation of winning back his true love Rene especially when he finds out that she's seeing local mall worker Ben Affleck who has a knack for picking up women who are on the rebound from bad relationships and subjects them to his bizarre sexual fetishes screw them in an uncomfortable place. Did I mention that Ben hates Brodie for having no shopping agenda every weekend that he comes to the mall? And to think he later played the comic book super hero Daredevil... Also along for the ride is Jay  Silent Bob in this wild and raucous romp of teen madness so vastly superior to Clerks it should be a crime.Joey Lauren Adams who plays one of TS's exgirlfriends here later had the title role in Chasing Amy.

Yes the characters are shallow to a large degree and the person I watched with got quite bored with this dialoge driven comedy.  That being said it has been a great while since I enjoyed a comedy as much as this.  Like an Arthur Hailey novel you constantly bounce around to 5 or 6 parties and their very different issues.  I could relate in alot of ways please remember this is a couple years before the Aids crisis.  I never found it to be dull indeed I was draw in by the characters as things went along.  I think what bothered many who've commented on the movie is you are lead to believe everyone will be meeting at the 'Party'.  Have patience remember the film is about the people not the party.  The end of the movie was probably the best part.  If you're intriged by what I've described here definitly make this a MustSee".

But this movie surprised me and left me with a sense of fulfillment for having watched it. I did not waste my time after all!The story takes place on New Year's Eve 1981 and incorporates 3 storylines into one. All the characters are tied together in one way or another and the movie centralizes around the New Year's Eve party and a woman's apartment which no one shows up at until she's drunk and passed out.This tale of sex booze and cigarettes showed the ridiculousness of these things and made us laugh at the same time. Despite the party being the central theme of the movie...we do not get to see it at all. This leaves a lot to the imagination. The movie was shot so that it alternated between characters and storylines but intertwined them beautifully. Every member of the star studded cast put in a great performance and this movie was truly well done. I enjoyed it very much and give it a 9 out of 10. If you're not offended easily...go out and rent this movie today!".

The characters in it are not testoseronedriven or in any way the pumpedup dumbeddown characters we have seen in recent decades.  They are sensitive but open to communication a little irrational at times but still human. They are characters from the female mind a female psychology and have very feminine ways in interacting with each other.Then note that is was probably marketed by the same maledominated Hollywood.This is of course mostly backed up with the amount of psychology classes I have taken but the simple version is that when this movie was new I discussed it with many of my friends.  All of the men either had no desire to see it or hated it.  Every single one of the women thought it was excellent.Granted this is a common rationale used by people who think themselves movie critics but just you try seeing with a member of the opposite sex and see how your opinions differ.This is the first movie of a New Hollywood tho it will certainly not be remmebered as such.

The film takes place on New Year's Eve 1981 and follows a number of people around town in New York City on their way to a party.  None of the characters or plot lines were especially interesting and the ending was rather flat and pointless. Unless you are a big fan of any particular actor in this movie I do not recommend this movie.  I give this movie 510 stars for the few funny scenes which were not enough to save this from being overwhelmingly boring.".

The only thing missing from this movie to make it a true music video is strategic product placement and gyrating naked women.  A quintessential MTV production it is a vacuous and borderline moronic paean to the youthful pursuit of coupling. As an aside I note that the cinematic chroniclers of modern history seem to think that each decade is defined by its obsession with having sex.  The 50's were apparently all about innocent sex.  The 60's were about free lovesex.  The 70's about kinky sex.  The 80's about deadly sex.  Other than war is there any other activity in which human beings seem to participate with so much passion?  Back to this story ... it is New Year's Eve 1981 in New York City as we follow a series nearadults detour toward their respective roads to the same house party.  Their only goal is to find a date either before the party during it or after.  To think the rest of the world at this very same time in history was worried about the implosion of the Middle East and Africa the AIDS epidemic environmental decay and global warming just to name a few minor problems.  Anyway the private party is hosted by Monica Martha Plimpton a totally annoying whiner whose low selfesteem is rivalled only by her neurotic selfabsorption.  Working their way toward her apartment are Val Gaby Hoffmann and Stephie Christina Ricci two gumchewing nasaltalking louts who couldn't find their way out of a wet paper bag.  Then there's Lucy Courtney Love who secretly pines for Kevin Paul Rudd who carries on endlessly about his recent breakup with girlfriend Ellie Janeane Garofalo.  Cindy Kate Hudson is an indecisive accidentprone giggler much like her mother the equally irritating Goldie Hawn who thinks she's falling in love with Jack Jay Mohr the simpleton to whom she recently donated her virginity.  Kaitlyn Angela Featherstone and Bridget Nicole Parker are girls who just wanna get laid so they pursue anything with a y chromosome including the bartender Ben Affleck the cab driver David Chappelle and their hostess' exboyfriend Eric Brian McCardie.  Tom Casey Affleck and Dave Guillermo Daz round out this group of losers as two punk rockers in search of true love.  That's it.  That's all.  Bored yet?  It took all of my willpower motivated primarily by the desire not to waste my video rental fee to sit through this piece of garbage.  And finally there are three people in this movie that really should have known better.  There's a cameo by brilliant murder mystery writer Caleb Carr. What were you thinking?!  Elvis Costello actually lends his name fame and body to the dnouement.  And my advice to Janeane Garofalo?  Fire your agent!".

They all sounded like they were sleeping through their parts.  You'd never know any of these actors had any talent at all!  The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack which featured some of the best songs of the early 80's. Unfortunately it was hard to hear the songs over the banal dialogue.  The overthetop 80's fashions were fun to look at too but there have been better movies made about the early 80s such as The Wedding Singer and The Last Days of Disco.  A waste of time.".

There is a virgin experiencing sex a guy who spends the evening complaining about the women who dumped him a bartender who constantly gets stood up.

It is basically a series of subplots with an ending where everybody seems to wake up with somebody. Great ensemble cast including Christina Ricci who searches for the party. Courtney Love celebrates her friend's birthday before countering his complaints with sex. Dave Chappelle plays a cab driver who sees all and is the film's observer. Casey Affleck mourns over broken relationships. Martha Plimpton plans a big party but is disappointed when only one person appears while others form the other subplots.

I've not been disappointed since... his turn in Jesse James was outstanding.I adore Martha Plimpton and can of course understand the character's obsession with EC.This film has worked it's way into our family 'language'. 'Ronkonkoma' in a heavy NY accent features largely... as does 'I want to lick his glasses'.There is so much to love about this film. It's cheesy and not cheesy all at the same time and it's the little things that make it.There is a great deal to read between the lines and so if you don't like subtle complexity in your films then perhaps this wouldn't be for you.".

I've not been disappointed since... his turn in Jesse James was outstanding.I adore Martha Plimpton and can of course understand the character's obsession with EC.This film has worked it's way into our family 'language'. 'Ronkonkoma' in a heavy NY accent features largely... as does 'I want to lick his glasses'.There is so much to love about this film. It's cheesy and not cheesy all at the same time and it's the little things that make it.There is a great deal to read between the lines and so if you don't like subtle complexity in your films then perhaps this wouldn't be for you.";

	schema:headline " Low key but poignant film";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the things that this film does so well is point out how people make ethnic jokes totally unaware that some of the people around them may be of the same ethnicity. This gives the central character the opportunity to get a good look at what type of person that they really are and how to react to it. Story takes place in the 1950's and is about David Greene Brendan Fraser who is Jewish and from Scranton and and he gets a scholarship to a good prep school in the New England area and he decides not to tell anyone about his being Jewish. He's recruited to be the new quarterback on the football team and once he arrives he meets some of his new dorm buddies. His roommate is Chris Reece Chris O'Donnell and the person he is replacing at quarterback is Charlie Dillon Matt Damon who likes to tell people that he is going steady with the beautiful Sally Wheeler Amy Locane. David does well in his studies and becomes a star on the team and gets along with everyone but once he meets Sally sparks fly.SPOILER ALERTBoth David and Sally like each other instantly and soon Charlie discovers what is going on and becomes furious. Charlie looks at David as the person who took not only his position on the team but also the guy who took his girl. Then he overhears from a former alumni that David is Jewish and he uses this to try and get even. David now has to hear ugly racist jokes and find Nazi slogans tacked up in his room but he also loses Sally who could never date a Jew. While taking a final in one of his classes he notices Charlie cheating and later the teacher finds the cheat notes on the floor and he tells the students that they must find the culprit themselves or they all flunk. David tells Charlie to tell the truth but he uses this to tell everyone that it was in fact David who cheated.This film is directed by Robert Mandel and the screenplay is written by Dick Wolf who bases this story on his own exploits as a young man in prep school. We have all seen films dealing with racism before and while this doesn't have anything to say that you haven't heard before it does do a splendid job of pointing out how racism can exist even when it's meant as a harmless joke or gesture. But things do get ugly in this film after David's true identity is revealed and here he learns that some of the people he thought were friends are really just bigots. Another good thing that this film brings to a familiar story is a cast of young actors that breath freshness into their roles. Fraser is particularly good in the lead role and while he has been blasted by some for some of the films he has made he does pop up in a good role every so often and this was his first really impressive performance. Damon also gives a good performance and his character really becomes a disgusting jerk later in the film but this also marks the first film that Damon and Ben Affleck appear in together. This is a well made film with a poignant script that in it's own low key manner is quite effective in what it wants to say and the performances by these young and talented actors are all impressive.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read the first 30 comments about this movie.  Not once did anyone comment on the reasons why Greene Fraser never mentioned his religion  the casual joking and common knowledge comments heard in the bathroom. Is it any less a matter of prejudice to use the phrase I jewed him down than it would be to use the term kike? Is telling a derogatory joke about homosexuals any more offensive than calling us fag? This is the only movie I can think of right offhand other than The Laramie Project that makes the point that casual speech can be used as a form of maintaining prejudice. For this reason alone School Ties is an important film. As a survivor of a 1964 prep school much like the one in the movie I can tell you that the scenes and attitudes are accurately presented. I found the characters to be a little onesided yes.  It's rare to meet any person who is as totally focused and determined as the Greene presented here.  Nor is any prejudiced person or group normally so totally open in expression as the good old boys we see in this production.  But that's the most impressive way to show the public just how bad it is to be bigoted or to be the target of bigotry. For the production and acting values I'd give this film 6 on a scale of 10.  For the prestar status performances of Fraser O'Donell Damon and yes even Affleck I'd give it a 7.5 on a scale of 10.  For the message I'd give it 9.5 on that same scale. School Ties is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who sees it. For star followers it has a cool four New Idols in prestar roles to add to their tape collections.  For the activists in the world it is a stark and dramatic example of how prevalent unrecognised bigotry is in our society.".

They murdered Jesus did they? And the Romans had nothing to do with that? Anyway this is a better film than I expected. Not only does it give us an interesting protagonist but it allows us to feel like the outsider he is when he arrives at the elite prep school. Regardless of their religion few people ever get a chance to attend such a ritzy school. Brendan Fraser plays David Green a workingclass Jewish kid who gets a football scholarship to St. Matthews for his senior year. The school is filled with smart and athletic young men destined for Ivy League schools and eventual seats at the head table of our society. The other boys David quickly befriends are played by a who's who of young acting talent just before they became huge stars. Chris O'Donnell Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are all on display. Matt Damon's Charlie Dillion character is a real jerk. All the guys crack little Jewish jokes here and there but once Damon learns the new kid's secret. He cranks the Antisemitism level to really ugly levels.Luckily for these guys David Green knows that he has a great chance of getting into Harvard if he just ignores their jokes as long as they don't find out he's a Jew. Green is a tough kid who's had to fight for everything he has and he could easily beat the snot out of any of them. Once the secret is out the boys he thought were his new friends suddenly become either indifferent to him or his enemies. The new girlfriend from a nearby school who adored him also turns her back once she learns his religion. The film could have stopped there and just been a protolerance kind of exercise but luckily there are other things going on. One of the boys is caught cheating but the faculty doesn't know who. Unless the boy comes forward the entire history class will be flunked for breaking the honor code. Green becomes a suspect because he initially hid his religious identity. Will he to take a fall for the guy who cheated?? The film is thoughtful and has interesting characters where it could have just given us closedminded bigots. Even though we know these guys are antSemites we at least see them as real people with complex problems and motivations of their own. The film boasts some beautiful and realistic locations in most scenes. There are some subplots not fully motivated or fleshed out. What exactly happens to the boy who bolts from his French exam? What became of him after his nervous breakdown? And why did this film feel the need to recylce a gag from the movie Real Genius about putting an intellectual's car inside his dorm room?? Still a very good movie that might make you think twice about cracking ethnic jokes around people you don't know that well. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

Please don't write your reviews based on Damon or Fraser or the co... they're not what is important about the film. The film should make people realise what a disgusting resentful quality antisemitism is and how much jewish kids have had to suffer not just in the 50s but over a massive period of history. But I'm not going to go into a history lecture.This movie touched me as this is a very familiar topic for me. Being born part Jewish in Russia I am well aware of the blunt dumb prejudices that surround Jewish youth throughout school years university admittance and army years. Fraser's character was lucky he was physically strong... Let me tell you there are very few things in this life worse than being a victim of all these prejudices.The story line is nothing special but one characteristic of it is important and truthful  Fraser's drive to succeed. Oh sure very few Jewish kids became football stars most of them had to be become successful through books and study but the point is surrounded by prejudice ignorance and hatred that's the only choice Jews ever had...  they had to strive to be the best or they had no hope of surviving with any dignity. Hence David Green's drive to go to Harvard had nothing in common with that of his classmates. They wanted the highlife and were pushed by their proud arrogant parents David saw Harvard as a way to simply survive.Some users have commented that there are more important issues in the world than this 'minor' bigotry case. Look does that mean every movie should be about East Timorese getting slaughtered just because it's the most important issue of the time? This movie tries to show us how dumb ignorant and blind antisemitism is... and believe me there have been there are and there will be millions of Jewish kids who would relate all too well to this movie.

Gosh is she a bad actress!This is the level of social insight we might expect from a high schooler not a weighty film.Its all a muddle. The reason we still have prejudice in our society is because  like here  we fail to examine it directly. Here it seems oddly conflated with racism.Gentleman's Agreement' was a similarly heavihanded preachy diatribe of no artistic or entertainment value. But it was a whole lot more intelligent and complex in its vision of what antisemitism is.".

Gosh is she a bad actress!This is the level of social insight we might expect from a high schooler not a weighty film.Its all a muddle. The reason we still have prejudice in our society is because  like here  we fail to examine it directly. Here it seems oddly conflated with racism.Gentleman's Agreement' was a similarly heavihanded preachy diatribe of no artistic or entertainment value. But it was a whole lot more intelligent and complex in its vision of what antisemitism is.";

It's very earnest in its portrayal of racism. O'Donnell is the one who has to play the middle. It's all very standard but then there is a great Twelve Angry Men section. I really like that scene.

There's just one problem  he's Jewish but that can be kept a secret. After he steals the spotlight and the girl from the former primary quarterback Damon the secret does what most secrets do  it slips out. And suddenly the star quarterback who was just one of the guys now isn't one of the guys at all. Then there's a cheating scandal and it's all dumped on the Jewish guy...after all cheating is the kind of things that dirty Jews do. Right? But as you might expect it's Damon who maneuvers the situation. And how will it all end? The then young actors do amazing jobs here although Affleck has one of the smaller roles. Fraser and Damon are terrific as is the girl friend  Amy Locane.The one criticism I have is of the scene where in about 30 minutes they dismantle are car and reassemble it in an evil house father's room. No just not possible...at least in that amount of time.But aside from that frivolity if you like serious movies this is a very good one!".

The danger is that it is very easy to overindulge and lose its audience. Or you could turn it into an action flick and fail to capture the novel's message. With Harmony it is the former case.The film opens with an action sequence something that might whet some viewers' appetite but it's the only action scene in the film on this scale which triggers the main character's return to her home country Japan. There she meets with her childhood friend who proceeds on to stabbing herself in the neck in front of our protagonist during their lunch together. Here's where the problems arise. The scene where it is supposed to be of a great shock to the viewers only achieves a meh response due to the fact that the film taking everything slow and calm. There's no sense of urgency to this scene but just plain repugnance to the visual display of blood fountain.Every location every dialogue and every character interaction in this film feel like the viewers are meant to meditate upon them. Characters appear and look important to the plot but then he or she disappears and we never see them again the smuggler the stepmother of another major character the doctor the comrades the other doctor etc. The enigmatic dialogue seems to never get to the point which leaves the audience wishing for subtitles and pause button to decipher what conversation took place.Another problem is the visuals. Normally I'd be praising a Japanese animation's visuals saying how my eyes grow watery just by looking at the screen. But not here. That is not to say the film looks horrible but it actually does in comparison to other animated films made in Japan. Shisha no Teikoku had lots of problems as well but that film at least had top notch visuals. Here everything lacks texture. Characters' faces look very strange in some scenes architecture look absurdly inconvenient the future environment shown in the film is very unremarkable and nothing leaves much of an impression. It doesn't help that the damn camera is constantly swaying around instead of focusing on something. It's always either moving around its characters or showing something else like scenery for example.Now the film does have its charm. Our main protagonist Tuan Kirie is a strong female and lesbian at that character with consciousness and does not have big breasts. Mystery element that fuels the film is Miach Mihie who has eerie vibe radiating from her just by her standing around in the scene. Her charm is seductive and it's no wonder Tuan is dominated by her in childhood. The plot does make logical steps up to some point and is very interesting. Anime fans will enjoy the End of Evavibe as the film progresses. The worldbuilding also works greatly in the film's favor which amplifies the tragedy once it gets violent. Some segments of the film which relies on dialogue in tellnotshow style is done nicely too.Although I kind of liked the film for above reasons there's constant sense that it should have been better. That it could have been better by giving it more urgency making it more shocking and critical in social commentary Japan does have high teen suicide rate. It's another disappointment for Project Itoh. Here's hoping Genocidal Organ is better. Much better.".

	schema:headline " Itoh is a terrible storyteller";
	schema:reviewBody "So I watched the second of the Itoh trilogy of movies regarding existentialism. The Empire of Corpses was bad but could still keep my attention a bit through mindless action scenes and old book references. Harmony fails even at that since it lacks action and is not even animated as well. You can spot the cgi much easier while the artwork is blander.The premise is about a world where pain and suffering have been eradicated thanks to the use of nanotechnology. Anyone taking a medicine stays healthy and happy while also not aging as fast. Unfortunately teenagers cannot be pleased even with a perfect world and feel the need to rebel against it for the sake of rebelling. Our main characters are a bunch of psychotic lesbians who want to see the world burn by committing suicide. And if that sounds completely dumb to you it can easily be explained with the typical excuse of they are teenagers it makes sense not to make sense that anime are constantly using to cover up for bad characterization.So the years go by and only one of them commits suicide while the other two get a job. There is one the plot considers the protagonist although the only thing she is doing is being an excuse for providing infodumps every five minutes. There is absolutely no personality to her other than hating the utopia she is living in. And by the way she is living in an actual utopia since there is nothing wrong with it.The only people who are discontent with it are suicidal angst teenagers. Everybody else has a perfectly happy life. So why do these psychotic lesbians hate this fine society? Because everyone is equally happy and thus everything is the same. It's basically nobody understands me I'm so different adults are stupid. By the way that's completely hypocritical when they all have eye scouters which show numerical statistics for every individual and they are clearly never the same. Your complaints are bull. Even your job is bull. How did you become an investigator when you are so mentally unstable and everybody has access to your statistics? Why don't they fire you for constantly getting drunk and not following orders? Anyways the conflict of the movie is about some angst ass brainwashing people into committing suicide. Not because they want to not because they hate their society but because he takes control of their minds. No actual reason and get ready for a lot of edgy scenes full of gore for the sake of gore. This ass goes as far as demanding every person on earth to kill someone within a week or be forced into suicide. Which causes worldwide chaos as everyone gets crazy and kills everything on sight. Woah this is so mature Turns out the one causing all that is the lesbian who was supposed to be dead because reasons. She has the supernatural ability to control peoples' minds because reasons. And she did everything for the sake of a surprise attack on the eternal. Whatever you ass you killed half the population of earth. She even tries to further justify this genocide by saying she was raped as a child and everyone must feel her pain. Something which did not happen in the utopia but in a barbaric place outside of it. So basically she destroyed a perfectly fine society for something that happened to her not because of that society. She is even goes as far as saying she did it all out of love. She killed half the planet and her best friend because she loved them.And then the movie ends by the plot device that is the protagonist simply shooting the psychotic lesbian. There was no battle no chase no resistance at all. She just sat there waiting to be shot after infodumping her bull for half an hour. What an amazing showdown. There is not even any epilogue. We don't see the after effects of this disaster aka what the survivors did after it was over or how the society changed because of it. We only get scenes of nature with sad music. The author didn't give a damn about people he only cared to say his bull philosophy and wrapping everything up.This is the cardinal sin of most scifi. They treat characters as mouthpieces and kill them off as soon as they served their purpose. There is nobody to care for in the whole movie. Half the population of earth gets slaughtered in a completely hollow way and the only thing the author focuses on is spewing existential dribble and showing us trees and lakes.There isn't even a sense of plot. The protagonist is constantly moving around the world not because she follows clues but because she is told to go somewhere for the sake of infodumps. She could have spent the whole movie talking over her phone and it wouldn't make a difference. Traveling doesn't mean anything it's just pretty colors in the background. The setting doesn't matter nor its people because they are just excuses for existential dribble which will bore the hell out of everyone within a few minutes. Final verdict Itoh is a terrible storyteller.".

The film's examination of sexuality and everything involved with it doesn't for one second sound untrue even when it makes sure that everything being pointed out is expressed frankly and colourfully. It's not everyday we get a story of a heterosexual man falling in love with a homosexual woman and although the concept could easily have resulted in a disaster of a movie Chasing Amy manages to layer everything almost flawlessly. There are no predictable pitfalls in this film and nothing is wrapped up in a neat little package. We are offered a group of characters that are likable but flawed who don't always get or give what we would usually expect. I have to say I never knew what was going to happen next it manages to be consistenly offbeat without being unrealistic. Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams have incredible chemistry together perfectly displaying all the emotional complications a relationship as eccentric as theirs would have. Jason Lee was also outstanding in his role of the vaguely jealous best friend. The only thing that bothered me about this film was there was too much YELLING!! and it was slightly uneven at times. But generally I liked it a lot and I'm just thankful that Kevin Smith is producing such fine work like this it is truly a refreshing escape from Hollywood's formulaic sap.".

How could anyone deny that this screenplay was anything less than original or perfection.  Absolutely intoxicating.  The performances were right on and the writing was magnificent.  Kevin Smith is without a doubt one of the best new writers.  With this movie he goes to a whole new level.  Clerks was great and I think I'm one of the five people that enjoyed Mallrats but Chasing Amy takes the cake.  Nothing else came even close that year. That movie should have made a star out of Joey Lauren Adams.  She gave the BEST performance in 1997 and was robbed of an Oscar nomination as was the script.  The scene outside of the ice rink is more than enough to show just how good she was.  And anyone who can watch that ending the you don't know if you should cry or jump for joy ending and not feel something is heartless.  The movie was great.  It is one of my personal favorites and will always be.".

	schema:reviewBody "To me a film can have no action and no real special effects and still be great.  If that film can take it's characters and make them interesting by making them speak the way we know people do then you are left with a fantastic film.  So is the case with Kevin Smith's wonderful film Chasing Amy.For anyone who thought that Ben Affleck couldn't act watch this movie and enjoy how he plays Holden.  He is honest in his approach to a character that is as complex as any great movie character.  Also cast perfectly is Joey Lauren Adams as his girlfriend and Jason Lee is so good as Banky his best friend and business partner that I really could have seen him with an Oscar nod that year.Kevin Smith's strength is that he knows how people talk and he is honest in his assessment of his characters.  And that is what makes this film the gem that it is.  And did I mention that it is a wonderful romance and it is wickedly funny?If all you've ever seen of Kevin Smith is Clerks then check out this awesome flick.

A really great film.Note  If anyone is a true fan of Jaws  and I like Smith think it is the greatest movie ever made  then watch for the scene in Jaws where Hooper and Quint compare wounds to be parodied hilariously in this film.".

	onyx:emotionText "To me a film can have no action and no real special effects and still be great.  If that film can take it's characters and make them interesting by making them speak the way we know people do then you are left with a fantastic film.  So is the case with Kevin Smith's wonderful film Chasing Amy.For anyone who thought that Ben Affleck couldn't act watch this movie and enjoy how he plays Holden.  He is honest in his approach to a character that is as complex as any great movie character.  Also cast perfectly is Joey Lauren Adams as his girlfriend and Jason Lee is so good as Banky his best friend and business partner that I really could have seen him with an Oscar nod that year.Kevin Smith's strength is that he knows how people talk and he is honest in his assessment of his characters.  And that is what makes this film the gem that it is.  And did I mention that it is a wonderful romance and it is wickedly funny?If all you've ever seen of Kevin Smith is Clerks then check out this awesome flick.  It certainly makes you appreciate how good Smith is at writing characters.  A really great film.Note  If anyone is a true fan of Jaws  and I like Smith think it is the greatest movie ever made  then watch for the scene in Jaws where Hooper and Quint compare wounds to be parodied hilariously in this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Love stories are difficult to do well. So is comedy. Kevin Smith does both. Very very well. Chasing Amy is in my opinion Kevin Smith's best movie Clerks 2nd Dogma 3rd and I really don't know where to start the praise.Traditionally Hollywood romantic comedies are... well bad. Really lame PG13 comedy with some catch phrase repeated ad nauseum and always some sort of hilarious incident involving a baby or a cute dog. And the characters are just as annoying as the lame jokes so ultimately you don't really care about whether or not they get together in the end.Chasing Amy is different. These characters are lifelike.This isn't a romantic comedy for teenage girls. It's a movie for adults. Almost everyone can relate to being a situation where they've loved someone so much but due to certain circumstances you just weren't able to have that person. And I guess that's what Amy's all about. Unrequited love. Well Unrequited love and sexual identity but that's another topic for another day.The real genius of this film is that for all it's serious themes it manages to convey it's message without being at all pretentious. Most independent films have this sort of arrogant pretentious I'm so artistic feel about them.......And I hate that. Smith's success lies in the fact that his movies are meaningful and they're actually funny as well. And Chasing Amy is no exception.In short you'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining and realistic love story than Chasing Amy. It's combination of hilarious dialogue interesting characters and realistic themes makes it a winner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a huge Kevin Smith fan its no wonder I love this movie so much it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Its a close toss up for my favorite Smith movie right next to Clerks. The Plot Holden McNeilBen Affleck and Banky EdwardsJason Lee are two long time best friends and the cocreators of their successful comic book Bluntman and Chronic. One day while they were pushing their comic at a comicsci fi convention they met a girl named Alyssa Jones. Holden immediately falls for Alyssa but his hopes are shattered once he finds out a shocking surprise she's a lesbian. Still they form a great friendship which only makes Holden more in love with her. Once Holden reveals his love to Alyssa they form what seems like a great relationship. Things change however once Banky fears that this friendship will affect their long friendship and Holden has to deal with Alyssa's rich past. The Good This is a very well done movie. Kevin Smith is well known for his creative dialog and clever direction in all of his movies this is no exception. The actors performances especially those of Ben Affleck Jason Lee Joey Lauren Adams and Dwight Ewell is exceptional. You won't find better direction for this kind of movie. I normally don't like love stories but this is one of those rare exceptions. The Bad Nothing really bad about this movie but its not for everyone. First off the movie deals with some really touchy subject matter. Its also one of the most profane movies I've seen. If you are offended of either one of these subjects I wouldn't recommend it.Overall Chasing Amy is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I give it a 1010!".

As loved as it may deservedly be Clerks is remembered for the crude humor rather than the plot while Mallrats which was meant to be a smart amusing teen movie turned out to be little more than a vehicle for Jason Lee's comedic talent. Chasing Amy is radically different combining Smith's trademark superb dialogue believable characters and a heartfelt story it is one of the best most insightful romantic comedies of the '90s and the director's most satisfying picture aside from Clerks I and II.Whereas his first two movies kept referencing other films as soon as there was time to do so Chasing Amy centers on Smith's second great passion comicbooks. In fact it all begins at a convention where Banky Edwards Jason Lee and Holden MacNeil Ben Affleck are signing issues of their successful book Bluntman  Chronic. Afterwards they hang out with fellow artists Hooper X Dwight Ewell and Alyssa Jones Joey Lauren Adams and while Banky spends all of his time arguing with Hooper over the racism in Star Wars one of the funniest things Smith has ever written or the gay subtext in Archie comics something clicks between Holden and Alyssa and soon enough they start seeing each other almost every day. It is obvious something deeper than friendship is in the air and they both know it yet there's a catch Alyssa is a lesbian or at least she used to be one before meeting Holden. Hence the big question can they have a meaningful relationship with her past being such a huge burden? What kind of sacrifices will have to be made?In another film the boyloveslesbian premise would have been an excuse to deliver a 90minute marathon of distasteful gratuitously explicit jokes. Chasing Amy on the other hand is good because it really cares for its characters and whatever crudities there may be never feel excessive or out of place but on the contrary they manage to convey the speaker's emotions more correctly this is particularly true for Jason Lee's foolproof energetic performance. The central love story is honest and touching two characteristics that are evident in the realistic dialogue and acting Adams who hasn't managed to find a decent role ever since portrays Alyssa as a human being not a stereotype and that's what makes her scenes with Affleck always at his best when working with Smith compelling and almost painful to watch.Most of the time Chasing Amy is a perfect balance between grossout humor and tender romance something the director kept toying with on the underrated Jersey Girl where the jokes were less sweary than usual and perfected with his masterpiece Clerks II. There are however a few moments when Smith doesn't understand he has to stop and tells us everything about a certain character's personality whereas he should simply have implied it. Overall though this feature remains one of the most hilarious moving revealing films of the '90s with its best moment saved for the director himself halfway through the movie the mandatory Jay and Silent Bob Jason Mewes and Smith make their appearance. In all the other View Askew flicks they are just incredibly funny. This time Bob breaks his silence and gives a long thoughtful speech that explains the film's title and has more to say about love and relationships than certain movies do in their entire running time. Astonishing.8510".

He insults men who do not fit these stereotypes and gay people in general.The only people I can imagine appreciating and identifying with his characters are themselves clichs in search of an identity or 13 to 25 year old boys who are lacking in life experience and derive their knowledge from comic books and PC games.

To take any serious emotion or distress from such a jabbering highpitched squealing freak of an actress was too much for me! The director seems to have the opinion that he is some sort of artist.

How the male lead could come to such a stupid conclusion that a threesome will solve all his problems is excruciating to watch and probably even more so for women. Can an audience have any sympathy with such ignorantly written characters?

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Smith isn't typically known for mature work  the majority of his films are funny but crude. Chasing Amy his followup to the 1995 box office failure Mallrats is certainly the most adult film he has made in terms of general context. Overall however I was left with mixed feelings.Holden Ben Affleck is the cocreator of a popular comic strip named Bluntman and Chronic. One day at a New York City Comicon Convention a friend of Holden's introduces him to Alyssa Joey Lauren Adams a freespirited adventurous girl whom Holden instantly takes a liking to. As they spend more time together Holden finds himself falling in love. But there's just one problem Alyssa is a lesbian.Holden's best friend and cowriterartist Banky Jason Lee resents Alyssa  both because he is homophobic and afraid of losing Holden. He doesn't trust Alyssa and digs up dirt on her that extends into her high school days when apparently she was not just into chicks.Chasing Amy has moments of rare greatness  the dialogue first of all is excellent. So is the acting. Joey Lauren Adams has been severely underused since Chasing Amy starring in undeveloped romantic roles in comedies such as Big Daddy. Her character Alyssa in Smith's film is threedimensional and her outburst towards the end of the picture is heartfelt and honest. Jason Lee is hilarious in a very believable way never stretching Banky into a farfetched comedic personality and even Ben Affleck manages to remain tolerable. Which is always unusual. I think the problem with Chasing Amy is that it simply tries too hard and lacks a point. Smith attempted to prove to his critics that he was capable of making a realistic sophisticated and complex motion picture and tackles some very very touchy subjects in the process without ever coming to any solid conclusion.Credit must be given where it is due  Smith is an expert at snappy oneliners and good dialogue. But no matter how clever insightful and emotionally developed Smith's everyday jargon may very well be at heart he is still a philistine. One need only listen to five minutes of one of his DVD commentary tracks to realize this. That core immaturity doesn't translate well to the screen in a picture that wants to be taken as something more. It's like a child trying to imitate an adult  the gestures might be there but the experience and cultivation is not.Another major weakness of Chasing Amy is that it is too blunt I think. Example? It's heavily implied that Banky is a repressed closet homosexual. It makes sense and a deleted scene from another of Smith's later films confirms it. But I felt it should never have been addressed at all in Chasing Amy  great films imply they don't stress. A character from Chasing Amy explains to Holden what we're all thinking  maybe Banky has feelings for Holden that he isn't ready to acknowledge. This is too much. It's too clear and not subtle enough. It should have been left up to the audience to use their own perceptions. By the time this explanation occurs in the movie I had already assumed Banky was gay Smith's desire to put it into words seemed anticlimactic and ruined the speculation.That best sums up the entire film really  Chasing Amy has its good parts but the finished product is messy and contradictory and just too damned wordy. It tries at every turn to be insightful honest mature and even epic. The problem with all this is that Smith lacks a point  he wants to say there's nothing wrong with being gay and love is love no matter whether you're male or female but it's clear that deep inside he is a bit like Banky  homophobic and immature. His decision to turn Alyssa into a mistake a woman who has been fooled into lesbianism who is saved by Holden doesn't make sense. I'm not criticizing the film's motive  if it had one I'd judge it based on how well it elucidates it. My own point is that Smith doesn't have one  he's wishywashy one moment preaching to his audience about the dangers of homophobia the next moment turning his lesbian into the very stereotype all lesbians must hate the woman who is afraid of men and deep down inside her heart is actually is attracted to them. I was left wondering what Smith was trying to get across to his audience.For what it's worth my favorite scene from Chasing Amy is when Jay and Silent Bob Jason Mewes and Smith himself show up. Silent Bob's monologue is honest and tender without coming across as being too showy or gushy. Had the entire film matched this one scene it would be a great deal better.".

Additionally to say this was a lesbian movie is more than insulting to lesbians.  This was a typical straight man's view of what it is to be a lesbian i.e. that if she meets the right man it will straighten her out  PUHLEEZ.  Steer clear of this movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched this movie for the first time I thought it was pretty funny but I was younger so I didn't indulge its craftiness as much as I did on the second viewing just recently.  Kevin Smith is a very talented writerdirector who has a knack for offbeat plots and refreshingly original dialogue.  He displays his talent greatly in this offbeat comedy.  One impressive element of Chasing Amy is it contains very little of the standard soapy Hollywoodish romance.  It's very unpredictable and doesn't contain the ending many would probably suspect.  Of course we know that Joey Lauren is going to end up in bed with Ben but there wouldn't be any intrigue or conflict if that didn't happen.  It's what happens afterwards that counts.  The only cliche I spotted was the scene where Ben reveals his love for Joey.  It takes place on a rainy night.  And Joey gets outraged and runs out of the carIN THE RAIN!!  Hello?  Pneumonia?  You ever thought of that?  I think if it was real life she would've waited for Ben to drive her backTHEN shout out her feelings and leave.  Other than that the film approaches the romance genre and lesbianism with sheer originality and sometimes brutal honesty.  In the scene where Jason Lee catches Ben in bed with Joey all we see is his mouth opened wide and his coffee cup dropping to the floor.  None of that melodramatic confrontational crap we usually see when a character is surprised to catch their friend in bed with someone they don't expect.  Though I often appraise Smith's witty dialogue his love for dialogue is also a minor flaw.  In some scenes the characters use so many adjectives and metaphors that it just sounds more written than acted out.  It just doesn't have that flow.  And it's a little unconvincing to have a character use the term fking cksucker over and over again in one scene and delivering an intelligent monologue full of collegelevel SAT words in the next.Despite its minor flaws Chasing Amy is a film like no other.  One that honestly stands alone.  We've seen other films about lesbianism but this is one to use the subject in a mature though profane and nonpreachy manner. It doesn't take advantage of any of the stereotypes.  And I like the surprise at the end where the character who you least expect delivers a thoughtful monologue that is the defining moment of the movie.".

Due to time limitations creative ideas etc. the film makers often need to adjust the story from the book to fit the film. As a lover of both books and film I ask that those who turn a book into a film follow the spirit and the feeling of the book. I believe the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants director and screenwriters did just that.Basically the book tells the story of 4 teenage girls who are experiencing their first summer apart ever since they have known each other since birth. Unbelievably they find a pair of jeans which fits each girl amazingly well although they have very different body shapes. They take this to mean the pants hold some sort of magic so promise to send the pants to each other throughout the summer and use it as a way of keeping in touch with each other thus  the traveling pants. The pants are sent from Tibby staying at home to Bridget in Baja California Mexico at Soccer camp to Carmen with her father in North Carolina to Lena visiting her grandparents in Greece.Three of the story lines are very true to the book although with slight variations. Tibby's storyline is almost a perfect match to the book Bridget's is close and Carmen's is slightly varied showing her in a less mature light than in the book. Lena's story on the other hand is told completely in reverse of the book. However I can understand the need to make this change as the twists and turns of Lena's story in the book would have been difficult to project onto film. The end result the girls experience the same issues in the movie as they did in the book and they change in the way the book indicated. The feel of the movie is the same as that in the book.This film is truly a coming of age story about young high school girls. It is beautifully filmed with lovely scenery from both Greece and Mexico. The actors portraying the young girls are very well cast and match the descriptions from the book. As a librarian I can tell you that no movie can ever equal the movie you make in your head while you are reading a book. But this movie is beautiful in its own right and a lovely story of growing up female and experiencing love passion death and disappointment. The girls learn that the love and friendship they share will help them to get through all the issues of growing up.".

I thought the movie was well done. The characters were believable the acting was great the topics were handled in a manner that was suitable for my preteen to watch. The comments I overheard from the other audience members 99 teenage girls at this Friday matine! were positive. My rating is a combination of my score 8 or 9 and her score 4 or 5. So just a word of caution...if you expect the move to follow the book you may be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Why as a 24 year old girl I LOVED this film...";
	schema:reviewBody "Please don't let this horribly cheesy title keep you away from this cinematic treasure! Writing this review two days after see the movie and I'm still crying. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is the kind of title that evokes Disney Channel movies staring Mickey Mouse Club members or worse Hillary Duff but I swear to you that this movie is so much more. I was in tears from beginning to end as I saw my own insecurities and fears addressed in each one of these characters.First there's CARMEN America Ferrera the writer the Puerto Rican the curvey one I HATE that word and the one who spends the summer with her father and his new family. Carmen's weight issues and absentee father issues hit home to me. In fact the first tears I shed in this movie came at the moment that Carmen drives up to her father's house and learns that he is getting remarried... to a women he lives with... whom Carmen had never met nor even heard of before. I learned only a few months ago over the phone no less that my father was remarried and it's still not something he's talked to me about. Carmen uses the magical traveling pants to get the courage to finally tell her father how sad she is and how much he's hurt her and this was the point in the movie that had me BALLING.Lena Alexis Bledel is the softspoken and shy beauty who spends the summer with her grandparents in Greece. I definitely relate to Lena in her what's the word modesty. She doesn't wear revealing clothes she's not open to new love and she has an overall fear of intimacy. With the help of the pants she meets a beautiful Greek man named Kostas Michael Rady and learns to let love it.Bridget Blake Lively is the tall blond and extremely confidant soccer star who spends the summer in Baja California Mexico at a soccer camp where she spends most of her time trying to seduce her soccer coach Eric Mike Vogel. She's also still grieving the loss of her mother who killed herself. For most of the film I felt no connection to Bridget at all tall blond and athletic I am not. But it eventually hit me. Bridget's persistent pursuit of Eric and her determination to excel at soccer are her means of hiding from her pain. Her main motivation in life is to numb the pain of her mother's death. Who can't relate to that? Tibby's Amber Tamblyn storyline is the most surprising. I didn't expect to be so moved. Tibby is stuck at home for the summer working at a Walgreenslike drugstore filming a documentary or as she calls it a suckumentary and generally hating life and humanity while her friends travel around the world. The traveling pants are accidentally sent to the wrong address and a little girl named Bailey Jenna Boyd finds them and returns them to Tibby. Bailey is intrigued by Tibby's suckumentary and volunteers to help with the film. Though she annoys Tibby at first Bailey turns out to be extremely soulful and has a real gift for discovering each person's humanity and connecting to anyone. This little girl singlehandedly steals the movie and Jenna Boyd is gifted beyond her years.This is NOT a chick flick this isn't a teenypop film and there's NO Hillary Duff or Lindsay Lohan anywhere in sight. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is about the fears and insecurities that all young people feel as they enter adulthood boys and girls. We all have to deal with our bodies with our parents with love and with death and this film deals with all of these issues with honesty sensitivity and maturity. And most importantly this movie reinstates the fact that none of us has to deal with these issues alone.".

I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.The sisterhood consists of four teenage girls. And each of the girls are special. They are each intelligent and introspective. And they take the important things in their lives in a mature serious way. These important things include their personal lives their personal development their families and the history of their families.And the sisterhood is special too. Not because of the trick of the one pair of pants fitting four physically different girls but because the girls care for each other and supply support for each other in a mature way that takes most of us decades to learn. They are there for each other for no ulterior motive. They help each other because there is a goodness and wisdom and healthiness in helping another human being.The four girls are equals in this movie. Not only are they equal in terms of their importance to each other but also in time in front of the camera. This is not a star vehicle for one of these young actresses. Their relationship is the star of this movie.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Picture web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Originally I had to read this book as part of my job reviewing fiction that is aimed at teens through young adults. The most recent trend I've noticed is the current uprise in books that talk about the real Bes of the high school world. The sex scandals the drug busts the foul mouthed youth...I'm only twenty and books like these have me saying What's with those kids today This book wasn't about that. It was about something really admirable that I would hope to read more of an honest friendship. Plus it was well written to the point I was EAGER to finish it. A note to those who haven't read...the audio book is one of the best read I've heard in ages and is worse the listen it has the same actress as the initial trailer announcer So I became a fan of the book and have been following this movie ever since and as a fan I have to say that their are elements I would have liked to see in the movie but the cut or at least the cut at the screening was lengthy but appropriate and did the best I think they could have to capture the book.The real heart of this movie though is between the chemistry of the main actresses. Most of them are playing parts a good five to six years under their actual age and yes they don't all fit the images I had in the book...but it's what they present that shows off. I think it's the added and personal experience these girls have had to go through in real life mostly from age and experience that helps them to really develop these characters. I admire these girls friendships and connections and at the same time I envy them...and even further on it's seems a little too hopeful for it's own good. The world would be a better place if people could hold on like these girls do through thick and thin death and marriage.Still this movie is an excellent movie for teen audiences and it has a lot more depth than recent fluffbits based on novels and old stories See Ice Princess A Cinderella Story Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen etc. It also has enough older audience humor to relate to all ages but not to the dark albeit funny...in a twisted sort of way point of popular hits such as Meangirls. Personally I think it would have done better to have been released around mothers day as it's a movie definitely targeted at the female group. Mom's...you'll like this because it's not quite to the sappy point of the notebook and retains a lot of goodnatured humor. at the same time you may not because it does discuss some teen issues...and it might insight conversations with the offspring As a guy though...I still think it was pretty damn funny in a heartfelt sort of way.".

Because of that i was pretty excited to see the film even though i know it couldn't live up to the book. Sadly i was correct.The acting was actually quite good as was the casting. The only character i didn't like the casting choice regardless of the fact that she did a fine job was Tibby. Tibby in the book is described as small meek and undeveloped. She didn't lookact that way really.The stories themselves were decent. Carmen and Bridget's were almost dead on minus the fact that they left out a vital scene in the end of Bridget's. Tibby's pretty accurate but they left out a whole lot. Lena's was completely changed which i didn't understand why they did.It's a teen chick flick so you expect insane cheesy moments. And the film is full of them. The soundtrack was horrible in my opinion making the film even more ridiculous at times. There were laugh out loud parts that probably shouldn't have been that funny.I think if you're a 1215 year old girl this movie is great for you or if you like teen chick flicks. It covers the crucial topics addressed in the book but lacks the depth Brashares originally had. I suggest seeing it just to see it but don't expect too much.Also if you're a guy stay away. There were maximum 10 guys in the theatre when i saw it and each one looked 12 dead in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "It must be really hard to make a chickflick. Take a couple of young female leads some strong and some insecure characters throw in a couple of love stories preferably one about a forbidden andor impossible love some personal problems and death and you have basically all the ingredients you need. But then again all genres are of course more or less like this. Throw in a couple of scares in a horror movie some explosions in an action flick etcetera. You just either dig a genre or you just don't. Chickflicks are obviously just not my thing.Of course chickflicks are more or less all the same because they feature all of the usual ingredients which I just mentioned. The movie also knows this so it tries to throw in an original concept about a pair of pants that travels between 4 different befriended owners who are spending their summer holiday for the first time away from each other. To me this whole pants thing just felt like an excuse to connect all of the 4 different stories within the movie which are focusing on the 4 main characters.Basically when you put 4 episodes of a random similar American TVseries in a row you'll have a movie just like this. The story features all of the and as much drama as you could expect.Still the movie is not an horrible one and yet is also knows to become an original one with its approach and story which in my opinion is mostly due to the leading actresses of the movie. They give the movie some life and emotion. It's also no coincidence that these actresses are leading ones in some successful TVseries of which some got launched after this movie while others already had a successful television career prior to this movie. They are also acting well with each other in this movie which makes them look convincing as a group who has been friends since childhood. I especially liked Alexis Bledel very natural seeming acting style for this movie even though normally I'm not a too big fan of her acting skills in many other things. Basically credit needs to go to all of the leading actresses but lets also not forget the young Jenna Boyd who is a childstar that isn't annoying for a change and can also really act as she proofs in this movie with a very difficult and hard to play role at such a young age She was only around 12 at the time of this movie..Thing with chickflicks or most romantic movies for that matter is that they pretend to be just like life and realistic with its story and approach but of course life as portrayed in these sort of movies just isn't true. You could say that the movie are 'falsyrealistic'. But apparently this is just a thing to seems to attract teenagewoman making these sort of movies and this movie in particular also a perfectly watchable one for them.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Chickflicks are obviously just not my thing.Of course chickflicks are more or less all the same because they feature all of the usual ingredients which I just mentioned. The movie also knows this so it tries to throw in an original concept about a pair of pants that travels between 4 different befriended owners who are spending their summer holiday for the first time away from each other. To me this whole pants thing just felt like an excuse to connect all of the 4 different stories within the movie which are focusing on the 4 main characters.Basically when you put 4 episodes of a random similar American TVseries in a row you'll have a movie just like this. The story features all of the and as much drama as you could expect.Still the movie is not an horrible one and yet is also knows to become an original one with its approach and story which in my opinion is mostly due to the leading actresses of the movie. They give the movie some life and emotion. It's also no coincidence that these actresses are leading ones in some successful TVseries of which some got launched after this movie while others already had a successful television career prior to this movie. They are also acting well with each other in this movie which makes them look convincing as a group who has been friends since childhood. I especially liked Alexis Bledel very natural seeming acting style for this movie even though normally I'm not a too big fan of her acting skills in many other things. Basically credit needs to go to all of the leading actresses but lets also not forget the young Jenna Boyd who is a childstar that isn't annoying for a change and can also really act as she proofs in this movie with a very difficult and hard to play role at such a young age She was only around 12 at the time of this movie..Thing with chickflicks or most romantic movies for that matter is that they pretend to be just like life and realistic with its story and approach but of course life as portrayed in these sort of movies just isn't true. You could say that the movie are 'falsyrealistic'. But apparently this is just a thing to seems to attract teenagewoman making these sort of movies and this movie in particular also a perfectly watchable one for them.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com";

The four actresses were up to the material and were able to convey their characters' strengths and weaknesses effectively. I also appreciated as a male that the young men in the film were shown as caring and decentnot just dreamboats funny sidekicks or sexcrazed drunken frat boysthe other male stereotypes in so many films aimed at teens. This is a movie I think most females can relate to and that most mature viewers could enjoy except maybe for the guys who are still in arrested development and think that the only good movie is one where people and things get blown up or otherwise destroyed.

I had gotten her to read the book before we saw it and we both enjoyed it so when we heard about the screening we jumped at the chance to go.The movie is about four friends Carmen Tibby Lena and Bridget. They've been friends since even before birth as their mothers took Lamaze classes or something like that together. Throughout the movie there are flashbacks to when they were little kids. The movie takes place in the summer the first one they've really spent apart. Before they take off in different directions they discover a pair of jeans that magically fit each of them perfectly. They decide to send the pants to each other on and off throughout the summer. Carmen goes to visit her divorced or so she thinks father Tibby makes a documentary Lena visits her family in Greece and Bridget goes to a soccer camp in Mexico.Big things happen to each of them over the summer. Carmen finds out that her dad is engaged a woman with two kids who's opposite to her mom white southern and kinda bland. After spending some time with them she freaks out and leaves. Tibby thinks she's going to be bored to death working at Walmans even if she does film everything but when she meets a dying girl her summer isn't so boring after all. Lena almost drowns while sketching on the docks in Greece but then she falls in love with her savior who unfortunately her family hates. Bridget makes a big mistake at her soccer camp when she goes after a coach too strongly and he responds leaving her to regret her decision. But by the end of the movie everything is all right and the girls have come together again at Carmen's father's wedding.All of the acting in this movie was great. Some of the story lines and characters in the book were changed sometimes actually making the movie better. I would recommend this to a friend.8 out of 10 stars.".

I am a sucker for road movies so that was part of the appeal for me... traveling different locations the laundromat the snack bar with the giant globe and the Big KMart at 2AM. I expected Ben's bridetobe to be a crashing bore or uptight priss so the audience would root for Sarah and Ben. But she was funny and sharp also and you don't feel like the marriage would suck all the life out of Ben as it seemed to have for others in the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Two days before his wedding Ben's grandfather has a heart attack while dancing with a stripper.  Due to the delay Ben's fianc Bridget flies ahead to Savannah to make the preparations.  Ben catches a plane later the day and meets freespirit Sarah.  When the plane is in a minor crash the two join up to head to Savannah by any way other than road leading to one comic' delay after another.  Meanwhile the two become a little closer and Ben begins to doubt that marriage is for him.I first saw this in the cinema with my girlfriend at the time in a fit of trying to be seen to be giving and willing to watch silly films that she wants to see.  At the time I was particularly untaken by the whole film despite the odd amusing touch.  A few years on she bought it on video  she likes the silly films she can watch with her friends  and I gave it another go.  The film is sadly as poorly pitched as I remember it it isn't light enough to be funny and it isn't well enough written to be an involving drama.  However by trying to do both it fails to do either well.The light part is clearly indebted to Planes Trains  Automobiles' in it's makeup with cross country japes and one mishap after another.  However to even compare the laughs in that film with the low number in this is well laughable.  The film tries to have some hilarious' set pieces but none of them are more than amusing.  Even the support characters who wander in and out only ever manage a few good lines.  What makes this harder is the serious side to the film where Sarah has a child and an abusive husband and Ben gets nothing but advice not to marry.  This element is present all the way through and makes the film much more of a drama than a comedy but because it wants to be funny as well the drama doesn't really work very well.Affleck is a noncharacter here and doesn't have the charisma to really involve the audience.  Bullock is normally good but this is outside of her normal character and she doesn't wear the difficult edges well.  The two have a reasonable chemistry that helps them through the rough patches but they don't fizz or spark together.  The support cast throws up a few interesting faces who give good performances including Ronny Cox Zahn Tierney and a few others.The film has been applauded for the realistic lowkey ending which is certainly better on paper than the usual formulaic ending and on this I pretty much agree.  It doesn't spoil the film simply because the 30 minutes before this are so very serious and not funny.  On top of this the film also has some nice directorial touches in slowmo rain and hail storms.  However the impact of the emotional climax in a swirling wind of flower petals is rather spoilt by the really poor back projection used to carry it off.Overall though this film is a bit of a letdown as it manages to only half work as a comedy and as a drama although it does have some nice touches that make it worth seeing as long as you know what to expect.".

We didn't have high expectations except to be entertained. And we found it very entertaining and not particularly predictable. Affleck the prospective groom has to make his way to Savanna in two days after a plane problem complicated by an arriving hurricane. He meets up with the ditsy Bullock and both of them learn quite a bit about themselves. If you watch the special features on the DVD Bullock explains how every one you meet even short chance meetings have some impact on you and this is a large part of what the movie tries to convey. And it does it very well. There's good acting lots of interesting developments and a very good story in total. I give it 7 of 10. It is a much better movie than I expected.The DVD picture is very well done and the sound track likewise with appropriate use of the rear surround channels. My only complaint? Not enough bass rumble during the lightning and thunder scenes during the storms.July 2010 update Saw it again a pretty entertaining movie with a good message.".

There were enough laughs to keep it lite and enjoyable. The gay bar was a real hoot. Ben did a superb acting job doing his dance all be it Sandy does'st hurt the eyes. The one thing I liked is this movie is not a tear jerker. Most of Sandy's movies have me shedding tears like a water works. The story line surely shows that people live their lives in very different ways and that gives the movie credence. What's to not like? Easy to follow has Sandy in it what more could you want? One criticism what did they use to put on sandy's eye makeup on a putty knife?".

Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock star as airline passengers brought together by the forces of nature while Ben Affleck's character Ben Holmes is on his way to his wedding. Maura Tierney portrays his fiance and she brought life to a character that was in the background. This is the perfect set up for Forces Of Nature because it seems when Ben and Sarah Lewis make progress the forces of nature somehow get in the way.Maybe it's a sign that Ben is with wrong lady or maybe it's a way to let Ben think about the future. As I was viewing this film I thought to myself Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock must have had fun making this film because it seemed that every time they were on screen together they were enjoying each other's company. One disaster after another occurred but Ben and Sarah made the best out of the situation and did a pretty good job.One outstanding performance came from the late David Strickland in his final film role. It was unfortunate to hear about Strickland's death because his role in this film showed the world that he can act well on the big screen. I was smiling every time he was on screen because I knew I would get something special from his performance.Forces of Nature is a wellwritten film that I found to have a lot of heart and dealt with many issues. I suggest that everyone check out Forces Of Nature because any and all of the Ben Affleck or Sandra Bullock fans out there will enjoy the film.".

Let me back up a little. The chance encounter and evolving relationship between the two principal characters follow a familiar track. Even then clich notwithstanding the movie was terribly funny to watch. Also remember that I had to watch it under the barbarous conditions of constant TV commercial interruption and with no ability to pause it at the times I wanted to. The team of Affleck and Bullock and particularly the latter was the reason. The role fit Bullock like a glove and we see her at her very best. In addition to the funny parts the showdown' scene in which they gave each other a piece of their minds while again quite predictable was well acted with a good mix of fire and poignancy. The ending which I really like while on the surface coming across as an unpredictable twist was not entirely out of the blues and here we come back to Tierney. This actress has so much unexplainable charm at least in this movie that subconsciously we empathize a lot with her. But it's also Affleck and Bullock credit to all three of them that accomplish a delicate balance that lifts this movie a notch above its peers. The ending scene is simply beautiful.".

To top it all off the twist at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy.

Yes there's a little bit of drama involved but overall it's a comedy like Planes Trains and Automobiles. And you should watch it as a sort of freewheeling comedy. Overall not a bad film.

	schema:reviewBody "I take on board all the criticisms cited here about this film and I accept that most of them are justified but I have to say that I had an enjoyable hour watching it missed the first 20 minutes... cooking my tea. Yes it is clichd the plot has been done many times before the script is often disjointed and has more holes than a Swiss cheese the characters are left half painted the actors are playing to type though that never hurt Bob Hope Cary Grant Carole Lombard etc. etc and elements of the story seem to be largely superfluous the most egregious example being the climactic hurricane but it is a romantic comedy... and I found it both romantic and gently funny in places. The weaknesses in the script and the editing can't be laid at the casts feet and they perform really well. Sandra Bullock and Benn Affleck's romance isn't the most believable you'll come across but they do work well together and have the chemistry needed to carry the heavily flawed plot. It also should be noted that very little in the story is believable so much so that at one point Affleck and Bullock arrive at a bank where Ben Affleck is due to pick up some money that will enable them to get to Savannah only to find the bank engulfed in flames. They turn to each other and laugh at the sheer improbability of it all it's as if the characters are momentarily saying to the audience yeah! we know that you know that it's all so fantastical and contrived... so don't worry it's meant to be. Lazy script writing or a foray into the realm of magical realism? The former I suspect but the film obviously set out to have a fairy tale quality about it and it has enough charm wit and warmth to compensate for the holes in the script. Sadly many of the comical shoots do seem to inexplicably wither before they get a chance to bear fruit but the comedy is without exception wellplayed by the cast. It just needed tighter scripting.I can't believe it has such a poor rating on IMDb  it has many faults but I was contented to spend an hourandahalf watching Sandra Bullock looking lovely and being charming and witty on screen. Compared to so much of the exploitative clichd adolescent emotionally empty fantasy violence out there that gets higher ratings 'Forces of Nature' is Palm D'Or material... maybe it's rather naff title hasn't helped it...".

	schema:reviewBody "Forces of Nature is a very unusual romantic comedy. Unusual in that it seems determined to avoid all the natural conventions you would expect from the genre. In fact as I watch it there's something about the film that places it just a little outside the mainstream. I don't mean it would be embraced by the indie crowd. Especially with stars like Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck at the helm. But it is not your standard romcom.Forces of Nature is a film that borrows a few plot lines from the superb Planes Trains  Automobiles. But instead of a businessman trying to get home for Thanksgiving saddled with an annoying travelling companion instead we have a man trying to get to his wedding and meets a free spirited woman along the way who might just be the girl of his dreams.Ben Holmes Affleck is an uptight publisher on his way to Savannah to be married to his fiance Bridget. But the plane he's on never even gets off the ground when a pigeon gets sucked into the engine turbine. Seated next to him is Sarah Bullock one of these eccentrics you tend to meet on public transportation.Ben is unwilling to wait for another flight to Savannah and since she's headed in the same direction Sarah wants to help Ben get to his wedding on time. But of course their journey proves to be anything but smooth filled with detours jail cells and all night KMarts.Although Forces of Nature is slightly predictable I do have a certain affection for the film. Perhaps because it is willing to take the whole romantic comedy genre in strange directions. Sandra Bullock one of my favourite actresses is no stranger to romcoms. But in this film she plays a slightly more edgier character than what I've seen of her previous work.Sarah is the complete opposite of Ben. Where he is a tense uncertain man who has to think everything through Sarah is an impulsive freethinking spirit who goes with the flow. But her willingness to be so spontaneous sometimes leads to problems. Like the scene when a train they're on stops in the middle of the track and she actually climbs on top of one of the carriages and invites Ben up just to feel alive. But the carriages are uncoupled and they end up seriously sidetracked.Forces of Nature does have some unexpected depth. Granted the screenplay is a little contrived the way it keeps throwing up obstacles to prevent Ben from reaching his wedding. Its all designed to keep Ben and Sarah in each others company. But that comes with the territory. And we do find out some surprising things about Sarah over the course of the film.Naturally of course the more time Ben and Sarah spend with each other they begin to open up to each other and a strange sort of attraction develops. But not exactly love. Sarah helps Ben to loosen up and Ben begins to question whether or not marriage is such a good idea now. But FON raises some fascinating and unexpected left field turns.Ben believes he may be falling in love with Sarah but she doesn't agree. After all they've only known each other for inside of two days. How could he possibly love a complete stranger who only just walked into his life a short time ago? She helps Ben to reexamine his feelings for Bridget and make the right choice in the end.FON is never as outright funny as it should be. But then maybe its not trying to be. It tries to ground the trappings of a romantic comedy in more serious surroundings. Its nowhere near as successful as the wonderful Lost in Translation but FON does have some pleasant surprises in store. Bullock is terrific and plays one of her most fascinating characters to date and although Affleck is as stolid as ever at least its in keeping with the character he's supposed to be playing.The ending is a little downbeat especially for Sarah's character. I genuinely did feel real sadness for her in the end. Bullock does such a great job of fleshing out Sarah's character I was left with genuine concern over her future.Forces of Nature is no classic but it does have some unexpected merits. It would be a shame if it faded into obscurity.".

Even when Ben decided that he'd better do the right thing and marry his fiance he just didn't seem to make the decision with all his convictions. It's definitely art imitating life when it comes to love commitments in Hollywood. As far as all the symbolism many people have written about here it's just hard to take any of it seriously in this love farce of a movie.

He teams up with Sarah Bullock who also needs to get to Savannah quick and they start an eventful trip that will change both of them...Comment Sweet comedy with some nice remarks about love and marriage. Very good performance from Bullock as the very impulsive character Sarah and Affleck is good as well as the calmer not so emotional Holmes. The story is good coherent through all the twists and turns. Some of the quirks are very predictable some more surprising. Most of them are more or less funny though or at least sweet or cute. A good movie for a rainy afternoon...610".

	schema:reviewBody "Forces Of Nature got my attention from the start and didn't let up until the end. Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock star as airline passengers brought together by the forces of nature while Ben Affleck's character Ben Holmes is on his way to his wedding. Maura Tierney portrays his fiancee and she brought life to a character that was in the background. This is the perfect set up for Forces Of Nature because it seems when Ben and Sarah Lewis make progress the forces of nature somehow get in the way.Maybe it's a sign that Ben is with wrong lady or maybe it's a way to let Ben think about the future. As I was viewing this film I thought to myself Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock must have had fun making this film because it seemed that every time they were on screen together they were enjoying each other's company. One disaster after another occurred but Ben and Sarah made the best out of the situation and did a pretty good job.One outstanding performance came from the late David Strickland in his final film role. It was unfortunate to hear about Strickland's death because his role in this film showed the world that he can act well on the big screen. I was smiling every time he was on screen because I knew I would get something special from his performance. Forces Of Nature was a film where Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock made what it is today number one at the box office. I suggest to any Ben Affleck or Sandra Bullock fans out there  to check out Forces Of Nature.".

Of course Im a huge Sandra Bullock fan and saw nothing wrong with her role in the film.  Affleck on the other hand irritated me a bit.  He came across as weak crap and silly on most occassions.  A lot off pple say Sandy carried the entire film on her shoulders  I could agree.  Without the character 'Sara' the film would be lost as I say most of the film suddenly revolves around her and her personality.  I also love Sara's make up style.  I would say because Sandy naturally has strong bold features she was able to carry it off esp with brown eyes.....and it worked!  Believe me if I had similar features I would be wearing the same......  But this is how I saw it  a guy going to get married but we can see in his face hes dreading it disaster strikes at airport Sara was there and to me Sara saved him.....in a sense as someone said here she made him see how he had cold feet. Of course she has her own personal probs and the scene where she meets Karl made me feel embarrassed for her in how Karl said what he said. Noone likes to be made to look a baffoon in front of strangers.  And the two most likely had this physical attraction grow between them but mentally were not suited to each other.Sara has a very quirky funny freespirit goodhumoured type of personality......so as Ben is stuck with her he sees just how much she is different from Bridgette and very attractive too!  Remember this is a film I know so many pple out there want films to be very realistic but sometimes the odd magical specialeffects film where there is fun in a story of a journey can be a nice break and refreshing to watch!  And in films we can play around and create the nonrealistic!  I applaud the makers and cast except Affleck on this film.........as its one I really really enjoy mainly because of quirky Sara!  A huge 9 outta 10 from me!".

Dogma is by no stretch of the imagination an antiCatholic movie. It embraces religion and points out the potential and actual problems that can occur within any religious institution.

	schema:reviewBody "Dogma isn't the kind of comedy that most people will find themselves holding onto their guts during. It's more the secondlong ha! kind of comedy.That simply means Kevin Smith's writing is clever enough to the point where you will be pleasantly shocked by some of the conversations and events of the film and think it all rather amusing and humorous. It's not hilarious it's just clever and a bit funny.The premise is rather interesting and surprisingly from a more fantasyesquire genre than Smith traditionally dabbles with. Loki Matt Damon and Bartleby Ben Affleck are more or less fallen angels that have found a way back into heaven. They must be stopped or the world will come to a screeching halt so a seemingly random protagonist named Bethany gets charged by God to stop them. Simple but the slick nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.The film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations tothepoint and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock who plays an apostle and Alan Rickman who plays God's messenger voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.Getting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way the conversations and the philosophy that come about that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written which keeps the film interesting.It's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events but Dogma is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.".

One rough point was that a great deal of dialogue came of as expostiory  there was simply such a massive backstory 2000 years of religious history...go fig... that it seemed at times that the plot had to fight its way through the background information.

I wonder if this was intentional or if it was a continuity issue?  The casting of God was simply inspired  her appearance was actually one of the highlights of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Dogma is one of Kevin Smith's most controversial films a smartly written comedy that takes jabs against the Catholic Church and religion in general and it is very much a cult classic which my friends from college raved about.Bethany Linda Fiorentino is a catholic woman who works in an abortion clinic who is given a mission from Metatron Alan Rickman the Voice of God to go church in New Jersey. She has to stop two fallen angels Loki Matt Damon and Bartleby Ben Affleck who have found a loophole that they can reenter Heaven but if they do that they would destroy all of existence because God's word is meant to be infallible. Fortunately or unfortunately Bethany is joined by Jay and Silent Bob Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith the thirteenth apostle Rufus Chris Rock as Loki goes on a killing spread and a demon called Azreal Jason Lee tries to make Loki and Bartleby success in their objective.Dogma is a sharply written comedy that is constantly funny. Smith makes a dialogue driven comedy filled with comical exchanges and great character inactions. Smith's trademarks of film related dialogue and jokes at the expense of Jay but the best parts is the satire of religion and his showcasing of knowledge of Catholicism combined with clever lines about the religion.Sometimes Smith does stand on his soapbox about religion but for the most part the satirical jabs are one target. We get satire from all angles from a Cardinal trying to get the church to appeal to younger worshipper by doing it in the most patronising way including a 'hey Jesus' and comic book art for its title 'Catholicism Wow'. There are criticisms about how The Bible has be rewritten to suit certain groups with the Bible being whitewashed though ignoring that Jesus and the apostles would have mostly have been of MiddleEastern appearance and women having villainous roles.Affleck and Damon were great together as the fallen angels having great dialogue and discussions particularly in the beginning and a scene in a boardroom for a children's character. Alan Rickman was also a comedy highlight playing against type as the Voice of God someone who has great lines and adds serious emotion depth when needed. He added gravitas and gave the role his all.Kevin Smith has often stated that he thinks he is not a particular good director but with Dogma he is able to keep a fast pace he knows how to shoot the dialogue sequences and can add a scene of tension when needed i.e. the boardroom scene. Smith is competent with the action sequence at the end and he knows how to use his bloodpacks. The general look and tone of the film where Reaper which Smith directed the pilot got its influences from.The film does occasional take a misstep such as Smith being at time very preachy and there is a demon made from faecal matter which was very immature and out of place for a smartly written film.On a final note Howard Shore of the Lord of the Rings fame provided the score for Dogma and much his other work he gives Dogma a top score. He uses plenty of choir beats and singers to add to the experience.Dogma is a highly enjoyable comedy that is intelligently written and very funny. It is a film deserving of its cult classic status.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this film was long overdue. I had heard of Kevin Smith's cult following and had experienced the wonderful ride that Chasing Amy was. To add to that the concept behind Dogma was pretty darn cool. The cast was big the canvas huge and the agenda enormous. But none of it could salvage this sinking vessel. All the king's horses and all the king's men and so forth.Kevin Smith's greatly touted skill has been his dialog. He is arguably among the finest pens that write longwinded tirades witty comebacks and insightful observations. Remarkably Dogma showed an utter lack of sophistication or tact. The moments that made me laugh could be counted on the fingers. Of one hand. Of E.T. I have seen the man in action not more than two days ago when he had come our university for the third run of his An Evening with Kevin Smith show. I just can't imagine how someone who had our rapt attention for five whole hours could come up with embarrassing dialog like in this film. The trite and corny lines almost overloaded my Cringeometer.The whole affair had a thick coat of amateurism on it. No doubt films such as Clerks and Chasing Amy aren't known for their polish and slickness but this film has the sensibilities of a highschool production. Blocky edits and choppy transitions make an already tedious film all the more unbearable. The characters are mere sketches with a pretense of a background or a personality. It almost seems like everyone's just being themselves while knocking off a few beers and reading out the lines halfassed. It is hard to believe anyone took anything seriously on the sets.Dogma begins with a few disclaimers about how it is supposed to be humorous and not intended to offend anyone. I seriously doubt anyone who sees the movie would be offended by it. Except perhaps fans of Kevin Smith and the discerning members of the audience. The philosophy presented in the movie is so thin you could have it instead of the Atkins diet. I have heard deeper words from people who have put a gallon of beer behind them. I am sure some or most of the ideas have come from such evenings of drunken revelry.This is a film without redemption. Quite unbecoming for a film that almost embraces the teachings of Christ.".

In comparison Dogma is trite forced laborious and worst of all unfunny.The problem with Smith is and this infects all his movies he thinks his mundane observations on life can sustain not just two or three hours but a whole catalogue of films.Clerks worked because it was fresh amateurish and somewhat fearless. It was the first time audiences were exposed to Smith.And he came out swinging  this is what I think about censorshipporn jocks religion love the system. It was a movie about rebellion and this resonated with a lot of white 15yearold males.But you can't make movie after movie on the same premise. Filmmakers are meant to grow Cohen brothers and take audiences with them.In this sense those 15yearolds who followed Smith and who he owes his career to have been cheated. His thoughts on Christians and I'm an atheist are the same he had 15 years ago. Yet he still has his faithful followers shell out to see them writ large every couple of years.His growth or lack of it as a filmmaker is outpaced by his budgets. When 10000 Clerks suddenly becomes 10 million Dogma and yet all you get are the same gags surely audiences have a right to feel cheated and shortchanged.I feel sorry for Smith. I'm sure sitting through one of his films is as frustrating and unpleasant for him as it is for me.Here is a filmmaker who tried to branch out Jersey Girl but failed catastrophically. This forced him to revert back to dick jokes and resort to Hollywood mechanisms  sequels star cameos  to sustain a career. The very things he thrashed against in Clerks.He wants to be taken seriously as a filmmaker but at the same time uses gay jokes and bestiality to get a laugh. While this is quite obviously a sign of a director lacking vision or inspiration Smith claims these devices are his way of keeping it real a kind of 'hey I'm still the same guy I was 20 years ago success hasn't changed me'. Damn straight.And that's where my real annoyance with Smith comes from. If he just put his hand up and admitted to being lucky because he built a career off one film and now gets paid to do what he loves I'd be happy.Instead he is a conceited git who tries to pass off his films as something more than uninspired garbage.I see his latest film is about a cop Bruce Willis whose baseball card is stolen. Oh the hilarity".

I don't know who told Kevin Smith he was funny but whoever that person is needs a roundhouse kick to the face.Almost every one of Smith's punchlines is a swear word. That's funny if it's limited I have no problem with swearing in comedies Midnight Run and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang are two of my favorite movies. I could have tolerated it if the movie actually had some amusing humor in it butalas there was none.The only part that made me snicker slightly was a joke ripped off from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The only part where I laughed was when the main character sprayed Alan Rickman with a fire extinguisher.Of course the kicker came at the end where Smith tries to play the serious card and lay out some honest criticism of Catholicism. Generally speaking I don't like this method of criticism whatever the subject because it prevents the audience from critically analyzing it.

	schema:reviewBody "Overrated would be my review for most of Kevin Smith films.  I am still not sure how on Earth he has such a cult following.  The only film of his that was good was Chasing Amy and even that had its flaws.  He also has the pleasure of directing a film that is on my top five worst films list which is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.  Be that as it may my problems with Dogma are a little different than most of his films.  The first time I saw it I kinda liked it.  The second time I realized how bad it was.  First of all choosing to satarize the catholic church especially in film form is like writing a love poem.  It's been done so many times you had better do something new or different Smith does neither of these.  I think of the films of Buneul Felini certainly the Monty Python stuff certain Woody Allen films and so forth and that's what I think of as good satire of the church.  There are countless others that did the subject so much better than here.  The biggest problem that I had with Dogma is that the film had no idea what it wanted to be.  It kept switching from semiserious film to farce.  Normally I don't have a problem with genre bending but here it shouldn't be done.  If this film was a farce than all the serious elements are out of place and pointless.  If this film is suppose to be more serious say just a normal variety of comedyfor an example As Good as it Gets all the farcicle elements become really asinine.  Take the reasoning for why the universe is going to be wiped out of existence.  If this is not a farceand I mean Marx Brothers Monty Python brand of farce then that idea is so ridiculous it doesn't deserve to be thought of.  First of all if we are focussing on the catholic church perhaps we should consider what they actuall believe.  According to the biblenot a bible nut just happen to know this angels can't be redeemed.  Period.  No confession no archway they are angels and not humans.  According to this films premise if Lucifer walked through the archway he would be able to go back to heaven.  Of course he'd have to cut his horns off I would imagine going with Smiths wing thing.  In this case why didn't Azreal do it?  He was also an angel cast down why couldn't he walk through the arches and undo all of creation? They are not human beings and therefore not subject to the same rules. End of discussion.  Too much of this film is trying to make a serious commment on religious dogma and it tries to do so by ignoring what the catholic church and the bible actually says.  Couldn't Smith come up with something not totally idiotic to hinge the film on?  Since this is the base of the films story I must say that this film is completely pointless.  Outside of that the Jay and Silent Bob stuff here is really annoying and their pressence is pointless and forced.  Then of course there was the scene where Kevin Smith showed how bad of a writer he is when he gets out of the S Demon sequence by using odor spray.  This is moronic and worthy of a Junior High school laugh.  Even S Demon repelantala Batman style would have been funier.  The truth is Smith knew of no better way to get out of the scene and he is a very sloppy writer.  He isn't much better as a director as there is absolutely nothing visually interesting about this film and that is the directors MAIN job.  We are after all talking about a visual medium. In the end seriously don't waste your time with this it is horrible.".

Even Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith were no good in this one.The script is just terrible. I'm a big Kevin Smith fan but almost every line in this one is cringeworthy and especially those said by Linda Fiorentino.The whole story is just a jumbled messit seemed very much made up on the fly as they went along.And wow is it long. And boring. And not even a little funny.This film seems to be trying to be a critique of organized religion on some level and so I want to make it clear that I am not saying negative things out of some loyalty to some religion. I'm not a religious nutjust the opposite. I'm completely nonreligious. Religion is the single strangest thing about humanity to me.I have no understanding of any positive thing that's been said about this film. It is one of the very few films I have given a 1 rating to. I can't believe one of my favorite directors made something this awful.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure what I find harder to believe the idea that people actually found this film funny or the fact that it is considered controversial. This is satire at the level of the Carry On films when a film uses a giant poo monster for supposed comedic effect you know your time is wasted on it. I watched this expecting to chuckle instead I came out feeling nauseated and patronised. At least half an hour of the film AT LEAST is spent with characters explaining the plot background and details to other characters. Can you say yawn? This is the first Kevin Smith movie I've seen and the man is the biggest overwriter I've had the displeasure of coming across. The characters just cannot shut up! This would be fine if the dialogue was witty or insightful but instead it's lots and lots of swearing the word fck loses it's already minimal impact after the fiftieth time you hear it in one scene and supposedly deep religious discussions that are immature and sound as if they were written by a twelve year old who just became interested in theology.It's near impossible to see who this film appeals to Smith shoots for pleasing all and ends up satisfying none. Those who enjoy the childish Dude Where's My Brain jokes will no doubt be crushingly bored when the characters decide to sit and talk inanely about something unfunny AGAIN while those who like the pathetic attempts at religious satire and discussion of the Catholic Church will cringe at the afore mentioned poo monster and a succession of equally puerile kindergarten comedy.The film is nowhere near as clever or anarchic as it thinks it is indeed it has incredibly tame messages and the characters are obnoxious. The protagonist a female distant relation of Christ whinges so damn much you want to slap her overacting face. Indeed pretty much every person in the film overacts only Alanis the only person with no lines significant? and Salma Hayek who's a decent comic performer That's why he's The King and you're a schmuk' come out with dignity intact. I should also say Silent Bob's expressions are pretty amusing as are the odd one liners in Jay's rants. However while Ben Affleck isn't as bad as he can be he's still pretty terrible and Matt Damon does an impressive impression of wallpaper throughout. When the film shoots for drama it's embarrassing. When the two fallen angels have an argument and one compares the other to Lucifer we're supposed to take it seriously but the poor writing and acting make it an utter nonmoment. At one point the protagonist after another annoying rant which I'm assuming is Smith's amateurish way of getting across how his characters feel as this is an insanely whiny bunch of people actually runs drops on her knees in the rain and screams up the sky WHY GOD!?!?!?! WHHHHHHHHHHHY!?!?!?' This was one of the only genuine laughs I got from the film it's an utter clich and this supposedly ironic cleverclever film tries to use it as drama worrying.Again I ask who actually found this controversial? Bible Belt Christians? Devout Catholics? Those same groups find 'HARRY POTTER' controversial it's hardly an achievement. The only other thing I could see as being controversial was the pushing of the prochoice abortion movement and while I am prochoice such plugging made me uneasy as prolifers are demonised in the film somewhat unfairly. If Smith is going to enter the abortion debate which is inadvisable in the first place for a film most likely to appeal to wannabe alternative' folk gagging to prove their antiestablishment leanings it should at least be fair and give the points of both sides. It's also obvious that the man directing is a Catholic himself and the film comes across as just more selfloathing rambling apologies from a liberal middleclass white male for the perceived wrongs his ancestors have done to the world. If there was any satire in the film I didn't catch it was the scene where God made all the bodies disappear satirical? Worryingly it appears not. Besides satirising the farcial exploits of the Catholic Church is about as hard as exhaling carbon dioxide.The film though isn't a total waste of time. There are some nice points the boredom of churchgoing is articulated adroitly for example and there are one or two funny moments. The conceit of the relative of Christ not being able to have children and thus losing faith in God is actually a great idea but it's poorly executed in the extreme. The dialoguewriting is terrible for the most part the characters talk too much about the story andor themselves and do too little the acting equally dire and most criminally it's simply not funny. Dogma' commits the ultimate sin for a movie packed with such dumb jokes it sure takes itself seriously. If you want to watch a comedy a satire or even a discussion of religion or theology there is surely better stuff than this.".

I think my interest in cult and bizarre began from seeing this classic slice of 1960s psychedelic trash for the first time. This is one of the silliest movies ever made but still one of the most entertaining. Jane Fonda then at the peak of her sex kitten period history lesson  this was before radical Jane and corporate Jane has never looked lovelier than in this movie and manages to really pull off Barbarella's wideeyed innocence. Anita Pallenberg costar of 'Performance' and then Keith Richards' old lady is stunning as The Great Tyrant even if her voice is dubbed and her handful of scenes with Fonda are unforgettable. The rest of the eclectic supporting cast includes cult favourites John Phillip Law 'Diabolik' as Pygar the blind angel David Hemmings 'Profondo Rosso' as Dildano a revolutionary and Milo O'Shea 'Theatre Of Blood' as renegade Earth scientist Duran Duran. 'Barbarella' contains some of the most striking and surreal images of the 1960s the doll attack scene is one of my all time favourites! and is definitely one of the most bizarre science fiction movies ever made. Like many of the 1960s more excessive movies it is a real love it or hate it proposition. I love it of course and think it Russ Meyer's 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' and Roger Corman's 'The Trip' are the three greatest 1960s trash classics. This is simply absolutely essential viewing for all 1960s buffs science fiction or otherwise. Long live 'Barbarella'!".

Directed by Fonda's thenhusband Roger Vadim the film is less concerned with creating a coherent storyline than it is in finding inventive ways to strip Fonda of her already skimpy outfits.In this it is remarkably successful and Fonda actually has both enough sex appeal and roundeyed innocence to carry the thing off emerging as something like a Barbie doll John Philip Law strikes a similar note as the sexy but equally innocent angel Pygar. The designs are 1960s psychedelic with as many Freudian twists as the film's makers can come up with and when all is said and done you can't help but roll your eyes in amusement.True enough BARBARELLA was probably much more entertaining back in the days LSD and indeed one might read the entire thing as an acid trip time machine. No one in the cast takes the film very seriously and neither should you when all is said and done it has all the depth of a pancake not so much funny as merely amusing and appealing to a very highcamp sensibility.

I knew of 'Barbarella' but I had never seen it until today. I think waiting 36 years has actually made the experience better. This is not by any definition a good movie. Jane Fonda a very bright actress plays Barbarella suitably as an 'innocent' sent on a mission to a distant galaxy to find the Earthling scientist Durand Durand and bring him back along with his invention. The story itself is secondary the charm of the movie resides in all the sexual situations that innocent Barbarella finds herself in. A perfect vehicle for the wild 1960s. The package blurb says 'she acts like a female James Bond.' Hardly. More like a female Austin Powers and some of the characters would have fit better in a Monty Python movie.The DVD is fine for an old movie although blemishes are quite evident. What puzzles me is the 'PG' rating listed on the package and the disk. The opening scene of Barbarella getting out of her space suit in the weightlessness of her spacecraft clearly shows her breasts and her nude butt. Very nice breasts and butt at that nonetheless inconsistent with a 'PG' rating. Plus many other scenes in the movie show groups of men and women in alluring positions again with some obvious female nudity. So anyone who plans to view this movie with those under 18 should be aware of this. For an adult audience it should not be an issue at all.May 2013 update It is now on Netflix streaming movies with a rating of R and comes across very well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Barbarella 1968  out of 4 Campy scifi based on the French comics has Jane Fonda playing the title role a futuristic superhero who is asked by the President of Earth to travel to a distant planet and rescue a doctor. I can understand why this film has gained a cult following over the past few decades but to me this thing is still a pretty big mess and it's somewhat shocking watching the film to day and looking back and wondering what the original producers were thinking. I mean if you look at the story of this thing it's a complete mess and it's all over the place. I'm not exactly sure what they were trying to do in regards to the story but it's a complete misfire. Not for a single second do you care about Barbarella's adventure nor do you care about anything she's doing in the film. The reason the film remains entertaining is because it's simply so strange and surreal. Visually the film is quite impressive as a bunch of pulp. The set design and costumes are certainly memorable and the now laughable special effects have a mild charm to them. What really keeps the film moving is seeing someone like Fonda doing a role like this. She's very good in the role there's no doubt about it as she can handle the campy moments as well as deliver on the sexuality of the character. Her nude striptease that starts the film is certainly the highlight but they needed more of these throughout. John Phillip Law isn't all that good in the film but there's no question that his angel character is quite memorable. Director Roger Vadim doesn't bring enough life energy or fire to any of the scenes to really make them work and that's certainly not good when you're dealing with a film like this one. BARBARELLA certainly deserves its label as a camp classic but it's just not entertaining enough to be fully rewarding.".

It's hard to see how even the most casual viewer in 1967 could have taken this as a serious entry in the scifi genre if this was real science fiction so was NUDES ON THE MOON. Watching our heroine getting into various predicamentsand out of various parts of her already skimpy costumesreminds one what a stunner Ms. Fonda was in her salad days. Another distraction is the campy sets and interiorspeople in the year 40000 hopefully will have progressed beyond shagcarpeted spacecraft and presidents who wear black feather boas.

	schema:reviewBody "Just what were they on? Barbarella is one of those sixties films the Beatles vehicle Help! is another which although it makes no explicit references to the decade's drug culture nevertheless leaves the indelible impression that the director the scriptwriter the set designer the costume designer the cameramen and most of the cast were under the influence of mindexpanding drugs throughout the entire shooting period.I first saw the film at university in the early eighties when a student film society organised a screening. Interest in it at that time may have been aroused by the release in 1980 of Flash Gordon another ultracamp science fiction film which was undoubtedly influenced by it and by the fact that one of the leading British pop groups of the era had called themselves Duran Duran in homage to their origins in a nowdefunct Birmingham nightclub called Barbarella's.The film is based on a French series of comic books which I must admit I have never read. Unlike say the Asterix or Tintin series the Barbarella comics have never had much of a following in Britain. The action takes place in the 40th century. Barbarella a beautiful young female astronaut is ordered by the President of Earth to travel to the planet Tau Ceti to find a scientist named Durand Durand from whom the band took their misspelled name. Durand is the inventor of a weapon known as the Positronic Ray which the President fears may fall into the wrong hands.The rest of the film is taken up with Barbarella's increasingly bizarre adventures on Tau Ceti. She goes iceskiing across the planet's frozen surface pulled along by an octopuslike creature is menaced by flesheating dolls with razorsharp teeth seduces a blind angel or ornithanthrope meets the predatory lesbian Queen of a decadent city and survives an attempted execution by means of an orgasmatron a machine designed to kill by an excess of sexual pleasure. Barbarella's capacity for sexual pleasure is so great that she blows its circuits. We are not of course meant to take any of this seriously the whole thing is intended as a sort of tongueincheek exercise in high camp surrealism Salvador Dali meets Edna Everage. The surreal nature of the film is emphasised by the use of psychedelic lighting effects. The opening song even includes the rhyme Barbarella Psychedella.Barbarella is played by Jane Fonda who at the time was married to the director Roger Vadim clearly a man with the knack of attracting beautiful women. He had previously been married to Brigitte Bardot and had been the lover of Catherine Deneuve. I wonder if when Fonda was taking her wedding vows she realised that Vadim's interpretation of for better or for worse included casting his wife in eccentric films like this one. Her devotion to her wifely duties seems to have been at the expense of her career she later revealed that her commitment to Barbarella meant having to turn down the leading roles in two more serious films Bonnie and Clyde and Rosemary's Baby. Moreover many of the heroine's adventures seem to have been designed with the express purpose of showing off Fonda's figure in a series of provocative outfits leaving her with a lasting sex kitten image. This was something she was never comfortable with especially when she was trying to reinvent herself as a feminist and leftwing activist a few years later.This is far from being Fonda's best film yet she is about the only cast member who emerges with any credit from it playing the heroine as a sort of wideeyed innocent abroad. John Phillip Law who plays the ornithanthrope Pygar is so wooden that I wondered if he was under instructions to play his role with a deliberately deadpan lack of emotion. David Hemmings as the resistance leader Dildano shows us just why his career never really took off in the way it was expected to after his early breakthrough in Blowup. Hemmings's costume looking like a pair of leather Yfronts is just as bizarre as anything worn by Fonda. Marcel Marceau shows that his talents as a mime did not extend to acting in spoken roles. Anita Pallenberg better known for her relationships with several members of the Rolling Stones was cast as the wicked Queen but Vadim did not trust her to speak her own lines the Queen speaks with the unmistakable contralto tones of Joan Greenwood.Barbarella was a failure on its release both at the box office and with the critics yet despite the dodgy acting and the nonsensical plot it has since 1968 acquired the status of a cult movie. Even back in my student days it was regarded as sort of historic artifact. Cults whether religious or cinematic can be baffling to everyone except ardent devotees yet I must confess that I have a soft spot for this surreal relic of the hippie era. It is an ideal film to watch when returning from the pub late at night. Particularly if one is drunk. 610".

The main rationale behind the film seems to be to get Jane Fonda to not wear very much which may not be an ignoble ambition in itself but will only carry the movie for the sad and desperate. Spoiler yes you get to see her breasts. Otherwise this is notable mainly because the mad scientist she's hunting Duran Duran gave the English 80s pop band who are still going I believe their name and because famous mime Marcel Marceau is in it. Spoiler he speaks. I think it's aiming at comedy but I can't believe the script is by the same guy who wrote the peerless Dr. Strangelove because the humour simply falls flat most of the time. There's the odd scene or line that raises a grin as when Fonda causes the machine which is supposed to kill her with pleasure to explode because she can take more than it can dish out but mostly this is only worth watching to see just how nonsensical it can get.".

Terry Southern's screenplay is often witty. Jane Fonda and Anita Pallenberg are wonderful. I ought to love it. Instead I find it almost intolerable.From the opening credits which go on too long and the first bars of that execrable music you sense something is seriously amiss with this movie. The camera seems to be in the wrong place all the time and the wrong shots are held too long. It often seems as if that they simply shot footage with no idea how it was going to fit together. You suspect that weeks may have passed between shots so that nobody could remember what had come before or what would come after. Faced with this hopeless material the editor was in despair and just gave up so nothing cuts together properly. At best the picture looks like the roughest of rough cuts. At worst the editing seems to be almost completely random.As a result there is no pace or rhythm either in individual scenes or in the movie as a whole. People wander about from scene to scene with no purpose or point. Soon all the energy drains out of the picture and you find yourself stranded in a weird limbo in which nothing seems to be happening even when it is nothing connects with anything else and time stretches out endlessly before you. At times the boredom is so intense it makes your teeth ache.I have seen and commented on some of the most incompetent movies ever made Fire Maidens The Flying Saucer Mesa of Lost Women but this movie seems to be inept in ways that transcend even those notorious turkeys. Although Roger Vadim had made at least a dozen pictures before this one it feels like it was assembled by people that had never even seen a movie before let alone made one. Of one thing I am sure  it could never have been made in America. It is purest Eurotrash.I have finally posted my response to this unaccountable movie but I know I will be coming back again and again to edit it because I realise I haven't even come close to identifying what makes it such a uniquely stultifying experience.".

Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella Jane Fonda and her mission to planet Lythion in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the space opera for those grotesque and travesty like situations for example... cannibal dolls! Cool! There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda which is halfnaked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching Rocky Horror Show. Fonda is a great actress not just sexy John Philip Law as Pygar he was great! Anita Pallenberg Great Tyrant an exotic sexy rival to Fonda Milo O'Shea and Marcel Marceau were also great and to mention David Hemmings. A highly recommended must see film. Watch it!".

Even after all these years she's still damn hot! We also have aggressive domineering and voluptuous Black Queen. And for ladies  here goes the blind nearly naked angel  The whole movie itself is full of quite erotic moments. The astronaut suit striptease in the beginning  hell yeah! And Duran Duran's machine... The sets and models are not so impressive from today's point of view but with a little imagination you can deal with that. And I even find a kind of nostalgic scifi beauty in them. There are also scenes with masterfully shot psychedelic pictures of moving colors and fantastic forms  it is worth watching the whole movie even just to see them.

	schema:headline " Diane Lane is Brighter Than the Tuscan Sun";
	schema:reviewBody "Under the Tuscan Sun is a polarizing film that seems to leave viewers and critics either in love with a story of growth and renewal or dismissive of its line.  I'm firmly in the former camp.Based so loosely on Frances Mayes's own account of her regeneration in beautiful Italy as to carry an end credit pronouncing that substantial fictionalization replaced key true details writer and director Audrey Wells crafted a stunning vehicle for Diane Lane whose radiance projects from the screen powerfully. And in every scene.Diane Lane as the changedfromthememoir Frances abandons San Francisco after her never shown cad husband divorces her getting the house she once loved.  Frances is a writer and literary critic.  Why does she leave S.F.? Two of her closest friends give her a ticket for a gay bus tour of Italy and she jumps off the bus to look into a ramshackle old country house up for sale.  Impetuosity?  Definitely.  Believable?  Yes actually.Frances' new house isn't a handyman's special it's a contractor's assurance of food on the table for a very long time.  Frances adapts to the house and the locals with remarkable aplomb.  Tuscany is sunny but its light fades before Frances's challenged but resilient commitment to not just restore a house but to create a home.  The two aren't the same. I'm not sure how many male directors could so well create that reality.Director Wells tells the story from a woman's heart but with a breadth of humor and drama that should appeal to anyone who wants to believe or needs to hope that there really is a light at the end of the tunnel of marital infidelity and dissolution.  Supporting Diane Lane is Sandra Oh as Patti her closest friend.  In relatively short scenes Ms. Oh displays a lively and laconic grasp not only of her friend's life but also of her own which is not as they say today devoid of issues.Lindsay Duncan is Katharine an older woman determined to hold on to her now fading attractiveness through a blend of humor earthiness  and alcohol. Her character may be predictable but she's also fun.Raoul Bova has garnered some press attention as handsome Marcello the romantically available and affluent Italian.  That's a character we've seen in many many films and Bova delivers an expectedly satisfactory but hardly deep performance.Yes Diane Lane is beautiful but there is much more to her acting than a shining appearance.  Her facial gestures mirroring her emotions as they shift from moment to moment are the product of extraordinary acting ability.  And her character draws a powerful portrayal.Credit also must go to cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson.  Perhaps it would be impossible for a blind camera director to turn in anything but a gorgeous visage of rural and urban Italy but Simpson did do a marvelous job of making the locales come alive.This is a film for adults for people who can understand pain and the search for recovery and understand the difficulty of coming back from a space that once offered the mirage of safety and security.I loved this film.910.".

The movie also has a certain atmosphere that makes you feel as if you are in Tuscan on a trip yourself. I have to disagree with the view that says you need to be in love to enjoy the movie. All what you need is some depth and you will definitely relate to the protagonist. She happens to be healing from a failing marriage but you can relate to her story if you are dealing with any kind of problems in your life.There is one specific part of the movie which I truly like is the one where she defends the love story of a young couple though she was hurt. This shows that even though she failed she didn't cease to believe in love. She succeeded in going out of the egocentricity of a person who usually hates good for people if his life is not working successfully.".

	schema:reviewBody "Poet and writer Frances Mayes became a household name when in 1996 she published Under the Tuscan Sun a book where she detailed how she and her new lover bought and renovated an abandoned villa in Tuscany Italy. With her stylish prose she made the book something more than a mere diary of the renovation and turned into a captivating chronicle of her trips through Italy and her familiarization with the country's rich culture. The book's detailed account of Mayes' trips attracted director Audrey Wells who used the book's story of the renovation of an Italian villa as a basis for this charming romantic comedy set in Tuscany and starring Diane Lane.Frances Diane Lane is a writer in her mid30s currently suffering writer's block but this is the lesser of her problems as her husband suddenly decides to divorce her and as a result of legal issues he keeps their house. Without a place to call home Frances enters a state of depression but her friend Patti Sandra Oh has a solution. Since Patti who is a lesbian has become pregnant she and her partner offer Frances their tickets to Italy and convince her to take a holiday. While traveling through Tuscanny with the tour Frances finds an abandoned villa for sale and impulsively and thanks to a series of consequences she decides to buy it. Under the Tuscan Sun details France's efforts to renovate the villa and her life at the same time as well as her encounters with many interesting characters from the beautiful Italian region.Well it is safe to point out that other than the tale of the renovation of an old house Audrey Well's adaptation of the story has little to no resemblance to the book's plot. However the way Wells mixes Mayes' Italian adventure with her character's own tribulations is almost perfect. True the movie's plot is a bit typical and filled with some of the most common clichs in the romantic comedy genre but it also offers some really nice and unexpected twists to the formula. While not exactly the detailed travelogue that Mayes' book is this version of Under the Tuscan Sun really captures the magic of the Italian region and accurately shows off bits of the country's culture despite the funny use of classic stereotypes.Director Audrey Wells takes a straight forward approach to her story but wisely takes full advantage of the location's awesome landscapes and the enormous talent of cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson. Together Simpson and Wells create beautiful vistas of Italy's famous countryside that often mimic in a cleverly fashion some very wellknown paintings of the same locations. The film's cinematography is definitely the movie's main asset but it's not the only good thing in the film. While in terms of style Wells follows the romantic comedy formula somewhat to the letter the movie is filled with a very human touch that most movies of this genre lack.Diane Lane is simply perfect as the movie's main character as while the role may be a bit typical she truly added her talents to the part and made Frances a very real and likable woman. Sandra Oh is good as Frances' best friend Patti although really less convincing than Lane. Vincent Riotta is the film's highlight as the helpful Mr. Martini who also gives two or three lessons to the stranger in a strange land. Lindsay Duncan appears as the strange Katherine and plays an overthetop character with dignity and charm. Overall the rest of the cast was very good with everyone being perfect to the part although nothing really special. By the way watch out for a small appearance of legendary director Mario Monicelli in a small role.It's impossible to compare the film to the book as they are both very different beasts with very little in common so fans of the book won't find a faithful adaptation despite the gorgeous images of Italy. As a film Under the Tuscan Sun is a very effective melodrama as while it's certainly sappy and silly at times it offers a breath of fresh air when compared to other similar films. True it's story may not be the most original one but the way it's executed it's strangely charming as if the beautiful cinematography and witty script were able to cast a magic spell on the viewers and simply captivate with their simple beauty.It's easy to dismiss Under the Tuscan Sun as another silly romantic comedy filled with typical clichs and sappy situations but while those descriptions often prove true to this film there is something else something more that this movie offers that makes it special and a truly different experience to those used to watch the same plots in melodramas over and over. Under the Tuscan Sun may not be true to its source book but it uses it cleverly to tells a really charming story. 710".

	schema:headline " Diane Lane in Italy. Nothing else matters in this nice but unremarkable movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Well 'Under The Tuscan Sun' isn't precisely unremarkable  I am remarking on it right now!!  There aren't many truly new stories in print and cinema this one has been told many times  someone finds theirself in a rut of some kind is reluctant to step out onto an unknown path but does so anyway to discover a better life. Diane Lane plays Frances a writer who early in the movie finds herself single again and free to do anything she wants. She is offered a chance to travel to Tuscany with a group of gay couples and at first she dismisses it. When she finally does take it her life is transformed. The DVD has a nice Dolby 5.1 sound track and the cinematography is superb with beautiful shots of the Italian countryside and the Mediterranian coast.  The 'making of' extra is only mildly interesting and the three deleted scenes are even less so. There is an interesting 'Easter egg' showing how they digitally altered a man's naked butt covering it to get the contractually mandated 'PG13' rating in the USA. Overall a pleasant little movie that tries to seem important but isn't really.  I believe it is '7' movie on the 10point scale.  I cannot imagine why 22 of the ratings are '10'.SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments beware!!Apparently happily married at a function for another author Frances is approached by a man whose book she had negatively reviewed partly because the male character messed around with young women he said Do you see the irony? Puzzled then he said 'Ask your husband.' Next thing we see is her and her attorney discussing disposition of joint property. Since he wants the house her share is bought out she keeps virtually nothing goes to Italy while on the bus sees a property for sale against her nature gets off the bus buys the old house has natural 'buyer's remorse' but gets contractors and fixes it up reminded me much of 'A Year In Provence'. In fact her strange blond friend is played by the same actress that plays 'Annie' in the 'Year in Provence' movie.One contractor worker is a young Polish man falls for Italian girl parents don't approve Frances helps convince them. Meanwhile she runs into a handsome Italian who gives her a ride to the coast looking for fixitup parts she asks him to make love to her they apparently hit it off but her pregnant gay friend shows up Frances and the lover have a tough time meeting again when she looks him up he has another girl goes home young couple wed in her courtyard at the end an American Rory Gilmore's dad writer shows up looking for Frances we imagine they might hit it off. However that doesn't matter Frances has started a new life and is happy.".

There is an interesting 'Easter egg' showing how they digitally altered a man's naked butt covering it to get the contractually mandated 'PG13' rating in the USA. Overall a pleasant little movie that tries to seem important but isn't really.  I believe it is '7' movie on the 10point scale.  I cannot imagine why 22 of the ratings are '10'.SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments beware!!Apparently happily married at a function for another author Frances is approached by a man whose book she had negatively reviewed partly because the male character messed around with young women he said Do you see the irony? Puzzled then he said 'Ask your husband.' Next thing we see is her and her attorney discussing disposition of joint property. Since he wants the house her share is bought out she keeps virtually nothing goes to Italy while on the bus sees a property for sale against her nature gets off the bus buys the old house has natural 'buyer's remorse' but gets contractors and fixes it up reminded me much of 'A Year In Provence'. In fact her strange blond friend is played by the same actress that plays 'Annie' in the 'Year in Provence' movie.One contractor worker is a young Polish man falls for Italian girl parents don't approve Frances helps convince them. Meanwhile she runs into a handsome Italian who gives her a ride to the coast looking for fixitup parts she asks him to make love to her they apparently hit it off but her pregnant gay friend shows up Frances and the lover have a tough time meeting again when she looks him up he has another girl goes home young couple wed in her courtyard at the end an American Rory Gilmore's dad writer shows up looking for Frances we imagine they might hit it off. However that doesn't matter Frances has started a new life and is happy.";

Ah well trust me I'm a huge booklover and Harry Potter fan so I can say that if I had read the book and was an immense fan I probably wouldn't have liked the film if it had taken the basis out of the original story. I truly sympathize with those of you who disliked this film because it did not go with the book in some way or another. Although since I love writing myself I have a very wonderful relationship with this film and its delicious scenery how the characters in it build in confidence and the whimsical things that seem to be thrown in it artfully. Yes there are some socalled cliches which is a word I hate using. We use that word to describe things that happen every day in our life things that repeat themselves in storybooks and films and are heard so often that we are likely to vomit with expectancy of it all. But the thing that hit me about this film is that a lot of things happen that you really don't expect. The comingofage story has been told for ages and will be expressed forever with all its little tidbits of similar goingson serious situation happens main character finds escape love broken heart confusion..etc.. I don't think an entire genre of literature can deny its existence now can it? The acting is superb and it has a lot of lighthearted moments that lift it up. It's basically about accepting yourself before you can truly find Mr.Right and realizing that you shouldn't put the blame on yourself for every single thing in your life that happens and about taking chances because life can have pros and cons. I even think that some men would like it. This film was very inspiring to me and although I didn't see it in theaters I left my couch feeling very creative and content as if I wasn't the only one who got inspiration from the little things life seems to hand out.".

It is unlikely she would be accepted into rural Italian life due to the fact she is nonwhite. this was a bit of PC nonsense. the film is also offensive to Italian men. For instance the one man she Diane Lane has an affair is turns out to be a caddish cheat. But guess what at the end your typically plasticky American brickhead turns up all cheesy white smile and tan and she finally finds what she wants all along a real American man and now she has colonized another part of the world. In fact this film is quite racist in its depiction of Italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants. the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash.".

	schema:reviewBody "How on earth these movies still get made I'll never know. Derivative in the extreme it is a bythenumbersmovie graced only by some good camera work  locations that are undeniably agreeable on the eye.Diane Laine plays a newly divorced professional writer desperately searching for answers to her sad life. Around her are the disfunctional  simplistic characters seen a thousand times before. The disfunctional represent her past the simplistic her spiritual future the return to her own personal Eden. Blah blah blah.The film exploits not only the chick dollar but the pink dollar too by sending her away on a gay holiday. I suppose this was an attempt by the producers to widen the audience  so increase revenues but anyone who fell for the gay  away line will be disapointed as it is a device quickly disposed of but by then it's too late as you've paid  are in the cinema.On this tour she sees a house  buys it on a whim. Obviously this girl has never tried to do business in Italy where things can be slow to say the least! Anyway she ends up with this abandonned villa that is in dire need of several million dollars of renovation.So where's the army of workers who renovate the house? Surely the Polish handyman wasn't working 247 to do all this was he? Or are we to believe that the place simply needs a coat of paint  hence took only a few days? If so why was it in such bad shape? Do we accept that Ms Laine does this all herself? Then how did she get round Italian immigration laws that allowed her to stay for the years this would have taken her? It's utter poppycock from start to finish.Raoul Bova as Marcello is predictable to the extreme only a naive cretin would miss the clumsy way his character was set up to be unfaithful to her. YAWN! When I saw this movie I was amazed how the audience was surprised by Ms Laine's discovery of this fact! I have news for these people when you go to Disney Land  meet Mickey Mouse it's really only a guy in a suit. Got that? Good!What really made me groan was the tap faucet. I watched this incredibly obvious  shallow plot device  chose my time to sigh in a loud voice Let me guess the damned tap will be finally running just before the sound of running water was heard. Of course the tap's dryness was a symbol for Ms Laine's parched  empty life. Now it is providing water again she is fullfilled....... hand me a sick bag PLEASE!It is just SOOOO predictable.Of course there were a few highlights mostly as I mentioned the scenery which was very well handled. There was also the dress Ms Laine wore on the scooter ride to her boyfriend which was simply a classic with well handled photography  direction  let's face it she looked stunning. Also there was the gratuitous bouncing boobs episode where she runs down a steep hill wearing a tight T shirt. Ah well I suppose the husbands  boyfriends dragged along for the ride on this movie had to have something to wake them up!All in all it is another example of the lack of imagination in Hollywod right now. What plus points it has are vastly outweighed by the negatives although I have no doub that it could have been a lot worse.Perhaps the most stunning criticism I heard was someone in the exit line who grumbled It's nothing like the book they changed practicaly the whole story  made a mess of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The real life situation involves two relatively lowbrow intellectuals who seek pleasure in Tuscany. They have some minor adventures mostly related to renovations that took place while they were in their real home in California. Since she can write she writes a book about the experience that reflects her own appreciation of those pleasures. That appreciation is still fresh mainly because she hasn't actually committed to Tuscan life.So we have a book. It exists as a conduit for referenced visceral pleasures. Such a conduit depends on not having a connected story.Now we have a movie of the same title. We not only have an imposed story of a woman's self discovery and resexualization that story is emphasized by all sorts of parallel threads the resurrection of the house even the opening of a certain watertap the exuberant troubled passion of two teenagers the episodes of an aging local beauty and the birth of a daughter from her spurned gay friend  even the eventual acknowledgment of our troubled adventurer by the land as denoted by an local deity delivering flowers.The overlay of Tuscan pleasures is supposed to elevate this project from the ordinary such.But let's suppose you really believe what is being preached in this movie to never settle for the mundane but actively seek the richest path as measured by lasting pleasure. In that case there will be other films that you should see projects that are more beautiful many indeed. And projects that don't have to hide their innate pleasures behind insipid romance. Also as a book A Trip to the Beach may suit you better as a commitment to a new fooddriven Latin life than Tuscan. As an engineered product this film has something more interesting than the imposed redundant stories. It realizes that  so far as the film  it is about a trip to a place that only exists in movies. Or more precisely the richness comes not from the real place but the fiction imposed on it by its inhabitants. The predominant vehicle for this is Italian film.So we have the magimentor in this story as a character from famous Italian films nearly as if she stepped out of a Fellini film into this one. We have the tide turn with our heroine when she attends a movie. We have lots of allusions to writing photographing and cookingascinema. All the advice about life is from a filmmaker.And. And we have the sunflowers. Now sunflowers do figure in the book and in the native landscape. But they  and several references to the Tuscan light are here because they reference Van Gogh. There's a direct visual reference as well with a huge Thuja tree Van Gogh's sunflower exploits were well to the west and in another country. But what matters here is the combination of his visual enthusiasm with his writing about that enthusiasm. He really would have said you can smell the purple.Think I'm kidding? Look at the primary framing device not writing but writing about writing aka reviewing. She is sent on her journey as the result of a scriptwriter writing lines about her writing about someone's writing. And her journey ends with Ed the same way.Still think I'm off track? Check out 'Guinevere' which has the same sort of thing world of film directing the 'real' life depicted in the film. And a much better job too.I will recommend Italian for Beginners for people who want a more engaging use of cinematic northern Italy to heal a broken heart. Or Wings of the Dove for those who want things more visually. Even Stealing Beauty which is the template for this is richer. Or if you can focus on food instead of landscapes Eat Drink Man Woman Vatel or Big Night.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

It isn't. This is a chick flick and not even a good one. Even my wife hated it. There is no plot nor much point to the movie. You keep waiting for something good or at least interesting to happen but it never does. There are a few laugh lines and a good reenactment from La Dolce Vita. That's it. When the credits begin to roll you realize that there really isn't anything to take away from the movie and that you have wasted 2 hours of your life that would have been better spent watching nearly anything else not counting TeleTubbies. Let me echo other comments about wondering ifwhen anyone in the movie ever works to earn a living. If you have to watch this at least enjoy the scenery.".

It isn't. This is a chick flick and not even a good one. Even my wife hated it. There is no plot nor much point to the movie. You keep waiting for something good or at least interesting to happen but it never does. There are a few laugh lines and a good reenactment from La Dolce Vita. That's it. When the credits begin to roll you realize that there really isn't anything to take away from the movie and that you have wasted 2 hours of your life that would have been better spent watching nearly anything else not counting TeleTubbies. Let me echo other comments about wondering ifwhen anyone in the movie ever works to earn a living. If you have to watch this at least enjoy the scenery.";

	schema:reviewBody "When life gives lemons make lemonade. Or so the saying goes. This film shows just how palatable that lemonade can be.Frances Mayes Diane Lane is a successful writer and teacher who finds that her marriage is ending in a most unkind way when a writer she gave a bad review to lets slip that her life is about to take the plot of his book which she panned. Shortly thereafter we see Frances in the office of her divorce attorney Jeffrey Tambor who convinces her that she should allow her husband to buy her out of their house. She does and moves into an apartment building full of divorces who are just as unhappy as she is. Her friends Patti Sandra Oh and Grace Kate Walsh decide that she needs a change of scenery and after some convincing send her on a trip to Tuscany. Once there she starts getting signs that she should stay and buys a crumbling villa to start a new life in. Her new life does not start smoothly however and she wonders if she has done the right thing. She tells her realtor Martini Vincent Riotta that the house should have a wedding in it and children and people to fill the bedrooms and cook for but she has none of that. What if she doesn't get those things? In her search for them she finds Katherine Lindsay Duncan a wise old protg of Federico Fellini adopts a group of Polish contractors helps one of them Pawel Pawel Szajda to wed Chiara Giulia Steigerwalt the daughter of her neighbors Roberto Nobile and Anita Zagaria provides a place for Patti to raise her daughter after Grace deserts her and has her own unsuccessful romantic entanglement with Marcello Raoul Bova. At Pawel and Chiara's wedding which she hosts at her villa Martini tells her that she has gotten everything she wished for. But Tuscany still manages to provide her with one more thing to make her life complete.It's a feel good story there's no doubt about it. And to that end it overlooks a lot of the impracticalities of the situation namely that Frances doesn't speak Italian or Polish or that she doesn't seem terribly worried about money even though she's spending an awful lot of it or should be. However the practicalities of the arrangement are not what's important in this film. What is important is Frances' healing process and heal she does with wonderful results.This is a well acted film. Lane carries the film with ease giving us a believable portrait of a woman who overcomes bitterness which at times seems insurmountable. Oh gives a great turn as the helpful friend who needs some help herself. Riotta is delightful as the compassionate realtor. Bova is wonderful as the smitten Italian who can't wait for Frances' life to sort itself out. Stegierwalt and Szajda are delightful as the young lovers and Nobile and Zagaria are believable as the disapproving parents. Duncan's performance is charming. And David Sutcliffe turns in a nice performance in a small part as France's love interest at the end of the film.Admittedly it gets a bit far fetched at times but the story telling is delightful the cinematography wonderful and the acting good enough that you really care about that. A good film about taking chances when they come your way.".

Totally ruthless he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  Clint Eastwood The Good' is the Man With No Name not really good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.

Eli Wallach The Ugly' is Tuco and he's easily the most complex  if not the best  character in the film.

Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace revealing more about each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible as is the direction  Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western clich that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes  one in a Union prison camp one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film  are amazing on their own but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.

	schema:headline " An epic Sergio Leone's masterpiece the best spaghetti gold Western film in the Dollars Trilogy!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1966 is an epic classic Sergio Leone's masterpiece film and a great conclusion to the Man with No Name Trilogy. This is my number 1 favorite Spaghetti Western about the Civil War and three gunslingers on a search for a lost gold. I love this film to death. It is my personal favorite western movie of all time. Clint Eastwood Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef are the best of the film in their roles. It has a great showdown in the cemetery on the end of the film the way how it is edited. The cuts with people's faces and close up shots. I love this film to death and it is my number one favorite western in the trilogy. If I had to put then into a 'favorite ranking' list? 1. The Good The Bad and The Ugly 2. A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Those are all three best masterpieces ! They are my favorite Clint Eastwood western movies in the series and they are really my favorite westerns that I am still watching today. I love the music score by Ennio Morricone that did wrote different and new theme music score for this film. The Action sequences are awesome and the bullets are flying the guns in this film are plenty. The scene action are also good which this film makes such an entertainment from begging till end. It is the third entry in to The Dollars trilogy or better known the Man with No Name it is the final installment of The Dollars Trilogy. This film is a classic that made Clint Eastwood in to a big star that he is today. An epic Western that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for 200000 in stolen gold Sergio Leone's 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' is one of his best masterpiece one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery. The inimitable Man With No Name teams with two gunslingers Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to pursue a fortune in stolen gold. But teamwork doesn't come naturally to the outlaws and they soon discover that their greatest challenge is to stay alive in a country ravaged by war. Forging and Vibrant and yet detached style of action never before seen and not matched since The Good the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Eastwood Style! The film is known for Leone's use of long shots and closeup cinematography as well as his distinctive utilization of violence tension and stylistic gunfights.The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amidst the violent chaos of the American Civil War specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862 while participating in many battles and duels along the way. The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood and the second with Lee Van Cleef. Still the race and the three gunslingers were just fantastic who will get the first the gold. The final scene on the cemetery is one of the best action scenes ever. The iconic Mexican standoff with Tuco AngelEyes in the middle and Blondie is the best scene in the film. The trio all separately are traveling trough American Civil War who doesn't want any part of the war to do.Clint Eastwood as Blondie a.k.a. the Man with No Name a subdued bounty hunter did a really wonderful job as the good person he showed that he is honest a good kind gunslinger. I think Clint Eastwood as Blondie did made memorable character and one of his the best acting performance on screen I have ever saw. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes The Bad a ruthless unfeeling and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes a job he is paid for. Did a terrific job as the villain in this film gosh this movie is awesome! He convinced me of his acting skills that he is a professional actor. Eli Wallach as Tuco The Rat The Ugly a comical oafish was amazing in his role Sergio Leone choose him for this film with natural talent as the main cast. Those trio actors did a wonderful job as a different gunslingers on searching for a gold. The film also has humor and it is also brilliant in the both terms the scene on cemetery where Tuco arrives first and is looking for a tombstone was brilliant. It turned out the gold was buried in a unmarked grave that was hard to find. I was laughing when Blondie throws a shovel to Tuco for digging up the grave and the Angles Eyes comes and throws another shovel for Blondie where both of them have to dig now the grave the scene was funny. They are a lot of moments in this film. 1010 my number1 favorite in the trilogy I love this film to death.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1966 is an epic classic Sergio Leone's masterpiece film and a great conclusion to the Man with No Name Trilogy. This is my number 1 favorite Spaghetti Western about the Civil War and three gunslingers on a search for a lost gold. I love this film to death. It is my personal favorite western movie of all time. Clint Eastwood Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef are the best of the film in their roles. It has a great showdown in the cemetery on the end of the film the way how it is edited. The cuts with people's faces and close up shots. I love this film to death and it is my number one favorite western in the trilogy. If I had to put then into a 'favorite ranking' list? 1. The Good The Bad and The Ugly 2. A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Those are all three best masterpieces ! They are my favorite Clint Eastwood western movies in the series and they are really my favorite westerns that I am still watching today. I love the music score by Ennio Morricone that did wrote different and new theme music score for this film. The Action sequences are awesome and the bullets are flying the guns in this film are plenty. The scene action are also good which this film makes such an entertainment from begging till end. It is the third entry in to The Dollars trilogy or better known the Man with No Name it is the final installment of The Dollars Trilogy. This film is a classic that made Clint Eastwood in to a big star that he is today. An epic Western that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for 200000 in stolen gold Sergio Leone's 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' is one of his best masterpiece one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery. The inimitable Man With No Name teams with two gunslingers Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach to pursue a fortune in stolen gold. But teamwork doesn't come naturally to the outlaws and they soon discover that their greatest challenge is to stay alive in a country ravaged by war. Forging and Vibrant and yet detached style of action never before seen and not matched since The Good the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Eastwood Style! The film is known for Leone's use of long shots and closeup cinematography as well as his distinctive utilization of violence tension and stylistic gunfights.The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amidst the violent chaos of the American Civil War specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862 while participating in many battles and duels along the way. The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood and the second with Lee Van Cleef. Still the race and the three gunslingers were just fantastic who will get the first the gold. The final scene on the cemetery is one of the best action scenes ever. The iconic Mexican standoff with Tuco AngelEyes in the middle and Blondie is the best scene in the film. The trio all separately are traveling trough American Civil War who doesn't want any part of the war to do.Clint Eastwood as Blondie a.k.a. the Man with No Name a subdued bounty hunter did a really wonderful job as the good person he showed that he is honest a good kind gunslinger. I think Clint Eastwood as Blondie did made memorable character and one of his the best acting performance on screen I have ever saw. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes The Bad a ruthless unfeeling and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes a job he is paid for. Did a terrific job as the villain in this film gosh this movie is awesome! He convinced me of his acting skills that he is a professional actor. Eli Wallach as Tuco The Rat The Ugly a comical oafish was amazing in his role Sergio Leone choose him for this film with natural talent as the main cast. Those trio actors did a wonderful job as a different gunslingers on searching for a gold. The film also has humor and it is also brilliant in the both terms the scene on cemetery where Tuco arrives first and is looking for a tombstone was brilliant. It turned out the gold was buried in a unmarked grave that was hard to find. I was laughing when Blondie throws a shovel to Tuco for digging up the grave and the Angles Eyes comes and throws another shovel for Blondie where both of them have to dig now the grave the scene was funny. They are a lot of moments in this film. 1010 my number1 favorite in the trilogy I love this film to death.";

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't sure if I was going to comment on this film because everything has already been said by the hundreds of other people who have posted their thoughts but I decided that I should really put my two cents in since this is my favorite movie.This film in my opinion is not only the greatest spaghetti western of all time. It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day and be perfectly happy doing so.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact it probably already is even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song Ecstacy of Gold is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music just incredible.The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor and he is incredible as Angel Eyes. It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as Blondie although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef I know many will disagree and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?.This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie stop what you are doing and go get it now!!".

The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie Sentenza Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave cocky yet adorable as laconic cigarsmoker Blondie a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing capricious nonchalant uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them redolent of their moribund morality which gives the story the impetus and the characters a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongueincheek satire on runofthemill westerns The Good the Bad and the Ugly continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis if it hasn't attained it yet. It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe not only to the Western genre but to the world of cinema.It's a must watch for any movie lover. 1010".

	schema:headline " Westerns don't get any better than this.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the thirdand arguably the best of the socalled spaghetti western trilogy. It is ironic that at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of Americanmade westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow over the quarter century or so since their release the critics have tended to change their opinions and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana Rowdy Yates in the television series Rawhide when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford the undisputed master of that genre and his protege the incomparable John Wayne. I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint the film is too long. I disagree. In fact in spite of its nearly three hour length I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story cinematography acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirtpoor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. In my opinion one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time lots of time. For example many of the scenes in the magnificent film Dr. Zhivago were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary if you haven't seen this film buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.".

	schema:headline " Primal honesty and morality";
	schema:reviewBody "After many years of barely watching any movies I treated myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western which in my admittedly limited experience was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn allAmerican good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time I would have watched it a third time. The setting is typically western a dry dusty panorama in which men barely coexist with each other few wasted words and lots of action horses and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law  order  all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns  the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.Good Bad and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters Bad Sentenza is the easiest to understand. He is very bad perhaps not so different from other villains but much more sharply developed murderous sadistic traitorous and remorseless. Good Blondie and Ugly Tuco are more puzzling but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality but they're not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative emotional loud wild and unpredictable but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool calm rational and controlled  in many ways similar to Sentenza  but whereas Sentenza tortures maims kills and lies for the hell of it even apparently enjoys it Blondie simply goes about his business coolly and shows several poignant hints of empathy decency and a sense of justice.GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the highlevel political struggle of history books leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality pointless death and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dustcovered blue. Later they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional offtheshelf morality the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier another is when prisoners are forced  by Sentenza's orders  to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends the musicians are of course pained by it.That was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard  it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico and even though it was filmed in Spain it really does look like New Mexico and just as in life in the American west the wide breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.The plot was extremely clever  and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold  three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure cooperation was not in their nature but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western clich that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother a sincere Priest and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior but Tuco punches back and says Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done. The movie is also irreverently funny For example Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and saidThere are two kinds of spurs? my friend. Those that come in by the door and crosses himself those that come in by the window.There are two kinds of people in the world my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting. Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend  those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig. In addition to all these specific attributes a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film long scenes of tense silences  never for an instant boring and telling startling closeups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters waiting for the first person to go for their guns the transitions start out slowly and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this I wish I had my own copy of the film just so I could see this scene again.Not just a great western but easily one of the best movies of any kind ever made.".

For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother a sincere Priest and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior but Tuco punches back and says Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done. The movie is also irreverently funny For example Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and saidThere are two kinds of spurs? my friend. Those that come in by the door and crosses himself those that come in by the window.There are two kinds of people in the world my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting. Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend  those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig. In addition to all these specific attributes a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film long scenes of tense silences  never for an instant boring and telling startling closeups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters waiting for the first person to go for their guns the transitions start out slowly and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this I wish I had my own copy of the film just so I could see this scene again.Not just a great western but easily one of the best movies of any kind ever made.";

I thought it was a slow tedious story about a bunch of unpleasant jerk characters involved in a bogstandard conflict over money. It all seemed very macho and selfconsciously cool and it had obviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my own generation  Tarantino for example and Robert Rodriguez. In short I was unimpressed.Years later I gave the film a second shot watching it all the way through this time. I loved it. What had changed? For one thing I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I paid attention to Leone's famous use of closeups his selection of memorable character actors and his wonderful scenesetting. I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes the props and the costumes and all those weird wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph.I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped over in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli Wallach's character Tuco quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. Their argument is great emotionally charged stuff made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the kind of sensitive human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie.Before I get too fuzzywuzzy I should also like to point out that on my second viewing I LOVED all the action too. Every gunfight is great in its own way and they're all a bit different. The greatest of them all is of course the final confrontation between the trio which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a film. And hey there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change of pace from all the smallscale action.Ultimately The Good the Bad and the Ugly is probably just a potboiler of a film without too much to say about for example the human condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be cool  it simply IS cool. In fact it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance Leone's direction and Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status  and the fact that everything else in the movie is great too helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.And to think I missed all that the first time through...".

There's something in The Good the Bad and the Ugly that's nearly or perhaps is mythical in it's craft certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scenesequence it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example in the first part of the film this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco played by Eli Wallach Sentenza or 'Angel Eyes' played by Lee Van Cleef and as Blondie by a 3536 year old Clint Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging which is something of a regular practice for them but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later the situation gets reversed as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn't and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert as Joe starts to burn and dry up going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe that they're executed in the mindset of a Western but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good the Bad and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns his trust in his collaborators and in his leading players as well. I for one had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan  scan process. There is such a clear distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the DVD preferably the extended version which was Leone's original cut more or less. The editing too is unique in many sequences the climax is the most noted and memorable. The score with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone is one of the landmark movie scores and themes of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off Eastwood technically was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars yet by this film had it down to a T it's still my favorite performance from him despite having few words and reactions Cleef's cold cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in ditto for Wallach who gets under the skin of his copatriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the mind at least for me it's Wallach  especially as he gets the most 'character' and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well surprisingly enough. Overall The Good the Bad and Ugly is an entirely satisfying western at least one of my five favorites ever made and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sergio Leone's film follows the adventures of 3 ruthless outlaws...The 'Good' is Eastwood's unchanging and unshaven 'Stranger With No Name.' An unprincipled killer who stands only for his 45... He is quiet inexpressive and cool only seen once with a brief moment of humanity where his classic disinterest contrasts with the real tragedy of the American Civil War...The 'Bad' is an excellent supporting actor a Western figure... With his long thin opening eyes deathly pale face and cruel voice Lee Van Cleef is the merciless bounty hunter ironically called 'Angel Eyes' always ready to kill for a price...The 'Ugly' is Eli Wallach a wild spirit with devil attitude... Tuco is charming but extremely dangerous...The pairing of Eastwood and Wallach is memorable for its black humor alternating each other's fate motivated satisfactorily by their excessive desire for collecting the reward money...

	onyx:emotionText "Sergio Leone's film follows the adventures of 3 ruthless outlaws...The 'Good' is Eastwood's unchanging and unshaven 'Stranger With No Name.' An unprincipled killer who stands only for his 45... He is quiet inexpressive and cool only seen once with a brief moment of humanity where his classic disinterest contrasts with the real tragedy of the American Civil War...The 'Bad' is an excellent supporting actor a Western figure... With his long thin opening eyes deathly pale face and cruel voice Lee Van Cleef is the merciless bounty hunter ironically called 'Angel Eyes' always ready to kill for a price...The 'Ugly' is Eli Wallach a wild spirit with devil attitude... Tuco is charming but extremely dangerous...The pairing of Eastwood and Wallach is memorable for its black humor alternating each other's fate motivated satisfactorily by their excessive desire for collecting the reward money...

And there was nothing of merit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the Southwest. Now that aside I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I first saw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire Western befor even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then I've been through film school watched hundreds of Westerns learned to appreciate them but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers Stagecoach Gunfight at the O.K.

Blondie's the good guy but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living in a highly immoral way but is obviously the good not because we're told but from small acts giving the dying soldier a cigar making sure the Captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow the genuine regret he feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad we at least know he has prinicpals when he's hired for a job he always sees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. In other words historical inaccuracies aside TG TB  TU maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film there are no clearcut lines of conduct no black and white or even grey but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be in every way bigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.This picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation particularly his allimportant introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal and straight away we get his freezeframe and the title the ugly  this is a simple character and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freezeframe and title the bad telling us he is pure evil. Finally in Blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco but only for his own profit. It's not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freezeframe and title the good  obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.Leone's trademark long drawn out faceoffs  exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's samurai films  are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith  given the treacherous and chequered nature of the good  but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted it's sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that this was clearly never intended as the central theme  Leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here  it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.This brings me onto the war theme. Antiwar sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with the it  they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.I've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art  he composes a shot like John Ford edits like Eisenstein paces like Kurosawa but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting  Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco probably his best ever performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing meanlooking gang members but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More while his face said bad guy his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.Just time for a final word on the recent 2003 restored edition. While it's great that several lost scenes have been added I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital  it keeps his story arc going and also shows an act of compassion from the bad when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes strange as it may seem considering today's technology is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "Belfastbased comics writer Garth Ennis said it best There are two kinds of people in the world my friend...those who dig Clint Eastwood movies...and dweebs. While I have to admit that my heart belongs to the opening act of The Man With No Name trilogy A Fistful of Dollars there is no denial in my mind that The Good the Bad and the Ugly is actually the better film. Many directors have tried imitating it's style including Don Siegel's substandard Hang 'Em High and Eastwood's own first Western offering as stardirector in High Plains Drifter but none have truly come close to the eccentricities on display here.I have a suspicion that the storyline is actually based on historical fact. Consider this account from Joel Rose's The Big Book of Thugs under the entry of The Reynolds Gang They were organized in 1863 by Texans Jim and John Reynolds. They were briefly interned in a Civil War prison camp for Confederate sympathizers and after being released began making robberies that according to Jim Reynolds were to help out Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy. The loot was buried somewhere in the area of Handcart Gulch and Spanish Peaks in Colarado Territory and later after Jim Reynolds and four members of his gang had been executed by Colonel John M. Chivington of the Union Army John Reynolds dying from a fatal wound during a holdup supposedly whispered out the location of his old gang's ill gotten loot. Unlike the movie version it was never found.Regardless of whether or not this was the actual basis for TGTBATU it is nevertheless a film more grounded in history than a lot of it's comtemparies and indeed more than a few of it's successors. The Civil War is part of the backdrop but it does so on a forgotten front of that war the Western theater. Most highschool history classes would have us believe that nothing happened out West but plenty did. In fact the last skirmish of the war if I'm not mistaken was in New Mexico and ironically enough a Confederate victory.The central of this film is greed. You don't just see it in the quest for the Confederate gold by Blondie Angel Eyes and Tuco. There are signs of it everywhere in the hotel manager talking about how he'll be glad to get the Northerners in town for the money they'll bring in Bill Carson appealing to Tuco's greed for a single sip of water the gang of cutthroats who are systematically robbing the Confederate prisoners of their goods. Set up against the harsh desert backdrop it exposes the ultimate folly of that greed the best symbol of it perhaps being the cemetary where the gold is buried. A little over a decade before the Reagan era of Greed is healthy greed is good this film provides the ultimate rebuttal to that argument. Greed has gotten just as many men killed if not more than patriotism ever did. Such a subtext makes The Good the Bad and the Ugly the cinematic child of John Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre and the precursor to Oliver Stone's Wall Street.As great as Leone Eastwood Van Cleef and Wallach are there is one member of this team that pushs this film into the status of greatness score writer Ennio Morricone. Not only does he manage to write one of the most recognized theme tunes on the planet he also adds the extra tension needed to convey the drama with the necessary oomph the best examples being in Blondie's torturous walk across the desert Tuco's frantic search through the cemetary my personal favorite and so good that Lucasarts did a sloweddown version of it for their western shooter Outlaws and of course the final three way shootout. He still composes scores for many other films to this day I've been told. A good example of his most recent work would be the 1990 version of Hamlet starring Mel Gibson and directed by Franco Zefferelli. But I truly doubt that he'll ever be able to top the legendary work he did here.".

They say that before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what was to be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. It was Sergio's World  an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free to control. He controlled the audience and his story like no other director.To me his best film was the one that was on many critics' ten worst films of 1984 list Once Upon a Time in America. I love the finished director's cut the cut of the film Sergio Leone himself wanted and pictured in his mind while filming the movie. Unfortunately the editor of the film cut everything into a twohour picture and messed up the timeline for the theatrical release in 1984  the result was a disastrous motion picture that now with the director's cut stands as one of the best of all time. James Woods once said that one of the critics who named it the worst film of 1984 later named it the best film of the decade.Once Upon a Time in America was Sergio's dream project one that took him ten years to get on the big screen and ultimately killed him by sucking the life out of him but The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1967 was undoubtably his most visual film. The extreme closeups the great way he lets the audience see nothing but what he wants  as far as he saw it the audience should not wonder what is offscreen whatever is within the frames is all there is. Compared to Once Upon a Time it seems a bit more corny and unrealistic  but it is a spaghetti western and that is simply the point. It stands above the rest as the best spaghetti western of them all.Leone is best remembered for his extreme closeups. Director Quentin Tarantino once said among many other things about Leone his role model that when he started out he knew not many camera directions so when he wanted an extreme closeup in a film he'd shout I want a Sergio Leone on this guy! Quentin Tarantino has such a respect for Leone that he even suggested the title Once Upon a Time in Mexico to director Robert Rodriguez the title of course a derivation on Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America both films of Sergio Leone.The Good the Bad and the Ugly a.k.a. Buono il bruto il cattivo il is the final film in the Dollars Trilogy  A Fistful of Dollars For a Few Dollars More and of course The Good the Bad and the Ugly. I have yet to see this film's predecessors but I doubt they are much better than this film. It isn't really about anything per se  it's a showcase of art and camera techniques. It is a showcase for Sergio Leone and a great one at that. I have no real care about the themes or outcomes  I simply enjoy being controlled by a masterful director such as Leone. When there's a director who can literally push in and give the audience specifically what he wants them to see without the audience feeling cheated you know you have a great director because there's a fine line between a selfish director and a visionary director. Leone has a bit of both so indistinct that it is hard to notice. The same thing was done in Carol Reed's The Third Man 1949 and the same is done here. And it is pulled off without any objections from the audience.Clint Eastwood is The Good  he rides around the desert kidnapping criminals giving them to the authorities and claiming reward money and then freeing the criminals before they are to be hanged. He meets Tuco Eli Wallach a.k.a. The Ugly and does his routine  but The Ugly fights back and ultimately kidnaps good ol' Clint taking him into the desert and practically torturing him in the heat.Then The Good overhears where a stash of gold is hidden from a dying man. The Ugly wants the gold so much that he nurses The Good back to health so that they can go off on a wild goose chase and search for the treasure. But there is already another man searching for the treasure  Angel Eyes a.k.a. The Bad Lee Van Cleef a man whose skills at gunfighting match those of The Good a true marksman if ever there was such a thing.There's a terrific scene towards the end of The Good the Bad and the Ugly where three men have found the gold buried in a graveyard. At exactly the same time. They each have guns pointed at each other. They could all pull their triggers and die or kill one of the three and the two could then take the money and split it. Leone zooms in with his extreme closeups and truly gives the audience a sense of paranoia a sense of what it would feel like in a circumstance such as that. Sergio Leone is a great director perhaps the most visionary of all time and now that his films are turning up again with their intended running times the realization strikes and sinks in.He's an even better director than we thought he was.55 stars John Ulmer".

While I don't even think it's the best thing Sergio Leone made it's a solid Spaghetti Western that has all but transcended the subgenre. There are images such as Clint Eastwood in the poncho and music like the main title theme that are known by people who have never seen the movie. I also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The Good the Bad and the Ugly. I can't think of another Italian made film let alone an Italian made Western that has become so universally known and enjoyed.There are so many moments in The Good the Bad and the Ugly that I enjoy. One of my favorites is that of Tuco running through the cemetery as Morricone's The Ecstasy of Gold plays in the background. It literally gives me goosebumps. It's one of those movie moments that I look forward to no matter how many times I've seen them. I'm also a fan of the techniques Leone used in The Good the Bad and the Ugly. Leone's use of the widescreen shots of the landscape intercut with extreme closeups of faces is brilliant. It adds a sense of intimacy to vastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part the movie and gain some insight into the characters. It's a technique that very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ.But I sincerely doubt that Leone's film would be so widely and wildly regarded if it weren't for the music of Ennio Morricone. I've already mentioned the main title theme and The Ecstasy of Gold but these are only two examples found in this amazing score. Can you imagine the final showdown without Morricone's music? I can't think of many instances where music and film go together to create such tension and anticipation. I've already used the word brilliant to describe Leone but it's also applicable to Morricone.Finally The Good the Bad and the Ugly wouldn't be the same without the three lead actors. Each at least in this movie is brilliant there's that word again in his own right. Clint Eastwood is The Good. He's The Good in the sense that he's not as bad as the other two. Lee Van Cleef is The Bad. He's a ruthless killer who would just as soon shoot you as look at you  as long as the price was right. And then there's Eli Wallach as The Ugly. As good as Eastwood and Van Cleef are Wallach is really something special. Wallach's Tuco is one of the most crazed but complicated characters I've seen. It's a special cast for a very special movie.".

For those who actually care about the history of film  Leone invented a brand new genre called the Italian western. His first Fistful of Dollars recycled a Japanese story Yojimbo recycled an American expat whose Hollywood career was officially over Eastwood and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the modern film era Ennio Morricone. next came For a Few Dollars More an original story which locked into film history Leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing and brought out of mothballs Lee Van Cleef one of the greatest faces in the history of the western. Angel Eyes in this one.  with two international hits under his belt Leone aimed for the stars and created this movie which marks his legacy. While simultaneously continuing the tradition he started and using the two stars from his second film he gave Eli Wallach an Alist star from the 1950s the role of his career. Wait there is more. He set the story against the backdrop of the Civil War and manged to make the transitions seamless and brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an antiwar film at the same time! The only film of Leone's that may compete with this one is Once Upon a Time in America also reviewed by this writer on the IMDb.By modern standards the film is overlong and had it been produced in America as was indeed the case with Upon a Time in America the suits would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. Luckily for the rest of us this was an international release cutproof and survives very nicely to the present day in its original form.QT was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear. He used Morricone's music in Kill Bill his best film in my view and in my view The Hateful Eight tries to emulate the power of Leone but falls somewhat short.For you youngsters out there I recommend these films as some of the most entertaining efforts ever set to film period. Imitated but not duplicated.Astonishing mindblowing unforgettable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people choose 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' as the best of Sergio Leone's superb spaghetti western trilogy I'm putting trilogy in inverted commas because the three movies actually have no connection to each other and Clint Eastwood despite the Man With No Name tag  plays a different character in each. Now it's a very close call I admit but as much as I love this movie I'm inclined to choose the one before it 'For A Few Dollars More' as my favourite. Anyway this is still a superb piece of pure entertainment and Leone's movies had a massive impact on not just the western genre but action and adventure movies of all kinds. Clint Eastwood is super cool playing Blondie just as he was as Joe in the first movie and Monco in the second. FAFDM added a strong supporting character by Lee Van Cleef TGTBATU continues that though Van Cleef is playing a completely different guy and also brings in  Eli Wallach as Tuco who adds some nice comic touches.  Blondie and Tuco have lots of great scenes together but I could have done with a lot more Angel Eyes Van Cleef one of the greatest screen villains of all time. Having three strong roles instead of just Eastwood is one of the great things about this movie. Another great thing is the unforgettable score by Morricone. Morricone did some of his most memorable work with Leone and this could just be the best of the lot. Certainly the main theme a massive hit single in the late 1960s as covered by Hugo Montenegro is one of the most recognisable and original pieces of film music ever. Another standout is the spectacular bridge scene surely a direct inspiration for Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' a movie which owed Leone a sizable debt in my opinion. It's very difficult to pick this movie apart and single out what is so great about it as it really works as a whole. There's almost nothing wrong with it. It's one of the greatest westerns ever made and a hugely enjoyable movie that is just as compelling on your tenth viewing as your first. If you haven't seen it before I still think watching 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More' first is the smartest movie despite the three movies being a trilogy in name only and each of the three being able to stand alone. Each movie is brilliant stuff and each comes with my highest recommendation. Movies don't get much more entertaining than this!".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I have read a lot of the bad hype that the flick has receieved and I believe that this is partly due to the fact that people go into these types of movies expecting amazing advances in cinematography as well as a gripping and dramatic plot. Well I hate to burst everybody's bubble but that is really not the purpose of this type of movie. These bad reviews make me wonder just how serious you have to be or just how snobby a critic going into the theater to hate this type of movie making.Far be it from me to say that this movie was perfect. It had its flaws and there were times when I found myself snickering at the silliness of it all but that to me is good entertainment. The scenes where Cage turned into ghost rider for the first time were fairly intense and I found myself marveling at the coolness of his transformation and powers. I also enjoyed the battle scenes including one involving ghost rider and a helicopter I won't tell you what happens there but it is pretty amusing. I also felt that the movie was pretty wellacted overall and the entire flick maintained an aura of fun throughout which I believe was the main purpose of the whole thing while flowing smoothly through a simple plot.If you are the type of person to overanalyze plots scrutinize special effects whine about some cheesy acting or if you get offended when a movie doesn't have a deep and philosophical meaning behind it this is definitely not a movie you should waste your time or money on.If however you are the type of person who enjoys some good laughs some over the top and at times cheesy comic book acting cool battle scenes action and adventure or if you simply just like to see some guy with a flaming skull this is worth the 8 bucks to get into a theater seat.".

However if you're looking for a movie that's a lot of fun and is going to keep you entertained then this is exactly what you're looking for.The visual effects in this movie are simply put amazing. Ghost Rider is just one of those movies that's cool to look at. As I said before the acting sometimes falls a bit flat but Nicolas Cage does exactly what's expected of him for the role. It's a bit clich and humorous at times but this is a movie based on a comic book so you have to expect that sort of thing.Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda provide the best acting in the movie while Wes Bentley does a solid job as Blackheart and Eva Mendez is just a very beautiful actress who fits in well as Roxanne.There are a lot of little gripes about this movie if you look too hard and overthink it but as a diehard Ghost Rider fan I didn't mind these things so much. It stayed relatively true to the original series while borrowing elements from the 90's series to help make the movie more visually impressive which I felt worked really well.I've been waiting for this movie since they started trying to make it over eight years ago and overall I'd have to say I really enjoyed seeing my favorite comic book character finally make it onto the big screen.If you want to go see a movie where you can just sit back relax and enjoy the ride then go see Ghost Rider without any worry of disappointment.".

	schema:headline " Hysterically funny";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghost Rider is hilarious. Unspeakably hysterically funny. Sadly though it's all unintentional humor. The movie manages to pack in every comic book and action movie clich imaginable laughable casting an illogical script wooden acting and jarring direction for straightfaced amusement.Johnny Blaze is a 17yearold tyro who works in a circus as part of a daredevil motorcycle act with his father. When he learns his dad's got cancer Johnny makes a literal deal with the Devil played by a cardboard cutout of Peter Fonda to save his dad's life. That lasts about one day because the next evening Johnny's dad dies during a performance. Nooooooooooooo! shouts Johnny. Which is kind of what you'll be yelling when you watch the movie.Johnny has a girl too Roxanne. The night before the fateful performance she tells him she's moving away  her dad skeptical about Johnny's ability to stay alive in such a dangerous line of work is sending her to live with her mother. Roxanne informs Johnny of this the very moment he's done carving an elaborate Johnny  Roxanne Forever mark into a huge old tree. Apparently she didn't want to ruin his concentration before dropping the bombshell. The two decide to run away together anyway but then Johnny's pop dies and Johnny runs off on his own to become the World's Awesomest Motorcycle Dude.Meanwhile! Elemental angels in league with the Devil's son Blackheart are trying to get a contract giving them control over the souls of some longdead town. With these souls Blackheart can rule the world or something. It's unclear how all of the souls of one tiny town in the middle of nowhere would give anyone the power to rule anything bigger than a hamburger stand. And it seems when Johnny made his deal with the Devil he became the Ghost Rider responsible for transporting the contracts of souls to the Devil Blackheart wants to intercept the contract so he can usurp power from his dad.Fast forward one year later. Yes one year. Johnny has changed from being 17 to being... Nicolas Cage. Cage is 43 years old. This makes no sense. Oh and of course he runs into old flame Roxanne too now played by Eva Mendes. Or more accurately played by Eva Mendes' chest which is prominently on display whenever possible. Mendes is 32 years old. She is ostensibly playing an 18 year old. Even more amusingly Roxanne is now a television reporter. At 18 it's more likely she'd be assistant gopher to the producer. Ever the professional even when on the air Roxanne wears lowcut tops the better to distract the viewer from her inane questions.One gets the impression that Cage signed on to this role merely because he sports a Ghost Rider tattoo which ironically had to be covered up for the movie. It's kind of as if Jerry Seinfeld were tapped to play Superman. You get all of Cage's mannerisms  the tics the hangdog expression the mouthagape gaze the laconic attitude. Not really what you expect from a comicbook hero. Mendes is fun to look at but her delivery is paradoxically flat. Rounding out the cast are a couple of old timers  Sam Elliot plays Caretaker a wily old coot as only Sam Elliot could play him. Elliot's a fantastic actor and he's a much better fit for his role here than anyone else in this sludgy claptrap but he can't save the movie. He's not even on screen until around the halfway point of the movie. Peter Fonda looking weathered and sort of beatendown is The Devil he's sort of aloof and unconvincing. Oh yeah and Wes Bentley who once was in American Beauty is Blackheart sans Joan Jett. Geez they could have gotten any gothylooking nitwit to play this role it was so overthetop. Bentley does not make a good villain.Let's be clear here. This isn't supposed to be a funny movie. It's a straightfaced comicbook tale of a haunted young man. And yet the movie's so ineptly presented one can't help but laugh. Questions abound Why does Ghost Rider not even show up until a good way into the movie? Why are we told Johnny's jumping 300 feet a football field when the distance is longer than that 360 feet? Why when Johnny asks the Devil if he's the one responsible for keeping Johnny alive through all his deathdefying feats does the Devil say No that was all you Johnny? Was it? If you're the Devil and you NEED this guy to be your Ghost Rider and your guy is in a line of work in which he's constantly in harm's way wouldn't you help him so he doesn't you know die? When Johnny stops his cycle on a busy freeway so he can chat with Roxanne blocking traffic how come no one drives around his bike and her van? There are two lanes. Why if Blackheart's a supernatural and presumably immortal being does Caretaker toss Johnny a kickass shotgun with which to attack Blackheart? Why is the church where Caretaker lives and works sacred hallowed ground that Blackheart cannot trod upon but other churches  including the one in the tiny middleofnowhere village  are not? Why when Ghost Rider races through the city one night inadvertently causing destruction does exactly one car flip up and smash into a window despite there being dozens of other vehicles around it? How come Ghost Rider can be hurt if you stab him in the shoulder blade but you can't wound him by shooting him? Some of these questions may have actual answers but I didn't get them from the movie.So the movie's pretty much useless and in a week or so we'll have forgotten it ever existed. It's poorly acted directed and written and offers little in the way of solid entertainment  unless of course you're looking for some unintentional laughs.".

It's a movie based on a comic book and it does a great job of bringing that comic book to life and of keeping the comic book nature of the story intact. This isn't a bad thing it is what it is. It's not a chick flick it's not clever and witty it's not deep and mysterious. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen with nice fx and a decent score and appropriate acting. It's fun. It's a hoot. The bad guys are bad the good guys are good and the end isn't a cop out which is nice. If you are not the audience for which this movie is intended you will not like this film. If you are you won't be disappointed. Is it as strong a movie as Spiderman? No. But the story isn't as strong either. It is however a good yarn something my kids liked something I liked and I'm not even a comic book guy.".

It's not a chick flick it's not clever and witty it's not deep and mysterious. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen with nice fx and a decent score and appropriate acting. It's fun. It's a hoot. The bad guys are bad the good guys are good and the end isn't a cop out which is nice. If you are not the audience for which this movie is intended you will not like this film. If you are you won't be disappointed. Is it as strong a movie as Spiderman? No. But the story isn't as strong either. It is however a good yarn something my kids liked something I liked and I'm not even a comic book guy.";

It is fun stuff though and very much in the spirit of the Marvel comic book of the same name. Nicolas Cage works well in the role his deadpan humor is well suited to the role of motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze and the scene in which he attempts to explain himself to his longlost girlfriend is classic stuff full of awkward pauses and an eyebrow put to good use.Granted things get a little melodramatic from time to time but that's as it should be. This is after all a movie based on a comic book hero and what superhero worth his heatvision doesn't indulge in a dose of the melodramatic every so often? It comes with the territory. Still there's a sense of humor at work here something that didn't play out well in the XMen franchise and led to that abysmal third installation. There are a good number of laughs in Ghost Rider. This isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously which is a nice benefit considering how heavy the subject matter could become. It's rough around the edges no doubt and isn't quite up to the same level as the Spiderman movies to date.I saw an early 1145 AM show and the theater was still nearly full. The audience laughed at points that were intended as humorous and even jumped at a couple of scenes. All in all everyone looked like they were having a good time from the six year olds with their parents to the older folks like me who were fans of this comic as kids. If you're looking for something fun Ghost Rider isn't a bad bet at all.".

The bad guys were nonentities and although they were supposed to be really powerful etc they don't do anything threatening through most of the movie and Ghost Rider eventually offs them with ridiculous ease even the main dude at the end.Honestly this movie has so many clichs you'll be bored less than half way in and after waiting about 30 minutes for Ghost Rider to appear you just want him to get off the screen straight away since apart from looking cool he comes across as a complete dork and his dialogue consists of really bad corny one liners. Every time he comes on screen you just hope to hell he doesn't say anything and when he does you'll be so embarrassed for the poor bloke.Go get the comics instead.".

He has a face that is like a silent movie actors and I kept thinking about movies like Nosferatu or Phantom of the Opera. He's been waiting for years to play this role and you can really feel how much fun he's having just going crazy especially in the first scene when Johnny Blaze turns into the Ghost Rider. The movie just borders on the edge of campy but always manages to pull itself back before going to far. And Sam Elliott. It's got Sam Elliot. What more could you ask for?".

	schema:reviewBody "This is yet another comicbook movie that this time doesn't dissappoint. It certainly does not. It's definitely one hell of a way to start off the 2007 movie blockbuster list. Ghost Rider had high expectations of showing off a new side to comicbook based movies horror. There are some pretty cool horror moments especially involving Blackheart. When Johnny Blaze turns into Ghost Rider for the first time it scared me not only by the look of his eyes but how frighteningly realistic it looked as well. That brings me to another point visual effects. They're a lot better than your average comicbook visual effects. When Blackheart's face turns into his more demoniclooking face it looked so REAL.There were a lot of amazing things about this movie that caught my attention but like every comicbook based movie there has to be something bad about it as well.First the GOOD things1 visual effects were off the chart in Ghost Rider. They all looked extraordinarily real including Johnny's first ever transformation into Ghost Rider. Other nominees include Blacheart's demonic face and especially Gressil's sand transformation.2 Most of the acting was well put and directed quite well. Nicholas Cage isn't the best Ghost Rider but Ben Affleck sure as hell isn't the best Daredevil. Cage still stayed true to the role. Eva Mendes and Roxxanne Simpson was OK. It wasn't the perfect acting but it worked for me. Last but CERTAINLY NOT least is Wes Bently as Blackheart. There was something about Bently that made me believe Blackheart was actually real that it was the actual Blackheart acting as himself. To me his best line had to be He sent you to bring me back. Well I'm not going back!! I LIKE IT HERE!!!. Thanks to the voice sycncronizers this wouldn't have been possible. He definitely brought the character to life and thats why he is the best actor in this movie.3 Electronic guitars and drums in a original soundtrack INSANE!!Now unfortunately the BAD things1 One thing that kept bothering me throughout the movie was Cage's acting. Some of it was OK while most of it made me feel like I was watching a mix of Saturday Night LiveSoup Opera. I think the cheesiest line was when he told Roxxanne who he really is. Was he mumbling? Was he trying to exagorate? I'll never understand it.2 Now in most actionsuperhero movies there has to be some form of side villain. In all three Blade movies you got Quinn Reinhardt and Triple H. Now in Ghost Rider we have three fallen angels Gressil Wallow and Abigor. All represent an element of earth. Do they provide a challenge for Ghost Rider? NO. They're OK but each one had little screen time and they were all unfocused to a point where we didn't really understand them that much. 3 Now not that this isn't important but isn't this movie TOO scary for little 12 year old kids? When I saw Ghost Rider in theaters some 1112 year old kid screamed and cried when Blackheart was walking out in the desert and put his face to the camera to show his demon face!! And he was siting in the very first row right by the screen!! I got a look at this kid and he had to be around 12 years old. Embarrassing. Ghost Rider is as amazing and breathtaking as any other MarvelDC Comic movie. It ain't perfect but it doesn't mean to be. It totally beats the failure of Daredevil and Elektra but doesn't beat the perfection of Spiderman and Batman.".

'Ghost Rider' is the best actionthriller movie of the year so far.Nicholas Cage's performance is absolutely incredible. His performance and the movie is stunning. The special effects are awesome. And the motorcycle scenes especially when it's riding on the skyscraper as seen in a trailer for 'Ghost Rider' would be great in IMAX. I can't believe they aren't releasing it in IMAX. It would look so cool! I think this movie will be a great hit when it comes out in theaters. I'm hoping the box office for 'Ghost Rider' will be at least 150000000.Like I said the special effects are awesome. The way the creators made Ghost Rider is so cool. I love the design for the Ghost Rider character.And the climatic fight between Ghost Rider and Blackheart is absolutely stunning. The sequence kept my heart racing and my pulse throbbing. 99 out of 100 people will not be disappointed with that sequence between the two characters.The movie is a furiously quick movie that seems to go by in a halfhour although the movie is 114 minutes 1 hour and 54 minutes.When I walked into the special sneak peek at our theater honestly I wasn't expecting much. I was just expecting a clichd comic book thriller that would be a cheap cheesy B movie that would last in theaters for at least two months but I was wrong. This is not a clichd comic book thriller and it's not a cheap cheesy B movie. It will last at least four months in the theaters...I hope so anyway.All in all an awesome movie with cool special effects and awesome performances.This is a mustsee! Official MPAA rating PG13 Horror Violence and Disturbing Images My MPAA rating PG13 Horror Violence Disturbing Images and Some Language My Canadian rating 14A Violence Frightening Scenes".

Then I watched it a second time and started to realize you have to really pay attention to the details to get the story. While not the best adaptation of a comic book graphic novel if you prefer to the screen the special effects are awesome and the photography is Oscar worthy. Cage is Cage that stoic actor who seems somehow devoid of emotion in most of his films. Mendez is hot goes without saying and equals Cage's level of emotion. Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda are the saving graces of the film both adding a dimension of emotion lacking in the main characters. The prelude scenes of young Johnny and Roxanne are somewhat necessary but could have been trimmed down to include more footage of the Ghost Rider and his missions. I haven't seen the newest film just released at this writing but hopefully the characters have been fleshed out and the plot concentrates more on the present than the past. With Cage being the only holdover for the new movie perhaps the new directors can up the game a bit. The original film is rated PG13 for violence and language but nothing the teens haven't seen in their video games. Collectible? If you are a Marvel fan like I am probably. As as classic film? No way.

I'll watch anything the guy does no matter how terrible the reviews are and sometimes I'll be pleasantly surprised as was the case with Seeking Justice Drive Angry and Kiss of Death. The guy has some hidden gems in his career. Is Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance one of them? Hell no.The first Ghost Rider was campy and stupid but it was a watchable popcorn action movie and it had Eva Mendes hence watchable. Spirit of Vengeance is just stupid. Everything about it is stupid. No part of this movie is fleshed out and none of it is interesting. It throws you right into the action with no exposition. It's just a bunch of things happening on screen oozing with CGI to make up for the complete lack of substance. You can tell this is the same guy that directed Crank the difference is that movie didn't need any substance because the premise was so fun. This movie just pisses on Ghost Rider's origin literally and expects you to enjoy watching sht blow up for the sake of sht blowing up. The writing in this movie is especially horrendous did they hire a 10 year old to do the screenplay? It sure as hell seems like it.So you may be asking yourself why give it a 410 if it's so awful? Well I'm a sucker for laughably bad movies and this definitely qualifies. I mean the dialogue alone tries to take itself seriously but ends up providing really good unintentional laughs. But I'll be fair not all of this movie sucks.Nicolas Cage is always enjoyable to watch. You can tell he's invested in the role and his dedication really holds this movie together. Idris Elba is also in this movie for some reason and he's great in anything even if his character is completely throwaway. The other acting is serviceable I guess. You can't really blame any actors here because it's obvious the filmmakers wanted it to be a massive CGIfest with stupid dialogue to lead action sequence A to action sequence B. To their credit the CGI in this movie is pretty cool. Ghost Rider looks badass the visuals in the big set pieces are nice to look at and if you have no interest in the story you can definitely shut your brain off and enjoy the insanity happening on screen. So in a nutshell you don't need to see this movie. You really don't. Not even the great Nicolas Cage is enough to hold this piece of trash together. But if you're really stoned or just want to see cool sht on screen for an hour and a half and there's literally nothing else to watch go ahead and knock yourself out with Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. You may find a new Bmovie comedy classic.".

It's a nice antidote to the slew of overly serious superhero films.Set in Eastern Europe the plot is an unoriginal demonpossession story done far better in the Omen franchise with young Danny Fergus Riordan being chosen by Roarke Cirian Hinds to carry his evil legacy. On the proviso that he's rid of his curse Ghost RiderJohnny Blaze Nic Cage agrees to help Danny's mother Nadya the absolutely stunning Violante Placido save her boy.Probably the highlight of the film is Nic Cage who unashamedly hams it up. Sometimes it's fun to watch someone play a bad role with gusto and no shame. That's exactly what Cage does and you know he's having a ball. More power to him.This is complemented by some cool special effects again they're cheesy but a film about a demoniacally possessed daredevil with a flaming body and skull doesn't have to worry too much about realism. Yes GRSOV is a bad film compared to 'Iron Man' 'Thor' and 'Captain America' but its good fun and a bit of escapism. If you go into it with the right attitude you'll probably like it. Sometimes we need to stop taking films so seriously and enjoy them as they were intended.".

The reasons given for the outcome of any conflict in the movie seem like the ones a child would come up with while playing with his little friends.I went to see the movie in a 3D XD Extreme Digital movie theater and even that didn't compensate enough how bad the movie is that I wouldn't be anxious to get out by 34ths into watching it.Now here's something I definitely don't get how can Stan Lee let such a horrible horrible horrible abomination like this thing be released under the Marvel name?".

Idris Elba does a good job as the Church guy and Ciarin Hinds is decent as the Devil.Overall this is a overthetop superhero film that doesn't deserve widespread hate but still is pretty bad.

	schema:reviewBody "I was pleasantly surprised by Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance which is to say that I didn't hate it. Well I didn't actually hate the original Ghost Rider from 2007 itself based on an occasionally popular Marvel comic book but aside from some neat special effects that film was pretty mediocre and I figured the sequel would be even worse. Imagine my shock when I found myself actually enjoying Spirit of Vengeance. While hardly extraordinary the new movie is surprisingly fun.Nicolas Cage is back as Johnny Blaze the onetime stuntrider now possessed by an evil spirit that transforms the unfortunate Blaze into an unstoppable beast with a thing for fiery motorcycles and a flaming skull instead of a head. Blaze is now cruising the backstreets of Eastern Europe doing everything he can to keep the Ghost Rider at bay and himself out of harm's way. But trouble has a way of finding Blaze and when a mysterious man named Moreau Idris Elba brings Blaze the strange story of a special boy on the run from the Devil played with wicked aplomb by the great Ciarn Hinds the haunted maverick can't turn him downespecially since Moreau promises to cure Blaze of his little problem when the boy is safe and the crisis averted. So Blaze lets the Ghost Rider come alive once again just in time to save the kid and his mom the gorgeous Violante Placido from a batch of thugs. But of course the troublefor Blaze for Moreau for the boy and his motheris just beginning.While the script is hardly anything deep or profound it is wellpaced and often surprisingly witty. The script has a pleasant selfdeprecating humor underlying it all and the various performers all seem to enjoy going along with the outlandish plot. Cage who is a fan of comics in real life is wellcast as Blaze and captures the character's conflicting emotions with expert ease. Not many modern actors play villains better than Hinds and Placido is surely on track to become one of the most soughtafter actresses in the business with her rare combination of melancholy beauty and on screen intensity. There's also an unexpected but welcome role for Christopher Lambert of Highlander famethough he's nearly unrecognizable beneath a scrawl of tattoos.Special effects are outstanding and there are a number of outofthis world action scenes that are major crowdpleasing moments. The Ghost Rider himself is a fearsome spectacle and his every appearance brings with it the gleeful anticipation that one of the movie's numerous baddies is going to get his muchdeserved punishment in an especially painfuland spectacularfashion. Best of all the script touches on the idea that we all have our inner demons to wrestle with which is all too true and there is even the hint that the Spirit of Vengeance is perhaps redeemable and that somewhere deep inside even the Rider might yet harbor Good.In a way you can't enjoy Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance if you're looking for too much but it's not bad and at times even becomes quite good. If you're a fan of the old comic book then this is a mustsee and even general action fans probably won't regret throwing down the cash for it if they get in the right spirit of thingsthe Spirit of Vengeance that is!".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked the first Ghost Rider and collected comic books for years. I say that to let the reader know that I am also a fan of comic book movies normally and am not a stickler about a movie sticking to comic book canon. My problems with this movie have nothing to do with it being a comic book movie.The special effects in the movie are very bad. I saw it in 2D since I do not like 3D but I do not believe that makes a difference. The new version of the burning skull is much worse than the original. Now there is tons of smoke most of the time and it is hard to see anything. Like watching polar bears have a milk fight in a blizzard but in black instead of white. The excess smoke and a skull that sometimes blazes but often is just impossible to see in the smoke combine to remove some of the cool factor of Ghost Rider. In addition the motorcycle and costume that were cool in the first one are gone. Replaced with a motorcycle that is hard to see hello smoke most of the time and when you can see it it is basically an old motorcycle on fire. Not the awesome chrome and blazes chopper you would expect. The outfit is old leather that appears to be melting when you can see it through the smoke. I suppose that would be fine if you are going for more of a rotted zombie look but that is not Ghost Rider.One of the main bad guys appears to be one of the ghost twins from the Matrix films and is about as interesting although he does have a cool power that the actor does a good job of appearing to enjoy. Sadly he is on the screen far too seldom and is far too often in GR's smoke.Which brings me to the acting. Normally I like Nicholas Cage but here he is different. His face is chunkier and he has replaced acting with turning his head sideways. Apparently someone told him that instead of snappy patter or doing cool things he would appear so much more menacing if he started just turning his head sideways. So he does it A LOT! As GR he barely talks except for a few very poor one liners that are akin to Arnold's I let him go in Commando.In case the poor acting distracting special effects and poor story are not enough they also added annoying camera work. At times it has the handheld shaky method so wonderfully annoying and at other times the director falls in love with closeups that add to confusion when you want to see what is going on.In the first Ghost Rider he could throw fire he could use a Pennance or Soul stare Gaze. He could defy gravity with his awesome chopper. He made quips and was a hero. They did away with all of that and replaced it with....Nic Cage turning his head sideways. I know that he does gaze at a bad guy but although some might claim that is the Pennance Gaze nothing seems to happen.Finally just in case all of the aforementioned was not enough they made sure to have lots of people talking with odd accents to help make sure the mumbled dialog was harder to understand. An awful movie that I have 2 stars only because of my respect for comic book movies in general and I am glad someone tried to make a sequel. If only they would give the rights back to Marvel and let us get a decent Ghost Rider movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "The biggest problem of the first Ghost Rider movie is it doesn't have enough riding no action and it focuses more to the romance between Johnny Blaze and Roxanne. Which isn't really the main appeal. In this film it gets focused to the plot. Unfortunately the story is weak and the script has its awkwardness scattered. Thankfully there's Nicolas Cage who's spicing things up with his crazy insane performance. This is probably one of his craziest performance since Bad Lieutenant. Also there's the Crank directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor using their shaky camera and directing style. It fits to the film. Some people may be disappointed but if you're in for some crazy Nicolas Cage and some crazy action then you're going to enjoy this.It doesn't look like a sequel though. The flashback of Johnny Blaze's deal is different from the first movie. The only thing that stays here is Nicolas Cage. Everything else is new. Well the story is pretty weak. The plot is little. The whole film is just chasing and protecting a boy. But chasing is what's best in a Ghost Rider film. More riding and less brooding. Though there are some brooding but mostly is riding. But stories are still important in films and that is the main flaw of this. The script is awkward. With awkward dialogue and awkward moments.The best parts goes to Nicolas Cage. This may not be the same performance from the first film but this new Blaze is more entertaining and ridiculously hilarious. With more ridiculous is the directing. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor uses a lot of their trademarks and gives plenty of insanity in some scenes. There's a perfect chemistry between their directing and Nicolas Cage's rage. Feels like it's one of the trippiest films I have ever seen. The action is quite ridiculous. With its well shot shaky camera and its nonstop booming. These things feels right for this film. Yes flaming awesome and disintegrating bad guys. Do the most ridiculous things with the power.Aside from Cage Idris Elba and John Whitworth are both fun and awesome. Ciarn Hinds is like Danny Houston. Even in the single glance you know he could be a dangerous bad guy. And here he is a threatening one. The CGI is obvious. The new skull design of Ghost Rider looks more awesome than the first one. The camera is shaky but it's well shot and made the action more exciting even in 2D.Some people might get disappointed if they expect something bigger. But the action is bigger but the plot is just little. The people who likes Nicolas Cage and NeveldineTaylor will enjoy this a lot. Or someone who wants to see something ridiculously insane. It's hard to take this film so seriously. It's just hilarious and fun. Let me say that it's a crazy version of last year's Priest but with better action scenes and there's a nut main hero than a bland one. It's short it's dumb but has its enjoyment. There's an easy advice to watch this film Watch it for Nicolas Cage.".

	schema:reviewBody "'GHOST RIDER SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE' Three Stars Out of Five Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze also known as 'Ghost Rider' the superhero antihero from Marvel Comics. It's a sequel to the 2007 hit film. This one is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor the team that brought us two 'CRANK' films and 'GAMER'. It was written by Scott Gimple Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer who's written several B superhero films. The movie isn't really much better or worse than the original which I thought was passable entertainment not great but not bad either.In this film Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe when he's contacted by a Monk named Moreau Idris Elba who tells him a plot to take possession of a young boy's body. The devil is currently using the human form of a man named Roarke Ciaran Hinds who Blaze previously made a deal with and cursed himself with the 'Ghost Rider' monster inside him. Moreau tells him that if he saves the boy Danny Fergus Riordan he could rid himself of the 'Rider' permanently.

	onyx:emotionText "'GHOST RIDER SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE' Three Stars Out of Five Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze also known as 'Ghost Rider' the superhero antihero from Marvel Comics. It's a sequel to the 2007 hit film. This one is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor the team that brought us two 'CRANK' films and 'GAMER'. It was written by Scott Gimple Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer who's written several B superhero films. The movie isn't really much better or worse than the original which I thought was passable entertainment not great but not bad either.In this film Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe when he's contacted by a Monk named Moreau Idris Elba who tells him a plot to take possession of a young boy's body. The devil is currently using the human form of a man named Roarke Ciaran Hinds who Blaze previously made a deal with and cursed himself with the 'Ghost Rider' monster inside him. Moreau tells him that if he saves the boy Danny Fergus Riordan he could rid himself of the 'Rider' permanently. So Blaze makes it his mission to protect Danny and his mother Nadya Violante Placido who are on the run from Roarke's men.The movie is so bad it's good. It's definitely more 'out there' than the original but it also has even less structure. Cage hams it up even worse than usual but is still like always likable. It's all mindless entertainment but it's still entertainment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vNlBzdmfUfA";

Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance on the other hand is the worst kind of movie to me it's not that it's terrible it's just..... bad. I had absolutely no reaction after coming out of the theater. The closest thing to an emotion I felt was the regret of wasting 12 dollars on it I had missed the 2D viewing because of a miscommunication with my brother They had tried to stay truer to the source material this time but when your predecessor has already retcon'd your story to hell there's no point. the jokes were just lame and it seems that the new makers who unsurprisingly worked on Crank read the comics but didn't watch the first movie. I went into this theater expecting a typical Nic Cage film and even by those standards I was underwhelmed. He felt like he was only in say 2 minutes of the movie even though he was clearly in nearly every scene. Even the special effects seemed off with the rider's head jerking about every time he tried to move. it was clear that they tried to fix what was wrong wit the first movie but all in all it was just..... bad".

But still I decided to sit down and watch Ghost Rider 2 Spirit of Vengeance of out sheer boredom.Let it be said that Ghost Rider 2 Spirit of Vengeance is actually much better than the first movie. There is a much darker touch and feel to part 2. The movie is more brutal and visual and you get to see a more violent side to the rider.Storywise well then I think the movie was halting because it was a sort of a weird hybrid mix of Ghost Rider and Rosemary's Baby. It wasn't bad don't get me wrong however it was just something of a clich. Nothing surprisingly new or inventive here.The effects and CGI though were top notch. I liked what I saw and I was thoroughly entertained. I especially like the pyrotechnics and the smoke effects.Ghost Rider 2 Spirit of Vengeance had a good enough group of actors together. However in my opinion the movie was carried by Idris Elba playing Moreau and Johnny Whitworth playing Ray Carrigan. What happened to the Ray character was really awesome. I am not familiar with the Ghost Rider comic books so I have no idea whether or not that character is from the pages but he was still cool and had really interesting powers.For a Marvel movie then Ghost Rider 2 Spirit of Vengeance was actually a surprise for me. Especially because I am not too keen on men in spandex tights running around with super powers. Ghost Rider 2 Spirit of Vengeance was darker grittier and for a more mature audience.One thing that I just had to shake my head in disbelief at was the inyoufacelame raised finger morals with the an illegal download and the crime doesn't pay comments in the movie. Wow could it get any more of a clich? The illegal download comment was funny though but it was not really at place in the intro.".

Being a fan of the Ghost Rider comic book I was a bit disappointed in the original film as I found it a bit flat. However I gave it a bit of a pass because I knew that 'Daredevil' director Mark Steven Johnson's style was simply not suited for this type of subject matter. So whenever I watch that installment I can't help but feel a bit torn because although I didn't care for GR1 overall I have to admit that there were aspects of it that I can appreciate.But after watching GR Spirit of Vengeance I was very refreshed and impressed. They gave it more of a 'cult film' feel which I thought was PERFECT for this project. NeveldineTaylor seem to never be scared to take risks w going outside the box of contemporary filmmaking and GRSOV is a true testament of that. Since I can relate this feeling w the one I got when I first saw Lexi Alexander's Punisher War Zone I strongly anticipate that this film is gonna take a beating from the masses. But I don't care because IMHO the mainstream nowadays apparently have no idea of original thought and much of their opinions are spoonfed to them by corporate media.Also what helped make this work is the performance of all the actors ESPECIALLY NIC CAGE! I admit I had my doubts about him reprising the Johnny Blaze character but it's quite evident he was in tune w the directors' vision. SOV like PWZ is clearly a 'loveitorhateit' movie which works for me because since movies like this don't rack up at the box office and tend to be viewed as commercial flops they come out on home releases pretty quick at very reasonable prices w extras to boot. IMO this film will make most of its money on DVDblueray sales.Not wanting to spoil it for anybody all I can say is if you go see GRSOV try to have an open mind. Otherwise you might just be setting yourself up to be disappointed w no fault being that of the movie. The only reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because I thought it was a bit short 136 and I admit I'm a bit torn because perhaps it may have been best not to draw it out.Chalk up another 'underground hit' for Marvel Knights!!!".

This time the Ghost rider is much crazier and a little bit spookier. They've rightly decided to drop the silly monster voice he used to have in favour of a more whispered tone. The ghost riders soul desire now is to destroy anything and everything evil. So when the persona of Johnny Blaze disappears you better start running if you've been a bad boy or girl.The plot is perhaps a little too familiar. The Ghost rider is charged with protecting and accompanying a boy needed for an evil prophecy an evil prophecy that also involves the demon that cursed Johnny Blaze. We've all seen this story line some where before but really it's just the setting to let Nicholas Cage go crazy with the Freaky new iteration of the Ghost rider and that is exactly what he does.I was not a fan of the original i thought it was a little too boring for a movie based on a character possessed by the spirit of vengeance. This one on the other hand has lots of action being directed by the guys who brought us the Crank movies and Gamer I expected as much. The Ghost rider really takes it to the bad guys this time round and the final battle and highway chase are both pretty spectacular. We also see a couple of new powers which was quite refreshing.The CG is a little bit hit and miss sometimes it looks fantastic other times the way it is implemented is a little ropey. All round though the effects are pretty impressive and the new look of old flame head with the burnt and craggy old skull and the charred clothes is a much more appealing style for a character this dark.The strangest thing for me is that this didn't really feel like a superhero movie. It felt more like a revenge flick. Add to that the few truly bizarre moments like the scene when Johnny is alone in the Monks caves and you've got something quite removed from the standard. This is no bad thing in my opinion but it may put off some of the marvel movie fans out there.There's a lot to be enjoyed here with some funny over the top one liners. some great action and another great crazy turn from Nicholas Cage. One thing I will suggest is watch the film in 2D as the 3D isn't that great.".

	schema:headline " One of the most bizarre superhero movies";
	schema:reviewBody "And when I say bizarre it means the kind of crazy type. This movie is filled with weird humor crazy 'earthquake' shots during action scenes and fastpaced editing plus crazy acting by Nicolas Cage. But after all what can we expect from the two guys behind Gamer and the Crank movies. I can never understand why action directors like to shake the camera so hard like a mad bull during an action scene but during dialogue scenes the camera is perfectly still. In this case the directors make the same mistake although it is not too bad. I can't imagine how is it like to watch this in 3D. I made a wise choice not to catch it in 3D.The story It is a fairly simple chase movie. A group of bad guys want to catch a mother's boy. It doesn't say why until the middle of the movie. Johnny Blaze known as Ghost Rider hiding from sight is asked to help. Blah Blah. And the story goes on. People chasing people for the boy. One thing that is an improvement over the first movie is that this features some cool action and Ghost Rider has more powers. But unfortunately when it comes to the action it is like watching a lost found footage movie so you can't exactly see the CGI action. The directors injected the movie with a sense of weird humour even weirder than the first movie. Some can get entertaining but some can become embarrassing. Although some camera shots are good I would prefer for less frenetic and crazily shaking shots.Overall Basically it is for purely entertainment. If you didn't like the first one you probably won't like the second outing. Although it features more action the story is really kind of straight forward but also at the same time disjointed. I saw some reviews stating it is the worst superhero movie ever it is not true. It is just something not really seen in superhero movies. Which superhero movie has crazy camera shots and crazy weird humour? Not to say I hate the directors but I would like a third movie to be directed by a different director.".

Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter leading to drug abuse and paranoia that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.Goodfellas is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images witty scriptwriting superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances  ever  as Jimmy even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screenhe's very hard to miss. A short deranged loudmouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci and I tend to love his characters but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in Goodfellas while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. What do you want f? the man asks. Liotta continues walking takes out a gun and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous it's been recreated by other directors namely Paul Thomas Anderson in Boogie Nights and there's a reason it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990 but of course he didn't. Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo get over it.The movie is based on the truecrime memoirs of the reallife Henry Hill whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi  Wiseguys  was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.Anyway Goodfellas has to be one of the best films I've ever seena true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!".

I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent Ray Liotta Robert DeNiro Joe Pesci Lorraine Bracco and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100 accurate. The camerawork also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song Layla put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this the greatest mob film still today.Hedeen's Outlook 1010!!  A".

The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time.

As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.The sham of the mafiosi is exposed  preaching loyalty respect  principles  but when it comes down to it they are just twobit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of selfworth and stature that comes with being a wiseguy breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust hate and jealousy through the forced smiles. Interesting that given this certain people envy their lifestyle and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company but whatever rocks your boat. Some people have actually paid to see The Dukes of Hazzard film so I shouldn't be surprised.".

Films like The Silence of the Lambs The Crying Game Pulp Fiction The Usual Suspects Fargo and L.A. Confidential would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's GoodFellas.  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the halfIrish halfSicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of GoodFellas it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances Paul Sorvino is quietly effective and Lorraine Bracco in an Oscarnominated role does the best work of her career.  However it is Joe Pesci in his welldeserved Oscarwinning turn who steals every scene as the one who does the dirty work.  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many filmnoir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.".

The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast both known and unknown the cinematography editing dialogue brilliant use of music it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and cowriter Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal  to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco Paul Sorvino Michael Imperioli and lots of well known faces in small but important roles Debi Mazar Samuel L. Jackson Illeana Douglas Kevin Corrigan plus dozens of unfamiliar actors and nonactors who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the stars. Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines but looks cool!. 'Goodfellas' is to date Scorsese's last Great Movie and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!".

The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said The man who did the voice on GTA Vice City?. This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography.

Of course this is a movie about the mafia from the working mangangster point of view where The Godfather was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite so there really is no valid comparison there. Goodfellas really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series The Sopranos which debuted nine years after this movie was made.Goodfellas tells the reallife story of mobster Henry Hill and it is largely true although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also Tommy the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example crime boss Big Paulie actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member made man Billy Batts nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.".

He always says things like Nice Nice and that was just a background piece in Goodfellas.  But that is the point all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales.  It all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like.  And with all due kudos to The Godfather but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way Goodfellas does.To say that Joe Pesci is the best part of this film would be to discredit the rest of the cast but at the same time you have to mention him in some way.  His portrayal of Tommy is haunting.  Here is a man that is so insecure and wants to be the top dog the made man so bad that he can't decipher between what is a joke and what is disrespect towards him.  Of course the scene in question is when he shoots a common boy for telling Paulie to screw himself after Paulie shot him in the leg.  You would think the guy has a right to let off a little steam and vent but Paulie is always looking for the diss.  He is always looking to find some hidden gesture from someone that is putting him down.  Even at the beginning when he is getting on Henri in the now famous  You're a funny guy  scene.  He is kidding with Henri but deep down inside he is angry with him you can see it and feel it.  Joe Pesci gave the performance of his career and he richly deserved to win best supporting actor that year.The story and script by Pileggi is sheer inside brilliance.  You can feel the inside observations that no one can have except for a guy that spent his whole life on the inside.  They ring so true and they get into your blood. From scenes like the fat guy running around delivering messages to the other mob guys because he doesn't like to use the phone to the scene when Henri Paulie and Tommy have Billy Bats in the trunk but they stop off at Tommy's moms house for a late night dinner of pasta and such.  They also have to borrow a sharp knife to finish off the guy in the trunk but to his mom they have to cut off the hoof of a dear that hit the car.  And the scene where Tommy does kill the young kid for joking with him and then Paulie gets mad at him not for killing the guy but because he doesn't want to dig a hole tonight.  There are so many tiny observations in Goodfellas that give it the authenticity it has.  And it is a film that stays with you for years to come.  I think this is Scorcese's best film and although I understand and accept why the academy awarded Dances With Wolves the accolades it did if this film would have swept the Oscars that year no one would have been surprised.  It is a landmark film and I think it is one of the best films ever made.  And again taking no credit away from Coppolla's Godfather epics but this gets inside the mafia on a deeper level.  It goes one step beyond what Coppolla gave us and for that Goodfellas should be remembered as the best film about gangsters ever made.".

The real Henry Hill who is the main star of this movie actually said it was at least 90 true. He than said it was probably 98 accurate. This movie expresses a lot of the gangster ways and how they really did things.Summary This is pretty much a biography on Henry Hill who as a kid always wanted to be a gangster and he actually worked for them. It shows how a young kid grew up helping the mafia and becoming a mobster himself. This is a true story and really shows what being a wise guy is all about.Overall Definitely a 1010 movie. Really makes me want to be a wiseguy.".

	schema:headline " Italian Storytelling";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Competent filmmakers are rare  there is no doubt that Scorsese is competent and should be celebrated on that score alone.But his films are empty. They take you into a gangsterland even Temptation' even Innocence' and snap along until they end and then you leave. But you leave with nothing and I expect more from a competent filmmaker.The problem  I speculate  is the degree to which Scorsese is locked in the Italian tradition of storytelling and its 60's incarnation in neorealistic films. This is a matter of performance where the force of the story is all in the force of the storyteller. The performer here is Scorsese. His screen persona is epitomized in the Pesci character driving driving the group by pressing on. By speaking over others. By showing the threat of violence.There's power here. It grabs your attention like Pesci grabs that of the fellas. I can see Scorsese constantly saying to himself that he'd be nuts to live any other way. But aside from some storytelling mechanics there are no ideas here no ambiguities no interesting characters no plot maturity no symmetries nothing to wonder about and discuss on your way home.But we should salute some of the decisions. Scorsese chooses to frame the film as a story told by the Liotta character. He plays an Irishman but looks and acts Italian. Narrative voiceovers. A clever framing device with us locked in the car at midway through and mirrored in the beginning. The end with Liotta looking directly and speaking into the camera and shooting us.And the camera. Much has been said of the camera. The long tracking shots especially the muchcopied entrance through the kitchen. The pullbackzoom toward the end when Liotta and DeNiro meet. The occasional corner ceiling shot. Normally I would love this especially since it is in the framework of a consistent notion of the eye. What bothers me is what that eye is it is dependent on the characters. The characters drive this movie and pull the camera. Consider the kitchen entry scene the camera is on a string behind Liotta. We follow always follow just as the fellas at Pesci's table have to follow his prattling. Compare that to dePalma's similar long tracking shot of Bruce Willis at the start of Bonfire of the Vanities.' DePalma's camera isn't dragged along behind by the force of Willis. It floats to the front the side swooping around independently curious. We the viewers are masters of the story. It's the difference between the northern and southern European storytelling traditions.Seeing how little deference the camera gives us really grates when the payoff is so slight. It makes DeNiro pretty hard to take. Yes we all get impressed by the power of his performance. But it is always clear that it is a performance we are not seeing a character but a serious actor' employed as a tractor to pull us along.Is this a great film? Well it did not change my life give my dreams new form or provide the basis for any meaningful discussion with my wife. It didn't help me define myself or my world. It provided no new perspectives on the things I struggle with. And many many films do one or more of these things. So for me no.What a waste.".

It details the story of mob informant Henry Hillportrayed by Liotta about his twentyfive year life in the mob from 1955 when he was 12 years old until 1980 when he cooperated with the FBI that put his fellow mobsters into jail particularly Jimmy The Gent Conwayportrayed by De Niro and mob underboss Paul Ciceroportrayed by Sorvino.It details into Hill's criminal life that he is involved in like extortionrobberyhijacking and murder. It also provides the viewer the benefits that entails being part of the mob like the amount of money they are able to earn and the ability to be given special treatment particularly not going in line at Copacabana as well as the respect they achieve from the people in the neighborhood.Many film viewers in the past have accused of The Godfather of glamorizing mobsters particularly the mafia Dons like Don Vito Corleone and his successor Michael Corleone particularly the first part.While I certainly do not agree with the critics considering that the movie has shown how mob life can destroy one's family as shown in the movieScorsese made it a point for viewers to see clearly in this film how disastrous mob life is all about. It really has shown the crimes that they are involved with as well as the fear and anxiety these people constantly feel considering their way of life wherein crimes and murdering people are a parts of their daily life. It has also shown how much it lost its appeal particularly during its decline in the 1980's when the FBI intensified its commitment of putting people involved in organized crime behind bars.We get to see how the main characters ended up getting murdered like Tommy DeVitoportrayed by Pesci in his Oscar winning performance or how they spent the rest of their life in jail just like Cicero and Conway and how fellow members of the mob made deals with the FBI like Hill in order to corroborate against their fellow mobsters or friends in the crimes that they are involved in and enter a Witness Protection Program to protect them from the mob.After watching this film since its release 27 years ago while this review is writtenI must say that it really could be considered the best film about the mob as it is based on a true story and a true account of mob life particularly the socalled foot soldiers a.k.a wise guys or better yet goodfellas who does hits for the mob instead of a fictional account about Dons or leaders of organized crime families in The Godfather saga.It also provides us how truly unappealing this way of life is especially now that the mob no longer provides that much impact in society and the advancement of technology that have benefited the FBI in terms of investigation of mobsters and the deals or programs that mobsters get into whenever they help the FBI in bringing down organized crimes.This film makes it clear in that regard unlike The Godfather saga considering that the mob are still in their glory years during the settings of the three part movies during the 50's60's and 70's unlike this movie when it was released in 1990.OverallGoodfellas shows that truth about the mobits way of life and its decline from the time it was released until the present time.".

Well today after i saw this movie i'm 20 years old but never saw this movie before  shame i wanted to see what do other people say about it. This movie deserves 1110 stars. I really REALLY don't know why didn't it got an Oscar but it's pity. Now 1 IDIOT user wrote why do people rate movies like this so high? The only thing i can say is Dude life is not only pink and furry you have to look at the other side of life the dark side. In this movie you will find a superb story of how was life back then when the mobs ruled all. Violence is this guys problem... Dude take a look around and see for yourself. There is MUCH MUCH more violence nowadays then there was back then sad but true. And at the end of the movie Ray really broke my heart he ordered spaghetti and sauce and he got ketchup with cheap noodles  NOTHING is like it was back then.. EVERYTHING is falling apart we eat junk food have to wait in line quality of products drop no good music... just compare the Mercedes cobra to a new E class.. cobra's simply wouldn't break down  Mercedes almost got bankrupted  new cars in 58 years u have to change em but lets get back to the movie. Another user wrote WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN THE MATRIX? MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.. well i don't know what to say.. simply no comment. How old are you kid? 13? Matrix.. good movie but Goodfellas is 1000x better. You will find action good story betray love and all in this movie. Tommy would kill you if he would read that matrix is better lol. and the most important thing is that it is TRUE STORY. Geee... i wish i could live in the 5060's. real life true friends.

	schema:reviewBody "Goodfellas 1990  out of 4 Martin Scorsese's masterpiece about Henry Hill Ray Liotta a man who grew up hoping to be in the mob and he got his but crime does not pay as the old saying goes. GOODFELLAS has been called one of the greatest mob movies ever made and it's been called the best film of the 90s as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It certainly goes on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made and each time I view the thing I can't help but be amazed at the brilliance on screen. It's really does seem as if this isn't a movie because the thing is so perfect in every way that it's almost hard to believe that it's real. Even though everything in this movie is great there's no doubt that every ounce of credit belongs to Scorsese.There have been wonderful crime pictures going all the way back to the silent days so the director was behind the eight ball but instead of just delivering a great movie he instead goes all out and really creates a film unlike anything we've ever seen before. The way he films the violence shows the good times and the bad times. Everything is so flawless that you really do forget that you're watching a movie because it comes off like you're a fly on the wall witnessing all of this stuff first hand. There's the now legendary camera shot going through the restaurant there's the terrific music score and of course the violence that really shakes you. One could argue that we've seen this type of story countless times but it's so fresh here that you can't help but feel as if you're seeing it for the first time.There are so many brilliant moments here but special credit has to go to the final twentyminutes or so when Hill finally starts to crack due to all the drugs. The fastpaced nature of this sequence is among the most perfect filming you're ever going to see because by the time it's over you're going to think that you too are high on drugs. Another amazing thing that Scorsese does is get you into the events in these people's lives. The good times early on are so much fun that you can see why someone would select to be in the lifestyle. The camera doesn't shy away from capturing these moments including the high times in the nightclubs with the women and the money. However Scorsese also nails the downside when everything starts to crumble and the violence is so shocking and brutal that you then realize that this lifestyle only ends one way and you're thankful that you're not involved in it.Another major plus are of course the performances. Liotta is perfect in the role of Hill and especially when you consider he must carry the film over the more famous actors. I thought Liotta perfectly nailed not only the young energetic Hill but he really pulled off the drugcrazed maniac. DeNiro as usual is also terrific in his part as he brings so much fire and energy to the character and can cause you to fear him with just a look. Joe Pesci deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as there's no doubt that he delivers one of the finest villain roles in the history of film. Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also impressive as are the rest of the supporting players even down to the bit parts.GOODFELLAS is without question one of the greatest films ever made and like all classics it's a movie that keeps getting better each passing year. Scorsese has made many great films in his career and this here is certainly among his best.".

Having watched it I have to ask what all the fuss is about? This is a very ordinary film which explores at extreme length the intimate details of the lives of the most childish individuals ever committed to celluloid. Whether or not people like these really exist I found it completely uninteresting. I have no idea why so many people are fascinated by the mafia  maybe it's envy of the power  but they should not hold a fascination for civilised human beings. People who deal out death as a punishment for the slightest reverse in their lives deserve to be ignored or reprimanded not lauded and celebrated as in this film. For every Henry Hill there are a thousand or more kept in poverty because of the crime which supports his odious lifestyle. It would be nice to think there was some kind of a moral ending but even then we see Henry selling out his colleagues just to keep himself somewhere nearer the feeding trough.How anyone can rate this film so highly is beyond me how so many of you IMDB browsers can and do just beggars belief!".

It would be nice to think there was some kind of a moral ending but even then we see Henry selling out his colleagues just to keep himself somewhere nearer the feeding trough.How anyone can rate this film so highly is beyond me how so many of you IMDB browsers can and do just beggars belief!";

These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them with some real lingering melodies from that era.The story works on two levels both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 95 people with regards to families and staying on top of the competition as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!' and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed as the film spans four decades we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts.

	schema:reviewBody "Starting with the 1950's we follow Henry Hill from a teen who tries to realise his dream of always wanting to be a gangster'.  He goes from running errands for Paulie Cicero to become a trusted man within his organisation.  Working with James Conway and Tommy De Vito Henry navigates his violent lifestyle where death is never more than a few steps away.For my generation this was one of our first introductions to Scorsese doing a real tourdeforce of a film  I was too young to appreciate Raging Bull and his 70's work when it first came out and the eighties were a quiet period except the brilliant king of comedy.  So here was a great introduction to a fanatastic director.  The plot is spread over such a long time in terms of story years that it's hard to get beneath the surface events but this is a very minor problem given that it's such a great ride. The focus is on events and the culture rather than a deep story and as such Scorsese works with set pieces and events rather than too much characterisation.  However the story moves so effectively through the action  Scorsese uses long tracking shots pumping soundtracks and scenes of building tension and sudden violence to create a masterful experience.The weakness with lack of depth is really put to the back of your mind by the action the direction and the performances.  The story is well held together by Hill's narrative and the shallowness is easily over looked. Liotta is excellent as the aspiring gangster and is full of self seeking menace.  De Niro does what he does best in terms of the Irish gangster role but the standout is Pesci.  Pesci gives a strong role as the vicious Tommy and deserved his Oscar.  The rest of the cast are all excellent whether it's major roles Paul Sorvino Lorraine Bracco or minor characters Frank Vincent Sivero.The real star here is Scorsese  he uses the camera and the soundtrack to great effect and gets great performances from his cast.  A modern gangster feast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overrated in 1990 Goodfellas has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. It's based on the  I daresay  untrustworthy recollections of a halfIrish halfSicilian mobsterturnedinformant who recently I am reliably informed appears as an addled halfwitted guest on The Howard Stern Show. The narrative arc if one can accurately term it that spans 30 years roughly from 1950 to 1980. This of course gives Martin Scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of popculture tunes ranging from Bobby Vinton to Derek and the Dominoes. His use of the last 3 lilting minutes of Layla as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across New York City only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. One wonders whether Scorsese would've been happier as a Top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker.His conventionality  a surprising development given his success with such Seventies classics as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver both infused with his uniquely individual aesthetic  extends beyond the soundtrack to the actual movie itself. Lovers of this movie will doubtless be distressed to learn that the various stylistic techniques Scorsese uses here  whippans sudden freezes that supposedly add ironic punctuation to the narrative even the use of pop music as commentary on a montage  all derive from French yes I said French auteurs from the New Wave school of the Sixties and Seventies. These same lovers of this movie would probably also consider Orson Welles to be an overrated old fuddyduddy but that doesn't stop Scorsese from pointlessly laying on at least two sequences of long trackingshots through complicated spatial arrangements without cuts the device Welles perfected if not wholly invented. An even less impressive feat for Scorsese who benefits from the technological advance of the Steadicam. Welles did it with oldfashioned cameras on dollies and hydraulic cranes. I believe that all these borrowings betray Scorsese's fundamental perhaps unconscious lack of confidence in the power of his story here.For the screenplay let it be said at once is poorly constructed. The narrative focuses on trivial events like a gofer getting shot in the foot during a card game or Paul Sorvino slicing garlic to atomic thinness and then presents the worldfamous Lufthansa heist through hearsay. The movie's main character Ray Liotta as Henry Hill hears a news report about the heist while in the shower. One may reasonably ask why we're in the shower with Henry when we should be in the getaway car with Robert De Niro's Jimmy Conway and his henchmen. This of course leads one to reasonably ask why we're not watching a movie about Jimmy Conway instead of Henry Hill the latter being more often than not on the periphery of the movie's main events. Having Liotta narrate the exciting stuff for us in voiceover is no substitute. Indeed the movie is cripplingly dependent on voiceover narration perhaps because Mr. Hill's own story in and of itself isn't interesting enough to really warrant a honesttogoodness movie in the first place. As the movie drones on with Liotta's loquacious narrator ceaselessly filling in the narrative gaps one suspiciously wonders  for example  why Hill and Conway are NOT whacked for bumping off made man Billy Bats while Joe Pesci's Tommy DOES get whacked. All three men were involved in the killing yet only Tommy pays the price. Why? Does Conway's and Hill's Irishness serve as a magical forcefield?  I don't get it. Well I did say at the beginning of this review that Hill was an untrustworthy storyteller. From the evidence it appears that Hill was quite conversant with his mob boss's cooking techniques hence all the time wasted on cooking scenes and shots of gorgeously laidout family feasts and far less conversant with the important incidents that are the subject of this film. Note too how inconsistently handled Henry's character is throughout the film one moment he pistolwhips almost to death a sexual predator who messes with his girlfriend the next he's aghast when some punk kid gets carelessly killed. Hmm  smells like selfhagiography to me.After an overlyedited chaotic 30minute final act in which a sweatyfaced puffyeyed Liotta drives around the suburbs peering up through his windshield at police helicopters dropping off hot guns going to the grocery store zipping back home to make meatballs AGAIN with the cooking! and so forth he gets pinched for good. Under the umbrella of the Witness Protection program he finally rats out his mob bosses . . . and it occurs to us that this should have been the focus of the film all along i.e. the FBI's successful eroding of the criminal code using Witness Protection. But Scorsese crams it in during the last five minutes of this 3hour movie. A little less time in the kitchen and in the shower and a little more time getting down to business might have made this movie pretty great.As it is the performers give Goodfellas undeniable energy almost mitigating all its flaws. Fans of good New York actors will forgive this movie everything Liotta De Niro Pesci Sorvino and Lorraine Bracco do THEIR job at least. And perhaps this is why the movie is so wellloved. Colorful characters limned by great performances are entertaining. But in my judgment the virtues of verisimilitude can't overcome what amounts to a 3hourlong nonstory.3 stars out of 10.".

After watching it for the second time recently to make sure my impression from a viewing years earlier was accurate I feel every person involved in the picture and particularly Martin Scorsese deserves to be punished severely for inflicting Goodfellas upon me.Goodfellas has absolutely nothing to offer. It has neither the wisdom nor the compassion to say or reveal anything about life or human beings. Anyway Goodfellas is not interested in that. It just wants to be smart hip and funny. With such lofty goals it's a wonder this entire starstudded cast of actors and filmmakers fell so very very short. Goodfellas is not smart. It is not intelligent enough to understand what it think it portrays on an individual or larger basis. It does not somehow explain or explore the mob psyche the existence of organized crime in America or anything else for that matter. Despite the fact that it is taken from actual events and people it seems to desire no contact with reality.Goodfellas is not hip. Apparently Martin Scorsese was not aware that there is nothing less cool than trying hard to be cool. Goodfellas is full of flashy camera moves tough looking guys in swank suits and more fast colloquial dialogue than you could beat out of Dashiell Hammett but none of it adds up to anything but slime. Yes that's right slime. Goodfellas is so obnoxious you want to take a magical eraser and scrub each of its characters back into the pure white on the page from which they sprang. Is this an honorable aim for a film? To make you hate its characters to make you hate its voice? Let me be the one to say that cynicism is generally a good cover for laziness and as an approach to life it is one step above nihilism. Real cynicism has no place in art. Goodfellas is not funny. A complete lack of respect for human life is not a secret recipe for brilliant ironic comedy. It is disgusting really and those who laugh reserve a spot for themselves in the grime between the cracks under the bottom of the barrel of good humor.The performances in Goodfellas much lauded are ridiculously onesided. How wonderful they managed to span the chasm between looking tough and looking smug  all except for Ray Liotta who has to do the balancing act between being paranoid and annoyed. Bravo.Of note is Scorsese's choice to play pop music over 95 percent of the film presumably so that we have something to listen to while we are busy ignoring his movie.Goodfellas is trash.

As I said I didn't think it was bad it was just wasn't that good. I had to force myself to keep watching trying once again to see what other people see in Scorsese. I get the feeling all the praise and accolades heaped on him are just a big prank being played on me.At least the Godfather was an actual good movie although certainly no masterpiece.A far far better movie than this that came out around the same time would be Miller's Crossing. It's actually entertainingyou don't feel like killing yourself after watching it for just a few minutes which is another thing about Scorsese I don't like. His slickness bleak subject matter unredeeming violence all combine to create an effect like a lowfrequency earthquake hum or dayold shellfishit's nauseating and depressing. I honestly spend the rest of the day depressed and joyless after watching a Scorsese film. You may say that's the power of the film maker but I say that's simply the power of the subject matter. Manos the Hands of Fate is pretty depressing for much the same reason.Art shouldn't always be uplifting I love Bicycle Thief and the Year of Living Dangerously but if it's going to put such misery on the screen then it should have a good reason for doing it and it should teach me something.A good example of how hollow the praise for Scorsese and his works rings is the famous Copacabana scene a two or three minute steadicam shot following two characters from the outside of a nightclub as they wind through the kitchens and so forth and end up at their table. Scorsese's fans call this the best shot ever. As I said it's a long shot of a fellow getting a table. Kubrick did great tracking shots too but the key to a great tracking shot like any shot is that it communicates something significant to us puts us in the state of mind of the characters etc. But this was just some people walking to their table. The difference is contextual and often subtle but it's there.".

It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it to portray LA as a dusty oilpainting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the streetwise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bankrobber a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with but he too leads an inescapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made indeed one of the best films. An epic wonderful sad adrenalinefuelled exercise in scale and grandeur.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this threehour gem of a film down to its core this is a film about men  strong men  and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pilljunkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis De Niro in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene at the very end of the first tape if you own the VHS version sets up the last half of the film beautifully as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others who I am ashamed at times to call close friends say that Heat drags in places I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the excon who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same excon when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy  this minor character in a film with bigtime heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really a series of brief moments some touching others traumatic and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulsepounding action. Come hungry.".

	schema:headline " Mann's crime drama delivers";
	schema:reviewBody "'Heat' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline involving characters and Mann's sometimes poetic sometimes gritty directing 'Heat' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.Perhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline which focuses primarily on the main characters Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline it almost seems as if one is watching two movies with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna's personal life the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna's marriage is deteriorating his step daughter is falling apart and as wife Justine says he lives his life more among the remnants of dead people.  A man of two other failed marriages Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal where every time the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score whether it be large or small.  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew and his relationship with Eady his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths and thus their stories draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet at different points in the movie the result isfor lack of a better wordepic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others following Chris and his wife for example but to say that they are the driving force of the movie to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical copsandrobbers story is the best explanation.In addition the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master his character McCauley can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and coldhearted killer on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And despite his life of crime McCauley's human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always he delivers an intense performance here as Hanna a workaholic obsessed with catching his man while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop but he cares about every man under his command about his stepdaughter and yes even about McCauley.  Through Hanna Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis with a raging temper undying devotion and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis who despite a smaller roll makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore as the implacable Michael Cheritto and Jon Voight as a gruff Nate are both likeable because of their human sides and despicable because of their professions.  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora as Justine and Natalie Portman as Justine's daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino so Amy Brenneman Eady is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.And Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own unmistakable impression and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud the blood is abundant but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And despite the enormous cast Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.".

Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis with a raging temper undying devotion and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis who despite a smaller roll makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore as the implacable Michael Cheritto and Jon Voight as a gruff Nate are both likeable because of their human sides and despicable because of their professions.  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora as Justine and Natalie Portman as Justine's daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino so Amy Brenneman Eady is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.And Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own unmistakable impression and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud the blood is abundant but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And despite the enormous cast Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.Because of these and other well done aspects 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made.";

	schema:headline " Action masterpiece Michael Mann Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's best favorite heist movie of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat 1995 is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything action drama heist great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting story score everything in here is excellent! This movie has a great plot brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley Robert De Niro battling Lt. Vincent Hanna Al Pacino LAPD robberyhomicide detective in this nonstop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film he wrote the screenplay produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series Manhunter and Collateral. This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10 because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task  actors and great stunts. Without the vision this film would be nothing. Without the tools this film would be nothing.Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley De Niro. Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the High Incident Bandits robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout as depicted in the film 44 Minutes The North Hollywood Shootout. Lt. Vincent Hanna Al Pacino LAPD robberyhomicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah Keanu Reeves FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto Tom Sizemore and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley Robert De Niro. He destroyed and hunt down McCauley's crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn't let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did letting go Bodhi Patrick Swayze and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi's men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me. Neil McCauley Robert De Niro as a professional thief was smart intelligent high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn't like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end he made a mistake when he went after Waingro Kevin Gage. The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis Val Kilmer Cheritto Tom Sizemore McCauley Robert De Niro firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout's I love it. The movie has great famous cast Al Pacino Robert De Niro Val Kilmer Jon Voight Tom Sizemore Ashley Judd Mykelti Williamson Ted Levine Dennis Haysbert William Fichtner Natalie Portman Tom Noonan Kevin Gage Danny Trejo Hank Azaria Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie. The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life's like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters. Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.1010 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time this movie kicks ass.".

	schema:headline " A stylish masterwork worthy of the talent involved";
	schema:reviewBody "I am always wary of films boasting of starstudded casts and bigname behindthecamera talent. So I approached Heat with some trepidation...of course I'm a big fan of DeNiro and Pacino even as he has declined into onenote manic performances in the 90's and I feel that Michael Mann is one of the most underrated directors in Tinseltown one need only view Manhunter to view his genius in pacing a crime thriller. Given the incredible supporting cast this production set high standards for itself. I must report that it did not disappoint. Given that the running time is almost three hours and Mann has the task of balancing two significant storylines DeNiro's and Pacino's the film is a stunningly linear examination of life on both sides of the law. The viewer sees sacrifices made and relationships lost in both arenas without the usual emotional push to root for one side against the other. The visceral thrill of watching Pacino and DeNiro emote together was one of the film's marketing points though they have two brief scenes together it is a unique thrill to see these two modern icons of cinema play off one another. While it is clear that either of these two has the star power to carry a film singlehandedly the experience of watching the cop and robber suffer through their diametrically opposed yet parallel lives is fascinating. I'm sure that fans of the films will remember in the years to come the diner scene between the two as fondly as some hold the pairing of Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea in Ride The High Country.Those who criticized the film at the time of its release found particular fault with the climax. They cynically deemed the clasping of hands between the two opponents as a overly sentimental gesture. While it is sentimental the scene is a neat capsulation of their relationship however unexplored throughout the film. They have acted as the hunter and his prey yet they finally realize that they are kindred spirits  dedicated men who put their chosen profession above all else in their lives. They are aware of the opportunities for normalcy they have sacrificed for their obsessions I love DeNiro's line in the diner on what's normal and hold each other in high regard because they share the same pain and isolation. I think Heat has a beautiful ending enhanced by Moby's elegiac God Moving Over The Face Of The WatersI don't put much stock in the Academy Awards in terms of evaluating a film's worth but it was a true disgrace that Braveheart was chosen Best Picture in 1995. Heat was not even nominated! Hopefully the Academy voters will right this error with Mann's equally powerful Insider at this year's ceremonies.Don't be scared off by Heat's running time or by criticism that its too indulgent in its character studies. It is precisely the film's attention to developing its characters that sets it apart from every other bythenumbers Hollywood crime film of this era and makes Heat a classic.".

The other action scenes are intense and memorable too and the cast in here is deep. This isn't just Pacino and De Niro. It's Val Kilmer Ashley Judd Jon Voight Diana Venora Natlie Portman Tom Sizemore Amy Brenamann Wes Studi Ted Levine Mykelti Williamson on and on. Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann one of the best directors in business add a great soundtrack and interesting camerawork and you have a great film. At three hours long it never bores one and at same time doesn't overdo the action either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters but you can't have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole.This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you. Its a crime thriller. Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best shootout in any film  ever. What more do you want???It's a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines  for example the recently paroled excell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a grill working for a nasty exploitative boss and then endsup as a standin getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the goodguys and the badguys that you wouldn't get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed. Just makes it a more satisfying and involving film.Mann who started his career on Miami Vice almost seems to be taking a trip back to the eighties with the soundtrack and styling of the film  almost but not quite. If you still don't want to see the film after this then what the hell's wrong with you?! Sit back and enjoy. Also  no. 247 in the top 250?? Whats up with that???".

	schema:headline " An okay movie. Would have been better 60 minutes shorter with half the characters";
	schema:reviewBody "Having seen almost every classic and influential crime drama of the past 30 years I finally got around to seeing Heat. Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes and a little bit of great action I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.While I wouldn't characterize the acting as bad I can't think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some tough guy porn will find plenty of it here.Ultimately Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time and after that we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer's subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.There is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story  a diversion that will have you scratching your head wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters but here all of the side plot material is really boring.One of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a realistic and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay I get that but if you are going to go with the realistic approach then don't ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn't take itself seriously. But in Heat I couldn't stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene largely because it's just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However it's sort of out of place in this film.I'll give Heat some credit for not being a bythenumbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface Reservoir Dogs The Usual Suspects to name but a few. While I didn't hate this movie I certainly don't think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas.".

However revisiting Heat 17 years later was a disappointment. The story looks far fetched and riddled with clichs and improbabilities.The main problem is with the selling point which is of course the Al Pacino De Niro relationship. Here's the problem no cop who does this job out of conviction could possibly respectadmire a criminal especially one who has killed other police officers. So the ending is absurd and downright ludicrous. The famous coffeeshop scene that Pacino and De Niro share is ridiculous and pointless entirely made for us the viewers. At the public request we present you Pacino and De Niro face to face! The clash of the titans! Not only there is no way in hell that a committed policeman would casually sit and chat with a criminal over coffee but what they have to say is so silly  sharing thoughts about their messedup private lives? Pacino trying to talk De Niro out of the bank robbery business? Seriously? Such a lame excuse to deliver the much anticipated De Niro Pacino moment... The writing is terrible in this scene as De Niro is also restating something he'd said earlier therefore diminishing the impact of that line. Another example of bad writing and poor characterization is a scene where Jon Voight warns De Niro about Pacino's tenacity.The constant shift to everybody's private lives was annoying and turned the whole thing into a crimeopera cheesefest. How many times have we seen the frustrated cop's wife act? And who cares about the bank robber's problems with his beloved wife whom he occasionally cheats on? Oh yeah bank robbers are capable of love too. Touching! Talking about unlikelihood De Niro's romance was laughable and so was the transformation of an innocent librarian into an accessory to murder. The way Amy Brenneman switches from horror at what De Niro did to the Oh well he's cute anyway is hysterical. Moral relativism is an interesting topic for sure but not here. There are moments that we're supposed to find moving like the miscast Ashley Judd shedding a tear on the balcony or the cop hero Pacino holding hands with a criminal... What a joke.The movie does contain some entertaining moments although highly improbable like the robbery scene. There's no way the Police would get into a shootout like that with so many civilians around. The suicide attempt scene is unnecessary and forced and there are other flaws and extremely farfetchedillogical scenes throughout like DeNiro  the gang gracefully passing through police checkpoints without even wearing a disguise just hours after the bloody robbery.Heat is fairly entertaining only if you can ignore its inconsistencies and plot holes. The more I watch the more I find it insulting to one's intelligence. I know it's just a movie but come on... it's a 3hour movie and such an amount of implausible developments make suspension of disbelief pretty hard. I swear if Pacino had shed a tear in the end I would have rated Heat with 10 stars and put it on my all time favorite so bad they're good list.".

The authenticity of the world of cops and robbers he portrays? The acting of Pacino and De Niro? I have watched the movie at least twenty times. So have many others on the forum. Why the fascination?You can look at a masterwork by Rembrandt or Michelangelo endlessly and enjoy the beauty the figures the colors the light And many of us do. But once you 'get' what the work of art is all about once you connect it to the great themes in life one's own life it becomes deeply touching. Often what it's all about is deeply buried in layers upon layers of craftsmanship and sheer beauty. One becomes fascinated one feels strong emotions but one has to dig deep to explain why. The greater the mastery of the artist the deeper one has to dig. The richer the treasures deep beneath the surface. So Michael Mann's mastery for all its perfection is only underpinning something of a higher order.In fact Heat has exactly the same essence as Ali The Insider Last of the Mohicans Collateral and Thief. These movies although superficially very different are really quite similar in their core. They are all about making lifechanging choices between different loyalties. Ultimate dilemmas. Heat is the most complex of all these movies in this respect and therefore in my opinion the greatest.What makes Mann's characters so fascinating? They rise to the occasion when facing 'heat' extremely adverse and often violent circumstances. They all face dilemmas lifechanging choices. They need to do the right thing no matter how slim the chance of success knowing they have to give up something else which is a good thing too. Vincent Hanna is not simply a workaholic. He gives up life as most of us know it marriage caring for his stepdaughter 'barbeques and ballgames' because he knows he is such a gifted policeman that he can put away criminals behind bars who will otherwise keep on killing the innocent people that haunt him in his dreams. But he can only defeat his adversaries if he is dedicated at the moments of truth. And he suffers for his dedication in all other realms of life. Neil McCauley forgoes normal life as well to be a perfect criminal and never be returned to jail but starts feeling the cost of that only after falling in love against his principles. He knows he can only stay out of jail when not attached to anyone or anything. Therefore his home isn't even furnished. To him that is the right thing to do. See the values of Mann's characters are not necessarily 'right' or absolute values. Criminals have values too and their dilemmas can be just as difficult. After falling in love he feels a dilemma. And becomes much more human albeit on the other side of the law.Why are some of the truly evil characters in Mann's movies so utterly evil? Because they are dedicated but don't see the dilemma. They have chosen for their own ego and pursue at any cost whatever drive they have usually power and money Van Zant Insider's Thomas Sandefur Thief's Leo but alternatively perverse violence Waingro or revenge Mohicans' Magua. They directly or indirectly provide the 'heat' that make the more sympathetic characters have to choose whatever they think is 'the right thing'.Heat is stuffed with lifechanging choices. Once you pay attention it seems as if almost every other line in the movie has a question mark attached to it. 'Check charge or cash?' are the first words in the movie. Not exactly life changing OK but a hint of all the choices to come . 'You taking me to breakfast?' follows shortly afterward. Less trivial. Then every character is faced with choices between loyalties. All the most memorable moments in the film are about choices. Often very complex dilemmas. Charlene Shiherlis first chooses to betray her husband Chris to secure her son's future but then when given the chance saves Chris's ass at the cost of probably never seeing him again. Neil drives through the tunnel with Eady on his way to freedom and ponders the idea to return and kill Waingro. De Niro's face shows the dilemma between loyalty one getting away with his love and loyalty two revenge for Waingro's actions which have devastated his crew with Chris wounded and on the run Michael killed by Hanna in the shootout Trejo tortured and mortally wounded being subsequently put out of his misery by Neil himself and Trejo's wife Anna violated and murdered. Neil simply cannot walk away from that. He calculates he can avenge his crew and get away afterward. But we later learn the presence of Eady at the hotel where Waingro is finished off puts Hanna on Neil's tail for the final confrontation.In short Mann's movies teach us doing the right thing isn't straightforward. The choices in life aren't obvious.To do the right thing you will have to give up what is good too and feel great loss. Doing the right thing doesn't result in a happy ending. You will feel vindicated at best. You may even die in the process.'I told you I was never going back'.".

So if you haven't seen it yet all I would say is this. If we assume you have some degree of film intellect then do not expect to see what you read in some of these reviews. If you go in not expecting much you may very well enjoy this very ordinary movie. if you go in expected the Best movie of the 90s or a masterpiece you may be sorely disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "The flaw of all gangster movies at least those acknowledged as classics Godfather trilogy Scarface Goodfellas Casino White Heat Once Upon A Time In America etc is how obvious and predictable their narrative progressions are. We get the rise the joyous ecstasy of crime and the obvious monetary rewards and the fall that period where the world violently collapses around the criminal. With the scripts all so loosely similar it just becomes a game of dress up. Of who has the best period details acting and set design.Released the same year as Scorsese's Casino Michael Mann's Heat positions itself as one of the first neo liberal gangster movies all the others still caught in the old framework of mafia patriarchy family values loyalty honour total adherence to a distinctive creed blood lines and tribalism. Heat in comparison completely breaks away from these oldfashioned ways. In Mann's film everyone is an individual in the most extreme sense. The gang is no longer a gang but a crew of independent professionals who just come together for a specific job and then split. In this world families and friends are nonexistent or total charades.While Don Corleone hid like a king behind his armed guards and giant fences Mann's gangsters are trapped in a state of perpetual mobility. Like a group of shareholders they are held together only by the prospect of future revenue. Their arrangement is temporary pragmatic and lateral. They know that they are interchangeable parts in a larger machine that there are no guarantees and that nothing lasts. Compared to this the gangsters of Goodfellas and The Godfather seem like stagnated sentimentalists nostalgically trapped in dying communities. While The Corleone's fight over territory and family honour Mann's guys are only interested in Capital. As DeNiro yells during a bank heist We're here for the bank's money not your money!Tellingly the DeNiro character's creed is one of zero loyalty. He has a 30second rule of walking away from anyone however close he may be emotionally or romantically. The message of the film is thus double edged. It isn't just that the film's final resolution is that justice prevails and the bad guys are put away rather it is that those who fall who get caught are those who failed to live up to the modern creed which is actually repeated twice in the film Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner. In other words late capitalism and attachment do not mix.So in this sense a film like Heat though otherwise entirely predictable essentially a bunch of little boys engaging in idiot machismo oneupmanship posturing Pacino's obsessivecompulsive manic cop vs DeNiro's cool sociopathic dedication etc nevertheless was one of the first films to manifest a fundamental social change. A series like The Wire then takes all of this much further with its attempt to consciously map out the vast and unrepresentable complexity of contemporary neoliberal capitalism. In fact a series like The Wire with its sheer scope complexity and writing credentials renders ALL gangster and crime movies irrelevant to any serious viewer.And so today's gangsters are all entrepreneurs all so called selfmade individuals the selfemployed Petite bourgeoisie radically without any social links even down to the kid selling crack to his buddies. This is all a million light years from the long obsolete world of The Godfather Casino or Goodfellas. While those elegiac films are about moments that had long passed Mann's is distinctively modern. This is a film about the 90s. This is a Los Angeles of polished chrome designer kitchens featureless freeways fluorescent bulbs and late night diners. All the colours sounds aromas and cultural quirks of Coppola and Scorsese have been torn out painted over refitted and remodelled. Mann's LA is a world without landmarks. A vast urban sprawl all traces of Old Europe replaced by business franchises multiplexes and multinational coffee shops. While Coppola's film centred around a family called the Corleone's their name itself a reference to the village in which they originated Mann's criminals have bland names like Neil. They are without history culture or family ties. In a brilliant touch Mann even has De Niro reading a book on metals when he first meets his love interest. The guy is a piece of cold polished steel in a world that is likewise.Rather than a risefall structure we also get something a bit different. These criminals get no joy from their profession. Trapped in a world of paranoia Mann's aesthetic is one of flat glass panes and expansive windows his criminals always fearing exposure. For Mann crime becomes a means of escape from the world in its entirety. Crime is total disconnection from both family society and man his criminals all looking to amass enough wealth to escape to some idyllic island on the horizon.But it's Mann's style itself that seduces us. This style which I call Armani decorum owes much to Mann's fondness for such painters and architects as David Hockney Alex Colville Edward Hopper and Ed Ruscha Alex Colville's Pacific is visually quoted in one shot. Mann's thus trades the old noir look for 1950's modernism block colours expansive glass panes geometric divisions and contemporary linear houses. His frame is divided into flat surfaces characters are dressed in pastels scenes are assigned panels of light and buildings are relentlessly modernist with fluorescent bulbs and geometrical flat surfaces. Couple this with his unique choice in music minimalist industrial and techno and you have a very sexy aesthetic.8.910  Dismissed upon release Heat achieved classic status a few years later due to young film buffs. As the star status of De Niro and Pacino fades and films like Dark Knight rip off its style the film seems to be on another downward spiral.Worth several viewings.".

This is the best crime movie ever made. And since my first viewing over 5 years ago I have seen it a countless number of times. After all of these viewings I can only say that this is my favorite film to watch and therefore the best film I have ever seen. I will not divulge into plot because the expanse and depth of the films story I could not do justice with a shorthand overview of its plot. This film is not about its plot it is about its characters and what they feel. Michael Mann is my favorite filmmaker his list of credits admittedly doesn't strike many people as the resume of the greatest living director but when you watch those films you can see the gift this man possesses at telling a story and making us feel for his characters. There are three scenes in this movie that had me so drawn in I still think about them often. One is the films first scene Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing electronic score captivates us in the first shots of the train carrying Neal McCauley Robert DeNiroand leave me and the audience wanting more. The third comes toward the end as McCauley and his boss Nate a wonderful Jon Voigt exchange their last words as Neal is planning on leaving the country the words the choose and attitudes they strike almost had me in tears. These are two hard men and this is far as they will go with their heartfelt goodbyes. The films last scene I will not give a description to as not to ruin the plot for you. I contains the best almost wordless exchange I've ever seen in a film. The music swells and Mann allows us to linger on the last shot. It brought me to tears and still does. This is the best film I've ever seen. I doubt you will see it that way but trust me you will love it.".

I just finished watching this movie for maybe the 20th time in my life of 26 years. There is simply one word this movie can be described with and that is Masterpiece. Why do I say masterpiece? Because of this 1. Acting  Stellar cast most of them at the height of their careers. 2. Plot  Great story plot holes are just for the nitpickers or the haters 3. Cinematography  Probably some of the best heist scenes and a city at night ever shot on film. 4. Characters  Not all of them but the main characters are well developed and you understand their motivation their actions their thoughts. This movie will not let you down. Perfect to watch in any situation.".

	schema:reviewBody "The thing to strike me about HEAT is that its overlong . I dont know if Ive been watching too much MTV but a major problem Ive had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that theyre too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film wed have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson  by banging his head off the table . Seeing as theyre shown throghout the story to be well organised  professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? Its a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . Theres another problem with too many domestic scenes  the film tries to show the audience the marital maritalromantic life of every major character  cop and robber . I know Michael Manns later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but thats necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is not HEAT isnt by any means a bad film  on the contaray its a good one . DeNiro and Pacino in the same movie  boy what a casting coup . Not only that we get to see Val Kilmer when he was famous plus up and coming names like Portman  Sizemore and Fichtner  and once the story gets going it is very compelling with a breath taking shootout . Unfortunately because someone  Im guessing Michael Mann deserves all the blame for this  thought theyd stretch out a two hour movie into a three hour one HEAT remains good instead of great".

	schema:reviewBody "A few days ago I finally got around to watching the much regarded 1995 'cops and robbers' movie Heat. I'm not a particular fan of this genre unless it is really well done but Heat has been on my list of 'Movies to watch' for quite a while. It received high praise from most critics and seemed to have some excellent credentialsLet's face it a movie starring Al Pacino Robert De Niro two of my alltime favourite actors along with John Voight Val Kilmer Tom Sizemore Ashley Judd Natalie Portman and many many more could hardly fail. And it didn't  even more so as it was in the hands of one of the masters of the genre Michael Mann who wrote and directed it.The film is a whopping 2 hours 46 minutes but the time just flew by leaving me begging for more. Heat is undoubtedly one the definitive films of any era and although it was made twenty years ago it hasn't dated at all and is still eminently watchable. Okay the cell phones may have been a little on the large side but that aside this movie could have been made last year.Al Pacino as the hardbitten cop on a mission and whose personal life is falling apart and Robert De Niro  the tough nononsense criminal genius  both play their parts to perfection. These two towering figures of the silver screen are only seen together in two scenes.The first meeting is about half way through the movie when they enjoy a cup of coffee together. This is a classic confrontation between 'good and evil' with both of them acknowledging the unstoppable forces that drive them to do what they do. They even have a grudging respect for each other  given the different paths they have chosen in life.The second time they meet is at the end of the movie when we watch the denouement of these two mesmerizing characters played out to the bitter end.Pacino and De Niro are totally 'on song' in this film and Mann has written their parts in a way that allows them to excel in what they do best. The supporting cast with the likes of Kilmer and Voight both villains are a joy to behold and the movie is acted by an ensemble of actors that was taken from the best that Hollywood had to offer in the mid  90's.Of course with Mann directing there is plenty of violence and a seemingly neverending shootout scene ranks right up there with some of the greatest shootouts of all time. To say any more about Heat would spoil the movie for those who haven't yet seen it.Even if you have it is well worth another looksie after all these years. Go get the DVD or download it. You will NOT be disappointed.".

At the beginning of the current year's term Mr. Chips is retired but still living on campus and still interacting with the boys at the school. Suffering a cold he retires to his living room in front of a fireplace and begins to reminisce about his long 63  year career at the school. Beginning as an idealistic teacher he gains a reputation for stodginess though his peers and students find that to be an almost endearing quality. Years later he goes on holiday with a fellow teacher to Austria and meets the love of his life Katherine Greer Garson who is an intelligent free spirit. After a whirlwind courtship the two marry and Chips as she begins to call him brings her to England with him in time for the next term. With her influence Chips begins to open up more to his students and peers and quickly gains a very popular following among both. Throughout the years Chips takes care of his students and sees several generations of boys from the same families come under his care personified by the Colley boys all played by Terry Kilburn. Once WWI begins most of the older students and schoolmasters enlist so Chips is asked to come out of retirement to do the job that he has wanted to do his entire career at Brookfield  become Headmaster leading the next generation of students while being forced to deal with the losses of his former students from the war.Goodbye Mr. Chips is obviously the inspiration for films like Mr. Holland's Opus in that it is a sentimental story of a young and insecure teacher who carries through with his career not really knowing the influence he has had on his students. Goodbye Mr. Chips did not have a big emotional crescendo at the end that similar films from the last two or three decades generally did and do but rather it had a quieter more dignified emotional catch. Robert Donat is spectacular in this Oscarwinning role. It is amazing that he was able to play a man that was between 1050 years older than he really was so convincingly. Greer Garson is wonderful as always in her role as Mrs. Chips. The film itself was charming and sentimental without being overly sappy I certainly had tears streaming down my cheeks at the end but didn't feel foolish about it. I would recommend this one to anyone but I think that it will certainly get a much better response from classic film lovers due to its purity and its unabashed sentimentality. 710 Shelly".

I watch it whenever I am depressed about the depths to which humans are capable of going which is all too often depicted in modern movies. This movie portrays the opposite.Chipping starts out as a teacher who because of an introverted personality has trouble communicating with the students in his charge and with his superiors.  Before going on the trip on which he meets his beloved he is passed over for a promotion as head of a residence hall despite the fact that he has seniority.  He is also made fun of by his students and finds he must revert to a strict form of discipline to keep them in line  he is not a popular teacher as a result.  He is at a low ebb starting to think that he is a failure in life.Then on a vacation to continental Europe he meets the character played by Greer Garson.  They have a whirlwind romance which in itself is so enjoyable to watch.  He is so clumsy in his advances.  And she is amused by him.  The actors do a great job of showing the chemistry between the characters.They eventually get married which gives Chips the confidence he had lacked.  His wife makes some suggestions which helps him find the balance of discipline and fun with the students and he soon comes to love his students as he would his own children and in the process becomes one of the most popular teachers in the school.One of my favorite aspects of this movie is its idyllic view of marriage. It really shows what marriage could be two people coming together to become stronger as a unit than they would have been separatelyanother movie of this vintage which portrays the same is Stars and Stripes Forever the biopic of John Phillip Sousa.Robert Donat's performance as the other reviewers have noted is of the highest caliberever.  And Greer Garson's role was all too short.  Also of note are Chipping's friend who invites him to Europe and urges him ahead in his romance and of course the various children who come into his life.Macho men must be careful with this one.  If it doesn't make you cry nothing will.  It may be best to take your girlfriend with you so that she can see your sensitive side.".

Robert Donat's performance gives you not just one character to remember but several as he convincingly portrays Chipping's different personas at different stages of his life.Greer Garson is also excellent in her role and Paul Henreid gets some good scenes as well. These relationships and others throughout the movie make for a believable and memorable portrayal of the title character and also of the world in which he lived. The story is wellwritten and it includes a very good variety of material showing the characters dealing with everything from eager anticipation to grave concern from blissful joy to great sorrow and much in between.The panorama from generation to generation also works well showing both change and stability as time passes. While only a handful of scenes contain weighty material all of it is thoughtful and much of it memorable. It keeps everything balanced and believable and it's been a good while since any movie of its kind has worked so well.".

Always a great actor Donat was perhaps at his best in this story covering the history of a schoolmaster from his first appearance at the school as a young idealist through crusty middle age and a change when he meets charming Greer Garson in her first screen appearance stranded up an Austrian mountain and into his much loved dotage as a kind of human fixture and fittings of Brookfield School.James Hilton's book is developed here to give not only a view of the English public school system which probably never existed but to cover issues such as the Great War with some power.  The film is extremely touching in places  whether this is because of the acting or the excellent music I'm not quite sure.  I do know that this version of the film is streets ahead of the misguided musical version which appeared three decades later with Peter O'Toole in the lead.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film demonstrates that if a cinematic work obeys the rules of good simple lucid storytelling it can hold up for a very long time indeed.Here is my synopsis of this wonderful filmcertainly an instance where a great book by James Hilton who also did A High Wind in Jamaica and Lost Horizon two novels which also benefited by excellent screenplays translates well to the big screen. The character of Chipping is well worth explorationone of cinema's most memorable figures. In this synopsis I want to mainly touch on the personality of Chippingand why his story makes such an impression on the viewer. Its a case of a character being welldrawn enough to strike a spark of recognition in uswe all know someone like Chipping.First of all Chipping is a person who doesnt think too much of himself. Outwardly he is completely unremarkable. As a young man he has no prospects. He is wayward and drifting and all on his own. He has no family to speak of. He seems to come from nowhere and also seems to be going nowhere. He is not a mover or a shaker. He is a meek little mouse of a man that registers on no one. He is quiet and shy. He is on the reserved traditional side conservative in speech dress deportment and character. He is also bookish and myopicneither charismatic in looks nor athletic in limb at odds in an age filled with charismatic athletic specimens.Chips hardly is a type to stand out in a crowd and he knows it. This makes him not a joiner. He has few associations and his friendships are not very deep. Chips keeps himself to himself. He loves frequently for example but the objects of his affection are never aware of it. He is one of those loner types who feel the urge to try to fit in but find that they are not really suited to fit in anywhere. He is one of those people who have worlds inside of them that no one ever sees.Whatever noble qualities he has are all hidden and on the inside of the man rather than on the outside.  Chips is the epitome of the socially awkward introspective backward individual. When the story begins we may surmise that even though a young man in his early twenties he has proably never yet been with a woman. Where would he have had the chance?In any case Chips is taken on as an instructor at an English boarding school in the middle 19th century. The heyday of the English boarding school.  This the start of his position in life is certainly one important aspect of his life and of this story.But the real hook of the narrative the most important personal event in his existence begins as an incident that happens shortly after he is settled into his teaching career. One holiday he accepts an invitation to go cycling in the Alps with a colleague. On a solitary hike into the mountains he encounters a fellow English tourista womanon her own.She is an extraordinary womanan outgoing experienced cosmopolitan charismatic beautiful graceful clever engaging a truly marvellous woman. But she is a woman that is usually already taken.  A woman that at her age  is usually found on the arm of a captain of industry or an actor or a politician. A woman of substance and import. A woman that can get any man she would want.Why is she single? Coincidentally just as Chips is an oddity in his gender she is an oddity to hers. She isnt emptyheaded for one thing although she is very beautiful.  She has standards. Although she has been courted incessantly by men from a very early age she is holding out until she meets a man that has inside him the values and ideals that she prizes. And she happens to be wise enough and sharpeyed enough and insightful enough to spy the admirable interior qualities of Chips. She sees that he is loyal and devoted and true of heart.So from this chance meeting a romance develops. Chips of course is truly astonished. But it becomes a fact. The two actually do marry. The woman does not want a politician an actor or a captain of industryshe wants him. She is the only other living being who comes close enough to see him at allreally see him. This is the very happiest time Chips ever has in his whole existence. He comes alive. He is out of his shell. From that point on he does a lot of things that he would never have dreamed of doing previously. Its because he is no longer alone.The two have maybe two or three years of life togetheruntil one day the woman takes ill from some reason or other and unaccountably dies at a young age. Chips  has to spend the rest of his life in love with something that is no longer real. His memories are real to him but he never again lives in the way that he did when he enjoyed her company.He will remain at the school for a good many yearsin fact he will live his life there and die there. The remainder of the story and the movie is about how this meek soul actually manages to eke out a very passable life for himself to obtain some measure of happiness despite his humble beginnings and the sadness of his early tragedy.Chips actually manages to have a life that despite all obstacles exerts a positive effect on a great many other people.  We see him able to live to a very great age despite many years of loneliness despite many hardships and trials. Over time his inner qualities prove him to be seen by many people as a worthwhile person. Completely by accident.In fact he winds up to be the mostloved member of the school's faculty. The satisfaction arising from this fact may be the only solace that Chips attains but to him its enough. He never forgets the woman. But the story seems to say he seems to be able to find . . . compensation.Goodbye Mr. Chips is a movie that deals surely and confidently with the most integral and basic humanscale events yearnings and disappointments dreams the play of randomness in life the strength of memory and the effect of time on the soul. To the hip or the unimaginative modern viewer this work will surely seem dated mawkish and flat its just not got the zing pizazz or hype that pervades more contemorary flicks. Instead this film is here for the long haul. The way I feel about it is if films cant encompass the abovementioned topics without earning a sour smirk these days from a trendy hipster then what should our films be about?I know I know. You dont have to tell me. Car chases breasts and explosions. See you later.".

	schema:reviewBody "The children attending the Brookfield school are no ordinary English  boys they are the the children of the upper classes of society who  for generations have learned from institutions such as the school  represented here. They are molded at places like this fictional one to  be leaders of their country.  Mr. Chipping is a teacher who gives his life to Brookfield only to be  bypassed when promotions are handed out. His love for the profession  and his dedication to the formation of these children are his reasons  for living. Most of his own life is spent at the school. Only in times  of crisis is Mr. Chipps recognized.  Mr. Chipps knows happiness only too briefly. He is extremely lucky when  he finds Katherine. One can see the rapport in her although we never  see it explicitly on Chipping's face maybe because a stiff upper lip  that doesn't let him express his true feelings to a woman who adored  him from their first encounter.

They are molded at places like this fictional one to  be leaders of their country.  Mr. Chipping is a teacher who gives his life to Brookfield only to be  bypassed when promotions are handed out. His love for the profession  and his dedication to the formation of these children are his reasons  for living. Most of his own life is spent at the school. Only in times  of crisis is Mr. Chipps recognized.  Mr. Chipps knows happiness only too briefly. He is extremely lucky when  he finds Katherine. One can see the rapport in her although we never  see it explicitly on Chipping's face maybe because a stiff upper lip  that doesn't let him express his true feelings to a woman who adored  him from their first encounter.

Chippings early career difficulties are overcome as is his shyness after he meets Greer Garson Mrs. Miniver' in the Alps while on holiday. Garson is able to show the stodgy Chips how to live life and her effect on him lasts throughout the rest of his life although Garson is not around for long.The film uses recurring patterns to show the passage of time namely the showing of the boys arriving at the school each year in the autumn. These segments often contained little historical snippets between the boys such as we now have telephones do you know how to use one?' and mention of Queen Victoria's death and the remark that it is going to be strange to have a King.' Other historical comments occurred between the teachers such as the remark on a book by a new author H.G. Wells and how he will never last because his writing is too fantastic. Sadly Chip's historical error occurs when he comments to the boys that they will not have to go off to World War I as the war cannot possibly last more than a few weeks. So many of the teachers and students end up losing their lives in the Great War. Some other scenes from this film have been parodied through the years in comedies most noticeably the scenes in the great hall when the headmasters are speaking to the boys is sent up hilariously by John Cleese in Monty Python's the Meaning of Life' and the scene where Chips canes an insolent student it is filmed as a shadow against the wall is later parodied when a punisher is reprimanded for whipping the shadow not the victim my memory is failing me here but I think this is in 1969s Take the Money and Run' by Woody Allen I could be wrong as a part of me also thinks that this could be in Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles.'Donat aptly handles the complex role of Chips through the years from about his mid20s until his 80s. This may be one of the earlier movies that so aptly chronicles the life and times of a person through such an expanse of years Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man' also performs n this manner as does Al Pacino in The Godfather Trilogy' albeit over the length of three long movies. Even more outstanding and interesting about Donat and his character is that he covers so much of a common man's existence Chips is a teacher not a King general messiah or Mafia chieftain.".

It's nice to know that there are people like Chipping actually teaching our future generations out there.Chips is the sort of role that fit Robert Donat and only Robert Donat. I cannot imagine any other actor playing the cerebral and shy schoolteacher. The film follows him for about sixty of the 83 years of his life. He arrives at Brookfield School around 1870 a young idealistic graduate certain of the vocation he has chosen. He doesn't mix well and his pedantic ways don't make him a school favorite. Donat certainly changes when on holiday in Europe with Paul Henreid the German teacher at Brookfield School he meets and eventually weds Greer Garson.Goodbye Mr. Chips was Greer Garson's first introduction to American audiences. When she emerges from that mist on the Alp both Donat and she are climbing she was a star from then on. Her screen image was set as the wise tactful and patient wife who was normally partnered with Walter Pidgeon. But she and Donat have good chemistry also.Paul Henreid also got his first exposure to American audiences as well. Interesting that in 1939 a German would be played so sympathetically. My feelings are that they wanted to show that the Allies had nothing against the German people only the terrible ideology that at that time held them in sway. Long after Henreid has had his last scene it is reported that he is killed in World War I fighting for his country and against the country that gave him a living for many years. Good people can fight for the enemy also.Chips is the kind of character that we admire because he's at a job he loves and does give the world that infinitesimal extra ounce of good in doing that job. He's not acclaimed certainly his demise wouldn't rate banner headlines but so few of us are lucky to be in jobs and professions we truly love and not do for just a paycheck.In that great year of Gone With the Wind sweeping the Oscars that year Robert Donat managed to beat out Clark Gable for the Best Actor Award. He had some other good competition that year with James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Mickey Rooney in Babes in Arms and Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights. The capstone of a great career.We should all hold and treasure teachers like Mr. Chipping of Brookfield School and the films made of their lives.".

The teacher is played brilliantly by the English actor Robert Donat whose mannerisms and excellent attention to detail enable his character to transform over the course of the film from a young man in his early twenties to an elderly don in his eighties far more than any simple application of makeup.Although a little too sentimental and simplistic in the view of some this wonderful and moving film should be compulsory viewing for prospective teachers everywhere.The DVD version is compiled from the best print available. One must remember that this is an old film 1939 and the original film stock has not travelled all that well over the years.

Goodbye Mr. Chips is a good film because it works in both categories.

It is an intense dive into the underbelly of school corruption chronicling the rise fall and redemption of the title character and his students. Mr. Chips is a good man that constantly walks the line of rigid disciplinarian rolemodel and selfdestructive masochist. His students on the other hand are the pseudo innocents that suddenly get thrown into a whirlpool of gendered warfare while fighting the standards their school has set for them. Yes the heroine sequences are rather grotesque and the sexphotography sequence may at first seem unnecessary but the elements of redemption rely on this harsh imagery to come across as potent. Indeed Goodbye Mr. Chips is not for the faint of heart but for those who can look beyond the brutality and see the beauty it is a very powerful journey.".

He WAS Chips and it was silly to try and remake a proven classic though Peter O'Toole was not a bad choice in casting.Donat captured the essence of Chips' shy personna and his love for his boys in one of the most sensitive performances I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  In a year that arguably produced some of the greatest movies in film in history Goodbye Mr Chips ranks in the top 5 of all time.I give it a 10!".

I suspect that this is because most users of IMDB are aged 30  40 ish. Goodbye Mr Chips is exactly on first sight the type of movie that many of you would not even consider viewing. It has no special effects cost peanuts to make no clever camera work but it does have those three essentials  superb story great script and staggeringly good acting from Donat. The movie is about life relationships about despair and decency and the power of love. What more could anybody ask for in a movie? If this film doesn't move and inspire you then truly nothing will.P.S. the Peter O'Toole version is pretty dire!!".

	schema:headline " Faithful adaptation of a perfect book";
	schema:reviewBody "Having read the book a dozen or so times I saw the film for the first time tonight. There's an inherent difficulty in translating a book like GMC to the screen its episodic the episodes sometimes more than a decade apart and relies for much of its effect on a narrative voice that I'm not sure could be captured successfully outside of print. The occasional streamofconsciousness internal monologues given to Chips in the book there's a terribly moving one at the end could be and its probably a fault of the film that they weren't.I disliked the Martin Clunes adaptation. Primarily because it lumbered Chips with all sorts of attitudes antifagging anticorporal punishment that are completely alien to the book and which it is inconceivable a conservative public school master of the Victorian  Edwardian era holding. Since this film was made in 1939 any attempts to modernise the character and his opinions are fortunately absent.It was terribly pleasing that the episode where Chips reads out the name of the German master who has been killed fighting on the Western Front as part of the roll of honour in Chapel has been included. One could have imagined it being cut because of rising antiGerman feeling but perhaps its inclusion represents a final victory for Chips' ideas of honour and decency.The scenes in the Chapel the daily litany of names are incredibly poignant though they were even more so in the book. I'm not sure if it would be as affecting to someone who was not English and who hadn't been to a public school but to those who are and who have the Great War still casts a spectre or at least it does to me. Every school chapel has its own memorial with hundreds sometimes thousands of names engraved on it every Armistice Day the Last Post is played my own school was still littered with photos of sports teams of whom half had died in the trenches or at sea. The Second World War doesn't seem to cast such a pall because it co clearly had a point. The Great War seems like nothing so much as a failure of diplomacy.Someone above wrote that they couldn't see the point of the film. Man teaches for a long time then dies or words to that effect. Well ignoring the adolescent idea that value and beauty can't exist within a story of the mundane providing that story is well told the film does actually have a point. Amongst others the value and importance of honour the satisfaction and necessity of dedicating one's life to a good greater than oneself and one's own material success the affection that one can inspire and the significance that one can have by simply teaching and then dying.The film itself is simply but well shot. Donat's performance is excellent while none of the others are any less than good. Those changes that have been made to the book do not corrupt its essential spirit and are trifling in importance. The only thing I didn't like the young Collie who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag and whose chubby unattractive face fills the screen at the end.If you enjoyed the film then please read the book. It's small but almost literally perfect in form and conception. I'm actually moved to text the person to whom I've lent it and ask for it back.".

Stepping out of line meant a good caning falling in love did not have immediate sexual overtones getting your baggage was virtually hasslefree fear of terrorists was not foremost in the minds of international travelers and most delightfully young boys were completely trusted in the company of men. Thoroughly enjoyable also is the view of history through the eyes of 1930's English historians. Racism and sexism are appropriate to the setting but xenophobia while evident in nearly every scene is amusingly excoriated toward the end of the film.It is in many ways an antiwar movie. It shows well the contradiction of wanting for go to war in The Great War merely for honor only to come home to honored posthumously. Discipline and Boy Scout virtues are shown to be the backbone of society and it is implied that English society is the one that really matters. Still forgiveness and a gentler touch are what eventually win the day.The film quality was not tremendousthe black and white graininess does compete well with contemporaries like GWTW and The Wizard of Oz and many corny visual devices already trite by 1939 are used. However these actually add to the charm of this movie. They reinforce the earnestness of the characters and the plot of GMC. May I call it that?.This seems like the granddaddy of all prep school movies and is probably the inspiration for Harry Potter Dead Poet's Society Chariots of Fire and many others of this type more of an ilk than a genre. This movie came out 11 years before I was born but it made me wish I had attended Brookfield.Robert Donat shows restraint while showing great range no mean feat. Greer Garson is delightful and the supporting cast is dutiful and appropriate. Paul Henried plays a caricature of himself to a degree that would be mocked in other settings but feels just right here.No serious film buff's viewing portfolio is complete without this one.".

	schema:headline " Why laugh? Why not?";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why but I seriously can't help but laugh at the Harold and Kumar movies. They're so over the top and silly that you can't help but laugh. The first adventure we went on with them they just had the munchies and needed some White Castle. The second adventure was to get the loves of their lives back and end up going to Guantanamo Bay. Now we get to celebrate the joyful holiday of Christmas with them. I admit that when I saw the trailer for this one it didn't make me laugh too much. I wasn't sure if this was going to have the same kick as the previous films had but A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas not only delivered in the laughs but was actually a very good movie that in it's own crude way was a touching story about how friends can grow apart but reunite by the weirdest situations.Harold is now a successful businessman who works at a popular company while Kumar is still living the life of a stoner handling a bad break up with Vanessa. At Maria's Christmas party Harold meets Maria's father. He explains to Harold that he never had a perfect Christmas and he is counting on Harold to make this one the best for his daughter Harold's wife Maria. Maria's father also brings to Harold's house the perfect Christmas tree. When a package addressed to Harold arrives at Kumar's apartment he decides to deliver it to Harold. The package turns out to be a large marijuana joint that Kumar cannot resist smoking. Since Harold has gotten married and does not get high anymore he knocks the lit joint out of Kumar's hands and it lands in the tree and causing a fire. So now Harold and Kumar are on a new adventure to get the tree back before the family returns.I know that the situations were out of control. We have some dark jokes with a child taking every extreme drug known to man we have Neil Patrick Harris on the verge of raping a woman. I know I should have been disturbed technically but why not just have a good time and remind yourself that this is just a movie? I thought Neil Patrick Harris was just too funny as usual when the boys ask him where he's been and that he got shot and branded a hooker he replies with can you be more specific? I almost died laughing. I loved the creepy waffle making robot that Kumar had how it actually loved Kumar and saved his life. But the moment that really got to me was seeing the kid who was on every crazy drug running around on the ceiling it was so out there that I just had to laugh.Like I said there are some very extreme jokes that a lot of people will take offense too easily. There is a moment where Neil Patrick Harris is talking about Heaven and I know that if you have strong religious beliefs you're not going to like that scene. Though I don' know why then you are seeing a Harold and Kumar movie since they're not listed in the tactful department. But what I really liked about this story is that it showed their softer side Harold is growing up and Kumar wants to stay the same as a stoner who is just cruising through life we all have friends like that and it's hard to keep in touch when you're on different paths. I loved seeing them remember what's important that it's OK to let go a little bit or that it's OK to grow up. I would recommend this for the fans it's a great follow up to our favorite stoners. If you're looking for a good laugh I think you're in for a treat Harold and Kumar do not disappoint.810".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know why but I seriously can't help but laugh at the Harold and Kumar movies. They're so over the top and silly that you can't help but laugh. The first adventure we went on with them they just had the munchies and needed some White Castle. The second adventure was to get the loves of their lives back and end up going to Guantanamo Bay. Now we get to celebrate the joyful holiday of Christmas with them. I admit that when I saw the trailer for this one it didn't make me laugh too much. I wasn't sure if this was going to have the same kick as the previous films had but A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas not only delivered in the laughs but was actually a very good movie that in it's own crude way was a touching story about how friends can grow apart but reunite by the weirdest situations.Harold is now a successful businessman who works at a popular company while Kumar is still living the life of a stoner handling a bad break up with Vanessa. At Maria's Christmas party Harold meets Maria's father. He explains to Harold that he never had a perfect Christmas and he is counting on Harold to make this one the best for his daughter Harold's wife Maria. Maria's father also brings to Harold's house the perfect Christmas tree. When a package addressed to Harold arrives at Kumar's apartment he decides to deliver it to Harold. The package turns out to be a large marijuana joint that Kumar cannot resist smoking. Since Harold has gotten married and does not get high anymore he knocks the lit joint out of Kumar's hands and it lands in the tree and causing a fire. So now Harold and Kumar are on a new adventure to get the tree back before the family returns.I know that the situations were out of control. We have some dark jokes with a child taking every extreme drug known to man we have Neil Patrick Harris on the verge of raping a woman. I know I should have been disturbed technically but why not just have a good time and remind yourself that this is just a movie? I thought Neil Patrick Harris was just too funny as usual when the boys ask him where he's been and that he got shot and branded a hooker he replies with can you be more specific? I almost died laughing. I loved the creepy waffle making robot that Kumar had how it actually loved Kumar and saved his life. But the moment that really got to me was seeing the kid who was on every crazy drug running around on the ceiling it was so out there that I just had to laugh.Like I said there are some very extreme jokes that a lot of people will take offense too easily. There is a moment where Neil Patrick Harris is talking about Heaven and I know that if you have strong religious beliefs you're not going to like that scene. Though I don' know why then you are seeing a Harold and Kumar movie since they're not listed in the tactful department. But what I really liked about this story is that it showed their softer side Harold is growing up and Kumar wants to stay the same as a stoner who is just cruising through life we all have friends like that and it's hard to keep in touch when you're on different paths. I loved seeing them remember what's important that it's OK to let go a little bit or that it's OK to grow up. I would recommend this for the fans it's a great follow up to our favorite stoners. If you're looking for a good laugh I think you're in for a treat Harold and Kumar do not disappoint.810";

	schema:reviewBody "A Very Harold  Kumar 3D Christmas is not going to surprise anyone. It follows the same successful formula and chemistry between John Cho and Kal Penn as the first two. The film also is rude inappropriate and has questionable taste just like the first two. So while the basic concept is the same it has been plugged into a Christmas setting making fun of the holiday and managing to shoot Santa Claus in the face in the process. Damn it's funny! I'm not big on buddy comedies but behind closed doors I secretly love Harold  Kumar. White Castle was funny Guantanamo Bay was even funnier taking on the issue of race and national security and 3D Christmas is poking fun at religion and holidays. Because many may be afraid of being ridiculed for touching sacred subjects and therefore don't Harold  Kumar movies repeatedly take on the challenge and find something original to laugh about. Sure making a baby high John having his penis stuck to a metal frozen pole and poking fun at the Catholic sex scandals may be inappropriate to some but everything's fair in comedy and what the filmmakers have done will make you laugh over and over. So while much of the film may be ridiculously over the top it all works. And while we don't see enough of Bobby Lee in the film who seems to be able to make you laugh without doing much we do get Neil Patrick Harris playing himself as a closeted heterosexual. That scene is not just really funny throughout but it steals the show. His scene is nothing short of a must see moment that is destined to be classic.".

But when it's Harold John Cho and Kumar Kal Penn it becomes a very wild adventure. I didn't enjoy the second one as much because escaping from Guantanamo Bay wouldn't be an easy task for anybody. For this third movie Harold and Kumar are back to turn a routine errand into a hairraising hazardous experience. Harold has to decorate a Christmas tree.But when Kumar comes over and accidentally burns down the tree they then have to find a new one steal it from a druglord gangster thug try to not rape his daughter crash a musical production of The Nutcracker and limit the number of people they shoot and drug to only Santa Claus and a baby.The 3D is of course a gimmick. They know that we know that. It involves joints coming out of the screen and eggs blood and guts. It is as juvenile and pointless as you can get. But that is the point.The jokes are of course offensive. But again that's the point. It makes it okay when the outandproud Neil Patrick Harris makes gay jokes or when Cho and Penn make racial jokes.I enjoyed the journey that they take in A Very Harold  Kumar 3D Christmas. Every time the baby found a new drug to imbibe or Kumar smoked another joint I laughed. It's the type of humour that has made the franchise so successful.".

For me to say this was just another Harold and Kumar movie would be unfair. I loved the first one. Simple premise with many jokes and characters along the way. Half of what made it funny was the fact Roldy and Kumar were going through this hell just to have some fast food. Escape from G bay had funny moments but them escaping a maximum security prison holding war criminals to reach America and regain their innocence? It was a little much. Don't get me wrong I still liked it but it felt like that magic was gone with the simplicity of the first. So when I saw the third was about to come out and it was a christmas special I felt hopeful for a good one but not confident. The third instalment had that simplicity again. Yes there was new characters and the 3D was new but they all worked so perfectly. Yes certain things were dumb and even weird like the fake baby Jesus winking at me or a coked up baby running around on the ceiling but its that kind of movie! They were going through hell once again to simply find a Christmas tree. The new characters were very funny and the old jokes and characters were seen and told in a new way unlike Hangover 2. Another new character was the use of 3D in this instalment. It was incredible and not just the smoke and coke flying at me but characters acknowledging it and poking fun. Bottom line is its OK to be apprehensive because the second one was just alright and a comedy like this in 3D could be thought of as being corny and trying to hard but they pulled it off perfectly. Harold and Kumar is dumb fun and for what it is this is a great comedy. Just make sure you catch it in 3D! Read my other reviews at rollginreviews.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems like just earlier this week was Halloween... oh wait a tic it WAS Halloween.The beginning of November is an unusually early time fir a Christmas movie to come out but then again it's not like there hasn't ever been a Christmas movie that's been released at the beginning of November. This year it's Harold and Kumar who have taken the honour of releasing a Christmas movie near the beginning of the year and for such a premature Christmas film surprisingly it turned out to be great!A Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas is more fun than it has he right to be. For one you can tell by the trailer it promises fun to be had and it lives up to the promise. The film in tone is like a mix of the first two movies. It has the ridiculousness of the second movie mixed with the style of the first. In addition throw in NPH Amir from CollegeHumor and characters we've seen before and you have yourself what may be the most fun film of the series.The film takes place 6 years after the first. A you may expect hard working Harold is successful has the beautiful Maria as his wife and life couldn't be any better for him. Meanwhile Kumar is a big fat and lazy frackup. He sits at home and smokes pot all day and has blown his chance at true love.Harold has invited his father in law played by Danny Trejo! who inadvertly brings his whole family to the household. The prejudiced in law replaces the faux tree with a naturally grown Christmas tree. When Kumar receives a package for Harold he takes it over where they reunite and discover it's a mega joint. Kumar tries to burn it up but they inadvertly burn the tree... Resulting in the two going on another zany adventure this time to replace the tree!!!First off you know what to expect from a Harold and Kumar movie however that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Because the film is consistently funny throughout and manages to keep you laughing until the final frame. The jokes are raunchier than ever! There's babies taking drugs Russian mafia jokes dark humour you name it. There isn't a thing this film doesn't have.The star power helps too while they may be getting a bit old Cho is 40 and damn he looks so young how do I look that handsome at 40 Cho and Penn deliver the usual great performances but I must note holy crap Cho really does prove himself as the talented actor he is here. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Penn too but Cho was easily the attraction for me. Trejowell what's not to love about him? Excellent actor and it shows Patton Oswalt is hilarious as expected and Amir from CollegeHumor is a great actor here as well. And Neil Patrick Harris... Well who can deny his brilliance?The 3D on the other hand is what prevents me from giving it a full mark. As you may have seen in the previews it does abuse the gimmick greatly but otherwise you really shouldn't waste your money. The screen gets very blurry during the more motiony shots and other than the flying out it doesn't really come as good use.Otherwise the new Harold and Kumar film is very enjoyable.

	onyx:emotionText "It seems like just earlier this week was Halloween... oh wait a tic it WAS Halloween.The beginning of November is an unusually early time fir a Christmas movie to come out but then again it's not like there hasn't ever been a Christmas movie that's been released at the beginning of November. This year it's Harold and Kumar who have taken the honour of releasing a Christmas movie near the beginning of the year and for such a premature Christmas film surprisingly it turned out to be great!A Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas is more fun than it has he right to be. For one you can tell by the trailer it promises fun to be had and it lives up to the promise. The film in tone is like a mix of the first two movies. It has the ridiculousness of the second movie mixed with the style of the first. In addition throw in NPH Amir from CollegeHumor and characters we've seen before and you have yourself what may be the most fun film of the series.The film takes place 6 years after the first. A you may expect hard working Harold is successful has the beautiful Maria as his wife and life couldn't be any better for him. Meanwhile Kumar is a big fat and lazy frackup. He sits at home and smokes pot all day and has blown his chance at true love.Harold has invited his father in law played by Danny Trejo! who inadvertly brings his whole family to the household. The prejudiced in law replaces the faux tree with a naturally grown Christmas tree. When Kumar receives a package for Harold he takes it over where they reunite and discover it's a mega joint. Kumar tries to burn it up but they inadvertly burn the tree... Resulting in the two going on another zany adventure this time to replace the tree!!!First off you know what to expect from a Harold and Kumar movie however that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Because the film is consistently funny throughout and manages to keep you laughing until the final frame. The jokes are raunchier than ever! There's babies taking drugs Russian mafia jokes dark humour you name it. There isn't a thing this film doesn't have.The star power helps too while they may be getting a bit old Cho is 40 and damn he looks so young how do I look that handsome at 40 Cho and Penn deliver the usual great performances but I must note holy crap Cho really does prove himself as the talented actor he is here. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Penn too but Cho was easily the attraction for me. Trejowell what's not to love about him? Excellent actor and it shows Patton Oswalt is hilarious as expected and Amir from CollegeHumor is a great actor here as well. And Neil Patrick Harris... Well who can deny his brilliance?The 3D on the other hand is what prevents me from giving it a full mark. As you may have seen in the previews it does abuse the gimmick greatly but otherwise you really shouldn't waste your money. The screen gets very blurry during the more motiony shots and other than the flying out it doesn't really come as good use.Otherwise the new Harold and Kumar film is very enjoyable. And surprisingly very heartfelt too as it has a great message about friendship. It will indeed snap you into the Christmas spirit and make you feel happy indeed. And while it may not be the best of the series nonetheless it is indeed very enjoyableOVERALL 810THE GOOD This latest entry in the series proves to be insanely fun entry with everything you could expect in a HK movie and more.THE BAD The 3D.

And then this! All I can say is apart from a baby getting high with the munchies and a penis stuck to a frozen pipe this was the worst of the three movies. I hate to say it but if you liked the first two and think this will be the same don't get your hopes up. It's terrible. And WTF is up with the 3D? This ruined it for me hugely because there are good 3D movies and then there are really cheesy diliberate 3D 'pokes' at the screen to make you go 'Awesome!'. Once I had saw the trailer I thought that it was a family movie that's how low this third sequel has dropped since the first two. It's an 18A? It should be a 12A! Yeah there's drugs and some nudity in it but really? This isn't something for fans of the first two movies. I still don't know how this movie has got a 7.2 Rating. It should be a 3.4 rating. Overall if you have seen the first two movies I don't recommend this one. Unless you want to because you might as well see this as you have seen the first two. If you have'nt then you won't be as disappointed as I am. I hope that they pick it up again and bring a much better fourth part to these movies. And if it turns out like this one I will give up with Harold  Kumar.".

These guys once again prove that anything can be funnier if you add weed and nudity. And the fact that Kal Penn can still make these movies and maintain a respectable reputation at the White House is hilarious enough as it is.As good as this one was however it didn't really live up to the expectations that were set by Guantanamo Bay. Maybe it's because when I saw that one it was in a packed theatre at 10 pm with a bunch of stoners laughing their guts out at every single joke. As unappealing as that sounds I wasn't stoned during this movie it's those types of things that make movies THAT much better if you ask me. Laughing my butt off with 30 or more people including a few random 14 year olds who needed to pretend they were with me in order to get in true story just wasn't the same.Something that really bugged me was how NPH was barely used in this one. Although his picture actually made it poster this time he wasn't really in it as much as I hoped. Come to think of it many of the old jokes from White Castle and Guantanamo Bay weren't used at all.And whether or not it was the theatre I went to the 3D was disgraceful. I almost suggest seeing the 2D version your eyes won't hurt you'll save a few bucks and you really won't miss anything.But even though it may not have lived up to the previous ones Harold and Kumar prove once again that as far as epic stoner comedies go they can't be beat. This one left me sore from laughing and with an itch to see more even though once again I wasn't stoned. I strongly suggest you get a big group to go to this one the more laughs around you the funnier this movie will be.And of course there's nothing like getting into the Christmas spirit a little early.

That's not to say the material is always shining in fact in terms of writing this is probably the raunchiest installment in the franchise yet. Which doesn't mean it is the funniest. This may be the least funny of the series yet this seems on the same level as Harold  Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay an inferior but amusing sequel.Being faced with the third installment is always an iffy place to be. Especially when you see it end. You try and think to yourself whether or not a sequel will be made. Here? I'm honestly not sure. I don't want there to be but there are a few set ups which make it seem like they are considering it. No sequel will match the humor the introduction to these characters brought us. It was erected from the simplicity of the story and the extreme likability of the characters.John Cho and Kal Penn who took a leave from his position at the White House reprise their roles as the stoner duo who have now been out of contact for six years. Harold is a successful Wall Street banker while Kumar is busy sitting on his couch with his buddy smoking pot and waiting for the next random hookup. Harold is married to the love of his life Maria Garces and her side of the family including her father Trejo is coming over on Christmas Eve.Maria's family is made up of thugs with tattoos and heavy muscles. Her father loves Christmas and cherishes it because when he was young he never had a respectable celebration with his family. When Maria and her family leave to attend a Midnight Mass Harold is left in charge to decorate the authentic Christmas tree. Kumar comes over and the duo accidentally burn down the tree think hard and the way they do it will come to you.Harold and Kumar now team up to try and find a new Christmas tree for the family before the family comes home. Joining them for a brief amount of time on their adventure is Harold's friend a new father with a child and Kumar's buddy who is hellbent on having sex with a young virgin. The baby jokes almost completely destroy the film with her inhaling marijuana smoke and cocaine. The result isn't laughter but a cringing factor that can easily destroy a comedy film.Thankfully those two characters are abandoned while the real stars do what they do best. Wander around aimlessly falling into comedic traps that are sometimes funny and sometimes not. Somewhere along the way in the second film Harold  Kumar morphed into a strange comedic fantasy rather than a straight forward comedy.There was a gag in the second film about a child with a severe birth defect giving him only one eye and very many scenes in this film involving fictionalized events such as a baby crawling around on the roof after getting mixed in with cocaine and the certain appearance of a jolly character. We begin to question why did the filmmakers feel the need to incorporate such farfetched elements in a comedy. I believe it just adds to the phrase stoner comedy film. As far as the 3D aspect of the film it's there but not necessary. It looks better than a lot of 3D films I've seen over the years but the extra ticket price is absurd for a film like this. One thing that incredibly aggravates me about this film is the fact that it is what I call a 3D abuser. This is the reason why 3D is a loselose for a movie if you incorporate too many 3D elements in the film IE throwing things at the audience or having an opening credit sequence devoted to using the extra dimension it will look awkward and out of place by the time you watch the 2D DVD. If you don't put the dimension to use and don't utilize enough the film will be criticized for even using it in the first place. A Very Harold  Kumar 3D Christmas when titled something like A Very Harold  Kumar Christmas on DVD will look awkward and very very strange on a 2D disc.But numerous pluses continue to put a smile on my easily pleased face. The presence of Neil Patrick Harris the use of the two leads to the fullest degree the excellent claymation sequence and the touching ending show just what the franchise has long been about. Heart and hilarity. As much as I loved the first film and have a soft spot for each sequel it's time for a good thing to come to an end. The series has just about overstayed its welcome and another sequel could very much put an unwanted stain on the fabric of the franchise like so many filmmakers feel like doing to franchises now.A Very Harold  Kumar 3D Christmas is good preholiday fun. It's not as downbeat and as miserable as Bad Santa yet it doesn't have the pleasing plot of a Christmas classic. It takes its R rating embraces it and is proud of the way its traveled. After all adventures to White Castle Guantanamo Bay and a search for a giant Christmas tree in the span of a few years is what I would call a long odyssey. An odyssey that should dock and deport before it goes into uncharted territory.Starring John Cho Kal Penn Neil Patrick Harris Danny Trejo Paul Garces and Bobby Lee.

	schema:reviewBody "... fortunately however significantly weaker still equals very funny. But there are just a handful of laughs spread throughout this picture rather than a constant supply.Of course all humour is subjective but having the two title characters apart for so long in the movie does harm the laughs even though it does drive the narrative. There's also an awkward feel good moral of the story motif to the picture. Still this being Harold and Kumar then part of the warm moments does involve the term cock meat sandwich.Lots of the genuine humorous moments occur with the parodies of 3D. However how well this will play if the movie is broadcast in 2D remains to be seen. Like the seasonal motif A Very Harold  Kumar 3D Christmas limits itself with the 3D gimmick unless it has designs on becoming a holiday staple.The equal opportunity offending continues in decent form though seeing a baby getting high is in questionable taste even for this series. As in previous films a highlight is Neil Patrick Harris though his assertion that we'll see you in the fourth one does nod towards a slightly cynical edge in this film's construction.Overall still a pretty funny movie in its own right but worrying signs that the joke is beginning to wear thin.".

A lot of my friends bash me for not seeing a Harold and Kumar movie but I went into this because I had friends who helped make the movie they had a miserable experience mind you and it looked pretty funny. Sure enough it was!It didn't start out well for me as the film was basically establishing the characters and to try to wow me with the 3D. The 3D in this film tries very hard to jump out at you especially when Kumar is smoking weed but sometimes I just feel it wasn't necessary. The film was good enough without it as 3D is nothing more than a gimmick. Although I applaud the filmmakers by making the 3D worthwhile although at times they look like cardboard cutouts the film could hold its own without it.The film pits Harold and Kumar at odds with each other as they lead separate lives. However one day Kumar delivers a package to Harold but slips and falls and the two meet up again. However the package is a huge joint and Kumar smokes it and accidentally sets the Christmas tree on fire which would anger Harold's step dad played by Danny Trejo who once I saw his first appearance in this movie it all went uphill from there. So they end up on Christmas Eve night searching for a new tree and all the misadventures that happen to them. Things like Russian mobsters babies getting high and end up at a Christmas show hosted by Doogie Houser who is really funny in this movie all pretty much adds up to hilarious hi jinks. The movie was pretty stupid and I may have lost a few IQ points watching it but I did have a good time. I still think it was odd for it to come so early in November. I guess a A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Thanksgiving didn't sound quite as effective.".

Applaud from this viewer.While the newest installment A Very Harold  Kumar 3D Christmas is actually the weakest of the three that doesn't mean it isn't still a lot of fun hilarious in spots and its one of those rare movies that starts off good and unbelievably gets better as the movie progresses.The first half is chockfull of gimmicky 3D and though it appears as if they're trying to make a 3DOverkill statement it's so much that I'm glad to see them ease up in the last half and make way for a good story. Despite the same ole buddymovieI'm getting too old for this sht plot it was still enjoyable with the reliable portrayals from both Kal Penn and John Cho.The movie takes place years after Harold  Kumar's second adventure to Guantanamo Bay and the boys have split up. Kumar's somewhat content at not moving forward  if anything he's getting worse and Harold's all grown up and happily married. Well there wouldn't be a movie if they didn't get back to the misadventures they're known for.Instead of craving White Castle or avoiding the law they settle on replacing a Christmas tree in order to not upset Harold's Machetestaring FatherinLaw.That's the easy explanation. The fun is following these duffuses around New JerseyNYC and giving away anything more would be spoilers. Suffice to say if you liked the other two there's absolutely NO reason you wouldn't be pleased here.While the movie's recommended I would also recommend  no demand  that you see it in Read 3D. 50 of the movie is that gimmick and so watching it in 2D you would be losing half of the entertainment.And now bring on Harold  Kumar Part 420.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is inevitable that a film will be benchmarked against its predecessors if they exist and particularly if they have excelled. For those wondering this hits a middle ground between both 'Whitecastle' and 'Guantanamo Bay'. A travesty though that it seemed to pick the worst aspects of the two previous instalments. It didn't push the limits of offence like the first and became a watered down lame excuse for a stoner comedy. It fell prey to some of the flaws of 'Guantanamo Bay' by throwing in emotion and other 'mushy' themes which don't befit a stoner comedy. Most of all though it made you feel as if it has been rigidly structured choreographed almost. It lacked the spontaneity and instinct you come to laugh at.After 'Guantanamo Bay' disappointed cult followers of the first the pledge was to make the third of the trilogy more in the vein of the original raw Rrated hilarity playing on stereotypes and being unafraid to venture into 'touchy' topics and treating them with light heartedness. What has been churned out is something more refined like an urbanised commercial 'Harold and Kumar' film which ultimately being harsh I admit came across as a cheap takeoff on the franchise. Kal Penn really didn't take the bull by the horns as he needed to and has done previously. Kumar seemed more vulnerable and Harold more assertive which changes the complex of the chemistry and made the pair more conservative than adventurous. The amount and involvement of other old and new characters makes the film more than just a Harold and Kumar Christmas but they all contribute negligibly. The one saving grace was Neil Patrick Harris. He seems to garner unanimous love from everywhere these days but his ironic real self mocking act is truly the icing and shows he is so respected and popular not to mention superb in this self fictionalised role. If you want something true to 'Harold and Kumar' style scenes with him will satisfy you. Yet in spite of being the one consistent factor he was but a guest star.In the end it was hard to decide whether a kid consuming and getting high on drugs was funny wrong or just plain daft. Oh yeah and by the way it was in 3D. If that really matters anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you seen the first two movies and expect it to be the same comedy and shenanigans Harold and Kumar get themselves into from getting high or from racial profiling then don't see this movie. If your new then you probably like it for being a standalone Christmas family movie. First of all the story sucks Harold's Christmas tree catches on fire and they have to find a new one very basic. Different from going to different escapades from a variety of incidents involving getting high or being chased by a protagonistracists. It felt like a bgrade Christmas movie in a rental store that nobody would want to borrow out too much attention was involved to the 3D that they just couldn't bother writing scenarios for the movie. It felt boring through the scenes seeing objects fly towards you like confetti eggs cocaine honey.What it should of focus on was stereotypes and comic relief that gets them in a problem and they somehow get out of it. It felt like it was also lacking jokes that the writers were scrapping from the bottom of a barrel to find any. That they had to have a baby involved such as getting high on marijuana but after that took it a step too far with cocaine. There's no stereotypical jokes or shows Harold and Kumar trying new stuff out. The character development was lacking even for Harold and Kumar it felt like they had no bond between them because the creators had to bring two other boring characters such as Todd with a baby and Adrian one for Harold and one for Kumar feels like they needed one white card each. The Ukraine mafia was too slapstick and didn't chase Harold and Kumar around like they were with the CIA.Rosenberg and Goldstein had a short part and one was converted to Christianity why not Islam or some other religion that's just typical for a Christmas movie. The only thing funny in this movie was the claymation of Harold and Kumar Neil Patrick Harris as funny as always and the waffle robot which seemed to replace the imaginary marijuana bag of Kumar's fantasy. Also Harold having his genitalia stuck to a pole and scolded with hot coffee. Just saying that I recommend to just skip to those scenes or off youtube clips you don't need to see the whole movie.".

The second one basically said all i wanted to say about politics and i quote George Bush was right  you don't have to believe in your government you just gotta believe in your country. He nailed it. I just got back from seeing The third and i gotta say it was freaking amazing. Harold and Kumar as always told it how it is. For example one scene Kumar sits on Santa's lap and a parent yells in protest Kumar responds  don't worry your son will get his chance to rub his rump all over Santa's dick in a moment... Isn't that basically what u take ur kids there for besides do you even know and trust that santa guy? The movie took a different turn by making the friendship split up with drew me in because I'm a fresh outa high school grad and i wonder if my life and relationship with my friends would change. But the movie gave off such a positive vibe about that subject that it relaxed me enough to realize i should just enjoy all the moments with my friends and not worry about the future. Religion is mocked but again Thats something that happens all the time. I believe in god and all that but i just shrugged it as a laugh and moved on. The movie reminded me why i love the characters and made me feel like the holidays were happening right now. Take it as just a movie have a good time talk about it with friends and you'l enjoy it. But if u go with a female you should probably have them step out for the Neil Patrick Harris scenes LMFAO! Go and see this if you have seen the others and in 3D while your on that good stuff and trust me the money you pay will be worth it.

The majority of the drug scenes are about other harder drugs like cocaine etc. And even then these scenes are just plain stupid anyway.I feel robbed of my time and a little less intelligent having sat through this lame immature joke of a movie.

You don't need to rewatch the first two movies to understand this new one. They spoof the claymation genre as a tribute to the classic Christmas specials we grew up with. They give a dirty twist to that infamous scene from 'A Christmas Story'Harold and Kumar aren't hanging out anymore and have new best friends with new lives. When Kumar receives a package meant for Harold he takes it to him and that's when the chaos begins. Throughout Christmas Eve night they must find the perfect Christmas tree deal with the Russian Mafia befriend a robotic wafflemaker and ride with Santa Claus in his sleigh. If you love dirty raunchy movies and Christmas movies this is the perfect blend for you. I highly recommend A VERY HAROLD  KUMAR 3D Christmas!!!".

This film will have its 85th anniversary next year and it came out back then one year before the Nazis came into power. The director is Max Ophls who also made several English and French language films in his career and almost a century later he is still among the most known filmmakers from Germany from the first half of the 20th century. The cast includes a couple names that may be known to fans of that era in film such as Wernicke Kemp Valentin and Karlstadt. Still I must say the one thing that makes this film stand out from its competition is not the acting writing or direction. It is the music and the singing that elevates the complicated love stories between the characters here considerably. Everybody wants to be loved but sadly it's rarely the case that they want to be loved by the one who loves them. I recommend Die verkaufte Braut. This film is definitely aboveaverage for an early 1930s film. Go check it out if you love musicals.".

It does not contain the whole opera of course you couldn't do that with the experimental first effort to film an opera but all the major titbits are there and you miss nothing of Smetana's best music which after all sets the final and definite touch of absolute comedy and highhumoured spirituality to the whole work.  No opera of Smetana's was more successful he actually composed ten and it is still successful yearly at the National Opera of Prague and has remained a stable success world wide on every international scene.

	schema:reviewBody "'Liebe Tod und Teufel' is nothing more than a creaky melodrama. It has dated terribly boosts lackluster performances and a soso story. The cheap film is not worth remembering. Well in all fairness the whole show comes to live for around five minutes when utterly beautiful Brigitte Horney croons Theo Mackeben's great song 'So oder so ist das Leben'. With her earthy charm prominent cheekbones and deep sultry voice Miss Horney created quite a sensation in 1934. In the right hands with good directors and handsome production values she might have become bigger than Dietrich. Alas her considerable talent was wasted in second banana roles and thirdrate melodramas. In later years Miss Horney played cameos in big budget WW II epics like the superior much much underrated 'Nacht fiel ueber Gotenhafen' and found work in mindless Edgar Wallace adaptations.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Liebe Tod und Teufel' is nothing more than a creaky melodrama. It has dated terribly boosts lackluster performances and a soso story. The cheap film is not worth remembering. Well in all fairness the whole show comes to live for around five minutes when utterly beautiful Brigitte Horney croons Theo Mackeben's great song 'So oder so ist das Leben'. With her earthy charm prominent cheekbones and deep sultry voice Miss Horney created quite a sensation in 1934. In the right hands with good directors and handsome production values she might have become bigger than Dietrich. Alas her considerable talent was wasted in second banana roles and thirdrate melodramas. In later years Miss Horney played cameos in big budget WW II epics like the superior much much underrated 'Nacht fiel ueber Gotenhafen' and found work in mindless Edgar Wallace adaptations.";

Excellent and lively musical score by Roy Budd and colorful cinematography by magnificent cameraman Edward Scaife . The movie was regularly directed by Sam Wanamaker who replaced Peter R. Hunt .

Meanwhile Leonard Nimoy who wrote about how much he enjoyed making this movie in his autobiographies is a most impressive heavy seeking Catlow for his own reasons.If one had not ever seen Brynner in a previous screen performance and if one had never heard of Nimoy's television alter ego Spock this would be the perfect film to get familiar with the actors' considerable talents. The vicious gunfighter he plays is a departure for Nimoy who even has a rare nude scene to perform. Brynner for his part plays his antiheroic figure with such relish that one can't help but be entertained by him.What works best of all with CATLOW is the film's quick and even pace. There is seldom a slow moment. The action sequences build logically then end quickly usually giving way to the next sequence that is already building. Since much of the film has been shot on location the authentic exteriors add yet another winning element to the picture's overall entertainment value.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a rather little entertaining western to watch. It has all of the violence and shooting but still it's made in a sort of more light and fun way.Never thought I would ever see Leonard Nimoy in a western. He made some appearance in western's but mostly in series and TVmovies. I think this is his biggest western's role out of his career. On top of that he also plays the villain in this one and he does it extremely well. He truly had some real talent for playing the bad guy and I wouldn't had minded seeing him in more roles such as this one. Yul Brynner is also good as always. He really was in his element in westerns. In this movie he takes a more of a kind and humorous approach which also works out really well for him.The characters are good ones but the character treatment isn't among the greatest. Yul Brynner will disappear out of the movie for some time then Richard Crenna and then Leonard Nimoy. He's supposed to be the main villain but nevertheless he gets hardly featured in the second halve of the movie at all. Consistency is not a too common thing within this movie.It's fine that the movie concentrates mainly on two characters that are different and also on the other side of the law but still great friends although they are not afraid to punch or shoot at each other either to get what they want. This sort of approach of an unlikely friendship isn't of course uncommon in a western.The story is a fine one that leaves plenty of room for action. There a lot of shootouts also involving villainous Indians. It all makes sure that the movie at all time is a fast going with plenty happening on the screen.It's a real '70's western. '70's westerns are a total different thing from westerns from any other decade. It has that typical kind of '70's rawness all over it and in this case the movie also features some experimental techniques such as some extremely fast editing in some scenes. Not sure if it truly helps or uplifts the movie but it still makes it a tiny bit more interesting to watch.Really a movie I enjoyed watching though it's obviously no genre classic. It's just too small and insignificant for that.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

There's some truly funny moments with witty dialogue to match and the action scenes are as solid as the rock formations that boom out of the Almeria locations.Budd's musical score is a bit hit and miss often sounding like it belongs in an episode of Alias Smith and Jones as opposed to a full feature length film while there's a lack of an edge to make the finale be anything other than run of the mill.

	schema:reviewBody "Actor turned director Sam Wanamaker and Academy Award winning King and I lead Yul Brynner teamed up for the second time as director and star respectively in Catlow a harmless featherweight adaptation of bestselling western writer Louis L'Amour's novel. Wanamaker and Brynner collaborated earlier on the espionage thriller The File of the Golden Goose. Anyway this 101minute PG13 rated oater deals with the camaraderie between roguish cattle rustler Jed Catlow Yul Brynner and Richard Crenna's determined arrowstraight U.S. Marshal Ben Cowan.Star Trek star Leonard Nimoy is cast against type as Catlow's nemesis who wants to put a bullet in him. Daliah Lavi and Jo Ann Pflug provide suitably distracting love interests for both Brynner and Crenna. The austere scenery around Almeria Spain substitutes marvelously for the Old West in this frivolous frontier yarn about maverick steers two million dollars in stolen Confederate gold Mexican soldiers and savage bloodthirsty Indians. Roy Budd's orchestral soundtrack enlivens this tolerably entertaining epic.One of the gags in the average but unexceptional Scot French and J.J. Griffith screenplay appears to have been lifted from Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Our amiable antihero Catlow surprises a bad guy and shoots at him through the sole of his boot with his sixshooter concealed in his footwear. Jason Robards performed a similar stunt in the train sequence of Leone's classic. The most distinctive feature of this otherwise ordinary but entertaining oater is Nimoy's handtohand combat with Brynner in the nude. That's right. Mr. Spock shows his butt and a glimpse of something else when our protagonist catches him offguard with his britches down. Nothing dirty mind you.As Catlow unfolds Cowan has a warrant to bring Catlow in for rustling cattle but the charges have been trumped up by greedy cattlemen who don't want anybody rounding up maverick steers. It seems that their own hands demand extra pay that their bosses refuse to pay for the hardship involving in such activities. Ben Cowan is on Catlow's trail when Apache's jump him wound him in the leg with an arrow and about about to kill when Catlow's opportune intervention saves Ben's bacon. Meantime the cattlemen have hired a hardcase Miller Leonard Nimoy and several gunslingers to corral Catlow. During a showdown in the desert Catlow spoils Miller's necktie party. As he is putting on his boot Catlow shoots at Miller through the sole with a gun. A brief gunfight erupts and Catlow's men scatter Miller's minions. After Catlow sells his steers for 23 dollars a head he allows Ben to take him into custody. Ben claps Catlow in irons and they take a stagecoach back to Fort Smith. Catlow's men rescue him in route. Naturally the cattlemen aren't happy about Catlow's escape.Cowan rides into Mexico and Miller trails him. In a border town Cowan finds Catlow long enough for our hero to lock him up. Catlow has set his sights on a mule train loaded with stolen Confederate gold that the Mexican army has discovered in a cave. Audaciously Catlow hijacks the mule train right out from under the Mexican Army's nose. Cowan sounds the alert inadvertently when he stumbles onto the vicious Miller and all hell breaks loose. Catlow leads his unwilling men into the desert with the army nipping at his heels. One of Catlow's oldest accomplishess Rios doesn't cotton to Catlow's plans and plots mutiny.No sooner has his men and he plunged into the desert than they find themselves at the mercy of the vicious Seri Indians. Catlow and company reach a fortress in the desert that lays in ruins. Cowan beats them to the fortress and spoils an ambush that the jealous Rosita has set up for Catlow. Catlow and his men cut down most of her gunmen and Catlow ties her up. Meanwhile Rios decides to doublecross Catlow join forces with Rosita and take the gold. They steal all the guns from Catlow's men and leave them unarmed to face the advancing Seris. Catlow Cowan and the outlaws are between a rock and a hard place when the Mexican Army ride to their rescue.The ending is entirely improbable. Miller's reappearance however restores some drama. Nimoy excels as a rough and tumble villain with hate in his heart. Sadly Catlow doesn't have enough grit to qualify as genuinely dramatic. The antics between Catlow and Cowan become rather childish and unbelievable particularly the last minute reversal. Catlow isn't a bad western but it is neither top drawer. The performances are adequate the scenery is rugged and the editing is incisive but the story unravels toward the end.".

To say this scene brings nothing to the table is a gross understatement and that scene is cringe worthy to say the least. I really think the posters who talk about this film have never saw it or are unfamiliar with with stars Or both For example one poster who talked about Richard Crenna Marshall Cowan and asks how he never did more Westerns must have been unfamiliar with The Real McCoys The Man Called Noon and countless others Many of which I never saw because they were made for TV but if you are going to ask the question all you need to do is read Crenna's IMDb Page and you will learn. The main reasons to watch are Yul Brynner Catlow who although not considered a Western Actor certainly was Including two classics The Magnificent Seven and Westworld and Jo Ann Pflug Christina. My favorite part? Spoilers Ahead Is the ending which shows what Catlow does to the rest of his partners in crime by locking up Rosita Daliah Lavi in jail for her actions and becoming Marshall and taking the rest of the gang back to Arizona for trial. As for the Marshall he gets shot up and cannot take the prisoners back to Arizona Which is why Catlow does it and after being healed he will have to face a different kind of sentence there is no escaping from.... The hacienda with Christina who knows what she wants and will get it. I really like the scenes between Christina and Cowan such as when they are ballroom dancing and horseback riding you can see how perfect they are together even if Cowan did not know it he will have a lifetime to realize it. 810 Stars.".

Seeing Mr. Spock in a villainous and highly animated role is a whole lot of fun even if his part is a smaller one. And Nimoy isn't the only one playing against type. The usually stoic Brynner is equally amusing to watch all goofy and smiling at one point he even gets to mug after getting kicked in the groin. On the downside the comedy as scripted isn't all that funny though the cast does the most with what they have. Despite that the film is fast paced never boring and I consider myself entertained. Overall this is far from a western classic but it's a mustsee for Brynner and Nimoy fans and well worth checking out for western fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1963 novel by Louis L'Amour this modern western stars Yul Brynner Richard Crenna and ... oddly enough Leonard Nimoy Spock from Star Trek who had been appearing in small TV roles since the 1950s. Brynner is Catlow and in spite of being hunted down by Cowan Richard Crenna he not only helps Cowan when Cowan is in injured but also plans on stealing two million dollars in Mexico. This one is more of a bullet burner than an oat burner as the ol westerns were called. Some beautiful scenery of Spain in here. It's listed as Comedywestern by imdb... and granted there are some scenes with fun upbeat music as they are clocking the soldiers one by one. For all the years Brynner had been in hollywood he still has a pretty strong foreign accent. Also a knockdown slapstick fight with Christina. Christina was played by JoAnn Pflug who was married to Mr. GameShow Chuck Woolery. I consider this one more of a western than a comedy. It's a typical western... L'Amour who was actually born LaMoore had written TONS of western stories and many were made into films. Directed by Sam Wanamaker who directed mostly TV shows and had been acting since the 1960s. It's pretty okay but it aren't no shakespeare.".

A detective James Booth is assigned to investigate the murder of a young woman whose body is found in the shadow of Windsor castle. In the course of his inquiry he stumbles onto a plot to steal a rare and valuable stamp called the Penny Goldand encounters a woman who appears to be the dead girl's lovely but dangerous evil twin Francesca Annis.This description paints the film in a better light than it actually is which is obvious since it comes from those trying to market the picture on DVD.The film's narrative has the quality of something one may see on a madeforTV program rather than something one would consider theatrical. While the set up and initially beginnings of the mystery are captivating the rest of the film is dreadfully dull and uninteresting. The story is totally unfocused as we are presented with scenes such as random flashbacks that seem totally out of place and irrelevant.The mystery itself is not at all that mysterious as the audience can predict its outcome from the very beginning and thus makes the film a big build up to nothing.There are a few good traits such as the wonderful location shots of Windsor Castle and the surrounding rural areas courtesy of Mr. Cardiff and a wellphotographed car chase which unfortunately seems out of place.The DVD was a blind buy given its cheap price of merely 4 most online DVD stores carry it between 46 but I certainly wouldn't pay a cent more. The film admittedly is attractive at that price but it is suggested you save up your money for more quality films.Not recommended except those who are fans of Jack Cardiff or those who don't mind squandering 5 to add a title to your collection.".

The genre had gone out of fashion about a decade earlier a situation that was to remain until the advent of the Morse TV movies in 1986. Nowadays a format that may have seemed outmoded in 1973 can be seen replicated on channels such as ITV3 on most nights of the year. Too bad then that PENNY GOLD provides such a tame example.Fittingly for a Jack Cardiff film the photography is superb as is the art direction. But in general the director and his cast are unable to bring the characters or the uninspired story to life. James Booth is good as the Inspector though with Nicky Henson as his faithful sidekick and there are all too fleeting appearances from Penelope Keith and Sue Lloyd. A crime story revolving around stamp collectors hardly sounds exciting to begin with although there had been at least one thriller on the same theme before BARBADOS QUEST with Tom Conway in 1955. Then fairly early on we learn that the murdered woman whose face had been damaged beyond recognition is one of twins one good the other evil. You hardly need to be Hercule Poirot to see where this is going. The film's at its worst when the murder of a typically tedious character is announced which we're then shown in a slowmoving flashback. I could hardly wait. The location shooting and reminders that the Britain of forty years ago was not the nanny state it is today hardly compensate for moments such as this.".

	schema:reviewBody "PENNY GOLD is a murder mystery thriller of the 1970s that feels very much like a TV movie even though it isn't. The soundtrack is quite unappealing and dates this film considerably and not in a good way. There's an opening shower murder before the rest of the story follows around a weary middleaged detective and his sidekick as they try to solve the crime.Their crimesolving skills include a lot of questioning and the occasional car chase. Sceneryspotting accounts for much of the fun when watching that and the appearances by future famous folk. John RhysDavies is a rugby player early on and Penelope Keith brings her plummy tones to a onescene cameo. John Savident best known for playing Fred Elliott in CORONATION STREET has a youthful turn and Una Stubbs is amusing in support. Watch out for Marianne Stone Britain's most prolific actress and Joss Ackland to boot.Unfortunately James Booth's detective isn't a very interesting character and I found him quite unappealing. Nicky Henson as his sidekick acts like Robin Askwith. Francesca Annis is a highlight playing the role of twins even though one of them is only seen in flashback and very appealing she is too. A shame the rest of the movie is only middling rather than engaging although it does have a nice twist ending.".

But the movie has such an incredibly bad story and storytelling that the movie still manages to almost become unwatchable at times.Not only just the story is simple and formulaic it also is told in about the worst way possible. The story never flows well which is probably also due to some bad editing. Seems like director Grard Pirs only concentrated on the style and action of the movie and not on its story at all. Definitely a case of style over substance.The story features lots of clichs and some highly unlikely moments even for action movie standards and the movie also doesn't exactly become much better as the movie develops. The movie even gets truly ridicules at times. Too bad because with its style and cast involved the movie really showed some potential.The movie really has a great cast. Stephen Dorff is a great actor and he also even shows that in this movie. Bruce Payne goes way too much overthetop with his role which causes him to be an unlikely and not likable enough villain. Steven Berkoff is way better in an also overthetop but very fun role as a Southern villain with an Elviswig. It's a role you normally wouldn't expect from him. And thank goodness that Natasha Henstridge's role is smaller than she is credited with.The action is fair enough. Definitely no bigbudget kind of stuff but obviously also way better than the average Baction movie. The movie provides a couple of thrills and kicks. Some of the special effects are a bit too fake looking at times unfortunately.A fair enough enjoyable guiltypleasure to watch but don't forget to switch off your brain first.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The plot concerns a group of hip young dudes who embark on a bank robbing spree to fund their early retirement sounds like a good plan. The first heist goes a little too well and soon they have problems with the cops and some annoyed gangsters all looking to get in on the action. This is all utterly predictable and we can see the inevitable double crosses coming a mile away. Rest assured if you haven't seen a hundred films with the same plot the makers of the film certainly did. The characters' are never really fleshed out so we don't really care what happens to them or particularly want them to come out on top in the end. Along the way our main dude Dorff gets it on with it's your turn to beNatasha Hestridgetonight playing a cardboard feisty police detective which provides the only real volatility in the story. It's one of those films where the actors are more or less just doing impersonations of characters from similar but much cooler films.The whole thing is shot with a weird sepia filter that made me want adjust the hue on my projector all the time and a lot of the actors seemed to have redubbed their dialogue to sound more menacing tho unfortunately not Berkoff who's southern state American accent is a bit of a joke. That said the music score was pretty cool.But never mind all this the only reason to watch is the car chases and big bangs. I think the whole thing was edited by the stunt drivers union with a lot of holes in the plot scenes too short to maintain any tension and probably more chases than were absolutely necessary...possibly the studio wanted Taxi 2 from the director but this ain't it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A gang of four thieves rob a bank and use roller blades to escape from the cops. This is the first of several daring robberies they have planned  the second involving an armoured car and an underwater escape. When they pull that off they find that not only do they get the cash they wanted but they have also stolen millions worth of bonds. Things look good for everyone as they know they will at least be able to get half their value through a shifty broker meanwhile though they not only have to cope with the cops but also some other groups that want the gang for other reasons.When this film started I immediately thought of a French short film called Argent Content which was a substanceless but enjoyable short about a bank robbery followed by a cool roller skate escape. That short was style over substance but the short running time saved it. However Riders moved past this copy and started to just lift lots of stuff from other films  Heat Sneakers etc all the genre clichs are forced into the movie but sadly nobody took the time to structure them into a worthwhile film that made any sense. So many things are thrown at the screen but they make no sense nor do they hang together. So we have stunts for the sake of stunts characters that lack any motivation a Heatstyle relationship that appears as quickly as it disappears and a plot that is just all over the place. It isn't awful but it is just so inane you wonder how on earth anyone ever though it was a good idea.The cast seem promising on paper but on film they are mostly confused and poor. Dorff is sexy and has good presence but he cannot make anything of his confused character  but he does look sexy nonetheless. Henstridge is also sexy but other than that you have to wonder how long she worked on the movie  all the rest of her scenes could have been done in a few days before getting sweaty with Dorff. The idea that their characters would have somehow had a PacinoDe Niro relationship is just laughable. Speaking of laughable Bruce Payne is in this film and is terrible. However at least he is in the movie which cannot be 100 said for Steven Berkoff who just appears to be in his entirely own twisted little film. Bennett Clich and McCarthy are all reasonable in support but neither they nor anyone else can do anything with this shambles of a film.The crazy style of Taxi might have worked once but Pires' attempts to do it again here just fall flat and it just falls flat on its face from the very start. Pointless and inane and will please only the very very undemanding genre fan.".

Unfortunately it has about the same attention to character and scenario development as the sports channel footage.The attraction of heist movies is watching the clever plot unfold unravel and then either work or fall apart. Riders doesn't offer any of that.  No tension no development nada. Just another implausible heist another burst of extreme sports footage then back to the clubhouse for the cool young dudes to plan their next coup.Except that they don't plan. Or rehearse much. Everything seems to 'just happen'. Oh look we just pulled off another perfectly executed heist. How about that?This goes for the inevitable entanglements as well  the bad guys who want their share of the loot just seem to surge out of the woodwork on cue. Despite all the masks and disguises and extreme sports getaways no one  police or thieves  actually seems to have any difficulty working out who these people are and where to find them. Did they leave flyers at the scene of the crime? Put up a website or something? The director doesn't tell but telling a coherent story is apparently not one of his priorities.There's lots more not to like. The dialogue is clunky the performances are mediocre at best. The four hip young things and Natasha Henstridge are merely lacklustre it's left to the veteran actors to really drag the movie down to the depths where it belongs. Bruce Payne is bad by any standard but the prize has to go to Steven Berkoff whose unwatchable scenerychewing complete with gratinglyfalse Southern accent breaks new ground in the history of bad acting. If they'd digitally replaced him with JarJar Binks it would have been more convincing and less painful to watch.To describe this as Straight to video material would be too kind.

Original storyline fast paced and full of comedy and high flying action.And when i mean fast paced...if you so much as blink for the first 30 minutes you will not know what is going on. Definitely a film worth paying attention to as the minute by minute scenes get ever more head spinning. I haven't seen Stephen Dorff in a leading role since watching Blade a couple years ago brilliant casting. The soundtrack is truly amazing every track seems hand picked to suit the play by play action in accordance with the song lyrics in an almost symbolic execution.Extreme Sports meets Lock Stock  Two Smoking Barrels.

	schema:reviewBody "Grard Pirs opens his 2003 film Steal with a strange sequence involving extreme sports police cars and the evading of capture following a robbery. The sequence as well as Steal itself predates the second Taxi sequel by a couple of months itself a film that sets its stall out relatively early with a string of extreme sports altercations featuring Sylvestor Stallone evading capture and inserting a few neat stunts in the process for the Hell of it. Taxi 3's opening turned out to be purely in jest a dream sequence appearing to send up your more typified dunderheaded action opening. Pirs' opening here is played straight a brash and carelessly chaotic way to open what ends up being a stupefying dull dumbo and ill conceived heist filmcomethriller more often than not resembling a more typical more idiotic direct to video cutandthrust thriller you might find at the bottom of a DVD bin in a petrol station forecourt.The irony is in that Pirs directed the first Taxi film from 1998 the man essentially a second unit director posing as a filmmaker here responsible for churning out this piece of junk. Steal or to give it its international release title in Riders tells the tale of four young thieves dragged deeper into the world of crime when powerful men coerce them into working for them. The film is a mess and a half with whatever Pirs picked up from working within that stable marked 'Luc Besson the writerproducer' annoyingly resonating throughout in that the cops are unglamourous the thievescomelowlifes quite the opposite action and spectacle are granted gleaming and frustrating priority over story and character and all characters of a law enforcement nature are suitably corrupt or just illminded. The team of four is headed up by Stephen Dorff's Slim he's the white male in a quartet additionally consisting of black male Otis Bennett attractive white female Alex Cliche and dopey hippie Frank whom drives around in a what else? VW camper van and he's played by Steven McCarthy.The four of them are predominantly young glamorous and good looking their opening job seeing them rob a bank before escaping from manya squad car by way of Rollerblade during which we're supposed to believe such things can outrun an automobile. The haul from the score is three hundred thousand dollars but we must believe that they would carry on despite this sum hell if it's this easy  why not? Within the forces of law and order stands Bruce Payne's leering chauvinistic piggish police Lieutenant named Macgruder consequently in charge of a room full of other droll suited unattractive officers out to catch Slim and his team of extreme sports indulgingbank robbing gogetters. New to the precinct is Natasha Henstridge's Karen their initial meeting of which sees MacGruder actually pause his speech in front of everyone so as to make light of Henstridge's photogenic qualities as a low camera angle uncomfortably extenuates her lower figure.The narrative sees Slim and his team forced into doing a job headed up by a scociopathic preacher from the Deep South named Surtayne Berkoff quite clearly playing the material for grins as those around him do so for grimaces and with one of his own guys. If they refuse to do so the preacher will somehow track them down overwhelm them again and then turn them into human icelollies. Meanwhile MacGruder is already using the crew for his own ill gain and Karen herself ends up getting romantically involved with Slim. The set up is purely an excuse to blow things up have things crash into other things and just play out somewhat eccentric and alienating content that nobody with an I.Q. of double figures upwards ought to particularly take to. The film is dismissible nonsense a really rather stupid exercise in second unit stuff which Pirs is clearly more interested in over anything else whatsoever bar perhaps Henstridge's exterior qualities. Some highlights include armoured vans crashing through meshed fences in slow motion police cars landing already upturned onto the roofs of other police cars people parachuting off of high bridges upon which numerous action set pieces have already played out as well as large 18wheeler trucks kicking up onto their sides riding along on half their wheels. I don't think Richard Stark across the broad course of many of his heist orientated novels ever inserted a scene in which his antiheroic brainchild Parker ever rode a skateboard out of dodge.Like many of Besson's films that he has both written and had a hand in funding namely the Taxi franchise the Transporter films and the first District 13 film the piece is solely an exploration in style over all else a vacuous exercise not in Parkour or the celebration of Jason Statham's manliness but in extreme sports. Here he has had little to do with the overall piece but his presence is in Pirs' illadvised glamorisation of crime and criminals as well as his childish trivialisation of the sorts of dangers behind what the characters are involved in. On a closing note and as many others have pointed out the film's runtime in bolstered to the gargantuan length of 83 or so minutes by a few minutes of end credits informing us on who's to blame. Additionally the extended use of slow motion throughout begs the question further still as to whether it was indeed a creative decision or whether it was one that spawned from a horror reaction in the edit room when the initial runtime was realised. Spritely leering repetitive and spasmodic nonsense Steal is a film which will do exactly that to a designated length of time from your life.".

A case of If I see another idiot jumping over a two deck bus.... Somehow they get into trouble with the police gee how is that possible? a guy who stands in shadows and tortures them by keeping them in a really cold room another guy who seems to be a cross between Elvis and a preacher Horrors!.I seriously don't know what Natasha Henstridge is for oh wait.. I do. Those semi nude scenes. Even the love scenes suck cuz there is absolutely no chemistry.The dialogues are cliched the plot is cliched the characters are cliched and the ending is cliched.I loved Ocean's Eleven but a hazard of its success seems to be the proliferation of crappy heist flicks that suck big time.I used to really like Stephen Dorf and thought he was doing weird but interesting movies. Then he did this one and I don't think I'll ever be able to see that Aerosmith video again without grimacing.Stay away from this one if you can't take boredom very well.Overall rating 12".

This is the film of which Baroness Von Trapp after its premiere said Nothing is true but it is wonderful. Well wonderful it is not but it s a fairly wellmade ditto scripted and entertaining film about Maria who would become Baroness Von Trapp. Ruth Leuwerik who always would blossom under Liebeneiner's direction is convincing as Maria and Hans Holt is the perfect Baron Von Trapp. Fine set design and as usual very good music by Franz Grothe.It is not as saccharin as The Sound of Music and it should be considered a typical product of its time with its optimistic to every problem there is a solution premise it may be that this premise was in the minds of the makers rather than the life of the Von Trapps. As such it was a modern fairy tale for German 50's audience with Maria as the fairygodmother this role is emphasized by the last shot of the film in which Maria looks straight at the viewer and says  Gute Nacht as a kind of blessing.Liebeneiner directs with light touch and knows how to tell the story economically but neither he nor the scriptwriter seems very at ease in dealing with the thread of Nazism and the subsequent 1938 Anschlu of Austria not surprising however as Liebeneiner could not have had a clear conscience on the matter.  The script suggests that after their escape from Austria the Von Trapps went straight to the USA while in fact they toured Europe and went to the USA in 1939 for an American tour the trouble with the immigration never existed.The film is loosely based on the memories of Maria Von Trapp which she published in 1947 the family had already stopped with their singing. The story goes that the producer's agent lead Maria to believe that German law forbid payment of royalties to foreigners. Later she found out that this was not true after which she received a lump sum of  9.000!. The story of the film and its sequel Die Trapp Familie in Amerika was sold to Broadway producer Richard Halliday and the rest is history.".

	schema:headline " Cannot keep the decent level it started with";
	schema:reviewBody "Die TrappFamilie or The Trapp Family is a German Germanlanguage film from 1956 so it is already over 60 years old. The director is Wolfgang Liebeneiner and this is one of the more known works from his truly long and prolific career. And it's not just the people who made this film but also those who starred in it back then who were enjoying pretty successful careers such as actress Ruth Leuwerik who died not too long ago in her 90s and who plays the main character here even if the title refers to a whole family. I think Leuwerik did a good job overall here and certainly elevated the material in its weaker moments. But still I must say that I did not enjoy the watch here as much as I hoped I would. The early scenes at the monastery and also the ways in which she breathes life into the rigid kids were fine and okay to watch just like the way she gets together with the dad but when they actually are the family the film is talking about then it all becomes pretty boring and feels at time like a poor man's Sissi film which is once again not Leuwerik's fault. I also think it couldshould have been 1520 minutes shorter. The color should not be taken for granted looking at when this came out and it sure adds something to the overall product but it's also not enough to make up for the glaring weaknesses and lengths in the second half. This is a film that is at least partially based on real events and characters and also from a biopic perspective I hope it could have been better. I see there is a sequel but from what this one here developed into I have zero interest in seeing it any time soon and same is true for the more recent more modern film on the Trapp family. The music side here is tolerable nothing more.

	onyx:emotionText "Die TrappFamilie or The Trapp Family is a German Germanlanguage film from 1956 so it is already over 60 years old. The director is Wolfgang Liebeneiner and this is one of the more known works from his truly long and prolific career. And it's not just the people who made this film but also those who starred in it back then who were enjoying pretty successful careers such as actress Ruth Leuwerik who died not too long ago in her 90s and who plays the main character here even if the title refers to a whole family. I think Leuwerik did a good job overall here and certainly elevated the material in its weaker moments. But still I must say that I did not enjoy the watch here as much as I hoped I would. The early scenes at the monastery and also the ways in which she breathes life into the rigid kids were fine and okay to watch just like the way she gets together with the dad but when they actually are the family the film is talking about then it all becomes pretty boring and feels at time like a poor man's Sissi film which is once again not Leuwerik's fault. I also think it couldshould have been 1520 minutes shorter. The color should not be taken for granted looking at when this came out and it sure adds something to the overall product but it's also not enough to make up for the glaring weaknesses and lengths in the second half. This is a film that is at least partially based on real events and characters and also from a biopic perspective I hope it could have been better. I see there is a sequel but from what this one here developed into I have zero interest in seeing it any time soon and same is true for the more recent more modern film on the Trapp family. The music side here is tolerable nothing more. Overall I think the weak and forgettable in here is more frequent unfortunately than the quality stuff and that's why I give this pretty old film a thumbsdown. Watch something else instead.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those horny teenager films that came out in the 1980's and it's easily just as dumb as most of them but looking at the young cast today this could be interpreted as a curio for this genre. Story is about horny teenagers from two prep schools where the boys and girls engage in raucous behavior from peering into windows to sneaking into showers. The girls side is Cherryvale and the boys Freemount and we see Jim Green Matthew Modine who dates Christine Ramsey Phoebe Cates and she has decided to give her virginity up and books a room in a cheap Mexican hotel.SPOILER ALERTJim's friend Bubba Michael Zorek takes bets on the event but he also wants to try and score with the sexy Jordan Betsy Russell who is jealous of the fact that Christine and Jim have a solid relationship going on although he and Bubba dress up as woman and sneak into Cherryvale. The Dean is Miss Dutchbok Fran Ryan who tries to keep the shenanigans down to a limit but she gets caught in the back of a limo with a chauffeur Ray Walston with their lovemaking broadcast over an intercom system!This film is directed by Noel Black who in 1968 made the terrific Pretty Poison but since then he has worked primarily in television and his feature film efforts were regulated to low budget sex romps like this. It would be easy to just unload one bad remark after another for a film like this but that would be too easy and instead I look back at this as something that was a trend and if you compare them with the few horny teen films that are made today you'll see how different they are. The abundance of nudity was actually the norm during this period and actress Betsy Russell has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes and the scene of her riding the horse topless has gone on to be infamous. The familiar cast is also another reason to check this out and along with Modine Cates and Russell is Kathleen Wilhoite Sylvia Kristel and Brinke Stevens in the shower scene. For trivia there are two things to point out like the fact that Cates sings two songs on the soundtrack and is actually pretty good and the other is that Paula Abdul was the choreographer for the outdoor calisthenicsdance sequence. I'm not really recommending this to anyone because this is one of those films that audiences can make up their minds about on their own but maybe my comments point out a few things to help others decide if they want to venture out and view this.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a genre that gave us many enjoyable films Private School may well be the best of the bunch. There is something truly irresistible about a film that sets out only to entertain its audience. There is no hidden agenda or deeper meaning or political motives here. The people who created this gem intended only to make us smile and show us some skin and make a little money in the process. Some days isn't that all a guy really needs? It's about time this one came out on DVD! The film deals with the social interactions between girls from Cherryvale and the young men from the nearby Freemount Academy. Of course when I say social interaction I mean sex. Simply put the guys are trying to either score with the ladies or at least get a good Polaroid of them coming out of the shower. The film has a serious undercurrent in how it deals with the relationship between Christine Ramsey Phoebe Cates and Jim Green Matthew Modine. They are trying to lose their virginity under the best possible circumstances but there are of course complications and misunderstandings. Christine's next door neighbor the lovely and talented Betsy Russell is out to steal Jim for herself using methods that would certainly grab any young man's attention. The resulting action plays out in the most satisfactory of ways.Private School scores on many fronts. The cast which contains many recognizable faces puts as much into their roles as they've done in any other films. The soundtrack featuring Phoebe Cates singing on two different tracks is much better than you would expect as well. There is tons of random nudity so you will get your money worth in that department.Curiously enough there is no DVD commentary by any of the actors in this film. Wouldn't it be fun to hear what Matthew Modine would think today about this early role in his distinguished career? And Martin Mull may have been hiding behind a beard for his little three minute cameo but the appearance was wellappreciated! He must have snuck this little bit part in between takes of Mr. Mom that year.For those who may question the logic of the Hound giving all ten stars to this film Heck that scene with Betsy Russell topless on the horse was worth eight stars by itself!!! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

After seeing it how can you forget Russell's topless horse riding scene and the saucy seduction of Matthew Modine's character. Yes tongues would be hanging! Wait on guys also featuring is sexpot Sylvia Kristel well known for the 'Emmanuelle' series as just wait the sex education teacher. Immature minds maybe but you should know the target audience it's aiming for.As for the cornball story it's rather slight with characters coming and going doing their own things with running gags cheesy setups plenty of flowing nudity and episodic setpieces. It's the same old highjinx that remain amusing due to the cast committing themselves and Noel Black's direction being so spiritedly random. There are moments of awkwardness with many daggy dialogues and tackiness but it was hard to keep a smile off my face. I really liked the classy Ray Walston who a year earlier appeared in the classic teen comedy with Cates 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' short but funny cameo. Matthew Modine was likable enough and Michael Zorek was humorous as a horndog. Kathleen Wilhoite in her film debut was a cheeky delight as Cates' roommatefriend and Fran Ryan was terrific as the prudish headmistress. There's also fine additional support by Jonathan Prince Julie Payne Richard Stahl Frank Aletter Frances Bay and Karen Chase. Look out for a risible appearance by Martin Mull as drug store clerk.Now the soundtrack is a complete blast. Catchy hip and upbeat bubblegum sound that's always well nearly playing in the background with many old tunes revamped. It's like a record with someone taking the needle off for a short break to only rip back in to it again. You got the 'Stray Cats' 'Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs' probably of the favourite of the lot 'Harry Nilsson' 'Rick Springfield' 'BowWowWow' and 'Vanity 6' to name a few.It's no classic but a vibrantly charming 80s high school teen sex comedy outing that can't do no wrong.".

Betsy Russell is an 11 on a scale of one to ten.And how many of us knew who she was. Fond memories of my teenage years.I am sure for many other too.As bad as this may sound to somePhoebe Cates is the girl you would marryand Betsy Russell the mistress.Both incredible beauties.Betsy Russell exudes SEX APPEAL.Phoebe Cates the prettywholesome girl next door.As for the rest of the cast does anyone even care. Matthew Modine for instancewas and has always been the stereotypical Nerd that tried to pull off the cool jock type.What a lucky guy to have worked with two amazing beauties.The seen with Betsy getting massaged by Matthew was a classicthe way she giggled and gyrated was something to behold.I am not sure if I have seen anyone sexier.between that scene and the horse back riding.This lady shows her true talents.If any of you guys want to see true sex appeal at it's finest.This is the ticket!!!!!!!!!!!";

Sure the plot is thin the humor is thin but Betsy Russell is so HOT! Probably the best scene is Russell riding topless on a horse. Even clothed this woman begs the male eye to revel and take in every inch of her skin. It's not Fast Times at Ridgemont High also starring Cates or The Breakfast Clubbut Private School for Girls got me through those years when I wanted to see a lot of TA. It is finally on DVD much to the chagrin of Phoebe Cates fully restored and in letterbox format to make the shower scene all the more pleasurable. It was about time considering that lame movies like Night Patrol Night of the Living Dead II and the Party Animal being put on DVD. In any case I am truly sorry Phoebe.

And although Ms. Cates keep herself mostly covered up in this movie the vivacious Betsy Russell does her best to compensate by getting her ample charms out at the drop of a hat.Viewers are also treated to a great cheesy dance routine with the girls clad in lycra leotards and legwarmers bending and stretching to the song The American Girl by Rick Springfield a real corker of a shower scene the unforgettable sight of a topless Ms. Russell riding a horse in slow motion and an appearance by Emmanuelle herself Sylvia Kristel who unsurprisingly plays the sex education teacher.Private School is enjoyably silly trash for those who love immature teen comedies with loads of nudity ie. me!.".

	schema:reviewBody "Private School is one of those movies which all these years later you just know that everyone who had anything to do with making it is embarrassed to have been involved. Heck I'm embarrassed and all I did was watch the stupid thing. It's a teen sex comedy about the students at two private schools one for girls and one for boys. The plot revolves around the boys and their rather pathetic attempts to see the girls naked. Antics ensue. Desperately unfunny antics. Even in the most horrible comedy movies there's usually a good laugh or two sprinkled in somewhere. Not here. There is nothing funny in this movie. Nothing. The movie features a young Matthew Modine who was very fortunate to salvage a career after appearing in this turkey and Phoebe Cates fresh off her Fast Times at Ridgemont High bikini brilliance. Ray Walston who played Mr. Hand in Fast Times also pops up. Oh how I wish I had just watched Fast Times again instead of sitting through this debacle of a movie.Aside from Modine Cates and Walston the cast is made up of a bunch of nobodies most of whose acting is so terrible it is easy to see why they had no careers to speak of. The closest thing to a somebody besides the aforementioned trio is Betsy Russell. It is her character Jordan who's the bad girl determined to break up the sweet innocent couple played by Modine and Cates. Jordan's seductive weapon of choice? Topless horseback riding. Subtle. If nothing else that provides a memorable fifteen seconds of film. Of course if the best thing you can say about a movie is that a girl takes her shirt off and rides around on a horse for fifteen seconds you know it must be a truly awful movie indeed. There's also the obligatory shower scene which at least gives us a few minutes of relief from the movie's hideous dialogue terrible jokes and incredibly uninteresting plot. Very early on in the movie one of the characters goes off to get herself a bag full of horse excrement. Seriously. There's a statement about this movie's quality right there. How would I succinctly describe this movie? It's exactly what's in that bag.".

Martin Mull has a small role as the pharmacist in the drugstore where Christine is trying to buy condoms. He is not listed in the credits.

I found another one. In the riding seen Jim is sitting with Christine on the fence when Jordan decides to go topless. When Bubba starts to chase her on his horse you can see Jim running behind him. He is no longer on the fence. How many times do you think I had to see this movie to come up with that one? Martin Mull has a small role as the pharmacist in the drugstore where Christine is trying to buy condoms. He is not listed in the credits. Also I noticed that Paula Abdul was in the credits for organizing the dance sequence. This must have been even before her singing career. She was a cheerleader for the Lakers' basketball team. This must have been one of her first jobs.";

	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time long long ago there was no Internet. The world was a dark and dreary place. There were no cellphones no selfies no sexting. There were no porn sites filled with naked girls by the thousands open to teens with just a click of the Yes I'm an adult box. If you were a teen and your parents had a VCR which cost about 1000 back then you still couldn't go into the XXX section of your local video rental store if there was one. Heck you couldn't even buy  or browse  a Playboy magazine legally.So what was left? Weeellllll you could actually do it in person but that would require actually meeting a girl. It was all quite mysterious back in the days before porn. So for the sexstarved American male there was the local movie theater or better yet drivein. Way back then a little nudity went a long way to attracting audiences at least males. And that's about all you get with Private School. Originality you do not get. We get clumsily remade scenes from the great classics of teen porn such as Animal House  1978 specifically the second story peeping Toms. We get the shower scenes in homage to Porky's  1982. And we get a sex ed class a la The Meaning of Life  March 1983. And then there were the crossdressing scenes which were original in Some Like it Hot way back in 1959. Yawwwwn. What's the difference between Private School and porn? Porn is more educational. We don't actually learn anything in the sex ed class scene unlike The Meaning of Life and any selfrespecting porno. What we do learn is that Sylvia Kristel who is a surprisingly good actress gives an incredibly bad performance presumably on the demand of director Noel Black. Was this some sort of retribution for a lack of cooperation? No Kristel does not provide a demonstration in the movie.We should not forget Dan Greenburg and Suzanne O'Malley credited with writing this movie I wonder if they list it on their resume?. And who came up with the imaginative title Private School?Fortunately Phoebe Cates is treated with more respect. I'm glad her career survived this flaming turkey. She was excellent in Gremlins. Where have you gone Phoebe? You can come out of hiding now. All is forgiven!If Private School were released today in a movie theater would anyone show up? Would anyone stay to the end? Maybe. There are some people who actually enjoy stupid bad movies. Which raises the question of why I watched it. Answer I stumbled on it in Leonard Maltin's book and found the cast Phoebe Gates AND Sylvia Kristel!!!??? Don't be fooled There is NO Phoebe and Sylvia scene  and rating of BOMB intriguing. But the sex scenes wouldn't cut it these days. Now sex has to be graphic and dished out in heaping helpings like Nymphomaniac etc. Some mainstream movies are now nothing more than porn with better production values like Titanic  and unlike Private School which had neither high production values nor graphic sex. Stay to the end? I dare you to make it past the credits! The title song is atrocious repulsive and repeats a certain fourletter word perhaps to help spice up the R rating. This movie is pure shameless teensploitation. Perhaps it should be titled Shameless. Don't get me wrong I have nothing against nudity porn or sex in movies just snickering unerotic sagging nudity. But hey if this movie turns you on enjoy those hyperhormones while you can. Youth is wasted on the young. Go out and meet a real girl. If you don't know what to do with her watch some real porn. You won't learn anything at this Private School.".

Private School is a byproduct of Porky's 1981 like Revenge of the Nerds 1984 is and all 3 are incidental indecent descendants of Animal House 1978 which are all some of the top sex comedies ever! The '80s was a great decade for sex comedies and lots of naked girls in sororities and showers scenes. God bless Phoebe Cates!... the '80s!!".

God Phoebe Cates is awesome. Betsy Russell's soooooooo hot in this and her topless bareback horseback riding is stuff of legends and 1 of the alltime hot nude scenes like top 150! Private School is a byproduct of Porky's 1981 like Revenge of the Nerds 1984 is and all 3 are incidental indecent descendants of Animal House 1978 which are all some of the top sex comedies ever! The '80s was a great decade for sex comedies and lots of naked girls in sororities and showers scenes. God bless Phoebe Cates!... the '80s!!";

An uncredited Martin Mull carries the film's best sequence in a kooky turn as a fasttalking pharmacist who makes condombuying a challenge but the entire supporting cast is in top form  Ray Walston as a sly chauffeur and Fran Ryan as a stern headmistress who gets caught in every shenanigan in particular. Betsy Russell also does well playing the closest the film has to an antagonist and there is a hilarious sequence in which she is lured into a male dormitory room full of boys spying on her from every nook and cranny something she remains oblivious to despite several boys almost showing their faces and often making noises! Not all of the humour works though it is more pitiful than funny to see the three main male characters dress in drag to sneak into the girls' dormitory. The casting of Sylvia 'Lady Chatterly's Lover' Kristel as a mousy sex education teacher is something that must have sounded funnier on paper than it is in actuality. Generally speaking though this is a pleasant and frequently funny ride with an ending that it is hard to forget and a catchy theme song.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts off with Yash Chopra's portrait and his own special Jab Tak Hai Jaan poem. And from that moment you're transported to his magical world to witness his take on love. You see the world from his perspective and accept anything whether good or bad with the most idiotic smile on your face. If you snap out or zone out of that phase then you probably won't enjoy JTHJ. Otherwise you're in for the best romantic saga of 2012 where true love is beyond anything where love defies everything. Yes even God's will.The premise of Jab Tak Hai Jaan is simple  almost too common. The framework is similar to Yash Chopra's Veer Zaara  start from present flashback 2 lovers separation for a long time.... then the same questions. Why are they not together? Will they end up together?It worked for me in Veer Zaara. And it did here as well. If I were to compare I'd say that Veer Zaara's story had more ''meat''  and the reason was more compelling and made a bigger impact there. Jab Tak Hai Jaan's twist will meet with a mixed reaction  you'll either approve of it or think it's highly stupid. It will all come down to how you warm up to Meera's character and agree or disagree with her ideologies. This is another crucial point which determines whether Jab Tak Hai Jaan will work or not for you. And if it doesn't at the interval then do walk out because you'd certainly not enjoy the second half or the climax.Jab Tak Hai Jaan works primarily because Yash Chopra manages to make you believe in his vision. As a director he has that ability to present his storyline in the most innocent simplistic convincing way.The film comes with a fair share of blemishes. The pace  length being the major culprits. In that respect the editing and screenplay should have been tighter. The writing by Aditya Chopra could have been more imaginativeThe love and passion were present and how. No one does it better than Yash Chopra. And no one portrays it better than Shah Rukh Khan. Lethal combo. I always use this vague term  but Jab Tak Hai Jaan has so much soul and has its heart in the right place. Picturisation and cinematography deserve full marks. Dialogues were simple for most part  and I liked that. There were a few really deep ones which I absolutely loved.A.R.Rahman's music is apt for the film. It does lack the ''epic'' vibe throughout the film but then comes the title track at the end and you're sold. Shah Rukh Khan as Samar was flawless. Every single time. You think he's done it all. You think there won't be any novelty in his approach. And yet he comes and blows you away. The intensity he brings in and the powerful control of emotions he displays is just brilliant. His outburst scene at the church is more than enough for me to declare this as my favourite male performance of the year. Katrina Kaif went all out for this role and it's obvious. Her dancing and attitude in Ishq Dance was out of this world!! I take my hat off to you Kat. And her pole dancing in the tube major turn on. This was no doubt her best look yet. Acting wise Katrina does well. It's a sincere performance with many ups and one down. She messes up her breakdown scene before interval but that aside she was natural to the core and this is something she should be proud of. Anushka Sharma as Akira brings the freshness required to get Samar out of his shell. The chick's energy is infectious  and it's hard not to fall for her character. Her crying scene is one of the most natural ones I've seen so far. Rishi Kapoor  Neetu Singh have a special appearance but a crucial one. In fact Pooja Neetu's scene with Meera takes the story forward and those 8 minutes between the four stars were one of the plusses of the film. Rishi is his jolly flirtatious self while Neetu has more to play with and leaves a good impact. Watching Anupam Kher was a delight. In short I liked it. While not perfect as a whole there's nothing to hate as such from Jab Tak Hai Jaan. It's a saga. An almost dreamy one. If you're charmed enough by the premise and the characters then you'll have a good time.This will remain the most special film of 2012  whether you love it like it or hate it. Go celebrate Yash Chopra.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jab Tak Hai Jaan  In a time dominated by South Indian remakes and illogical stunts comes a movie that is so refreshingly different from those mindless sagas. A movie that connects to that Old World charm and beauty of a special feeling called Love. A movie that will make you feel good about life and gives you hope about love. Though an Love Story on the surface the movie has its own layers of emotional undercurrent running from its inception till the last frame. And The Great Yash Chopra is not called a LEGEND just like that he justified his legendary status yet again with a MASTERPIECE. And there is no match for SRK when it comes to intense roles. He excelled in a role tailor made for him only. When MR Bachhan calls his' act as THE BEST after Swades who are we to comment on that. Still I believe this movie will not appeal to all as not everyone is born with a good taste and we can't help it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jab Tak Hai Jaan  In a time dominated by South Indian remakes and illogical stunts comes a movie that is so refreshingly different from those mindless sagas. A movie that connects to that Old World charm and beauty of a special feeling called Love. A movie that will make you feel good about life and gives you hope about love. Though an Love Story on the surface the movie has its own layers of emotional undercurrent running from its inception till the last frame. And The Great Yash Chopra is not called a LEGEND just like that he justified his legendary status yet again with a MASTERPIECE. And there is no match for SRK when it comes to intense roles. He excelled in a role tailor made for him only. When MR Bachhan calls his' act as THE BEST after Swades who are we to comment on that. Still I believe this movie will not appeal to all as not everyone is born with a good taste and we can't help it.";

	schema:reviewBody "We see Major Samar Anand Shah Rukh Khan being the shining star of the Indian Army's bomb disposal unit clocking almost close to a hundred IED diffusion and doing so in daredevil fashion. Some call him the man without fear while others coin the term the man who cannot die because his job is high risk but he doesn't take the necessary precautions. The routine involves going off for a little quiet time for himself after having stared death in the face but this time round got rudely interrupted by the vivacious Akira Rai Anushka Sharma who is adamant to get a stint with Discovery Channel and chanced upon Samar's diary of sorts which got left behind.And this natural flashback provided a look into the Major's past before his army career being a multiple job holder in London in order to make ends meet from shoveling of snow to the waiting on tables to being a fishmonger and busking in the streets. Fate allows him to meet poor little rich girl Meera Katrina Kaif and before you know it their constant interaction to exchange tips in the learning of languages form the basis of their relationship even though Meera is engaged to a rich scion. I suppose no girl can resist the charms of a man who can serenade at multiple London landmarks and dance the way SRK does.But here's the catch which I thought was an extremely bold move. Religion comes into play and this takes on proportions and depth of discussions about how some put religion as priority having empowerment over their lives that it could sometimes lead to paralysis of sorts. To save Samar's life Meera makes a pact with her spiritual father and I suppose only a bet as big as exchanging one's happiness with the life of another can bring that prayerful wish to fruition. But this causes bitterness in Samar because how can one do battle with Jesus? It's almost impossible but if this rivalry of one's heart toward man and toward god isn't colossus then I don't know what is.I suppose what Yash Chopra's story was trying to say is that without love or keeping the faith one's life can get really inward and withdrawn losing that fun element with all things going really serious and at times reckless. Samar goes back to India and fulfills his family lineage of military men but chooses the riskiest of professions if only to tempt the higher being at taking his life away and in such fashion to put a dent in his ex lover's faith. Akira enters the picture and finds this old fashion love of the previous decade a lot more meaningful than the present throwaway ones that centers around physical love. The second half after the intermission sees the relentless pursuit Akira has for Samar only for her constant advances to be continuously rejected because in essence Samar's heart was locked in on another and left for dead.As if that wasn't enough  with how Samar has turned into a Meera even without his knowledge in shutting people out  Yash Chopra has more up his sleeves when he has to put everyone together forming tremendous tension especially when throwing in one of the oldest plot elements in the book for a romance albeit too with one too many hospital stays. It's decision time and you'll find yourself taking sides as to who Samar should eventually end up with after having emotionally invested an hour with each heroine. Characterization here is top notch in making everyone of them rich and real that you'll probably see shades of yourself or people you may know in one or more of the leading protagonists.Shah Rukh Khan once again shows why he's one of the leading men in Bollywood with his fine all round performance in being a younger man who is full of zeal hope and life with the world ahead of him given his hard work and yet balancing that out with a more sullen serious look as the hardened military man with a death wish nursing a broken heart and resigned to the impossibility of challenging god. Between the two leading ladies it is difficult to pick who actually had an edge over the other but if it's a personal choice I'd give my vote to Anushka Sharma if only for her assured portrayal of a bubbly personality who knows what she wants and is a go getter being in for a challenge when encountered with emotions she has yet to handle compared to the more indecisive character that Katrina perfectly portrayed in what would be a classic Yash Chopra model of the unattainable femme fatale responsible for the total breaking of hearts.Cinematography is great as you would come to expect from a Yash Raj production with lush costumes glossy production and art design sets and locales being nothing but the best to put you in the mood for love and love lost or broken. Music by none other than A.R. Rahman also lifts the film into epic greatness befitting a contemporary love story of our time. If anything Yash Chopra's parting gift through his films and this one in particular is a reminder to keep the faith that love will come in good time and to remember to live life not be afraid of it. A definite must watch backed by all the right reasons.".

A very good story but screenplay by Aditya Chopda and Devika Bhagat is not up to mark. It drags so many times. Dialogues by Aditya Chopda  are very good especially after interval. Performance wise Anushka Sharma is show stopper. Shahrukh Khan is very good in intense emotional scenes as usual. Katrina Kaif is also good. She is very balanced actually. Music by A.R.

	schema:headline " A Movie of Two Acts Unfortunately Only one of Them is Any Good";
	schema:reviewBody "Yash Chopra's last cinematic outing left me feeling somewhat conflicted but I would still recommend it as a watch for any fan of Yashji. First I would like to elucidate the moving and effective parts of the film before I go on to the major critique. Firstly the performances from all of the actors were at least at par with their previous work and I thought Shah Rukh in his role as a Major in the Indian army was one of the best of his career. In addition the cinematography and the songs in the movie were both enchanting and involving. The story is very compelling and though a touch filmy gets the viewer involved in the struggle between the characters very well a feature that is common to most of Yashji's work in any case. On to the negative aspects. While the story is engaging the character development is somewhat confusing. We get to see the change in Shahrukh over time from a carefree worker in London to a cold and calculating soldier carefully orchestrated over time and yet Katrina's character is portrayed in a very nebulous light. She takes her relationship with God very seriously in some areas but in others it seems to be at the back of her mind if it is there at all. Normally I would attribute this to Kaif's lack of depth in acting ability but in this case she cannot be entirely to blame as she was at least adequate in the role she was given. The second major problem is that the antagonist God is never portrayed if He could be at all in a very distinctive light. It would be giving away plot points to say exactly why but suffice it to say that Chopra did not seem to have the heart to actually portray a fight against God and so the effort of making him the only true antagonist seems to be halfhearted. Finally in the final third of the movie a somewhat shady tactic is used in order to propel the story forward. While I have seen worse devices used in Bollywood films it did seem like a somewhat cheap ploy to utilize in order to move forward. This does seem to somewhat distance the audience from the actual plight of the characters and further seems to muddy Katrina Kaif's role in the film. Overall I would not call this a terrible movie by any stretch and certainly a beautiful film to watch but if there is any lesson to take away from this film other than for Shahrukh Khan not to go on the streets in London is to keep it simple and that emotion can only go as far as reality allows it.".

Katrina after a long time since Namastey London has given a convincing role. Her chemistry with SRK was great. But even with her relatively small role I think Anushka Sharma came on top with her acting and unmatched facial expressions.Movie isn't predictable...at all.

Shah Rukh Khan handles the role of a strict army officer and jolly youngster so well that it seems hard to believe that both roles are played by the same man. Anushka sharma is bubbly and ' happygolucky girl' who lives life to the fullest breathing every moment of her life happily. Katrina Kaif on other hand is exactly opposite to Anushka.

	schema:reviewBody "Started my year with this film. Wanted to write just after it but couldn't make out time for writing review. Jab Tak Hai Jaan is a love triangle. Shar Rukh Khan Katrina Kaif Anushka Sharma are in the lead roles of the films. Story is penned by Aditiya Chopra  it has plenty of twists  turns. Because of so many turns  twists it gets engaging at the same time complicated. On thing about the story is that if you are not familiar with characters like Meera who has firm believe in God then the story might not satisfy you. If you can go with this then you will find story terrific. Films screenplay by Aditiya Chopra  Devika Bhagat is masterfully written. Film never gets predictable. Also because of the story its keeps your interests till the end despite of its slow pace. The writers deserve Kudos for their job. Aditiya Chopra's Dialogues are very much contemporary  effective. Performances of top 3 actors are top notch. Shah Rukh Khan just lives the role of Samar Anand. He is supremely effective in both characters of struggling young man  lonely army man. He has again proved to be King Of Romance in font of camera after doing romantic character almost after long years. One thing is for sure is that you won't see such handsome Indian army officer anywhere. Katrina Kaif plays a perfect Yash Chopra Heroine except of her part time smoking habit.it won't be wrong if it is referred as her best performance. She also dances very well. Film would've been incomplete without Anushka Sharma's performance. She just lives the character of new generation girl. Her endearing character will make you fall in love with Akira. Anupam Kher has been effective. Neetu Singh and Rishi Kapoor leave lasting impressions in short special appearances. Other actors like Shaarib Hashmi Amarinder Sodhi Gireesh Sahdev Andrew Bicknell Ameet Channa does a formidable support. Direction of Yash Chopra is just terrific. Though he is making films for almost 50 years but he gave the movie a contemporary look with his masterful hand in film making. He is just master in romance shows his matured skill in every scene. Another feather to his cap. Songs have not been as that popular as they were expected as this film has Oscar winning pair of A R Rahman  Gulzar. But songs go well with the moments in the movie  compliment the actors. A.R. Rahman have done experiments with music as it has the taste of Yash Chopra  his own style. Gulzar is very good with lyrics .He is brilliant with Punjabi lyrics of 'Chhalla'  'Heer'. According to Yash Chopra supporting artists were best possible in the country  so it is. Film is shot in Exotic location like Kashmir Ladakh London. Anil Mehta's cinematography is grandiose  World Class. He is both excellent in capturing Indian  foreign locals. He captures the actors  their emotions gracefully and gives a look of poetry in celluloid. A.R. Rahman's background music is just too good.Songs picturisation by Vaibhavi Merchant is superb. Like other Yash Chopra movies it has also got gorgeous costumes  best makeups. Watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan not only as it is last film of Yash Chopra also for the reason why everyone will miss this man. Truly a man who cannot die.".

I was bored to death and am falling short of words at expressing my extreme displeasure at watching such a movie which came after 8 LONG years !! I mean is this the result of waiting for 8 years ? Nope this is not the way for Yash ji to go and definitely not the swan song I was expecting from Yash ji.May he rest in peace but this is an apology of a film. Songs are below average no hummable soundtracks and the film is SOOOO SLOOOOW !!There is hardly any movement in the first 2 hours. Things start to get a bit interesting for about fifteen minutes or so and after that it's all downhill. Extremely disappointed in Yash ji but lesser said about it the better. SPOILER To conclude I would like to quote SRK's statement made to Katrina in the endPehle nahin soch sakti thimeaning couldn't you have thought of it earlier instead of making me wait 10 TEN years for it lest it would have saved meand the viewers the torture. I wanted to give it 010 but I guess that is not possible in minimum star rating. Also I am writing this review because it's amazing as to how everyone is praising this film. I was myself stunned at the disgusting and pathetic piece of work this film is.".

I was bored to death and am falling short of words at expressing my extreme displeasure at watching such a movie which came after 8 LONG years !! I mean is this the result of waiting for 8 years ?

Movies that entertain you make you dance make you laugh make you cry and above all make you love the life.Jab Tak Hai Jaan has it all and beyond. What makes Jab Tak Hain Jaan special from Yash Ji's earlier movies is the narration characterization. When he shoot portions in Kashmir and Ladakh he never did it for the sake of Natural beauty. Switzerland lush green mountains a sort of character in all his movies is not there in this one. But nature plays a important role in narration. And that's what Yash Chopra is. The portions shoot in ladakh are not romantic considering its rough mountains light comic scenes in kashmir valley and some thrills of bomb defuse in street of Kashmir. Kashmir is not there just for scenic beauty.There are actors there are heroes there are superstars there are stars and there is Shah Rukh Khan. He needs no special dialogs he makes ordinary ones very special. His eyes speaks thousand words..Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes you believe that here is someone who redefines acting. A classic performance from a legend.It's hard to select who is better Katrina or Anushka though few may say Anushka but that's due to her character. What Darr did to Shahrukh's career and his way of acting Jab Tak Hai Jaan will do to Katrina and Anushka...watch their performances post Jab Tak Hai Jaan...now on they can make a ordinary role a talk about.There were mix reactions about Music but once you saw the movie you will agree this is the best music. Like all Yash Chopra movies music of Jab Tak Hai Jaan is not for making popular music but it is important part of movie. For Example Challa song or Heer song...you may wonder why out and out Punjabi song? but when you watch the movie you come to know they are in Punjabi for a reason.Technically movie is stunning...cinematography is awesome and so is choreography. Few may fill the movie is slow...but then understand love stories are not Action or thrillers where you want a fast paced narration. Love Stories do need their own time to move on.To conclude....this is not the last movie of Yash Chopra for me....through the future performances of Shahrukh Katrina and Anushka Yash Ji will talk to us....and with smile will say Main Yahan Hoon Yahan Hoon Yahan Hoon Yahan This movie is special in many ways...DON'T MISS IT".

It's a rather artistic anthology of mostly longform videos all of them rather smartly or creatively done.  Michael Jackson may be considered a freak these days but after all this was the man who gave us Thriller considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It.  With Moonwalker he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff incorporating claymation special effects live performance footage and even selfparody the Badder sequence. And for those wondering what Joe Pesci was doing there this video came out just a tad before he became a household name and was one of his most memorable appearances on film.  And IMHO I think the Smooth Criminal sequence the choreographed section beats anything else Michael Jackson did up to that point!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah Moonwalker I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan I grew up with his music Thriller was actually the first music video I ever saw apparently. Believe it or not there was a time where Michael Jackson was like a God to people a time where women fainted at the sight of him before really fainting before seeing the sight of him sorry Michael. But Moonwalker was what started to be a tribute to all of Michael's success of the time right when he released his famous Bad album that was record breaking was the first album to have 6 top ten singles. Michael is an incredible artist there is no doubt he writes sings dances but when it comes to acting or keeping a story straight with his audience not so much.We start off pretty simple Jackson's music life career success and the mania that was the 80's biggest star in the world Michael Jackson. Later on Jackson is a 30's style gangster who uses his powers as a crime figure to protect the children. When Jackson was allowed to be near children we cut to him playing in a field with the children and their dog. The dog runs away and in their search for it Jackson and the children uncover the lair of Mr. Big Frankie Lideo a drug dealing mobster with an army of henchmen who wants to get the entire populace of planet earth addicted to drugs starting with the children. Mr. Big discovers Jackson and the children but they escape Jackson tells the children to meet him at Club 30's which turns out to be a haunted nightclub abandoned since the 1930s. The story goes back to the mobsters attack on Jackson and here it is revealed that Jackson is actually a magical gangster who draws his power from shooting stars. As one passes by the club Jackson transforms into a sports car and mows down several of Mr. Big's henchmen. The story picks up on the children at Club 30's and at first the children are afraid but when Jackson appears the scary atmosphere of the club transforms and the children find themselves back in the 1930s. The club is now filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers. Jackson participates in a danceoff with the other club members which serves as the music video for Smooth Criminal. At the climax of the song Mr. Big lays siege to the club and kidnaps one of the children Katie. Jackson follows them back to Big's lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen. Mr. Big appears and mentally tortures Jackson by threatening to inject Katie with highly addictive narcotics. While Katie manages to just grab Joe Pesci's glasses and get free from being injected Mr. Big decides he's had enough and orders his men to kill Katie before finishing off Jackson but not before a shooting star flies by. Jackson transforms into a giant robot and kills all of Mr. Big's soldiers. Yup ummm you want more weirdness? Watch the movie.Moonwalker is fun for the first half hour seeing Michael's success and all his hard work really makes his fans appreciate him once again. Is it mostly to hype up his album? Yeah I love how he spends the first 25 minutes praising how awesome he is then we go to his song called Leave Me Alone which is kind of hypocritical not that it's not a great song just a small turn of events. Then when we skip the crummy acting the story was incredibly weak The villain spells his name out loud while Michael and Katie are spying on him lol Michael is a transformer all of a sudden the villain's big monster plan is to make kids high? Also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make Marvin the Martian blush. But if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for Smooth Criminal. This music video is perfection it's choreographing it's setting it's song it's smooth style Michael always goes above and beyond perfection and Smooth Criminal was incredible. I loved Moonwalker as a kid I still watch it for fun to this day but it's not the best movie by any means it's pretty silly but it's all good if you're a Michael Jackson fan as well.710".

Yeah I love how he spends the first 25 minutes praising how awesome he is then we go to his song called Leave Me Alone which is kind of hypocritical not that it's not a great song just a small turn of events. Then when we skip the crummy acting the story was incredibly weak The villain spells his name out loud while Michael and Katie are spying on him lol Michael is a transformer all of a sudden the villain's big monster plan is to make kids high? Also the villain has some sort of massive ray gun that would make Marvin the Martian blush. But if there is one new thing that is incredible that the movie gives us is the new video for Smooth Criminal. This music video is perfection it's choreographing it's setting it's song it's smooth style Michael always goes above and beyond perfection and Smooth Criminal was incredible. I loved Moonwalker as a kid I still watch it for fun to this day but it's not the best movie by any means it's pretty silly but it's all good if you're a Michael Jackson fan as well.710";

Beginning with sickly video set to 'Man in the Mirror' a montage listing his achievements and bits and bobs from his career it goes through all the highs of his life then crashes down into a really really entertaining segment which acts as a funny music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed Demon' following the adventures of MJ as he runs from manic stopmotion fans and finally dancing against a rabbit costume. The stop motion isn't that bad as some would have you believe. It's passable.Then we see the great video for 'Leave me alone' and straight into the main feature.Yes the plot is laughable. Very laughable. We see Michael walk out of a building then get shot at by thousands of troops. Then we hit flashback showing MJ and three children stumbling upon an underground lair. 'Mr Big' Joe Pesci is the nefarious villain who has a plan to get every child in the world hooked on 'drugs' no specifics are mentioned at an early age. MJ and the little girl he is with get caught then chased... yada yada yada. The plot isn't really the important part. We get two very cool sequences where MJ turns into a car then a robotspaceship thing and of course the amazing 'Smooth Criminal' sequence.It's a soso film but it is fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. It has most of his greatest hits and some cool little bits and some quite good special effects the RobotSpaceship sequence in particular Worth it especially seen as though you can pick it up for about a quid on ebay. It'll keep the kids quiet for a couple of hours as well as most 20 somethings who were kids when it was first released.".

	schema:headline " Selfindulgence as only Michael Jackson knows how";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1988 Michael Jackson was literally on top of the world. His 1987 album Bad had set a record for the most number one singles to come from the same album. Add to that the fact that his previous albums had all set records for sales to the extent that not even an organisation as powerful as the RIAA could withhold his rightful share of the money. To cut a long story short Jackson was the King of the musical world and even to an old cynic like myself who was raised on Black Sabbath it did not seem undeserving. So when Michael Jackson asked for more than twenty million dollars to make a series of fantasy viginettes based around his songs that basically portray him as the saviour of the world the last thing the combined powers of the MPAA and RIAA were willing to say was no. But then the 1990s hit and Michael Jackson's reputation in the world's consciousness changed from that of an eccentric billionaire to a worn out circus freak. Let that be a lesson to all budding musicians  if it can happen to Michael Jackson it can literally happen to anybody.It appears that Warner Brothers now own the rights to this rather odd piece so it has finally seen the light of day on DVDVideo. This time capsule of the late 1980s is as odd now as most of the rest of the Michael Jackson material that came after. As you can expect from a film that mostly consists of viginettes put together to the specifications of an eccentric millionaire unifying themes are hard to come by. The first thirtyfive or so minutes of the film is a quick recap of Jackson's career up to that point followed by what is essentially an extended pair of music videos that satirise the cannibalistic fascination the press had with Jackson in the 1980s. It is after this thirtyfive minutes that the material finds a real focus and in spite of the high bar set by the earlier material it manages to get even stranger than before.The plot of Moonwalker proper concerns itself with a nonspecific future world where we follow three children living in a dirty world of squalor. As a hit squad makes an attempt on the life of Jackson who is playing himself we get a flashback to happier times that ends in a weird explanation of why the world we see is now so dirty. Joe Pesci portrays an embodiment of evil by the name of Frankie Lideo whose ambition is to have every child in the world taking drugs. Given that Ritalin and such torture pills were still popular at the time Jackson's vanity project takes on a scary level of accuracy I doubt he intended. Of course the whole thing is just a transparent Just Say No message that gained Jackson a few points with the Reagan administration at the time and doubtlessly got the nod from Bush senior too. Not least because of Joe Pesci's immortally embarrassing line about how his troops have to stop them praying in school. I do not know whether Jackson or cowriter David Newman came up with this crock but it is a good thing Jackson ran out of favours with the Republican party during the 1990s. Otherwise who knows what kind of propaganda we would have to tolerate today?To be fair the new footage of the film is skilfully edited shot and choreographed. Being one of the few films shot with a 1.331 aspect ratio in mind it is surprising how dynamic some of the shots are. Joe Pesci chews the scenery like he was previously on a hunger strike while Paul Reubens gets a cameo as a voice and claymation puppet that will amuse the adults in the audience. The cinematography of the main event is actually quite tight. The special effects more than justify the budget. At the time the twentytwo million dollars used to make the film was consider extravagant even by Michael Jackson's standards. The claymation is far from seamless and some of the effects are dated but considering the advances in filmmaking technology since it does not look too shabby at all. Had Michael Jackson intended to make a coherent musical rather than a loose framework for music videos there is no telling what might have resulted.While RIAAendorsed music has only got worse since Michael Jackson's fall from the limelight it is somehow considered cool or hip to rag on the man and his music. I do not know the truth of all the allegations made about Jackson. I really think they are best left to those making them and the man himself. So when I see the film depicting him playing catch in a park with a small group of children I do not get the sense of alarm bells so many others describe. The video game based on this film is a whole other story but video games were considerably cruder in those days. The is a reason why Bad yielded no less than six number one singles from a track list of eleven no less. Jackson was at his creative apex both writing songs and conceiving music videos that neither he nor anyone else endorsed by the RIAA have matched since. The next time you hear someone try to tell you that creativity was dead in the 1980s this along with some videos from the likes of Devo will set them straight.When all is said and done I gave Moonwalker a five out of ten. It is as selfindulgent as you would expect from a man who could afford to light his cigarettes with hundred dollar bills. Much of it is unnecessary even crap but when it falls back upon its strengths namely the music it shines. This is the kind of time capsule that the culture of the 1980s really deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "With all this stuff going down at the moment with MJ i've started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched The Wiz and watched Moonwalker again. Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay.Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah Joe Pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates MJ's music.Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.Bottom line this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another which i think is most people. If not then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.".

Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah Joe Pesci's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates MJ's music.Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.Bottom line this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another which i think is most people. If not then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty? Well with all the attention i've gave this subject....hmmm well i don't know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact. He is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars. I hope he is not the latter.";

	schema:reviewBody "Besides from the seeing the new This Is It and saying Im a huge Michael Jackson fan I thought I would prove it and see a movie he actually did back in his time. Moonwalker breaks all rules laws and scripts in the film making history. It's completed in a phenomenal fashion all leading up to the highlight of the film. A triumph comicbook texture short entitled Smooth Criminal which Ill discuss later.Besides being subject to jokes and media we need to remember that back in the 80s everyone was into Michael Jackson. So having a movie on him titled by his dance that only a handful knew Moonwalker. The film is what you would call a montage of Jackson clips so Ill have to do separate paragraphs to sort these out so I don't do block writing entirely. Though I may combine some since some are very short.The movie opens with Michael Jackson singing Main In the Mirror at a live concert. He is covered in sweat and singing his heart out just to please his fans. Then it cuts to a kaleidoscopic view of MJ's career leading up till 1988. We see early clips of The Jacksons 5. From ABC to Beat It it's all there.Then we get a short clip of Bad entitled Badder. The kids are amazingly talented doing back flips front flips everything while lip syncing key point of the MJ song. It was sort of unnecessary having this on the tape seeing as I didn't want to see kids sing one of my favorite songs. Sure they were lip syncing but I would like to see my one of my favorite songs sung by the artist. Not pre Kidz Bop it up.Followed by my favorite of the film Speed Demon which is MJ being bombarded by his fans who are claymation figures. The scene is overall colorful and very upbeat. MJ acts natural as if he has done this before which he probably has. Overall this is the best thing on the tape so far.Leave Me Alone is a heartfelt crowdpleaser showing MJ dancing in front of a crowd announcing to everyone who can hear him to well leave him alone. It's a catchy tune that is definitely and underrated portion of the film.The next clip is the main course and the point of this whole film extravaganza. It is Michael Jackson playing a superhero trying to stop Mr. Big Joe Pesci from drugdealing crime boss with an army of henchmen. Michael Jackson at the same time is protecting Katie Zeke and Sean three homeless kids who spy on MJ. After escaping Mr. Big's clutches MJ goes into the club and begins dancing to Smooth Criminal while defeating Big's henchman. Thats all you can say without giving anything away. It is a real standout from the movie and the dance choreography is stunning. Michael is probably the at his most lively stage yet and not putting himself or dancers into any grueling treatment.Then the last two segments are minor though serve a purpose. Come Together isn't the greatest thing to come out of the tape. It is a little long but still not awful. Come Together is a song originally written and sung by The Beatles being sung by Jackson here. In my opinion it should have stayed sung by The Beatles.The Moon is Walking and the music video of Smooth Criminal closes this heartfelt film. My only complaint is that this movie is unsure of what it wants to be. First it wants to be a documentary then it wants to be a compilation of music videos and music clips. It jumps around and at points is confused. But for the most part Moonwalker is a sensational movie that is sure too please MJ's fans.".

I do not care if I get a sane scifi feature from this man but I do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing shriek yells cool crowd choreography and some bits of CGI and animation. There also should be a few uninterrupted videos. Everything I've mentioned is here. Stupid plot and overthetop vanity fair are not a problem when I witness Mr Michael Jackson in action. To me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos not king of pop which sounds moronic especially for us Russians because pop sounds like the Russian word for arses and MJ is definitely not king of arses. I can rewatch his best music videos which are artistically beautiful and I never get tired of them.My first impression of this film was What is this...? bits of different videos some drawn images unsettling jumps from one theme to another absence of any cohesive plot line some kids fooling around etc. but as I watched it till the end I could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on TV nowadays. What I like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily.Without Mr Michael Jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor. Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbole of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality. He knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles.When I see a proper DVD release with Mr Michael Jackson videos I know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release. HIStory I HIStory II and Moonwalker are all great though only Moonwalker is more like one movie with a solid Smooth Criminal theme paparazzi topic and a few weird spoofs and twists.Being no fan of MJ I can still give this film... like no other a solid 9 out of 10 I've been hit by Smooth Criminal for sure and my major complains are the following initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main MJ antidrug campaign should have been given more skyrocketing insanity and stress and there should have been more moonwalking itself of course.

The vignettes are good especially Speed Demon but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment in which Michael Jackson turns into a car a robot and finally a spaceship and it's just as weird as it sounds. Joe Pesci is hilarious and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout!The real gem however is the incredible Smooth Criminal video which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone!".

Typical concert movies are overly produced. The intimacy of this footage makes you feel not like you're in a concert but like you're witness to very private performances. You get to see first hand how involved this man was to every little detail of production and planning. There are no crowds of screaming and crying fans to have to sit through with the exception of a brief opening scene in which the auditioning dancers get a little too blubbery at times. This film easily reignited my appreciation for the man who was without a doubt one of the greatest entertainers of our time. Complete 180 for me I'll be the first to admit.

He seemed at ease and so happy and normal while on stage as if it was built to be his. You would never believe this was the ''freak'' that the world perceived him to be. Shame on those people. Genius at work a perfectionist down the smallest detail and I think the film has captured this very well. What I liked a lot was the fact that the film was not concentrating on his death and tradegy but solely on his concert his music and his geniality and it was a fitting tribute to one of the greatest musicians of our times.

I also expected to see Michael less weak than some of his others concerts but damn.. If you didn't know he was dead and saw him dance and sing like he does there is no way you could predict that he was about to die of illness. There was no way I wanted to pay for tickets to his concerts before this day but now I would pay 500 for seeing those concerts in London. Although that This is it was about the concerts the movie also consist a little sense of humor love and a insight to the worlds climate problems.A really great job with great cutting and editing.

When I heard he intended to take rehearsal footage of the This Is It tour and market it as a film I assumed it was an attempt to recoup the investment made in the project. Who could have guessed that this film would stand on its own and also enter the echelons of the best documentaries about rock music ever made? No less Michael Jackson reveals more about himself in this footage than we've ever seen before. It's his premiere moment on film and I would guess he would not have wanted it shown only because we seefor the first timeJackson without a mask. I won't attempt to characterize this complicated insanely talented person but basically he's painfully shy. And he excelled at one of the most public vocations there is performing.What's interesting about the footage is that it exists at all. But since concerts today use video projection for the large venues where they play it was natural to include the cameras during the rehearsal period. And it's riveting! Nothing is ever less than compelling in large part due to the level of talent in all quarters. The dancers the musicians the backup singers sets costumesit's a parade of the best of the best. While Jackson is the center of all of this if you don't care for him there's plenty of other things to look at and enjoy.Any sadness is brought by the viewer. There's not one nod to Jackson's demise or when it occurs. He looks thin but even in a rehearsal mode he's electrifying and I think that's why the film works. We're not at some huge arena for which the concert was conceived with 10000 screaming fans. And rather than missing that electricity we get intimate performances of familiar Jackson material. But it's reimagined and you never know what's coming next.An alert there is footage throughout the final credit sequence and after the credits end. And if you can see it in a DP theater...for the sound alone. An amazing experience!".

We're not at some huge arena for which the concert was conceived with 10000 screaming fans. And rather than missing that electricity we get intimate performances of familiar Jackson material. But it's reimagined and you never know what's coming next.An alert there is footage throughout the final credit sequence and after the credits end. And if you can see it in a DP theater...for the sound alone. An amazing experience!";

This is a mustsee for every MJ fan and even nonfans to understand why he was so popular and deserved every bit of the title King of the Pop. A consummate artist a perfectionist and a visionary. The film is overflowed with his energy passion and dedication. If the rehearsals could be this good and engaging one could only imagine what the concerts would've been. His voice sometimes showed his age but his dance moves were not at all. Also the young female guitarist was not just good looking but crazily good with the guitar as well. Smooth Criminal segment is probably my favorite but they're all very excellent. I don't feel the film is exploiting his death in any way. It's simply paying the tribute and gives fans something they deserve to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forget everything you think you know about Michael Jackson. Forget the scandals the surgeries the rumors the mysteries. Just accept that we're all innocent until proved guilty in America and let it all go. Michael Jackson was the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. This documentary shows that hours before his death he remained the greatest dancer in the history of mankind. He was a revelation pure and simple. And the greatest achievement in Kenny Ortega's simple elegant tribute is that it allows the viewer without a shred of distraction to witness the process of an artist. Sure some of the footage is a little amateurish as this was meant for Michael Jackson' records more than anything else. But that's the fun of it. The viewer gets to witness the raw nature of the artist rather than the glossy outcome that would have been the final product. If you're concerned that the film will be an act of gross exploitation and an attempt to squeeze every last dime in the wake of Michael Jackson's death know this I haven't the slightest doubt that Michael would have wanted his fans to see this footage. Of course it's exploitive don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise but so what All documentaries are exploitive to some degree and tasteful exploitation is better than tasteless exploitation. This is a film about the process nothing more. We're just lucky that this process happens to revolve around the finest entertainer of our time. If you're even the slightest fan this is a must see. If you're not I dare you not to be won over. Also if you're looking for signs of fatigue from Michael Jackson you will be disappointed. In fact if there's one thing that bothered me about the film it's that Michael was in such terrific shape that it's angering to think he died so close to the finish line. We don't have many great entertainers left in the world. And the fact that at 50 years of age operating at about 80 energy wise Michael blows the top 10 pop singers of today out of the sky is rather remarkable.

Every single person in the theatre was singing along and clapping for and after every song. I was over the moon with the recreation of the Jackson Five seeing as The Love You Save is a touching one for me. The real fun came with the especially theatrical numbers that were Thriller and Smooth Criminal both had me in fits of happiness. Then after a dramatic and heart touching rendition of Earth Song Man In The Mirror drew the whole show to its close emanating love and Michael's passion for people to make a change.I saw not one single thing in my opinion wrong with this film and I believe everyone will enjoy it.

	schema:headline " The Exposed Life the Spatial Logic";
	schema:reviewBody "Film is such an ordinary business in many respects that when something unique comes along it takes on an importance on that fact alone.Whatever you think of the music he was a person manufactured to exist only in the media marketplace uncomfortable and profoundly unsuccessful at a human scale. He like some other performers I suppose can only live can only actually breath on a stage and then only if it is bigger and more dynamic than any ever created. If I had seen the show I would likely have left crying about the huge waste of resources the fantastic color budget there only to suspend a shaky being and the shakier admiration we grew to need.The form of the film is set up to keep us from reminding ourselves that we are not seeing a concert. Instead we are seeing stuff that would have been culled for a terse making of DVD extra one focused on how the most expensive and elaborate stage show in history was put together. Jackson would never have allowed us to see him as a human never allowed us to see him not trying hard. He would have hidden what he knew to be his great weaknesses  that he was never allowed to develop a mind a means of articulation any semblance of connection to the world outside his craft. If it were possible for him to know about this it would be a hell for him knowing that we can see him as he is not as he invented the imageHe knows music and movement at an intuitive level perhaps qualifying as genius but he cannot speak more than four words that are genuine even when it comes to the music. He is a master showman but unable to imagine anything at all instead only see what others have done for him and intuit how it needs to bend to fit him in. There are sequences here that you can see someone was clever with for instance a sequence which would have him composited into old movies. He is terminally uncomfortable in this and one can imagine the angst of identity he carried home and which had to be drugged away. The man shown here as his trusted collaborator credited as director was who killed Jackson by shifting the only world he knew.The performances themselves are remarkable. The singing is unrewarding he tells us repeatedly that he isn't really using his voice that he is preparing to warm up knowing that physical stress was coming. We don't notice it much because we know the songs so well and what we hear has been supplemented dishonestly. But the dancing IS rewarding. The backup dancers are rewarding in the usual way they are the best in the world possibly  given advances in the science of training  the best ever assembled. Each time we see them they are working hard as if their lives depended on it. In terms of narrative the film is about them and to a lesser extent the backup musicians. We see the tryouts and the announcements of the winners. We see some truly extraordinary people here. This is where the energy comes from.Jackson's dancing is remarkable as well but for different reasons. He reinvented stage dance. He is as influential as Astair more because his visual style transformed music into a video art a transitional metamedia where it stands today. We may be even more familiar with his moves than his sounds. He lopes through the numbers. It isn't fair to expect him to be good. His body is in pain joints are taped up to allow even what we see.But what we see even if it lacks energy is amazing. Jackson is important because he created himself and everything about himself. Even his ideas about love and peace are fabricated. But the invention face clothes music pseudofamily and all are physically situated. He has created it all in the context of the space around him and how he moves in it. Even the iconic moonwalk where physics seems denied indicates this. It is remarkable not only because he invented a self one that it is outrageous and comic in every detail but that it is coherent and has an inner logic. That inner logic is spatial a logic of movement. His soul invents itself first in movement and builds a self to occupy. This part alone makes the film amazing. Often in the film we see numbers from beginning to end that are assembled from different rehearsals. In some of these rehearsals it is clear that he has just arrived on the set that has been cooking for months. His stage choreography is made up on the spot. As the splices shift back and forth you can see that each time he is making up a different  sometimes wildly different  routine. He does so effortlessly. He does so automatically and with grace. But most remarkable is that it makes sense each time. It is a whole soul coherent and true visible. Visible to us conveying that sense that spatial logic.What an experience. It is sad that he had to suffer and die so this could come to us. If he had lived he would have made a big show. As it is we are allowed to see him in his own private show living in movement exposed.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	onyx:emotionText "Film is such an ordinary business in many respects that when something unique comes along it takes on an importance on that fact alone.Whatever you think of the music he was a person manufactured to exist only in the media marketplace uncomfortable and profoundly unsuccessful at a human scale. He like some other performers I suppose can only live can only actually breath on a stage and then only if it is bigger and more dynamic than any ever created. If I had seen the show I would likely have left crying about the huge waste of resources the fantastic color budget there only to suspend a shaky being and the shakier admiration we grew to need.The form of the film is set up to keep us from reminding ourselves that we are not seeing a concert. Instead we are seeing stuff that would have been culled for a terse making of DVD extra one focused on how the most expensive and elaborate stage show in history was put together. Jackson would never have allowed us to see him as a human never allowed us to see him not trying hard. He would have hidden what he knew to be his great weaknesses  that he was never allowed to develop a mind a means of articulation any semblance of connection to the world outside his craft. If it were possible for him to know about this it would be a hell for him knowing that we can see him as he is not as he invented the imageHe knows music and movement at an intuitive level perhaps qualifying as genius but he cannot speak more than four words that are genuine even when it comes to the music. He is a master showman but unable to imagine anything at all instead only see what others have done for him and intuit how it needs to bend to fit him in. There are sequences here that you can see someone was clever with for instance a sequence which would have him composited into old movies. He is terminally uncomfortable in this and one can imagine the angst of identity he carried home and which had to be drugged away. The man shown here as his trusted collaborator credited as director was who killed Jackson by shifting the only world he knew.The performances themselves are remarkable. The singing is unrewarding he tells us repeatedly that he isn't really using his voice that he is preparing to warm up knowing that physical stress was coming. We don't notice it much because we know the songs so well and what we hear has been supplemented dishonestly. But the dancing IS rewarding.

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't really planned to see this show today but a dental appointment was timed such that I ate lunch in a mall here in Bangkok and wandered by the multiplex upstairs after eating. The second showing of the day was to start in ten minutes so I bought a ticket. There had been advancebooking for the last couple of weeks with a chart showing the available seats for each show. A week ago the showings had two or three seats booked at best for any show. For the showing I attended there were twentyfive people in a five hundred seat house. I looked at a poster on my way in and realized this was the first day of release so this was a disappointing turnout.I don't know what material was available from the tapes of rehearsals but the film as a whole is often a bit of a patchwork quilt sometimes feeling somewhat like the pieces are a bit mismatched. In some numbers there are frequent cuts back and forth from at least three different occasions as shown by Michael wearing different wardrobe. Also adding to this effect is the fact that some shots were captured in highdefinition others in standard video which are intercut for the same songs. The audio on the other hand is pretty seamless and of high quality throughout. Sometimes a song sequence is interrupted to show a behind the scenes conference on how to proceed. Many songs are not included in their entirety apparently to allow for such background material to be included instead. Much of the show seemed like an extended making of extra to a main event.Again I do not know what material was available but if most songs were recorded in their entirety I think I would have preferred to see an attempt to show what the final concert would have been like without so many interruptions. If I had directed it I would have done a few minutes of the behind the show material first and then attempt a concert experience. For instance there is a sequence done in BW with MJ interacting in a crime movie facing a menacing Humphrey Bogart after watching Rita Hayworth sing. But this segment is interrupted multiple times with color shots done on stage some with the associated song some not. I was disappointed not to be able to see the way the BW segment would have played in concert. I am guessing it would have been in one continuous piece.As it is I can see where the concert would have been a real treat. I worked as a stage hand for a Jackson Five concert over thirtyseven years ago and it was well done but far less elaborate. Michael's voice and dancing still appeared to be in top form to me despite all the intervening years and the set design and lighting was elaborate and effective. Perhaps the show was edited as it is to allow us to see him as a perfectionist at work but someone who had rapport with his cast and crew. His interaction with the cute blonde lady guitarist is a highlight. He comes across as a normal down to earth person albeit one that is incredibly talented. I felt a little sad at times while watching this show because he seemed so vital and fit that it is still hard to accept that he is gone. Perhaps he really could have played fifty playdates in London without faltering. Considering how vigorous the numbers are this would have been another great achievement for him.".

Michael had inspired so many wither it was dancing singing wardrobe or just being a generous human. The thing that made Michael so special that many people don't realize why he was so special to so many how many years Michael had been performing. Since he was a child my grandparents my parents and my sister and I were fans. 3 generations as I'm sure many families feel the same.This Is It was supposed to be Michael's major comeback tour after years of hiding after all the child molestation trial drama. 50 sold out concerts in London I was so excited and hoping he was going to possibly come back to the states for another world tour and was even looking up how much the tickets were. Unfortunately Michael passed away just a few days away from performing.This Is It documents the rehearsal footage of his future concerts. Ranging from a wide variety of his mega hits from his newest song This Is It going back to his roots singing I Want You Back I'll Be There and State of Shock. Of course also performing all of the fan favorites from his Thriller Bad and Dangerous Albums as well. Watching this movie got me teary eyed as well as others in the theater when he performed both Human Nature and I'll Be There he still had his wonderful voice giving his all. Michael was an absolute perfectionist and his shows in this documentary as other describe how he knows his tune and his years of experience has helped them grow.Also having little commentaries with the musicians and dancers everyone so excited to work with Michael. You could tell this was the cherry on top of the sundae for them working with one of the world's greatest entertainers. The girl who was rocking out on the lead guitar was beyond awesome my sister and I had our jaws dropped on how she just tickled those strings making those incredible sounds come out. The dancers were also just wonderful and had such energy and pr essence and would've done a terrific job.All I can say is that This Is It would have been the ultimate concert. Michael really went all out for this concert with mini movies introducing his songs. He had a little Chicago gangsters clip with Humphrey Bogart and other gangsters chasing after Michael. Thriller was also such a show with the dancers rising from their graves and their costumes were awesome! Michael also did a very touching performance of Earth Song that would make anyone want to look at our Earth and want to make a difference.To sum this up this was a gift to Michael Jackson fans and was incredible to watch. Even if you're not a MJ fan like my boyfriend is you'll still enjoy it he was impressed on how dedicated everyone was and loved the music. This Is It should not be missed!1010".

His natural charisma and talent is unparalleled his body a rhythmic treasure. Every 360 spin every whiplash hand movement every grab of the crotch every nod of the head iconic hypnotic actions that are given an instant gravitas by Michael. Watching him dance and glide across the stage floor is akin to seeing Michael Jordan slam dunk or Marlon Brando act  you absolutely know that nobody will ever be able to do what they do to the same magical level. And these are only rehearsals.As for the tour itself it was so close to kicking off that we are lucky enough to see all the other elements it had to offer. A superb prefilmed sequence that has MJ superimposed onto film with Humphrey Bogart ends in a machine gun fight which is a delight to see its noirish atmosphere perfect for 'Smooth Criminal'  one of the best dance sequences on offer. Also prefilmed intended to be in 3D is the ghoulish and ghastly 'Thriller' segment a funfilled lead up to Michael and co doing the uberfamous Thriller boogie. However for a solo dance performance from MJ himself nothing can beat his electric standalone routine for 'Billie Jean' the backup dancers and technical crew present stare on profoundly awestruck  as will you.The documentary itself doesn't have much to do. Director Kenny Ortega creative director of the tour and a close friend to Michael knows that all we want to see is the man at work and he capably delivers. Ortega plays the music in an appropriate order ensuring there is a meaningful narrative to the proceedings but is thankfully never forceful in sentiment. Allowing the lengthy rehearsal sequences to play out complete with MJ feedback and chatter there is an added poignancy here that goes a long way to showing the world what was really lost on 25 June 2009. Not only an iconic sometimes controversial entertainer who was often viewed through a cynical lens but a genuinely affecting human being.With only a limited two week run at cinemas around the world I suggest you book tickets now to see this freakish talent in action.

	schema:reviewBody "I am not one to watch concert videos. I am not sure I've even sat through an entire concert video and I still can say I haven't because I just couldn't make it through Michael Jackson's successful This Is It. I watched almost the entire thing before I gave up. I love Michael Jackson's music as much as the next person. I grew up with him one of my favourite anthologies was the History album and I was shocked about his death as well. I suppose with all that and the hype that was and is Michael Jackson my expectations of his final concertfilm were reasonably high. What I expected was some of his greatest music mixed with his charismatic and brilliant stage presence musical genius and a majority of behind the scenes footage we have never seen or could never see and that is where This Is It hits a brick wall. It hyped itself as 'behind the scenes' Michael's last days and there is virtually none of that. The scenes are the most mundane pointless moments in putting together this concert. The music is a mish mash of various moments in his career but nothing really moves you or shows you anything that really makes you want to see more.It bodes well for the people who put together Michael Jackson's last concert that they hired a legitimate director like Kenny Ortega. Ortega's credits include a host of TV Shows and Disney musicals and I would have hoped he could have put together something with more than just clips and short snippets of music and more of a story. I guess I just wanted something that really just paid the ultimate homage to a man who is truly a musical legend. I wanted to be moved by his music the way he has always done but for me This Is It was a total dud and did none of that. At the same time this is strictly my personal opinion of the film because I know many fans and concert lovers adore this movie or at the very least enjoyed it so maybe I'm not the right person to review this. I score a 2 because it did so well and many love the film so they must have done something right. However if you're like me and not a huge concert video person you might wanna steer clear and simply watch Youtube videos of Michael Jackson because then you can put together your own homage to the King of Pop. 210".

There were two documentary films made about Elvis which quite frankly do not hold a candle to This Is It in style scope editing and footage. This Is It is a wonderfully brilliant homage to Michael Jackson. Granted it was done more for his own record and not the viewing public but thank God the powers to be decided to release it. I can only sympathize with MJ fans when they lost their idol having gone through it 33 years earlier but they have a wonderful film to remember him by. I went to see it because I quite like his music like Elvis he had a God given talent and I love dancing and I came out of the theater blown away by his professionalism hard work and attention to detail. From beginning to end I was enthralled by the dancing numbers Smooth Criminal rehearsals being my favorite and the music. Fan or not you can view this movie and appreciate his talent and he had it in spades. There is enough dance footage in this movie to satisfy dance fans and for Michael Jackson fans there is more than enough to keep them satisfied. I came out of the cinema appreciating Michael Jackson much more than before I went in. I mourn the loss of his early demise and the talent that surely robbed the world of future projects. If the concerts in London had ever gone ahead they would have been outstanding no doubt about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Almost everyone around me is against seeing this movie. They only know what the media has fed them about Michael Jackson and don't want to just jump on the bandwagon now that he has died. I was scared to see this movie because I felt was contributing to Sony's profit off his death. Of course I had to see it anyways because I needed closure. The first thing I noticed is how normal he looked in the footage. From what the media presented to us I was expecting to see a frail  weak Michael Jackson on stage. I was shocked at how well he moved how good he sang and how normal his face looked. He blew me and everyone away in the theatre I couldn't stop singing and dancing in my seat.. to me this movie was a celebration and victory for Micheal Jackson. Many people will look at it differently and focus on his appearance but if you look past it you will see his beautiful soul and relentless talent that is and always was Michael Jackson. I think that everyone who ever doubted him should see this movie and you will find that you have been lied to by the media. What I take most importantly from the footage was that he was not only going to give possibly the greatest performance the world would ever see.. but also he was going to use this show to express his love for the world and inspire people. After everything that he has been through in his life... the world turned against him and the media used the one thing he loved the most children to destroy him and we sat back and watched it happen. Why would he still care about the world after everything he had been through... I think because he stayed true to who he was from the beginning he never let the evil of the world change his heart. This is a true victory to me. I wont allow myself to focus on his death and possible murder because then I will remember his story as a tragedy and that's what the media wants us to do. Focus on a tragic icon who rose to the very top and came crashing down.. that's what sells. This is not the true story of Micheal Jackson if you watch the movie  the Jackson  an American dream  this is it you will see that he overcame the struggles of his life and got back on the stage to perform his heart out because they didn't break him. This is how I will remember his story.I want to point out some issues about the many pictures we saw of Michael before he died. As I photographer I know that we can easily manipulate the way a person looks through professional programs and make it look very real.. I used to wonder myself why he would wear the masks. Think about it.. thousands of photographers who were paid millions of dollars were always trying to catch a picture of him and they would manipulate his features and exaggerate them to make him look like a freak. By covering his face they couldn't do that anymore... so the media turned it and used it to make him look even more weird. Of course none of us normal people walk around with masks like that so we think it looks weird but we don't live like Michael Jackson in a world so secluded from having a normal life.. the media and fans made it impossible for him to ever be normal. So why did we compare him by our own standards. I can point my finger at everyone else and say look at what they did to Michael Jackson but I am guilty of never really looking into things while he was alive. I always loved his music and what it stood for but I was ashamed so I would say  I don't care for his personal like but his music is amazing and no one would dispute. No to say that I believed what the media presented about him but I never took the time to educate myself and stand up against all the garbage. I will learn from this and teach my children one day to stay away from gossip and especially the media.. and learn about person before you judge them. Most important I will teach them about the story of Michael Jackson and how he inspired me to be better person.".

I saw this movie with no expectations thinking that it was just a way for the studios and his family to make money that it would be just a bunch of interviews and clips hastily thrown together to cash in while MJ was still in people's mind. It was not. The movie documents the months of hard work Jackson and the crew put in to prepare for the London concerts. In light of the amount drugs that Jackson had been on and his poor health for him to be so alert to dance so well and to work so hard is mindboggling. Throughout the movie Jackson oversees the minutest details  slightly changing the beat on the piano refining cues and positions. While I liked Michael Jackson's music in the past my respect for him was tempered by his freakiness and many controversies. But after watching this movie I have a whole new respect for him. You can see the talent oozing out of him. He knows his music intimately and works so professionally with his crew. He's famously eccentric but he's also an extremely nice guy who was always courteous with his staff. I really regret not seeing Jackson's live shows in the past and am saddened that the world lost such an extraordinary talent. His songs have held up well after more than 30 years and as one commentator noted at the age of 50 he still blows all the top 10 pop singers out of the sky. I'm really surprised that the movie only got 7.9 million at the US box office but I expect its sales to grow people who have watched the movie say great things about it. In China as well the theater where I saw the movie was only about a quarter full although I do live the outskirts of town... Watch this movie and be amazed.".

I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall yes even more than Star Wars. And today many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks let's get something straight  you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow flying. Iceberg right ahead! The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music which has also been a victim of the film's success was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess I am a Titanic buff. As such I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it  in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could Open up your hearts to Titanic and you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1997 do I remember that year Clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of Princess Diana the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls I was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14 a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK I know that's silly to say but I did rewatch the film. Being completely honest here Titanic is a great movie it delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean dated the day the Titanic sank. 101yearold Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912 the upperclass 17yearold Rose boards the ship with her controlling fianc Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a firstclass formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing music and beer in thirdclass. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting amazing effects beautiful costumes outstanding sets a wellwritten story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron the extreme perfectionist that he is went over time and money budgets for Titanic but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream I'm king of the world! at the Oscars because this movie blew everyone out of the waterno pun intended you know what? I'm going to admit it I love Titanic even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing be true to yourself don't follow the crowd lovers or haters if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.1010".

Kate Winslet was good Kathy Bates was perfect Leo was ok I'll give you people that  I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries Romeo  Juliet.  But ultimately the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing drowning people he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed broke my heart  i cried the most right there at that point he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

	schema:headline " A Superb Epic";
	schema:reviewBody "I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards  even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. It was so great she said. You really felt like you were on the ship. Nonsense I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested. Well maybe thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. OK I thought I'll give it a look see. I didn't want to like it  and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First  the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it you really do feel it. Then  the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack are excellent  Winslet's being the superior I thought but both were good. They had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t I thought. In my opinion though stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then  the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic but I have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive indeed. Then  the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of My Heart Goes On.Problems. Well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. I know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while. The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed I thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where I think it would have been so much more impressive.910".

	onyx:emotionText "I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards  even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. It was so great she said. You really felt like you were on the ship. Nonsense I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested. Well maybe thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. OK I thought I'll give it a look see. I didn't want to like it  and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First  the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it you really do feel it. Then  the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack are excellent  Winslet's being the superior I thought but both were good. They had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t I thought. In my opinion though stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then  the details.

I saw this a lot when I was growing up this was one of the films of my childhood it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember' but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars James Cameron's romanticdisaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar' and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success it is simply perfect too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version.

	schema:headline " Triumph in Tradgedy Titanic";
	schema:reviewBody "Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane. Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the Titanic which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic Rose DeWitt Bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this the scene shifts to Southhampton Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose Jack Cal and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown Captain Edward Smith the ship designer Thomas Andrew the White Star Line Representative Bruce Ismay and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations.  In addition Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'.  Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship John Jacob Astor who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director James Cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic.  Like most history novels we know the ending but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I find it so amazing that even after all these years we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhyped...well we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that! lol  You see it's not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic everyone was in awe.  Let's face it a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once not twice but maybe 3 times and more!  So I really wouldn't say that this movie was overhyped...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being overhyped.  ha!  Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally I LOVE this film.  However this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!    I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.  It's not thier best work I've seen much BETTER work from both of them but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!".

Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhyped...well we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that! lol  You see it's not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic everyone was in awe.  Let's face it a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!

For a start Kate's Rose would certainly not have done two things she does in the film as quickly as she did Obviously thousands of teenage girls seeing the film in 1997 would disagree with my views.

James Horner's best selling score is really quite poor and only occasionally brings the emotion it should do. Performances are generally excellent and sometimes succeed in overcoming some thin characterisation such as Billy Zane as Rose's fiancewho even has to suffer with far too much eye make up!Overall Titanic is still worth seeingand sometimes it really does hit the heights that it should.

	schema:headline " Come on admit it. This is a great film!";
	schema:reviewBody "When you have a film this big and successful it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...Jim Cameron didn't need to create this hugescale heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the moviegoing world though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history 911 Pearl Harbor etc. Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail this film is without peer.The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a worldclass actor but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown is always likeable and the rest of the cast mostly Brits does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguardenforcer.   As far as the special effects go it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better.

When you've got nothing you've got nothing to lose! or You seem like kind of an indoor girl are two examples. Also the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today's economy would go for 80000! These were some RICH people and they wouldn't have let a guy like Dawson near them.Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It's not that bad.This film is tragic exciting sensual pretentious corny extravagant and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!5 of 5 stars.So sayeth the Hound.".

	onyx:emotionText "When you have a film this big and successful it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...Jim Cameron didn't need to create this hugescale heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the moviegoing world though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history 911 Pearl Harbor etc. Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail this film is without peer.The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a worldclass actor but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown is always likeable and the rest of the cast mostly Brits does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguardenforcer.   As far as the special effects go it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of shoot and edit the last hour of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "The tragedy of the doomed ship Titanic has inspired many books and movies. The battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination. The latest film concerning this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker James Cameron. The story of Titanic involves two fictional characters Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet from different backgrounds one is a hoboartist the other is an aristocrat and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.First of all although using a historical name this movie had little regard to history. The plot was built around two fictional lovers French diamond and treasure hunters. The deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background. Many historical facts were simply forgotten. Where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? Why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the Titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? Omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy. And what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.The overall plot was rather shallow rich equals greed and corruption poverty equals compassion and heroism. It is very ironic to spend 200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts. There was absolutely no human side shown in antiheroes. It seemed like Billy Zane was playing a part of the devil. Casting was also very poor. If DiCaprio was 2 inches shorter than Winslet you could swear she was his babysitter. The length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours. First hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse. Hearing corny pick up lines such as I see you and This is my side of the ship generated more pain than the screams of drowning people. Also jokes were too abundant and rather lame.Titanic did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original. The best thing about this film were its special effects and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.Although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense the public could not resist a sentimental story starring Romeo DiCaprio and so the movie became a success. Now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture so it seems that Titanic did achieve something after all.".

Shortly after the epic started they started to get restless some of them left asking the others  call us when the iceberg appears Over an hour and a half into the movie only the two girls who had seen the movie before were still there. They started shouting iceberg iceberg. A stampede followed they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed emitting Ohs and far outs. So just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho for instance had a similar running time but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In Titanic Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the supposedly creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends. The film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so what do I know?".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of the negative comments posted below seem to be from people who either just don't like musicals or who are unaware that all the cliches in this movie were essentially invented by 42nd Street. It's sort of like complaining that Shakespeare is full of quotations. This movie is absolutely brilliant which is why it's been imitated endlessly for the last seven decades.Sure Keeler's not the endall of tap dancing but she fits the bill as an ingnue and is generally amiable and perky. The plot is predictable but only because we've seen it duplicated so often. If you hadn't seen the same sort of thing a million times you'd notice that it's tightly assembled and even somewhat suspenseful. The show is full of firstrate comic asides even if some of the material is dated by obsolete slang and contemporary pop culture references.And do people still take the trouble to complain that Busby Berkeley's dance numbers couldn't have been seen properly by the audience in the theater? That's like complaining that an ape couldn't really grow to be as large as King Kong. The whole point is that it's a movie and Berkeley is able to do things that can't happen in the real world. Hence the transformation of background settings while the camera is close up on an actress's face. There isn't even such a thing as a closeup in a stage production. Carping that a '30's musical isn't realistic enough is like complaining that Venus couldn't actually have been born out of a clamshell.In any case this is one of the great '30s musicals... and one of the great Hollywood movies of all time. If you don't like the genre then so be it. It always amazes me that so many film fans strongly prefer Singin' in the Rain to such predecessors as 42nd Street Dames Top Hat Swing Time etc. when Singin' in the Rain is simply an homage to the '30s musical and generates quite little fresh material of its own. Mind you it's a brilliantly executed homage and it arguably benefits from its overt tongueincheek attitude but I can't help thinking many are simply swayed by the fact that it's in color really good Technicolor and has clearer sound quality than its '30s predecessors. Either way you need to see and appreciate the original movie musicals before you can really understand what Singin' in the Rain was about... just as you should see some Hong Kong action flicks and blacksploitation films to get what's going on in Pulp Fiction.But I digress. See 42nd Street and try to keep an open mind. Just because it's old is not a reason to assume that the people who made it didn't know their business extremely well.".

	onyx:emotionText "Most of the negative comments posted below seem to be from people who either just don't like musicals or who are unaware that all the cliches in this movie were essentially invented by 42nd Street. It's sort of like complaining that Shakespeare is full of quotations. This movie is absolutely brilliant which is why it's been imitated endlessly for the last seven decades.Sure Keeler's not the endall of tap dancing but she fits the bill as an ingnue and is generally amiable and perky. The plot is predictable but only because we've seen it duplicated so often. If you hadn't seen the same sort of thing a million times you'd notice that it's tightly assembled and even somewhat suspenseful. The show is full of firstrate comic asides even if some of the material is dated by obsolete slang and contemporary pop culture references.And do people still take the trouble to complain that Busby Berkeley's dance numbers couldn't have been seen properly by the audience in the theater?

	schema:headline " A steamy erotic musical of the 1930's.";
	schema:reviewBody "Do you find the musicals of the 40's and 50's pristine sterile and virginal in the extreme?  And based on this unhappy discovery you've decided that you don't like musicals.  Please do not distress yourself and allow me to introduce you to the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930's starting with 42nd Street the best of them all.Like nearly all the musicals of its time 42nd Street is a depressionera back stage musical which focuses on the grueling hours that have to be put in by the singers and dancers day after day in preparation of opening night. The film has a fine cast with lovely Bebe Daniels as Dorothy Brock Ruby Keeler Dick Powell Ginger Rogers George Brent and Warner Baxter who chews the scenery in every scene he's in as the stage director of 'Pretty Lady'.What separates films like 42nd Street from the musicals of the 40's and 50's is the daring camera work of dance director Busby Berkeley.  Berkeley loves his chorus girls and he has no qualms about aiming his camera up their dresses at every opportunity.  One of the sexiest moments in the film comes when the girls try out for the chorus in their street clothes.  Each girl of course is dressed differently from the others with a different hat love those cute 30's hats dress and highheel shoes.  This variety makes them look hotter than when they're all wearing the same chorus outfit.  When they have to show their legs in the hopes of being chosen  Berkeley gets his camera down low and gives you a birds eye view of each girl's legs ... first a front view than they turn and let you get a good look at their calves.  It is a very erotic scene.  Later when the girls leave their dressing rooms and are coming down the stairs for opening night Berkeley puts his camera under the stairs and shoots up their dresses as they pass. Again when the girls emerge from backstage and highkick out for the opening number Berkeley has his camera down low at a 45 degree angle aiming right up the chute of the costumes of the first few girls to dance out on stage.  Further along all the chorus girls form an arc in one number with their legs wide open and Berkeley tracks right thru their legs all the way around the circle.  You can even see the last girl has a gold ankle bracelet on her left ankle.  Once the production code was strictly enforced after 1934 shots like this were never seen again.42nd Street has three great songs You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me Shuffle Off To Buffalo and of course 42nd Street.  There have been many revivals of 42nd Street and they often include the best numbers of other films along with the three I mentioned including Dames from the film of the same name Go Into Your Dance a terrific number and Lullaby of Broadway which is the highlight number from GoldDiggers of 1935 which has a spectacular tap dance sequence with 100 chorus girls wearing gorgeous sheer black skirts as part of their chorus outfits.  If musicals often leave you cold and you haven't given 42nd Street a try than I suggest that you do so ... and sit close to the television set.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit the reason I purchased this movie was all because of a CD I bought that had Ruby Keeler singing 42nd Street on it.  But I also must admit that my purchase was not a waste of my money in the least!!!!I adore this film.  It's the quintessential Depressionera Busby Berkley musical that usually starred either Ruby Keeler Joan Blondell Dick Powell Jimmy Cagney and featured a young Ginger Rogers.Let me begin by saying that especially for the time period this actually happens to be a rather risque little musical... from Ginger Rogers' character actually having the name Anytime Annie to the little scene occuring on the train when Ruby Keeler extends her arm to have her shoes shined.  But I'm not writing to focus on that.Warner Baxter gives a tremendous performance as Julian Marsh the director whose life and financial security hang in the balance with the opening of his new musical Pretty Lady.  His last scene in the film is especially powerful and at the same time very depressing.  George Brent is grand as Pat the man deeply in love with the star of Pretty Lady Dorothy Brock. Also a young Dick Powell shines as the juvenille of the show Billy Lawler who happens to be in love with a doeeyed chorus girl by the name of Peggy Sawyer.  Boy can he sing!!  Bebe Daniels is gorgeous as Dorothy Brock the star of the show who is having trouble maintaining a balance between her Sugar Daddy Abner and the love of her life Pat Denning.  She has such a fantastic talent as an actress and singer and is one of those true 30s beauties.  And look at that wardrobe!  One thing I also noticed about Daniels... she's a TERRIFIC crier.  Then you have Ruby Keeler aka the former Mrs. Al Jolson playing chorusgirlturnedovernightstar Peggy Sawyer.  Ruby Keeler is absolutely adorable with her petite frame lovely large eyes and fresh face.  She makes the song 42nd Street her own and her dancing is FANTASTIC!!!!  I have read many comments where people said she couldn't dance and looked like a clunky cow... but let's take a few things into consideration.  First of all she was playing a kid who by luck got into a huge musical production.  Her dances had been choreographed to make her seem insanely talented but at the same time a little awkward. Second of all Ruby Keeler had a style all her own.  Her taps weren't the light airy taps of say Fred Astaire but they were much more earthy. And by this I mean no disrespect to Astaire as he is one of my favorite actors!  Her taps weren't light brushes on the floor they were pounded deep into it.  Her singing is so cheerful and so lilting... her ingenue image paved the way for other similar ingenues such as Debbie Reynolds' Kathy Selden in Singin' in the Rain.  But upon viewing this there are two characters that stick in your mind Lorraine and Anytime Annie superbly played by Una Merkel and Ginger Rogers.  They're so hilarious  absolute riots!  They could not have found a better pair to spark off of each other as wisecracking friends Lorraine who is shall we say stuck on Andy Gotta love the platinum blonde hair on Una!  She's such a fantastic character actress. and Ann who aside from her obvious permiscuous ways does a great British accent love Ginger's random monacle! and is quite humorous when loaded.All in all coming from a diehard musical fan I give this movie a definite 1010!!!!  Watch it and I promise you'll agree.".

A back stage story that sets the standard for all those unknown becomes overnight star films. The weakest part of it all is Ruby Keeler and I apologize in advance to all of her fans and there are many. She was an Irish Step Dancer which does not come across very well in film. Step dancers concentrate on their feet only and upper body movement is not a consideration. This makes the dancer appear as heavy footed and clumsy. Plus she wasn't a very good actress and didn't sing very well either. But she was as cute as a button with those big eyes and innocent faceso all is forgiven.Warner Baxter gives the best performance of his career as the driven director who verges on madness. Dick Powell is delightful as the juvenile many who only know him from his later films are not aware that he had a beautiful tenor voice and made his first splash in films as a singer and light comedian. Ginger Rogers is perfect as the slightly dishonorable chorus girl with the sugar daddy and Una Merkle playing Ginger's pal is surprisingly cute. Bebe Daniels is beautiful as the star of the play and does a great rendition of You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me. The rest of the supporting cast is right on target...with some good support from Ned Sparks Guy Kibbee and the ubiquitous George E. Stone.A lot got by the censors in this film to the delight of the audience....things were tightened up the next year as the Hayes Office started cracking down.

This film also served as a springboard to stardom for Dick Powell Ruby Keeler and Ginger Rogers. Warner Baxter stars as the dyspeptic director who harangues his cast into making a great show. Bebe Daniels is his star who is seeing an old boyfriend George Brent while stringing along rube producer Guy Kibbee. Ruby Keeler is the newcomer who has eyes for the show's juvenile Dick Powell and who is befriended by old hands Ginger Rogers and Una Merkel. Toss in Ned Sparks Allen Jenkins George E. Stone Louise Beavers Charles Lane Lyle Talbot Henry B. Walthall and the day's top chorus girl Toby Wing. Great musical numbers boast the singing talents of Powell and the dancing talents of Keeler. Bebe Daniels also has a great number in You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me. And Rogers does NOT make a mistake during the Shuffle Off to Buffalo number. She starts to say belly but changes it to tummy. It's part of the show folks! Belly was considered to be a vulgar term in 1933 her use of the word shows her character. It's not a mistake. But it is odd that Keeler stars in this number with Clarence Nordstrom rather than Dick Powell. Other songs include Young and Healthy and the superb 42nd Street. The best and oft repeated line belongs to Daniels speaking to Keeler Now go out there and be so swell . that you'll make me hate you! This line is also said by Glenda Jackson to Twiggy in 1971's The Boy Friend.".

Wing is so luminous in her spotlight number it's hard to believe she never broke it wide open like other former chorus gals Paulette Godard Betty Grable and Lucille Ball.George Brent the blandest of Warners' leading men is hopelessly miscast as Daniels' old vaudeville companion but he plays well against Ruby Keeler and Daniels.

	schema:reviewBody "I seem to recall readinghearing somewhere that movie musicals were becoming less popular in the 1930s. They were for the most part creaky messes with poor sound quality. Then came this movie which you can credit or blame depending on whether you like musicals or not for popularizing them. The story has been done before now 2004 and was probably done before in 1933. Prima donna gets injured the ingenue must take her place. All the clichs come out in full force but with enough enthusiasm that you may find yourself sucked in depending on how jaded a viewer you are. The performances are good. Daniels is stunning and a good actress and she can sing. We don't get to see her dance too much though. Powell makes a good juvenile lead and sings well. Keeler gets a bit annoying but that's probably just the character she is playing. She cannot really sing and I never thought her dancing was that great. I'm a fan of Ginger Rogers though so I am biased when I wonder how this movie could have catapulted Keeler and Powell to stardom while Rogers had to wait until she was paired with Astaire for her career to take off. After seeing movies starring the likes of Astaire Rogers Eleanor Powell Ann Miller Gene Kelly etc. I find Keeler's dancing to be a bit heavyfooted. Not that it is terrible she does pull the part off well enough. The Busby Berkeley choreography is fabulousno one did it like he did it. Just never you mind that if the show were actually on a stage the way it is supposed to be in the movie you wouldn't actually notice the aerial geometric patterns. Still it is nice to look at. So leave your sense of reality in the other room pop this movie in your VCRDVD player and enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "In reviewing one of the film versions of The Virginian I said that it was the prototype for all the westerns that were done where all the clichs started. The same can certainly be said for 42nd Street THE original backstage musical.It's also a film that couldn't be made but right in the middle of the Hoover Depression. Today's audiences can certainly appreciate the magic in the Busby Berkeley musical numbers but the economics of the situation can hardly be grasped. Many shows on Broadway opened and closed fast after the Stock Market crash of 1929 because no one could afford the price of a ticket. A whole lot of the wealthiest producer directors on Broadway from Florenz Ziegfeld on down lost plenty of money in that era.Warner Baxter's producer was such a man. He's lost his shirt in the market and he has to come up with a smash hit for his own economic survival. The cast and crew he assembles to put on the show Pretty Lady are all fighting for their survival. There are plenty of talented people out of work so none of them better mess up. Guy Kibbee is the sugar daddy and of course his price for financing the show is some kanoodling with star Bebe Daniels. Probably at that point in history his money gives him more power over everyone than would even normally be the case. You really hate Kibbee in this not because he's mean or vicious but why should such an obvious fool and oaf control the destiny of so many.Bebe of course has her problems a man who taught her the business but who she left behind in vaudeville while she hit the big time on Broadway. We never do see George Brent do any songs or snappy vaudeville patter but that's all right because he's believable as the happy go lucky hoofer who might have been big time if he had the breaks.And of course the youngsters Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler playing in their first film together. Powell has one big number Young and Healthy but it's on Keeler that the plot really turns.I suppose the real star of this film is Busby Berkeley who's vision of kaleidoscopic chorus girls came into real fruition here. The Depression story is dated but Berkeley's musical numbers Young and Healthy Shuffle Off to Buffalo and 42nd Street are eternal. That and all the clichs about putting on a Broadway show that became standard in films for generations.Baxter's driven producerdirector Daniels' egotistic star Brent's vaudeville hoofer Kibbee's moronic businessman backer and eager hopefuls Powell and Keeler became clichd characters in a dozen films any movie fan could name.But it all started here folks it all started with 42nd Street.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since the birth of talking pictures in 1927 and regardless of the studio or of the stars involved Hollywood had always struggled to 'hit the ground running' when it came to musicals.The early shambolic efforts by MGM became a Testament to the genre's awkwardness. In fact you only have to look a their all star Hollywood Revue of 1929 and in particular the cringe inducing twotone Technicolor scene of 'Singing in the Rain' with a whole host of the Alist stars hamming it up in raincoats to see that the movie musical was nearly a stillborn concept.In 1933 Warner Brother's became the first studio to successfully produce a musical that didn't leave people shifting uncomfortably in their theatre seats.The movie was 42nd Street directed by Lloyd Bacon. It was more a film about a musical than it was a musical film as all the singing  dancing take place within the context of the rehearsals and then later the actual show itself.At the height of the depression Broadway musicals were few and far between because put simply not many people had the money to finance them. Enter Abner Dillon Guy Kibee a Kiddie Car tycoon who after taking a shine to a famous Broadways Star Dorothy Brock Bebe Daniels agrees to finance a Broadway show called 'Pretty Lady' on the proviso of course that Brock is hired for the female lead. Brock on the other hand feels no romantic affiliation with Dillon in the slightest as she's really in love with her former vaudeville partner Pat Denning George Brent who's put his own career on hold to allows hers to flourish.Warner Baxter plays Julian Marsh the former Broadway big shot hired to direct the show who like most of his contemporaries is now near penniless after the Crash of '29 and signs on for the show just for the financial nest egg the success of the show will no doubt give him and is not about to let Denning's relationship with his leading lady ruin his plan by having Dillon's financial backing withdrawn.A chorus call is made and it is here we meet the rest of the cast and crew. Inexperienced chorus girl Peggy Sawyer Ruby Keeler arrives for her first audition and meets up with Juvenile singer Billy Lawler Dick Powell. Una Merkel  Ginger Rogers also appear playing two 'experienced' chorus girls who guide Sawyer through the initial auditions.After a drunken altercation the night before opening Brock breaks her ankle leaving her out of the show. And in an act of desperation. Marsh is coerced in making Peggy Sawyer his new Leading lady.The show itself is the real treat of this movie. With the very risqu 'Shuffle off to Buffalo' number with Keeler  Clarence Nordstrom in which Rogers  Merkel also get a chance to shine.Dick Powell is also given a great number in the form the wonderfully Busby Berkeley choreographed 'Young  Healthy' and the lucky dog gets to serenade a bevy of young starlets and boy could that guy SING! The title track is Keeler's shining hour and while she may not have been the best singer in the world she could certainly shake a shoe when shoe shaking was required. Perhaps this routine is a bit 'clunky' compared to the grace of Astaire but watch Keeler in the Shanghai 'Lil sequence in Footlight Parade with James Cagney made later that same year and you'll see the grace that Keeler could dance with.42nd street may not have had the most engaging of plot lines but it's the songs  dances that put the movie on a pedestal and it is the same song  dances that were to become the yardstick that all musicals for the next few years were to be measured by.'You're going out there a youngster but you've got to come back a star' These words proved quite Prophetic for Keeler because after 42nd Street Dick Powell  Ruby Keeler along with Busby Berkeley and his famous Kaleidoscope overhead shots became the staple of all Warner Brothers Musicals for the remainder of the 1930's.Ginger Rogers' tenure at Warner's was short lived and after a switch to RKO Studios later that year she starred in low budget musical call Flying Down To Rio. It took only one scene and once dance to make her a superstar. The dance The Carioca her partner Fred Astaire.Enjoy!".

It introduced the world to Busby Berkeley's wonderful kaleidoscope images of leggy chorine girls and we never looked back. The plot young chorus girl is plucked from oblivion to replace the temperamental female star is old hat now but this is where it all originated from. It probably made other studios like RKO consider doing musicals and look what RKO gave us...Fred  Ginger!So 42nd Street deserves a lot of credit for it's unique place in history. And it's an entertaining film to boot. So why do I prefer Gold Diggers of 1933? Well the later film moves faster seems to have much more energy has better musical numbers and actors. I was surprised at how the musical numbers were so bunched up in this film they seemed to all come at the end the showstopping finale when they could have been more spaced out. Yes the point of the finale is to finally reveal the show miraculously coming together but there's not enough heat in the first half at least for me.Ruby Keeler became a huge musical star after 42nd street. Oh Ruby. She was so cute and plucky and likable but Lord was she a bad actor and singer! Seen today her tapping is also quite average. I've read that buckdancing tap where movement below the waist was emphasised was the style of the time and that could account for little Ruby looking like a clopping horse. And when Ginger's wisecracking Anytime Annie Ginger was just crying out for a lead role then the girl stole every scene! insists to the producer that Peggy's the only chorine who can save the show I had to laugh. Luckuly Dick Powell who I like a lot was around to show the way. We also have George Brent and Bebe Daniels in the mix. Daniels was quite good but she just wasn't appealing to me.".

While it has more stock characters convenient plot turns and exaggerated performances than you could count it also has a very good production that establishes a believable and interesting atmosphere. It features some entertaining Busby Berkeley numbers and it moves smoothly at a good pace avoiding some of the drawbacks of many movies from the early sound era.The cast has an interesting assortment of performers ranging from solid to very good. Several of the performances are rather overdone but yet they all work pretty well together. Warner Baxter and a couple of other cast members make their characters almost cartoonish and yet you still feel as if you know the company and care about what happens to them.Some of this has to do with the lively variety entertainment. The catchy and memorable title number is the best but a couple of the others are pretty good too. Even when Ruby Keeler has difficulty doing justice to some of the material it is usually good enough in itself and Keeler is sympathetic enough to make you want to overlook it. The script likewise makes use of some clichs in the dialogue and in the plot developments yet it introduces some interesting characters and situations.Although it is fairly easy to point out some of the weaknesses it is also easy to see why 42nd Street became something of an icon among screen musicals. It is enjoyable to watch and it captures the backstage atmosphere in a way that few movies since have been able to do.".

The gowns are all knockouts and very carefully selected to accentuate the wearer. Not a single Hollywood star today can appear as glamorous as the ladies in this movie. The hairstyles makeup gowns all flowed together with a wonderfully innocent manner. It is not the same when you have a modern Hollywood star fully aware of who designed their gown. The innocence lends that little bit of accessory that you will only find in the thirties. I do not emotionally connect to thirties movies like I do to other decades particularly the forties. But this movie is a must see it has a lot of energy. It does not drag and the chorus is just visually a treat. The songs themselves are not memorable but the overall energy and effect is. The storyline is pretty light but the players are first rate. Bebe Daniels carries off her role perfectly and is very likable as well as gorgeous. Ruby Keeler wouldn't have been as good if she were any more talented pretty etc. It was the right balance.".

When looked at objectively the whole business seems pretty silly. Warner Baxter chews up the scenery. The Bebe DanielsGeorge Brent love affair is apparently the main subplot but certainly doesn't generate any sparks. Ruby Keeler couldn't act or sing the scene where Baxter is trying to get her to do both  a couple of hours before opening night! shows that quite clearly. She was a good tap dancer but certainly did not set the screen on fire as did Eleanor Powell in her best sequences. Would she have been there if she had not been Mrs. Al Jolson at the time? Dick Powell does show why he became a major star and not only in musicals. The most interesting part for me came when Berkeley did the Shuffle Off to Buffalo as it might reasonably have appeared on a stage then breaks out of those confines with the 42nd Street sequence the first of a series of many more inventive pseudostage numbers in his later films. But above allthe film has become iconic because of the numerous appearances of the you'll come out a star line in film anthologies. I gave this an 8 because of its historical standing but I've seldom had more difficulty in deciding on the appropriate rating.".

Warner Baxter is Julian Marsh a desperate hardpressed producer with melodramatically secret failing health. His star Dorothy Brock Bebe Daniels is in love with her old vaudeville partner Pat Denning George Brock but she's the project of Kiddycar tycoon Abner Dillon Guy Kibbee who does a fine befuddled fellow of a certain age. Una Merkel and Ginger Rogers play chorus girlsand Rogers manages to steal a lot of small scenes with her quick wisecrack delivery. Dick Powell plays the juvenile lead with a crush on new chorus girl Peggy Sawyer Ruby Keeler. There's something wrong with Powell's face his upper lip is too long his chin is too short his eyes are too sparkly and generally he's too eager to please. Keeler has puppydog eyes and a pleasant face but not much of an acting or singing voice. Ned Sparks who in a tophat and cigar looks a lot like the untrustworthy companion in the Little Nemo comics has a wonderful grimace and doubletake. For much of the film they're working on the play in the theatre and Daniels sings a lot of songs but she's on the downward trackshe breaks an ankle and cannot go onwhile Keeler is heading up. It's an interesting way of having two stars share one stage role. And both the Ginger Rogers and the Bebe Daniels characters act unselfishly in the end promoting and supporting the new girl. There's just enough sappy melodrama between the song and dance numbers to please those who require such things. And there are some great quick shots of old New York a busy grey aerial shot of skyscrapers a series of street signs from 42nd street intersections. The songs are mostly not very memorable but Shuffle Off to Buffalo and the title song seem to have lasted. The best part of the movie has to be the stage settings and the Berkeley routines. For the honeymoon Shuffle routine after the newlyweds sing from what appears to be the back platform of a train the whole thing splits in half and opens 180 degrees into a cutaway railway car. In a precode bit of suggestibility the new bride thrusts her arm through the sleeper curtains to drop them where the porter can get them and give them a good brushingand the arm jerks rises and then sinks languorously dropping the shoes and lingering... And there are some lovely dances on slowly turning glossy black platforms. And in the finale the whole cast seems to mount a set of steps or bleachers their backs to the audience and carrying dark skyline cutouts. Then all at once they turn and each one holds up a painted skyscraper. A wonderful effect the dancing buildings. It strikes me that Busby Berkeley's heritage has passed partly to film directors like Terry Gilliam whose artificial sets melt into verisimilitude as in Baron Munchausen and the artist Red Grooms.".

Warner Baxter is Julian Marsh the browbeating director who indicates to one of his assistants that he's ill the implication being he hasn't got much time left. Not hard to believe as he smokes one cigarette after another and yells so much that his blood pressure must be off the charts. Ruby Keeler is Peggy Sawyer one of the chorus girls and like the rest of them she needs the job. Dick Powell is the juvenile lead and Bebe Daniels is the star of the show Dorothy Brock. Ginger Rogers has a nifty role as the chorus girl known as Anytime Annie the only time she said no she didn't hear the question. In those days latching onto a Sugar Daddy was the big thing and Ginger has no problem in that department. George Brent sans mustache is Brock's expartner who takes a shine to Keeler. The dandy supporting cast includes Una Merkel Ned Sparks and Allen Jenkins.When you watch 42nd Street you understand where the term hoofing comes from in relationship to tap dancing. Seeing and hearing the chorus rehearse one wonders why Marsh didn't just pack it in. But of course the opening night show is a wow with Busby Berkeley's choreography coming to the fore in Shuffle Off to Buffalo and the brilliant production number 42nd Street  which shows the savory and unsavory sides of Times Square before Disney took it over. Berkeley's work in this film made him a superstar film choreographer though he'd been toiling in Hollywood for a few years by then.Ruby Keeler is cute but lousy and the idea of her saving a musical is ludicrous. Dick Powell plays the juvenile well but of course he went on to not only become a wonderful serious actor but a terrific producer so this was just the tip of the iceberg for him. Daniels is great if melodramatic by today's standards  as she limps around on her crutches one gets a sudden vision of Carol Burnett doing that in a skit. Baxter is appropriately tough and says the most famous line You're going out a chorus girl but you must come back a star. He also gives us the downbeat scene at the end of the film that makes 42nd Street different from all the rest when he sits on the fire escape in the theater alley listening to the audience as they leave the show.42nd Street spawned dozens of movie musicals in the '30s actually reviving the genre. None of them compare  and that includes the Broadway musical derived from the film  because none of them have the darker grittier Depression subtext that makes 42nd Street true to its name.".

	schema:reviewBody "42nd Street Warner Brothers 1933 directed by Lloyd Bacon is not the history of the famous New York City street but a successful backstage musical story was not only tremendous success when released in theaters but one to have earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. Followed by frequent reruns on both local television stations revival movie houses a colorized edition on Turner Broadcast Station in 198788 and finally Turner Classic Movies cable channel in original black and white format after 1994 it appears that someone must have done something right by all this because 42nd Street still retains its classic film status after all these years.Warner Baxter in his only role for the Warners studio heads the cast as Julian Marsh the greatest musical comedy director in America today who signs a contract with producers Jones Robert McWade and Barry Ned Sparks of the Actors Equity Association as general stage director. Bebe Daniels in possibly her best known Hollywood movie role of her career plays Dorothy Brock a temperamental actresssinger making a comeback starring in Marsh's upcoming musical Pretty Lady. As Dorothy plays up to Abner Dillon Guy Kibbee the show's financial backer her real interest is her former vaudeville partner Pat Denning George Brent. In order for Dorothy to remain in the show Pat remains in the background meeting with her only in secret. Other members of the ensemble cast of Pretty Lady include Peggy Sawyer Ruby Keeler a shy young hopeful given plenty of encouragement by juvenile singer Billy Lawler Dick Powell sassy showgirl pals Lorraine Fleming Una Merkel and Anytime Annie Lowell Ginger Rogers Terry Neil Eddie Nugent among others. Assisting Marsh are his immediate stagehands MacElroy Allen Jenkins and Andy Lee George E. Stone as well as accomplished composers Al Dubin and Harry Warren supplying the score. After five weeks of strenuous rehearsals situations occur that could prevent the show from having its gala premier.As much as 42nd Street is Baxter's show from start to finish rarely seen without his smoking cigarette with Daniels coming a close second there's life imitating art with the overnight star being that of Mrs. Al Jolson better known as Ruby Keeler. With this being her motion picture debut and first of seven musicals opposite Dick Powell this tap dancer from Broadway would share more scenes here opposite George Brent than her soon to be frequent screen partner Powell. Though there has been some criticism about Keeler's acting and dancing skills there's no doubt how much she and her Peggy Sawyer portrayal come close to being one of the same and extremely likable indeed. One cannot imagine any other way it could have been both cast and performed. For its then allstar cast others appearing without screen credit are Louise Beavers Pansy Dorothy's Maid Charles Lane The Author Mary Foy Mrs. Holt Peggy's Landlady Tom Kennedy Slim Murphy Jack LaRue and very briefly former silent screen actor Henry B. Walthall. In it's theatrical trailer Lyle Talbot is listed as part of the cast. Some newspaper clippings credit him in the role of Geoffrey Waring Pat Denning's friend who offers him a stock job in Philadelphia a scene nonexistent in the final print.Songs good songs in fact by Harry Warren and Al Dubin include It Must Be June sung by cast during rehearsals You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me sung by Bebe Daniels You're Getting to Be a Habit With Me sung by Daniels during rehearsal tryout Shuffle Off to Buffalo sung by Keeler and Clarence Nordstrom Young and Healthy sung by Powell to Toby Wing and 42nd Street sung by Keeler. Interestingly the opening night show's three production numbers all running no more than six minutes apiece would hardly be a reason for anyone to spend good money for a show lasting 15 minutes. For movie viewers however these numbers are the major highlight from the clever staging by Busby Berkeley. Though Berkeley choreographed earlier film musicals 19301932 notably for Samuel Goldwyn starring Eddie Cantor it is with 42nd Street Berkeley's first for Warners that gathered much praise and attention. His creativity dance ensembles and trademark overhead camera shots are reasons why 42nd Street has succeeded decades after its initial release. As 42nd Street had been revamped and imitated in other musicals it was even spoofed in a skit titled 43rd Street on The Carol Burnett Show CBS TV around 1973. And let's not overlook the fact that movie became the basis for the long running Broadway musical of the same name that premiered in 1980. All this because of 42nd Street. Regardless of imitators here's to the 1933 original from its opening aerial view of New York City various street signs of 42nd Street from Times Square to 8th Avenue Julian Marsh's stress and strain on his cast the risqu oneliners to the cinematic closing minutes that's as original as anything ever done at that time. Watch for it. Yes 42nd Street may be clich and predictable during its 90 minutes. In many ways especially for firsttime viewers it's very original and highly entertaining. 12".

Luckily the nonmusical parts were really good too. The plot was just a pretty standard behindthescenes of a play movie. It actually reminded me a lot of two films about plays that I have just seen recently Micheal Powell's The Red Shoes and Tim Robbins' Cradle Will Rock. While the plot may be a bit common the dialogue is exceptionally good. It is snappy and witty and clever at all times. Also the ensemble cast was extremely good. I love Dick Powell. He's not in this film too much but he's perfect in every scene he's in. I was first introduced to him in the guise of Phillip Marlowe and I am among the small group of people who consider him the best incarnation of Phillip Marlowe and he's just as great in the genre which brought him his fame.This is also the first movie that I've ever seen involving Bubsy Berkely and I have to say WOW!!! Those musical sequences are ingenious! One thing I find funny though is that if you think about it the audience who would be watching the play from below wouldn't be able to see any of the fancy designs the dancers make with their legs! Too bad for them! I give this film a 910!".

I found that I could really identify with and care about them.The story. I thought it was really interesting and realistic. The behindthescenes look at political machinations was exciting. I tend to like movies without special effects that are not unrealistic fantasies. Ordinary People generally comes to my mind. I thought that this movie simply took reallife type people put them in interesting situations filled with conflict and had us watch them deal with the problems they were in.I also think the movie had a message for us in terms of right and wrong. In fact it's downright Shakespearian. Contrast this with another Al Pacino movie Heat where the criminals are portrayed just as sympathetically as the law enforcement officers and there is no inkling at all that there is anything morally wrong with armed robbery. I'm uncomfortable with that.It's refreshing to see a movie in this day and age without gratuitous sex violence bombs and bullets profanity.On a cinematic level I found the directing acting the entire cast and production to be first rate.I realize that many many people possibly the large majority don't see things as I've described here. But if what I've written resonates then you'll probably like this movie a lot.".

I found that I could really identify with and care about them.The story. I thought it was really interesting and realistic. The behindthescenes look at political machinations was exciting. I tend to like movies without special effects that are not unrealistic fantasies. Ordinary People generally comes to my mind. I thought that this movie simply took reallife type people put them in interesting situations filled with conflict and had us watch them deal with the problems they were in.I also think the movie had a message for us in terms of right and wrong. In fact it's downright Shakespearian. Contrast this with another Al Pacino movie Heat where the criminals are portrayed just as sympathetically as the law enforcement officers and there is no inkling at all that there is anything morally wrong with armed robbery. I'm uncomfortable with that.It's refreshing to see a movie in this day and age without gratuitous sex violence bombs and bullets profanity.On a cinematic level I found the directing acting the entire cast and production to be first rate.I realize that many many people possibly the large majority don't see things as I've described here. But if what I've written resonates then you'll probably like this movie a lot.";

Usually they are derivative or too ambitious often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable. But City Hall does not do neither of the above mentioned. The plot is cleverly crafted story is believable. As far as characters go I would say this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is superb and proves again that Al Pacino belongs to the absolute top of American actors nowadays.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a transplanted New Yorker I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall. But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created.For example there's a reference to Woerner's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There is or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996. It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts.No surprise because the script was coauthored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school. The story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside City Hall itself.Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself. He's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control Cusack finds more than he bargained forDanny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal. He's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them do Aiello in. City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa one of the most underrated and underappreciated talents ever on the screen. No one watches anyone else whenever he's on.Al Pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself. His is a complex part he's a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like New York. For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple City Hall is highly recommended.".

Pacino was great he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was good too as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuusiana accent. He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect. The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable dramatic and slightly comical at times. Danny Aiello was superb as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters probably too many. It may take a second viewing to remember which Zapatti was which? After so many crossreferences one has to stop and think just to recap. The ending didn't have a lot of sting. It was built up for so long and then was a bit of a letdown. This was one of the few problems with the film. Since the movie wasn't billed as a huge blockbuster big screen hit it made some forget that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but the film's lack of splash in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations. It was semisuccessful in the home market and viewers are still learning that this title is out there. Made in 1996 it still stands up today and will remain popular for many years to come.So make yourself some lemon pudding you'll see and see this movie!".

The first half was decent and involving but it kind of slid off the rails interestwise for me the rest of the way and got too talky and uninspired.I don't really know if the problem was with the script or its direction. I know I'm not the greatest John Cusack fan in the world I find he's much better in comedy like his sister Joan but he had pretty good costars whose talents were basically wasted in Martin Landau Anthony Franciosa and Danny Aiello these guys were BORN for these roles and films so on paper this should have really worked out well. I had always wondered why this film had bombed so miserably and now I know why. In cases like this more should have been done to alter the story arc just some basic tweaks to make it more suspenseful andor though I usually balk at such 'Hollywood' tendencies some romantic tension a beauty such as Fonda's was misusedthey may as well have hired someone else.

	schema:reviewBody "Set in New York City this political drama is about an investigation into a shooting incident and also a young man's journey from naivety to disillusionment. The young man is Kevin Calhoun John Cusack who after becoming fascinated by politics as a youngster in Louisiana embarked on a career that led him to The Big Apple and his current role as Deputy Mayor of the city. He's energetic highlymotivated and eager to learn all that he can from his boss Mayor John Pappas Al Pacino who's obviously a wellintentioned man and a consummate politician.The alwaysbusy Mayor's office is attempting to bring the Democratic Party Convention to the city and planning to build a bank amongst other things when news comes through about a shootout in a Brooklyn street. An exchange of fire between an undercover cop and a drug dealer had left both men dead and a stray bullet had also killed an innocent 6yearold boy who'd had the misfortune to be closeby at the time. On hearing the news Mayor Pappas swings into action immediately by launching an investigation which Calhoun is appointed to lead and then visiting the cop's widow and the boy's father before skilfully updating the media at a swiftlyconvened press conference. Despite being advised that he wouldn't be welcomed by the congregation of the Harlem church where the boy's funeral is to be held Pappas insists on attending and gives a stirring speech that's wellreceived by everyone present.Marybeth Cogan Bridget Fonda an attorney who works for the Detectives' Endowment Association is on hand to protect the reputation of the deceased cop and the interests of his widow. She takes an interest in Calhoun's investigation which focuses on whose bullet killed the child why the cop went to a meeting with a drug dealer without any backup and why the drug dealer had been paroled rather than jailed for the serious crimes he'd committed in the recent past.Calhoun's investigation reveals that the boy had been killed by the drug dealer's bullet and that the decision to parole the young criminal had been made as a result of a conspiracy involving the drug dealer's Mafiabossuncle Paul Zapatti Tony Franciosa a Brooklyn politician called Frank Anselmo Danny Aiello and Judge Walter Stern Martin Landau. A couple of these men become immediate casualties of the conspiracy but others soon follow.There was a lot of talent on board in the making of this movie as a couple of members of the writing team had previously been involved in classics like Taxi Driver Casino and Goodfellas and Ken Lipper had served as Deputy Mayor of New York City under Mayor Ed Koch. Lipper's input in particular must've been important and is no doubt the reason why the dialogue in City Hall is so realistic and incisive.It's great to see Al Pacino in a role that's so perfect for him as he comfortably displays the flamboyance charisma and shrewdness of John Pappas and delivers the kind of speeches that would be expected of a politician of his calibre. It's also enjoyable to watch the slick way in which his character's political instincts kick in whenever he has to deal with a difficult problem and also his skill in handling different types of people. John Cusack in his understated way also does well in portraying the transition that Calhoun goes through as he matures both as a politician and a man. Tony Franciosa and Martin Landau are especially good in their supporting roles and Danny Aiello makes a tremendous impression as a political operator with a penchant for the music of Rodgers  Hammerstein.City Hall shows very adeptly how many deals compromises and accommodations have to be made in order to achieve anything of any significance and also implicitly questions how anyone can keep their integrity in such a milieu. It's these qualities that ultimately make this movie so thoughtprovoking as well as entertaining.".

Apparently the mayor knew what was going on all the time and it was just business or politics as usual for him.Pacino's speech at the funeral of the young black kid was outstanding. Talk about a smooth political orator! Pacino played New York City Mayor John Pappas. He reminded me a lot of another New Yorker former governor Mario Cuomo who although I disagreed with many of his statements was a smooth talker like Pacino's character in here.

	schema:reviewBody "Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling  the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful  the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it!".

	schema:headline " A thrilling political 'whodunit' ruined by a pointless ending and an unnecessary closetoromantic subplot ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since Frank Capra and The Godfather movies Cinema had shattered faith on American politicians and I guess reality finished the job. And given the requirements of the political thriller genre dissociating the word 'politician' from the epithet 'crooked' became unconceivable and Harold Becker's City Hall is no exception the script cowritten by three giants Bo Goldman Nicholas Pileggi and Paul Schradder depicts politicians as puppets with money as the strings held by criminals.The games had its rules and one of them was to never harm let alone kill innocent people. In Scarface Tony Montana owed his demise to this principle and Eliott Ness couldn't overlook the explosion that killed a poor little girl in The Untouchables. City Hall opens with an offduty cop and an inprobation criminal linked to the mob meeting on a rainy day and shooting at each other. Nothing we're not familiar with but then there's a stray bullet that takes the film to an unexpected direction killing a 6year little boy going to school with his father.When a bullet kills a child the community can't close eyes. We know the bullet hasn't finished its trajectory and many other heads will follow. The film is basically about the aftermath of the triplemurder a thrilling investigation and its political dominoeffect. What makes it even more riveting relies on the character who desperately tries to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle Kevin Calhoun John Cusack in his 'boyish look' days as the deputy of an ambitious and charismatic lawyer named John Pappas played by a Pacino at the top of his game sometimes over it. Calhoun asks a friend about the killer's probation and what follows is a great piece of dialog. David Paymer's character looks confused. Isn't the document kosher enough? No it's too kosher. We get the message.In other words the Judge let a gangster free while he deserved to be sentenced for jail for more than 10 years. And the 'signal' alert starts ringing when Calhoun discovers that the judge happens to be a friend of John Pappas. Calhoun tries to protect his mentor little he knows that Pappas will also be revealed as the mastermind of the whole operation. Mastermind is a bit too much in fact this is a benign case of political corruption. Then Mobster Zappati wants to spare his nephew a 15year sentence he orders his friend a Brooklyn mayor named Anselmo played by a great Danny Aiello to 'persuade the judge' a good friend of John Pappas which loops the loop. Meanwhile Anselmo orders to hide 40 000 dollars in the cop's home to imply that he wasn't that clean. Really small potatoes we've seen worse.But all of these actions are aggravated by the dramatic turn it took when a lamb was sacrificed at the altar of political corruption. But more dramatic even tragic is the unforgivable turn the film takes as it deliberately screws up the mechanism it confidently built up. It all starts with Bridget Fonda's character as the lawyer representing the cop's widow and struggling to clear her husband's name in order to get a full pension  well if it wasn't meant to be a sort of 'romantic' subplot why a beautiful blonde for that? And this is where the film starts to lose its beat because there's nothing she brought up that Calhoun couldn't have discovered alone. The whole ride to 'buffalo' was just the setup to a cringeworthy ending that didn't even make sense in the first place.Basically Fonda is the film's first mistake and the poster could have done without her. There was so many great moments a reunion between Anselmo and his business partners his last conversation with Zapatti which had the same powerful undertones as the unforgettable meeting between Tom Hagen and Frankie Pentangeli in The Godfather Part II. The film even has the intelligence to spare us some random action scenes it's all in the mystery surrounding the opening crime it's one hell of a political whodunit meaning who committed the first mistake? And the only character for the film is Calhoun whose arc will change from idealism to an awareness of the limitation of the political world. If anything the film had to conclude on a sad and melancholic note.Instead we have that upbeat tone at the end where he campaigns for some candidature I didn't even care about and an exchange of a few wisecracks with Bridget Fonda. That 'bullet killing a child' was the plot device that belonged to City Hall and no other film could have used it instead. Imagine the conversation you know City Hall? City what? The film where a kid gets killed during a shootout and Pacino makes a speech during his funeral. Yeah I remember that movie so  how about it? Well it could have been much better. Unfortunately the film is so thoughtprovoking and subversive that some other parts simply didn't work the ending Bridget Fonda and the fact that we're left confused about the future of John Pappas.It's incredible that a screenplay written by the authors of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' Scent of a Woman Goodfellas Casino Taxi Driver and Raging Bull couldn't come up with a more explosive material. A disappointing collective work for a film with a very promising concept a stellar cast but the conclusion of an ordinary TV movie. That 'bullet killing a child' deserved more. When you have such an original opening you can't afford such a cheap and ordinary ending much more one that doesn't even ring true  in other words this was a man's film.Indeed it could have been to political thrillers what Heat was to the gangster genre it could have been even longer what a waste of performances especially Aiello who was astonishing.".

	schema:headline " Complex but Worth Repeated Viewings";
	schema:reviewBody "I read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred went ahead and started watching. I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex involved and full of detail. That is a good thing but also quite unexpected in this culture of car chases explosions gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development. In fact what a welcome departure however I am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what I watch. This film is chock full of character development and plot line the kind that we used to analyze when I was in high school. It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer. What a nice change. I would compare it to 'All The President's Men' in terms of generic subject matter. That is it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially 'own' them. Unlike 'All The President's Men' this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality. In this sense the movie is a character study like 'The Negotiatior' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In that movie their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense. Yet the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other trust each and ultimately unite together against the corrupt Police Department. There is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically there are many similarities. I WILL say that City Hall requires a whole lot more concentration. In fact I was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals I've seen in my life going back to Watergate. The thing is the public knows that something is wrong for sure! but following the details is hard to do. This movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity. I think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film unrealistic expectations.If one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience it really is excellent! I watched it 3 times in a row! The acting is superb and the directing is flawless. The weakest link is John Cusak's accent.".

With a couple of judicious language cuts and some clumsy edits for violence the movie came to the little screen essentially intact. Unfortunately City Hall is such a pleasant and vacant little thriller you probably will have forgotten it by the time you get up from in front of the TV to stretch.There's almost nothing here in this pedestrian story of city hall corruption! Al Pacino is just fine as the mayor of New York a man who keeps hammering home to his staff headed by the Pillsbury Doughboy incarnate John Cusack that if it's good for the city it's good. Cusack looks as if he needs to be put back in the oven for another ten minutes. Bridget Fonda is all pretty hair and nice legs and freshly scrubbed cardboard. Danny Aiello plays well Danny Aiello. The other person of interest in the movie Tony Franciosa has been around a long long time and he is just so interesting to watch even though he doesn't have much to do.There's an interesting subplot wherein Pacino is working very hard to bring the 1996 Democratic National Convention to town. Senator Ernest Hollings makes a nice appearance with Pacino and other bigwigs at a dinner party and his cameo adds a bit of gravitas to this fluffy little Harold Becker film.Pacino is just plain fun to watch as he chews the scenery and makes it look very much like good governance. Cusack doesn't fare so well. He has a great voice and the sound recording of the actors is crisp and melodious but at one point or another you have to wonder how really this Louisiana transplant Kevin Calhoun got to be the Deputy Mayor of New York City. He tells Fonda something about politics being in all Louisianans' blood streams. Then he goes back to fighting corruption.Does anyone see the irony here? Oh well. The movie is over the dead cop's wife has got his pension the baddies are locked up or have moved on Cusack is chunkily cheerful and has Fonda with those spiffy gams and happy face Pacino has apparently retired to practice law and you can't remember what you did for the last two hours.".

His righthand man is none other than Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun John Cusack an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. Everything points in that direction until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by Marybeth Cogan Bridget Fonda who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. A six year old boy and a police officer's death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent coverup by political payoffs and city corruption involving union leaders like Danny Aiello played by Frank Anselmo corrupt judicial officials like Judge Walter Stern. Martin Landau and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti Anthony Franciosa who are deeply involved. Also implicated are party officials like Larry Schwartz Richard Schiff who works for the probation office of New York. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. ".

Also implicated are party officials like Larry Schwartz Richard Schiff who works for the probation office of New York. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. ";

It's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense.  We know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes.  The film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way.  All the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola.  QA which also takes place in New York is a far better alternative as is LA Confidential.".

One of the movie's main problems is that Cusack has the lead role but his character isn't very interesting.  He plays a transplanted Southerner determined to help pave the way to the White House James Carville anyone? for his fatherfigure Mayor Pacino.  A shootout at the beginning of the movie that leaves a cop a felon and a young boy dead unearths possible corruption in the courts leading the idealistic and inquisitive Cusack on a trail that may lead back into his very own office don't want to give anything away but the video box says as much.Much of the movie's two hour runtime is stuffed with chatter to show the atmosphere of the New York political scene but ultimately it just fills like filler because there's not much of a payoff as the scandal that is eventually unveiled is as simple as 123.  Bridget Fonda has third billing but her role is a minor one maybe 20 minutes of screen time as the lawyer representing the dead cop's family.  Mostly she seems to be around to give Cusack a love interest and gives a pretty dull performance.  Pacino alternates between being bombastic in his supposedly charismatic moments and just looking plain tired.  Cusack is saddled with a ridiculous Louisiana accent that comes and goes.  This is definitely not the best work of any three of these normally good actors.  Overall the movie's probably okay if it's on TV and there's nothing much else to do otherwise it's not a real compelling watch.".

It's as if the characters the plot and the pacing of the film were kept apart throughout filming and then only introduced in the editing room.The film begins with a lackluster conflict the accidental shooting of a child by a drug dealer with relatives in the NY mob families who looks as if he came directly from Central Casting and acts just as stiff. Before we even know anything about this character he's confronted by a possibly corrupt cop  the entire background motivation and confusion regarding the cop's rational for meeting with the drug dealer alone without backup and without reporting in first is left completely unresolved...don't look for answers by the end of the film gunfire is exchanged and everyone is dead including the innocent child who is clearly injected into this formula for nothing more than aestheticemotional purposes and is treated like cinemachum shot dead for instant sympathy by the audience only to draw in the bigger fish in the water the primary characters.On the heels of the shooting we are introduced to our principles Al Pacino as the mayor John Cusack as the deputy mayor singlehandedly managing the entirety of New York. The completely contrived setup of the administration of a city the size of New York being managed at least from all appearances we are given on screen by these two characters is beyond laughable...its' insipid.  Very little backstory toward the actual operations of a City Hall the interlying politics required to operate a major city other than another contrived conversation between Al Pacino and Danny Aiello later in the film regarding quid pro quo negotiations for construction in a borough of the city.The central plot of the movie springs from the reaction by City Hall to this one shooting incident as the world is we suppose put on temporary pause for days afterward in New York by this event.  Cusack abandons his supposed position with City Hall and becomes a kneejerk Mickey Spilane trodding beside Bridget Fonda on some halfass investigation of the politics surrounding the now dead cop suspected of corruption and the question of why the drug dealer was ever on the streets in the first place having been questionably released on parole years before.  Everyone phones in their performances which appears as if everyone approached the movie with high hopes then got distracted by something better to do possibly calling their agents for better scripts once this movie started filming and just showed up to through with the dialogue.Numerous gaffs faux pauxs regarding life in New York cornball accents by Cusack Fonda's character operating with the depth of a spring puddle vanilla backgrounds boring dialogue  save Al Pacino's impassioned yet ultimately weak tirades toward the shooting of James Bone and his personal conversations with Pappas make for a really unsatisfying film....so much potential for more here.Avoid it. As much as it pains me to recommend against Al Pacino and John Cusack actors I really enjoy City Hall just can't deliver and feels like a TV movie of the week.Recommendations Better political play on a national basis in Thirteen Days and the Contender.".

Salim Kumar is exceptional and can be ranked as one of the best in Malayalam Film industry. in the last scene where he enters the police jeep by uttering the words one who knows everything is a judge thats why we call him a judge is exceptional. all supporting cast plays their part perfectly. and my opinion is that state award and national award for best actor should go to Salim Kumar his performance is far too good compared to Mohan Lal's in  Thanmathra. may be the jury was too scared to ignore Mohan Lal as he is the superstar. and this is undoubtfully the best movie of the Year unfortunately it went to thanmathra lal Jose also deserved to get the best director award. All the departments in the film. director screen playediting acting music everything scores and makes this film unforgettable experience. watch this film i can guarantee it will put a dagger in to your conscience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Race 2 is a popcorn flick at best! Too much care has been taken for the oomph and style in the film but little has been done to enlighten the screenplay which was definitely a plus point of its predecessor Race. Race 2 boosts of a stellar cast of Alist actors but the plot doesn't have the spell to stand above the rest. The first half moves sluggishly while the second half seems rushed. In the first edition of Race the twists kept us hooked and interested so in Race 2 we expected more and better twists. Director duo Abbas Mustan do try and desperately to give us more than a handful but keeping up with them is labourious.The hero in the film Saif Ali Khan is shown as an James Bond incarnate as he can do almost everything be it riding a speed boat archery fencing gambling etc. John Abraham makes a sorry villain and since all his tricks are thwarted by Saif in this film you feel that he has come across looking more dumber than being intelligent in the film. I wonder what went wrong with Deepika Padukone in Race 2? She shows only her skin and not her acting skills. Oops! But is that true for the other ladies in this movie too? Not really. Jacqueline Fernandez has a meatier role than Deepika's. Deepika wears a stonefaced expression on her face throughout and you wonder is that the same actress who gave a power packed performance in Cocktail? But it must be noted that Jacqueline too struggles with giving the appropriate expressions and she has minimal facial expressions. Anil Kapoor and Ameesha Patel compete to prove who comes across as sillier. Anil's PJs make you feel sick to the stomach. The music of the movie is also a minus point. Race 2 lacks an appealing chartbuster much like AbbasMustan's last year's disaster Players! Race 2 with its twists and turns is like one of those terrible roller coaster rides that leave you nauseated and sick by the end.".

Director duo Abbas Mustan do try and desperately to give us more than a handful but keeping up with them is labourious.The hero in the film Saif Ali Khan is shown as an James Bond incarnate as he can do almost everything be it riding a speed boat archery fencing gambling etc. John Abraham makes a sorry villain and since all his tricks are thwarted by Saif in this film you feel that he has come across looking more dumber than being intelligent in the film. I wonder what went wrong with Deepika Padukone in Race 2? She shows only her skin and not her acting skills. Oops! But is that true for the other ladies in this movie too? Not really. Jacqueline Fernandez has a meatier role than Deepika's. Deepika wears a stonefaced expression on her face throughout and you wonder is that the same actress who gave a power packed performance in Cocktail? But it must be noted that Jacqueline too struggles with giving the appropriate expressions and she has minimal facial expressions. Anil Kapoor and Ameesha Patel compete to prove who comes across as sillier. Anil's PJs make you feel sick to the stomach. The music of the movie is also a minus point. Race 2 lacks an appealing chartbuster much like AbbasMustan's last year's disaster Players! Race 2 with its twists and turns is like one of those terrible roller coaster rides that leave you nauseated and sick by the end.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Race 2";
	schema:reviewBody "The directing duo of AbbasMastan created Race back in 2008 that deals with the twists turns and doubletriple crossings between two brothers Ranvir Saif Ali Khan and Rajiv Akshaye Khanna against an ostentatious backdrop that included the requisite flaunting of material wealth horse racing romance and shady characters that included the likes of femme fatales in Bipasha Bashu and Katrina Kaif in one of her earlier Bollywood roles. The sequel boasts no less although with only Saif Ali Khan and Anil Kapoor as the now ex police inspector Robert D'Costa returning but adopting a similar formula that focused on the con.You don't really need to watch the first film because everything pretty much moved along in standalone fashion in this follow up which spent a considerable part of the first half hour cementing the nastiness of brothersister team Armaan John Abraham and Elena Deepika Padukone. One's a street fighter who has never lost a fight and brought out of the scene by Elena the brains of their enduring and successful partnership dabbling into various cons from casino tables to just about owning an empire both in the light and in the shady underworld. They form a formidable team and individually Shiraz Ahmed's story shows just how bad ass each can be never batting an eyelid if they have to rely on good old fashioned murder or seduction to get at what they want.We're soon introduced to another new character played by Jacqueline Fernandez as Omisha a thief who soon hooks up with Armaan not only because of his good looks but more importantly his wealth and wicked demeanor while Ranvir enters the picture to try and gain trust from the ruthless siblings to take on a larger con together with Elena sending out her foxy signals right from the start. For a Bollywood movie this covers the romance angle where the leads have their counterparts to woo or in this case accelerated into the expected song and dance sequence in lieu of something more kinky that can't be shown on screen.But really things just aren't that simple where soon Ranvir gets involved with both women though for different reasons and has an objective and motivation that ties in with a key character from the past as well as to answer the rather open ended prologue in this film. To say a lot more is to ruin the surprises that AbbasMastan have in store for audiences. This is a Race movie that has qualities to be expanded into yet another Bollywood franchise of rotating villains played by a top star for each installment going along the Dhoom route. So expect that things will never be as they seem and there's almost always a motive behind what someone will say and do where loyalties can shift at will and oneupmanship is the order of the game.Which happens to be the film's weakness as well. Sometimes the flipflopping extracts a chunk of imagination coincidence and stretches one's belief that the con actually began many steps beforehand like a chess grandmaster playing against an amateur that surprises spring out from the blue with constant smirking that one got on top of the other only for that smirk to be wiped out by an even larger wink. It can get tongueincheek at times and opened up loopholes that would be best glossed over for the entire narrative to work. Heavy reliance on sleight of hand techniques also called for plot convenience with its fragmented narrative style forced to hide and then present details of the con.Heavy reliance on CG is also telling but here the CG still seemed rather cartoony which suited the hyperreality style of the world that the characters in Race exists in. It's entertainment for the masses so AbbasMastan waste no time in plying implausible stunts in every deathdefying escape although a parkour sequence was expertly handled. Set action pieces get bigger as the film moved along culminating in a really nutty climatic showdown thousands of feet in the air. It's one thing presenting large set action pieces but another in presenting them well no matter how cheesy it would be. Someone forgot to tell the filmmakers to ease up on the cheesiness but perhaps they had comedy in mind as well with a key unintentional one given gossip rags on the John AbrahamBipasha Basu relationship that will have audiences in stitches.John Abraham's hulking frame got put to good use and in what would be the usual Salman Khan style there's builtin opportunity here for clothes to be shed in a stylized MMA caged fight for some brawn to be added rather than to put him in a role whose character is only interested in whatever it takes to make money and horde cash in what would be a major negative role since his turn in the first Dhoom. Saif Ali Khan continues with the swagger and poser requirements as Ranvir from the first film playing the ultimate conman now with a more personal vendetta at hand and paired up yet again with Deepika Padukone for the umpteenth time. If anything Deepika's role as Elena fit into the typical Bond girl role in having little to do little to add to the story but there for the eye candy. And she carried off the lightweight role really well as does Jacqueline Fernandez in yet another sequel of her career. Anil Kapoor is grossly underused here if only to serve as the plot's conduit between characters and spending most of his time with his character's secretary Cherry Ameesha Patel leering and spouting sexual innuendos.If movies with twists and turns at every other instant is your cup of tea then Race 2 would be that popcorn entertainer you're looking for with a good looking cast providing eye candy to wild away those two and a half hours. It doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you.".

It's entertainment for the masses so AbbasMastan waste no time in plying implausible stunts in every deathdefying escape although a parkour sequence was expertly handled. Set action pieces get bigger as the film moved along culminating in a really nutty climatic showdown thousands of feet in the air. It's one thing presenting large set action pieces but another in presenting them well no matter how cheesy it would be. Someone forgot to tell the filmmakers to ease up on the cheesiness but perhaps they had comedy in mind as well with a key unintentional one given gossip rags on the John AbrahamBipasha Basu relationship that will have audiences in stitches.John Abraham's hulking frame got put to good use and in what would be the usual Salman Khan style there's builtin opportunity here for clothes to be shed in a stylized MMA caged fight for some brawn to be added rather than to put him in a role whose character is only interested in whatever it takes to make money and horde cash in what would be a major negative role since his turn in the first Dhoom. Saif Ali Khan continues with the swagger and poser requirements as Ranvir from the first film playing the ultimate conman now with a more personal vendetta at hand and paired up yet again with Deepika Padukone for the umpteenth time. If anything Deepika's role as Elena fit into the typical Bond girl role in having little to do little to add to the story but there for the eye candy. And she carried off the lightweight role really well as does Jacqueline Fernandez in yet another sequel of her career. Anil Kapoor is grossly underused here if only to serve as the plot's conduit between characters and spending most of his time with his character's secretary Cherry Ameesha Patel leering and spouting sexual innuendos.If movies with twists and turns at every other instant is your cup of tea then Race 2 would be that popcorn entertainer you're looking for with a good looking cast providing eye candy to wild away those two and a half hours. It doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you.";

Directed by AbbasMustan this highenergy film may be all flash and no substance  but what flash! It tells the story of two highliving international playboys Armaan John Abraham and Ranveer Saif Ali Khan whose combined wealth would make Aristotle Onassis green with envy. The two men are locked in a game of mortal combat after Armaan has Ranveer's girlfriend killed. There's even an attempt on the part of the two gazillionaires to steal the Shroud of Turin no less. If there's one lesson to be gleaned from Race 2 it's that some people really do have too much time and money on their hands.But the plotting  which is nearly impossible to follow anyway what with its double and triple twists and its constantly shifting allegiances  is the least of the attractions of Race 2 which is so beautifully photographed that it almost doesn't matter what's going on in the foreground of the picture. The pedaltothemetal pacing helps to mitigate to some extent at least the excessive length of the movie and the chase and fight sequences are pretty damned spectacular even if they do strain credibility on a regular basis there are even blatant ripoffs of Speed and Air Force One along the way. The movie also restricts itself to a bare minimum of those annoying songanddance numbers that are practically de rigueur in any Bollywood production though there's a ferocious cage match scene that ends on too downbeat a note for a film of this frivolous a nature. There may not be a lot of food for thought in Race 2 but the movie does provide a feast for the eyes.".

The highlights of the film can be mentioned as the running chase between the killer shooter and Saif Ali Khan.Saif rocks in this film. Deepika and Jacqueline are looking very pretty and attractive.

	schema:headline " RACE 2  Race Continues..";
	schema:reviewBody "RACE 2  2013 I love watching thrillers action movies. Movies that truly makes you go wow!! And you have the highest adrenaline rush while watching it. 'RACE' the previous part of 'RACE 2' was one such movie. It gave twist after twist and surprised me totally. So when heard about the second part of it I had already made my mind to watch it. and I am equally thrilled as last time.'RACE 2' has a very stylish star cast. John Abraham in place of Akshaye Khanna. Jacqueline Deepika padukone and Amisha patel in place of Katrina kaif Sameera Reddy and Bipasha. Saif Ali Khan as Ranveer Singh and Anil Kapoor as his best buddy continues as in previous version. This is a revenge story of the characters and they all are blessed with lots of Greed. Money and Betrayal is there in full power which causes for the twists in the story. Except for Saif's and Anil Kapoor's character we wont know who is whose who till the last minute. That uncertainty is the best part about 'RACE 2' as it was in 'RACE'.The movie is international and we shouldn't be logical when watching this. The money that these characters deal with is unimaginable in normal sense and little 'too much'. But this being a movie where its all for money amount can be anything. So leave that. The director duo wanted it to be a bigger hit than the first part so they have repeated some 'ingredients' from the previous recipe. Atif aslam song an exclusive song to woo Saif's character  Touch me in RACE and Lat lag gayi in this  a last scene between Saif and Anil where some last doubts of we the audience are cleared. Could have avoided these repetitions. Also the songs in number. 'Lat lag gayee' was unnecessary. Saif was already finding it hard to dance in previous songs and then came this. As same as Saif and they both have made the song dull. 'Be intehaan' in a typical romantic duet style didn't look good. But the title track 'Allah Duhai' was stunningly superb in making. The choreographer deserves a big thumbs up for it. Songs being good and groovy doesn't make you bored in between the movie or does it slow down the pace.The new characters introduced of John Jacqueline Deepika are really cool for the plot. Except for Jacqueline impressive performance from the cast. John doesn't have any new expressions to show so he has been asked to show his body more. Jacqueline's dialogue delivery and expression does not seem to sync anywhere. Amisha patel was good with what she had to do but her character was limited in the script. She could have been given more to do on screen. The story being ultramodern  the ladies are all stunningly hot in this flick. I would call this a rich script which is required essentially for an entertaining thriller. Though some action scenes were out of the world I don't mind it that much. A good experience provided you are familiar with the nature of 'RACE'. Its all about Betrayal and Winning..".

	onyx:emotionText "RACE 2  2013 I love watching thrillers action movies. Movies that truly makes you go wow!! And you have the highest adrenaline rush while watching it. 'RACE' the previous part of 'RACE 2' was one such movie. It gave twist after twist and surprised me totally. So when heard about the second part of it I had already made my mind to watch it. and I am equally thrilled as last time.'RACE 2' has a very stylish star cast. John Abraham in place of Akshaye Khanna. Jacqueline Deepika padukone and Amisha patel in place of Katrina kaif Sameera Reddy and Bipasha. Saif Ali Khan as Ranveer Singh and Anil Kapoor as his best buddy continues as in previous version. This is a revenge story of the characters and they all are blessed with lots of Greed. Money and Betrayal is there in full power which causes for the twists in the story. Except for Saif's and Anil Kapoor's character we wont know who is whose who till the last minute. That uncertainty is the best part about 'RACE 2' as it was in 'RACE'.The movie is international and we shouldn't be logical when watching this. The money that these characters deal with is unimaginable in normal sense and little 'too much'. But this being a movie where its all for money amount can be anything. So leave that. The director duo wanted it to be a bigger hit than the first part so they have repeated some 'ingredients' from the previous recipe. Atif aslam song an exclusive song to woo Saif's character  Touch me in RACE and Lat lag gayi in this  a last scene between Saif and Anil where some last doubts of we the audience are cleared. Could have avoided these repetitions. Also the songs in number. 'Lat lag gayee' was unnecessary. Saif was already finding it hard to dance in previous songs and then came this. As same as Saif and they both have made the song dull. 'Be intehaan' in a typical romantic duet style didn't look good. But the title track 'Allah Duhai' was stunningly superb in making. The choreographer deserves a big thumbs up for it. Songs being good and groovy doesn't make you bored in between the movie or does it slow down the pace.The new characters introduced of John Jacqueline Deepika are really cool for the plot. Except for Jacqueline impressive performance from the cast. John doesn't have any new expressions to show so he has been asked to show his body more. Jacqueline's dialogue delivery and expression does not seem to sync anywhere. Amisha patel was good with what she had to do but her character was limited in the script. She could have been given more to do on screen. The story being ultramodern  the ladies are all stunningly hot in this flick. I would call this a rich script which is required essentially for an entertaining thriller. Though some action scenes were out of the world I don't mind it that much.

Their last outing players was a big disappointment and an insult to the great  Italian Job. Howeverthe earlier Race had packed some punch courtesy superb acting by Akshaye khanna and some really good music. 5 years later the director duo came with Race 2 and I must say the movie lacked the thrill some high octane action that the earlier movie had. The only saving grace this time around was Saif Ali khan as Ranveer Singh who with his great personality brought something to cheer in this movie. John Abraham looks great on screen but has a poor dialog delivery the one thing that he lacks in every movie of his. Deepika Padukone and Jacqeline Fernandes both look gorgeous and u don't really see their acting this time around and just admire the efforts that their stylists have put in.Music is good but not as good as it was in Race. Overall if u are getting bored sitting at home and have some bucks to grab a seat in a cinema hall Race 2 is not a bad option. Watch it for Saif Ali Khan.".

Character could do anything. Director duo AbbasMustan inserted a ring fight with John that is neither required nor very impressive then typical double meaning dialogues by Anil Kapoor and Amisha Patel  which is not suitable to actors like them. Any comedian could do it but star power was necessary to pull the audience. A chase sequence between Shooter and Saif Ali khan is impressive but I was unable to understand that first shooter didn't try hard to hide him while shooting that indicates he was ready to face the situation then rather confronting Saif he started running. This complete sequence is worth watching. Screenplay by Shiraz Ahmed is forceful. He is unable to put any clue about any character's behavior before their act whenever he felt to reveal he just shown that in flash back. Therefore audience cannot attach themselves with the thrill because at the end they can show anything. Dialogues by Kiran Kotrial is OK. Performance wise Anil Kapoor is fine. Saif ali Khan John Abraham Deepika Padukone are good. Amisha Patel does not have scope but she is OK. Surprisingly Bipasha Basu is looking very beautiful in her guest appearance.

	schema:reviewBody "Detective Daniel Madigan Richard Widmark and Detective Rocco Bonaro Harry Guardino enter a squalid Manhattan apartment building to pick up Barney Benesch Steve Ihnat who is wanted for questioning on a case in Brooklyn. When Benesch manages to take Madigan and Bonaro's guns away and escape Police Commissioner Anthony X Russell Henry Fonda tells them that they have 72 hours to get Benesch back or else.Out of all of the Don Siegeldirected films I've seen to date this was the biggest disappointment. The film begins and ends with fantastic action sequenceswell directed well shot with a nice gritty feel but in between the film felt overlong overly complex and far too soapoperalike for my tastes.It could be due to Madigan being adapted from a novel but Abraham Polonsky and Howard Rodman's Henri Simoun here script includes so many different threads most of them inconsequential to the outcome of the film that it almost begins to lose coherence in the middle. It's a bad sign when the major arc of the story is completed but characters still have to engage in a number of But what about so and so? verbal tags at the end of the film to try to satisfy the audience.It feels almost as if Madigan is made for two entirely different crowdsone fans of gritty crime action films and the other fans of realist dramas cum soap operas. I can't imagine the former caring about most of the material in the middle unless it had a pay off towards their genre and I can't imagine the latter being interested in the action scenes. Most of the material in the middle although it has some more than admirable dialogue and decent performances hinges on a complex web of personal and professional relationshipsvarious romantic affairs questionable relations between the police and citizens and so on.

Again it might work if it had some other payoff but it doesn't.Still the positive aspects were good enough to not bring my score below a 6. The film might also play better on a second viewing where you better know how to adjust your expectations as it goes along. On a first uninformed viewing the beginning is likely to gear you up for a great suspenseful and witty ride leaving you disappointed in the middle until you finally adjust and then you're awakened again with action at the end.".

	onyx:emotionText "Detective Daniel Madigan Richard Widmark and Detective Rocco Bonaro Harry Guardino enter a squalid Manhattan apartment building to pick up Barney Benesch Steve Ihnat who is wanted for questioning on a case in Brooklyn. When Benesch manages to take Madigan and Bonaro's guns away and escape Police Commissioner Anthony X Russell Henry Fonda tells them that they have 72 hours to get Benesch back or else.Out of all of the Don Siegeldirected films I've seen to date this was the biggest disappointment. The film begins and ends with fantastic action sequenceswell directed well shot with a nice gritty feel but in between the film felt overlong overly complex and far too soapoperalike for my tastes.It could be due to Madigan being adapted from a novel but Abraham Polonsky and Howard Rodman's Henri Simoun here script includes so many different threads most of them inconsequential to the outcome of the film that it almost begins to lose coherence in the middle. It's a bad sign when the major arc of the story is completed but characters still have to engage in a number of But what about so and so? verbal tags at the end of the film to try to satisfy the audience.It feels almost as if Madigan is made for two entirely different crowdsone fans of gritty crime action films and the other fans of realist dramas cum soap operas. I can't imagine the former caring about most of the material in the middle unless it had a pay off towards their genre and I can't imagine the latter being interested in the action scenes. Most of the material in the middle although it has some more than admirable dialogue and decent performances hinges on a complex web of personal and professional relationshipsvarious romantic affairs questionable relations between the police and citizens and so on. It all comes to naught in the end. Also not helping is Henry Fonda's odd aloofness. Again it might work if it had some other payoff but it doesn't.Still the positive aspects were good enough to not bring my score below a 6.

It is one of the odd and frustrating things about the piece the story is complex enough without being unsure who to focus on a shame because Widmark Clark Fonda and Whitmore are doing sterling work for their under pressure director Siegel was constantly fighting with producer Frank P.

But hang on! Wasn't there a murderer on the loose at the beginning of the film? Half way through the piece I had forgotten about Steve Ihnat's crim that opened up proceedings surely that can't be right? Film looks terrific at day time though where Metty's bold Technicolor photography really gives the New York locations a sense of 70s wonder I know it's a 60s movie but it feels very 70s and in a good way as well though Costa's score is far too blunderbuss for narrative themes.It's a mixed bag a film you just know should be better considering the talent in front of and behind the cameras. Ideas at core are strong and worthy of filmic adaptation while the last quarter is electrifying and crowned by a classic foray into film noir territory. But really this is recommended as just above average entertainment for the copcrime movie fan. 610".

Start with a script that can't decide whether it's thirdrate soap opera or secondrate police drama with enough trite subplots and dialogue to border on selfparody. Fleshing out the private lives behind the badges may be a workable idea but here the many subplots detract rather than add to the overall effect. Then there are the performances. Widmark's aging Madigan appears not so much a burnedout case as an expressionless cypher whose presence leaves the audience with nothing much to root for and a long way from Widmark's usual intensity. Then too whose idea was it to have the street tough Madigan go through an embarrassingly bad comedy scene with Henry Fonda that should have stayed on the cutting room floor. There's also Fonda's turn as police commissioner a role that must have required him to swallow an ice cube first and a lemon second because throughout he appears too frozen to unbend and too sour to smile a combination that results in a grimly overdone portrait of moral rectitude. Just the thought of his character coupling with Susan Clarke is about as plausible as pairing Cher with Jerry Fallwell. In fact the entire cast apart from the poignant Inger Stevens appears to be doing their scenes by the numbers which is technically the fault of director Don Siegel. Except Siegel is a Hollywood master who ordinarily directs with style and verve and specializes in policeaction dramas yet here with the exception of the shootout there's none of the usual snap or polish. My guess is he took one look at the script and went for the payday as did everyone else. I suspect too  as another reviewer points out  that the film's basic problem lies with the studio Universal which only recently had specialized in Doris Day comedy fluff. Here however it's 196667  city ghettos are on fire change is in the air and Hollywood is trying to play catch up.

What struck me and it has not been picked up by other posters is the very visible difference between the majority of the scenes shot on authentic NYC locations and a few scenes straight from the Universal backlot on urbanistically nonsensical streets with no gutters.The studio shot scenes and the schoolofLaloShifrin score increase the impression that you are watching a first class TV movie. It all makes you hungry for a dinner in a foil tray.Definitely entertaining in a period way.".

	schema:headline " Very good cop film that injects 1960s morality into the old Film Noir genre";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good filmfull of excellent acting and a pretty interesting story. Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda are both wonderful actors in the movie and their stories run parallel during most of the filmhaving almost no interaction in the film. Harry Guardino Inger Stevens James Whitmore and others provide some superb support and the film is very entertaining. In many ways it's like a 1960s take on Film Noir though with slightly less gritty dialog and a lot of late 60s sensibilities a bit of nudity and graphic language that at first took me by surprise. Now this isn't to say that the film is needlessly gratuitous. I just had a hard time at first hearing some of the swearing coming out of the mouths of some oldtime actors. Additionally and this did NOT improve the film for me there were some soap operalike elements thrown in that often didn't work. Having widower Fonda sleeping with a married woman who had kids just seemed sleazy and didn't at all fit with the character they had created. He prided himself on his decency and integrity but this didn't seem to make much sense. However the tension between Widmark and his wife Stevens did work pretty well as you could certainly see how being a detective could really be tough on a marriage.All in all this was a very good film that seemed a little like DRAGNET the TV show POLICE STORY and a soap opera all rolled into one. Good stuff that is well worth seeing though I'd hesitate to let younger kids view this DVD.".

Directed by legendary Don Siegel and based on a novel by Richard Dougherty with and adaptation by Abraham Polansky and Howard Rodman proves to be a trip back to that era of the New York of the 1960s where crime took center stage for the police. There are two main stories in the narrative one involving a team of detectives and the other about the police commissioner who finds himself in a dilemma as he finds out his best friend in the force has been involved in a shady deal.The detectives Madigan and Bonaro come to pick up Barney Benesch a criminal who is being sought in Brooklyn as a witness for a crime. The two irrupt in the apartment where Benesch is in bed with a young woman. He outmaneuvers the detectives fleeing with their weapons an embarrassing position for the lawmen who become the target of all jokes in the department.Anthony Russell the commissioner is told as he arrives in his office about the investigation that points out one of his colleagues chief inspector Charles Kane has engaged in a shady deal which appears to be a criminal act something a person in his position is immediate grounds for termination. Russell and Kane go way back in the police department. Russell a decent man must get to the bottom of the situation to determine whether the chief inspector has to go.Don Siegel shot the film using locations in New York. The screenplay adaptation was written by Abraham Polonsky a veteran of Hollywood who was a good director himself and Howard Rodman. The emphasis of the action revolves around Madigan and his partner Bonaro but another probably more interesting film would have been made from the conflict between the two friends in higher places. Russell is no saint he was having an affair with a socialite but basically is a decent man. Kane on the other hand was just a good police officer whose whole family had been involved in the force in several positions.Richard Widmark does a wonderful job as Madigan a man who has problems of his own with an unsatisfied wife who is more interested in having fun which her husband was not able to provide. Henry Fonda plays the upright commissioner with his usual easy way for giving a good performance without even trying. James Whitmore is Kane the man who makes a mistake and lives to regret it thinking he has jeopardized his friendship with Russell. Inger Stevens' Julia is a tad exaggerated not feeling real. There are interesting supporting roles. The film had locations in New York City and Brooklyn but it is obvious studio sets stand for real Manhattan streets. The final sequence was filmed in Los Angeles. Russell Metty the cinematographer shows the New York of the late 1960s with flair. The music score is by Don Costa.".

	schema:reviewBody "A good solid cop story made believable by the solid performances of Widmark and Fonda. Steve Ihnat an unknown steals the show as he creates the character Barney Benesch. Benesch is the most cold blooded asocial homicidal animal you ever saw. Vicious insane suicidal and homicidal. He is never without a .45 in each hand even while carrying a sack of groceries. Good scene Widmark and his partner spot a guy in a booth in a bar that they think might be Benesch. When he expresses his resentment over being harassed Widmark tried to brush him off by saying I'm sorry. You looked like some guy from Cleveland. The guy jumps out of the booth and attacks them shouting Nobody tells me I look like I'm from Cleveland. The weak point in the movie comes when Widmark and his partner corner Benesch in a small apartment and he is behind a refrigerator with a pistol in each hand daring them to come and get him. Just before they go in a uniformed cop offers them bullet proof vests which they refuse. NO cop would do that. And if he did he would be immediately removed from duty for a psych exam. So they go in guns blazing while Benesch comes out guns blazing. Stupid end to what could have been a much better movie. But still worth watching because of a superb cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Landing in theatres two years before Airport this seems at times to be a template for the later more glossy film.  Where Airport dealt with the myriad problems of the airport manager and one of the pilots including the halting of a deranged bomber this film covers the myriad problems of a police commissioner and one of the detectives including the capture of a deranged killer.  It also has the similar elements of a secret affair with a younger girl and a dissatisfied socialclimbing wife.  Widmark even looks through a curtain the way Dean Martin did during one sequence.  All that's missing is Helen Hayes in a tweed coat and a brown hat with a pompom! This comparison actually sheds less favorable light on Airport since IT came later and was clearly inspired in it's direction and format by this film.  Widmark plays the title role a detective who with his partner Guardino allows an unbalanced killer to steal his gun and break free from custody.  The pair have 72 hours to bring the guy in or face reprimands. This does not sit well with Widmark's bored wife Stevens who has been planning to make a splash at a party which falls during this 72 hour period. Presiding over the department is Fonda who is worried that a longtime cohort Whitmore has gone dirty and who drowns his sorrows in the cleavage of young married Clark.  The story threads take place separately until like Airport they converge at the end.  The film opens excitingly enough with a showdown leading to an NYC rooftop.  Location work throughout adds to the aura of the film.  Widmark and Guardino in the last glory days when detectives still wore suits ties and HATS! make an intriguing pair of cops with Guardino coming off especially authentically.  In a less authentic moment the film asks the audience to believe that a woman pushing 30 and in bed with the suspect is really jailbait.  Things quickly get bogged down when Widmark comes home and has to deal with the lovely but shrewy Stevens.  Her role is horribly cliched by today's standards.  Maybe it was less so then.  Still Stevens manages to inject some degree of empathy along the way and even gets to wear one of those skyhigh late '60's hairdos that defy gravity.  Meanwhile Fonda wrestles tiresomely with his doubts about Whitmore all the while maintaining a stoic one note expression and seemingly walking through the film.  His icky relationship with Clark 35 years his junior! provides neither titillation nor insight into his character.  Clark's role is pretty thankless and she still has some unaccountedfor residual British accent leftover from her studies in England prior to this.  There are small but solid turns from various other character actors including North as a torch singer and Warren Stevens as a bachelor on the make.  Stroud gives a hammy bizarre performance as an informant but even he is outdone by Ihnat as the killer.  Ihnat's loud inexplicably salivating character is never adequately explained and is underpresented to the point where his apprehension isn't as climactic as it ought to be.  Incidentally the ending of this film could not be more telegraphed.  Clues are dropped in the audiences lap one after another like breadcrumbs as the climax approaches.  In all it's a slick visually interesting film with some good acting tempered by some vague scripting alternately hammywooden portrayals and a layer of rigor mortis over it.  It came at a time when police dramas had one foot in the Dragnet door and the other pointing towards Dirty Harry.  The conglomeration of the two approaches isn't always a comfortable one.".

I enjoyed Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda of course but also James Whitmore who around 25 years later also excelled in Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption. A fine film such as Madigan must have a powerful ending and that's the case here. The last 10 minutes show Siegel's mastery at his best.

So many classic cop movie tropes are there the one officer who is determined to play by the book police corruption guys in suits who show off their identification oneliners galore and aided by the aura of cool Richard Widmark brings to the screen. Plus is there a more cop name than Madigan? Many of the men in the film wear suits and fedoras with this being the late 60's and the final days in which it was common for working men to do so although there is a sense of New Hollywood creeping in with the criminals in the movie appearing in that 1970's archetype. Madigan is also one of the best uses of location never has the grit and grime of the New York streets been captured so vividly.The opening credits are a fantastic montage of New York in the early hours of the morning. This should come as no surprise as director Don Siegel had been a montage creator before becoming a director. I could happily have this movie playing in the background just to listen to the music. The score by Don Costa itself is one of the most underrated film scores I've heard it's so motivating and makes you want to go and kick some ass. Much of my appreciation of Madigan is due to the film's aesthetics. The film's plots are good if not entirely exception but men are those some fine aesthetics.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Madigan when it came out some 40 years ago. Revisited it again recently on DVD. Wow what a disappointment! As others have pointed out above they just didn't know what they wanted to do with the film. The story is absolutely atrocious full of loopholes and lack of exposition. The notes on the DVD said that Henry Fonda's Commissioner character was supposed to be the lead  and why he took the part. Then they changed it to Widmark's Madigan character. They had to force the two to have some relationship to make any sense of the story but it was thin very thin. A quick note about the music. It was indeed awful and inappropriate. But at least it was jarring enough that it woke you up during the numerous dull parts! What you can see here is the struggle to make the transition from the heroic copdetectives of the previous decades though clearly not the film noir typesto what became Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry. This struggle in Madigan was painful to watch. It was never clear why Madigan was considered such a rogue. Can you say that about Harry Callahan? NO! Just an offhand remark that he had an incident or two in the past quickly countered by James Whitmore's character saying He's a good cop. And the opening scene where Inhat's SP? character gets the best of Widmark and Guardino made absolutely no sense. Why was the villain so bad? Why all the scorn for Widmark and Guardino when they were just doing Brooklyn a favor by picking up this guy? And never explained why the villain was so heinous other than that he shot some guy. They had to have him shoot two cops later to make you think Ooooooooooooh he is very bad. Come on! And inserting all of the women into each of the character's lives then giving them the most shallow of development and no explanation of say Sheree North's character inserted into one scene so you know Madigan once had a mistress but now loves his wife. On and on. Absolutely terrible writing. A high school level. Fonda 59 and Widmark 54 were too old for their roles. But again it was a transition time in Hollywood. Still trying to use the older stars until the next generation  and a very different style of detective films  came along. Ugh!".

	schema:headline " One Weekend In June";
	schema:reviewBody "Madigan is widely recognised as being a significant influence on the spate of TV and movie cop dramas that become so popular in the 1970s. It's also quite an ambitious movie because in its 110 minutes it features a manhunt for a killer provides an insight into the complicated personal lives of police officers and contrasts the work of street cops with those in more senior roles. Maybe more significantly though it also shows how the events that take place over a single weekend in June lead a Police Commissioner to rethink the whole set of values and principles that he'd previously adhered to throughout his long and distinguished career.Tough NYPD detectives Daniel Madigan Richard Widmark and Rocco Bonaro Harry Guardino break into a tenement apartment in Upper Manhattan to apprehend a suspect who's wanted for questioning and find Barney Benesch Steve Ihnat in bed with a naked young woman. Benesch reacts by pushing the woman out of the bed and takes advantage of the distraction that this causes to disarm the two cops and escape with their guns. When Chief Inspector Charlie Kane James Whitmore informs Police Commissioner Anthony X Russell Henry Fonda about the incident the strict disciplinarian reacts by criticising the Manhattan officers for departing from the rules by attempting to make an arrest on behalf of a Brooklyn precinct and gives them just 72 hours to recapture Benesch.Some other matters that Russell has to deal with on the same day include delivering a speech at the Police Academy graduation day meeting a black preacher who claims that his son was beaten up and racially abused when arrested in connection with a sexual assault charge and also what to do about convincing evidence he'd been given of some serious wrongdoing by his oldest friend and colleague Charlie Kane. Russell is a firm believer in what's right and what's wrong and doesn't recognise any middle ground and so decides he'll have to deal headon with the accusations made against Kane.Meanwhile Madigan and Bonaro make progress in their search for Benesch by conscripting the help of a bookie called Midget Castiglione Michael Dunn and a young man named Hughie Don Stroud who'd acted as a pimp for Benesch. Working long hours and under considerable pressure Madigan also has to cope with the complaints of his beautiful wife Julia Inger Stevens who berates him for the commitment he gives to his job and the fact that it leaves her lonely and frustrated at home. She also doesn't understand why he's not more focused on gaining promotions to achieve greater status and respect. A brief amount of time he spends with his exgirlfriend Jonesy Sheree North provides a more pleasant interlude but when reports are received that Benesch has shot a couple of police officers with Madigan's gun the pressure to bring the unhinged killer to justice becomes even more intense.Despite there being many different threads to its plot Madigan never loses its impetus or clarity and through the use of extensive location work also achieves a gritty semidocumentary style which is perfect for this type of material. The characters are also interesting to watch because they're so welldeveloped and display the kinds of contradictions that are so commonly seen in everyday life. A great example of this is Commissioner Russell who demands that everyone under his control should maintain the highest moral standards at all times and yet this man who presents himself as a paragon of virtue is actually involved in an adulterous affair with a married woman. What he learns about himself and others during the course of this drama easily makes him the story's best written and most fascinating character by a considerable distance.The quality of the acting is particularly good in this movie with Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda both outstanding in their lead roles and some fine supporting performances especially from Inger Stevens and Don Stroud.".

	schema:headline " Mixed bag but interesting bridge between classic film noir and modern crime films";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Don Siegel who had a foot firmly planted in classic Hollywood and who was also a trailblazer in modernizing American action films Madigan serves the perfect bridge between the two. Cowritten by Abraham Polonsky who'd previously been on the Hollywood Blacklist for refusing to testify before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee the film follows two different NYPD police officers. One is Madigan a tough nononsense detective played by Richard Widmark trying to catch a killer and the other is the straightarrow police commissioner Henry Fonda who's balancing justice politics and an extramarital affair. The film was based on a book titled The Commissioner and Fonda's character was the original focus of the story but the producers instead changed the focus to Widmark's Madigan character so the film unfortunately ends up a an odd combination of two different stories. Both Fonda and Widmark's stories involve them having to balance their worklife and homelife but neither of those story elements seemed all that interesting. The most interesting part of the story concerned Widmark and his partner Harry Guardino on the trail of criminal Steve Ihnat. Watching Widmark and Guardino push the boundaries of acceptable law enforcement in their investigation makes this film an interesting bridge to director Don Siegel's controversial and highly influential vigilante cop film Dirty Harry he'd make a few years later. Siegel also makes great use of NYC locations that give ether film added grit and realism much like we'd later see in William Friedkin's The French Connection and Siegel's use of San Francisco in Dirty Harry. Siegel also skillfully demonstrates his own directional action sequences chops with a memorable showdown in the film's finale which features with three characters in tight quarters all with John Woostyle doublefisted pistols in each hand. Overall Madigan features an old style police detective story with a nice plot nod to Kurosawa's Stray Dog that abandons the stylistic German Expressionist roots of American film noir and instead takes the genre into new more realistic and gritty of territory even if those stronger elements get somewhat undone by dull and unoriginal subplots involving the marital lives of Madigan and the commissioner.".

In my opinion these concerns in his life are represented in an excellent way and along with Madigan's battle this turns the movie into very deep and advanced. In this movie it was intended to make the story about Madigan but the novel where the movie is based upon is called 'The Commissioner' meaning about Russell. In this movie they succeeded very well in giving them both the proper attention. Steve Ihnat always had a tendency to overact but in his role as Benesch this turned out very well and his brief appearances throughout the movie are very memorable. And there is of course the then normal use of cigarettes the powerful language the suits with hats and the wonderful music who make this an excellent movie that keeps to enjoy.".

As with most of Ken's work it's essentially about the infinite redeemability of the human spirit given half a chance.Comparisons are being made to the Full Monty but I don't quite see that. If anything it's a far better Trainspotting with jokes to replace the parts you hardly want to watch. It's hilariously funny and if you don't blurt out at least one guffaw during the film you are dead from the neck up. At the same time it is not a feelgood movie as such because it faces the stark realities of the situation of the main character head on. Their lot is fairly hopeless and unlikely to get much better.Inevitably in a film designed to fit within the constraints of the medium it compresses far more than is sensible. More development of the way Robbie comes to understand his options would have been better as would his growing relationship with Big Harry. You can forgive that as otherwise it would have been a 10 part series for TV. Budgets are tight and we all know that this would never have made it.I raise a glass to Ken we need more like him. A man who reminds us so well how the world can be a better place rather than just telling us how bad it is. That's really the Angels' Share after all.".

I wasn't disappointed by any aspect of the movie and would recommend it to anyone.The characters are real and the acting is hard to fault. The film strikes a great balance between highlighting the mistakes the main character Robbie made in the past and not being overly sympathetic and at the same time recognising that he deserves a chance to build a better future and put it all behind him. The inclusion of the scene where Robbie is confronted by one of his former victims and the victim's family was inspired.All of the performances given are believable but i'd reserve a special mention for John Henshaw who plays Harry. There's an almost intangible sadness to the character where you know he's also trying to make up for earlier mistakes in his life although the film never goes into details. Very understated and poignant in parts.Above all this is a film with heart and has something for everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday was my birthday and this was the film my wife and I decided to go out to watch even if it seemed almost all the other screens at our 'Plex were showing Spider Man. I think we made the right choice. It probably helped our enjoyment being from Glasgow enabling us to play Spot the Location as you invariably do in these situations and of course our familiarity with not only the types portrayed in the film but also their what I'll politely term vocabulary and vernacular.What it is at heart is a caper film involving four young offenders who as part of their community payback sentences get taken under the wing of a goodhearted middleaged minder well played by John Henshaw and learn that they have a penchant for whiskytasting after a sponsored visit to a distillery. From there they hatch an unlikely plan to steal for a private collector extracts from a rare cask which takes them up to the islands on an intrepid miniMission Impossible which after some ups and downs ends happily for all.The film displays Ken Loach's by now usual mix of naturalistic realism with everyday settings and improbable plotting with attendant unlikely coincidence along the way. The film starts with a couple of violent scenes to fully convey the tough environment from which the protagonists are seeking a way out but changes into a different film altogether when the four decamp to the Highlands to carry out their ingenious theft. That dichotomy in retrospect seems a little forced at times and the coincidental nature of the plotting which affords them their onceinalifetime opportunity stretches credulity as it settles into almost Ealingesque territory but it's carried off with some flair and conviction with a nice human touch at the end to send everyone home out of the cinema with a feelgood smile on their faces.The ensemble acting is as usual with Loach of a high standard. Paul Brannigan as the brains behind the misfits shines but each of the four comes across with their own personality. The dialogue is sharp and up to date with some funny setpieces thrown in too particularly those involving the wrong bike and how a recovering junkie slaked his thirst.Overall once you suspend disbelief at the plot development and denouement this is an easy film to settle down and enjoy. My wife and I certainly did happy birthday to me!".

Like all of Loach's films Angels' Share takes a look at the judicial system and how the mistreatment of criminals effects their lives. In the case of Robbie our protagonist the poor decision by the courts  coupled with his girlfriend and their newborn baby  has a profound effect on his life as he begins to put his juvenile past behind him that is until his community service officer instills a newfound interest in whiskey. These events lead up to a pivotal heist scene that plays out like something from the French new wave with a hint of British. Loach's direction has definitely adapted with the times but his adaptation of longtime collaborator Paul Laverty's screenplay is as poignant as it always is when the two collaborate. Undeniably better than last year's Route Irish  which was a very rare look into the Iraq war  and definitely worth the watch.httpdestroyallcinema.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Ken Loach does funny! Ken Loach does bleakness misery sorrow and hopelessness too but in The Angels' Share it is present only to serve the plot and not for characters or viewers to wallow in. The second in my unexpected eightstar double bill after Seeking a Friend for the End of the World The Angels' Share is a delightfully engaging story of Scottish desperation and resolve to escape the vortex into the plughole of doom.I watched it in an Inverness cinema surrounded by Scots who loved every reference injoke and scenic delight and I benefited hugely for it. Jump on a plane and do likewise. Or at least find a quiet cinema devoid of morons who bore easily if there are no explosions and settle into your seat a colourful trek through claustrophobic violent council estates to the sprawling peaceful Highland vistas.Robbie Paul Brannigan narrowly escapes a long prison sentence for yet another violent attack that has left an innocent victim's life in tatters. He remains free thanks to the work of his persuasive barrister and the small matter of the impending birth of his first baby. It isn't a hero's escape. He's an unpleasant creature who has fallen into a habit of violence and crime the kind of person you strive to avoid and write off as one of life's hopeless failures.Fortunately not everyone thinks this way least of all Loach. Leonie Siobhan Reilly the expectant mother is a gentle but strong and resolute force in Robbie's life and she supports him loves him and makes it very clear that she won't take any more of his crap. Either he sorts his life out or he'll lose her and the baby for good. The second great impact on Robbie's life comes in the form of Harry the always watchable John Henshaw the man in charge of his community service group. A gentle caring soul who is quite possibly alone in the world but for his charges he could easily be a doormat for the group of young criminals but instead they respect him because he in turn respects them. Harry sees potential in Robbie and introduces him and the group to the world of whisky not drunken swigs from a bottle in a brown paper bag but of touring distilleries tasting appreciating and understanding quality single malts and the joy of experiencing the finest of them.And that leads to a plan The Angels' Share is a strange combination of Trainspotting any number of 'one last job' capes and Whisky Galore! that confounds the myriad risks of failure. It could so easily be unpleasant because of the characters depicted but they evolve and so we care about them it could be insensitive by diluting the violent crimes they have committed but Loach never uses that brush to paint a more palatable picture it could be predictably upbeat and feelgood but the gritty reality of what they are trying to escape is never far away and they uncertainty of whether they will succeed or fall straight back into it is ever present.There is an impression of nonactors in the cast at times and occasionally it jars but it is easily forgivable because of the setting the circumstances and the camaraderie they share. The scripting is a rally track through lanes of vicious language and actions oneliners and jawdroppingly funny comments and some brutal honesty that is both tough and caring. Oh and there's one grossout moment that had most of the audience gagging and laughing simultaneously.The Angels' Share isn't a film for those who easily squirm at ripe language but it is an uplifting story of scoundrels who become rascals and just may find redemption. The big screen certainly accentuates the occasional stunning rugged scenery but this is a film that you'll appreciate just as much in the seclusion of your own living room if you can't find a screen near you playing it.If you're easily put off by the aura of 'worthy' Ken Loach then shame on you. This is easily his most accessible film yet and a great place to start if you're a Loach novice. And a knowledge of or taste for whisky is unimportant although after watching The Angels' Share I wish I could both stomach and appreciate a wee dram.Watch it!

It could so easily be unpleasant because of the characters depicted but they evolve and so we care about them it could be insensitive by diluting the violent crimes they have committed but Loach never uses that brush to paint a more palatable picture it could be predictably upbeat and feelgood but the gritty reality of what they are trying to escape is never far away and they uncertainty of whether they will succeed or fall straight back into it is ever present.There is an impression of nonactors in the cast at times and occasionally it jars but it is easily forgivable because of the setting the circumstances and the camaraderie they share. The scripting is a rally track through lanes of vicious language and actions oneliners and jawdroppingly funny comments and some brutal honesty that is both tough and caring. Oh and there's one grossout moment that had most of the audience gagging and laughing simultaneously.The Angels' Share isn't a film for those who easily squirm at ripe language but it is an uplifting story of scoundrels who become rascals and just may find redemption. The big screen certainly accentuates the occasional stunning rugged scenery but this is a film that you'll appreciate just as much in the seclusion of your own living room if you can't find a screen near you playing it.If you're easily put off by the aura of 'worthy' Ken Loach then shame on you. This is easily his most accessible film yet and a great place to start if you're a Loach novice. And a knowledge of or taste for whisky is unimportant although after watching The Angels' Share I wish I could both stomach and appreciate a wee dram.Watch it!

	schema:reviewBody "'Never judge a book by it's cover' is a line used roughly halfway through this relatively benign recent effort from British directing stalwart Ken Loach. This is a maxim to keep in mind if approaching Angel's Share with the poster's main advertising soundbite 'Scotland's answer to The Full Monty' as a trusted precursor. Like wine or whisky tasting itself much of a film's effect is to do with the aftertaste and it is only in the closing third of the film that the aforementioned tagline could bolster a challenge to be relevant at all as Angel's Share upon full viewing provides an awkward mixture of traditional 'Loachian' workingclass realism with lovablerogue schadenfreude comedy.There is much to like and take away from Angel's Share including great dialogue brilliant comedy and memorable characters. The problem is that these elements span what feels like two films fighting each other to exist in one with neither sitting comfortably together or allowing the viewer to solidify a perspective to settle on in terms of their relation to the main characters. It could certainly be argued that this should precisely be the case for the parts of the film which reflect how ambiguously and inconsistently characters in real life can behave but when Loach suddenly wants to do good on that tagline all that comes before betrays the impish happygolucky final third that is well written yet foreboded by scenes not dissimilar from the violence in films like Sweet Sixteen. Imagine some of the generic heartwarming feelgood comedy scenes in The Full Monty interspersed with gang beatings and attempted grievous bodily harm and you can imagine the failed dichotomy displayed during Angel's Share.This disharmony in tone however is pleasingly the only main fault of the film which can certainly be included as another of Loach's great accomplishments. Taken on a scenebyscene basis both the characters and the actors portraying them are addictively watchable as they blunder and plunder as worst and best they can in the context of their worlds. The theme born from the meaning of the title itself is subtly explored and comes wonderfully full circle as that aftertaste at the end is about to kick in. There is honest drama amongst the frivolous escapading much coming via the standout performance by John Henshaw as the poor guy charged with overseeing the group's community service tasks. It also includes the only known example to me of the use of 'I'm Gonna Be' 500 Miles by The Proclaimers where the lyrics actually fit the context of the story as opposed to simply occupying a clip because they are Scottish other stereotypes do exist however such as Irn Bru and kilt wearing though these also exist in logical situations even if they may grate some at the front end.Loach's style is never compromised as regards to the way the film is shot even if it strays in tone come the end of the story. Glasgow is shown rather than shown off with barely an establishing shot in sight helping to bring the viewer down to the level at which the characters themselves exist at  drab interiors hostile alleyways rundown tenement areas etc. It is when the group set off on their daring 'heist' that the beautiful shots of the Highlands offer a sensible contrast as a visual metaphor  the job at hand providing faint hope of starting afresh even though it is still a crime they are intending to commit. An awful almost tenminute tour of the whiskey distillery makes you feel like you've wandered into the filming of a tour itself rather than still watching a film but is subsequently saved by the attempted pilfering of the 'Holy Grail' of whiskies  perfectly paced and ramped up with tension. In fact the crux of the story is so well crafted it almost makes you forget how little reason you should have to root for the success of the group's plan in the first place. Intentionally ambiguous yet jarringly inconsistent Angel's Share succeeds in delivering an entertaining and memorable mixture of comedy and drama. Just ignore that tagline and watch out for the aftertaste . . .".

The dialogue is fantastic the conversations in this film seem so real and the colloquialisms provide so much humour for Scottish audiences. There have been few Scottish films lately that seem like a real Scottish film. The film also discusses a lot of other important issues i.e. alcoholism drug abuse poverty violence and gang culture.

I heard a lot about Ken Loach films before I saw The Angels' Share but I never had time to see one. I must say he is a talented director. I was impressed by the choice of actors which is very judicious. I would compliment all the actors and I would reserve a special mention for Paul Brannigan the main character. The acting is so realistic that the film seems like a real documentary about Scots'lives. The characters are friendly and endearing. We can see a lot of beautiful Scottish landscapes during the whole film and this is really pleasant. Ken Loach made an original storyline and his film allows everybody to have a great time. It is a sweet comedy hilarious sometimes but mainly poignant. The film speaks with heart humor and lightness about the social realism of delinquents. It shows that everyone deserves a second chance in life even if it is very hard to get out of a situation you were born in. Ken Loach knows how to put a strong message in simple words. The Angels' Share is a good film which is food for though. I was interested in watching it thanks to his participation at the Cannes Film Festival and I was not disappointed by any aspect of the film. If I were you I would go quickly to the cinema to see it. I would recommend it to anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robbie a young man on a community payback scheme trying to turn his life around for the sake of his newborn son comes up with a plan to give him a financial head start. He recruits his fellow offenders to his caper.The Glasgowset collaborations of Ken Loach and Paul Laverty always sit somewhere on a spectrum that runs between socialist realist politics and crowdpleasing mischief. This outing sits more towards the crowdpleasing end. As such the young protagonist's underclass credentials are evidenced merely by his scars tracksuit and chestpuffing in the face of his adversaries. His partner only ever speaks to him about pulling up his socks for their child stilted clunky exchanges that supply information and do nothing for characterisation. The young woman's thuggish family are cardboard cutout neds who speak in clichs. So characterisation is simplistic and dialogue always pure exposition. However anyone looking for some pay off in the plot will be sorely disappointed. It is pretty obvious from the beginning how things will play out with the exception of one genuinely surprising and humanistic twist. At one point Robbie is being chased by bad guys when his fatherinlaw incredulously appears like Batman in his Nedmobile to rescue him before snarling more ned clichs at him. Paul Brannigan as Robbie has a certain look and charisma but he can't act. The young actor's story in many respects paralleling the character he plays is touching and perhaps Loach and Laverty are using cinema to smuggle in some kind of social rehabilitation programme for worthy but underprivileged young men. But one part of me wishes they'd use real actors or at least send their discoveries to acting school before filming starts.As someone who grew up in innercity Glasgow I always feel I should like these LoachLaverty films and wonder if my conflicted emotions come from the part of me that is Glasgow. But 'The Angel's Share' has made up my mind for me  these films are just belowpar cinema. I get that the script is meant to be a fable but not one line of dialogue stayed with me or resonated to a deeper place. The characters like those in 'My Name is Joe' are all meant to be lovable rapscallions but the visceral violence that can be a very real event in Glasgow is not represented here and the truly pitiful aspects of these young men's pathetic and selfdestructive delusions about 'masculinity' require a complexity of portrayal that seems beyond these filmmakers. There is a psychology and dialectic at work that defies easy ideological explanation but that ease is all Loach and Laverty ever reach for. Loach's socalled naturalistic directing is simply workmanlike camerawork that fails to add shade or depth to character. I can't think of one shot in this film that struck me as cinematic.I applaud the good intentions of Loach and Laverty but their execution is sorely lacking. I think the praise they garner comes more from the middle class guilt of broadsheet critics and the desperate relief of disenfranchised Glaswegians at ANY attempt at all to portray their lives on screen. Wooden acting underrealised framing and a flat underdeveloped script  apart from a few chuckles at comments by dimwitted characters what exactly is there to like here? What is this film doing that was not done by Bill Forsyth 30 years ago only ten times better? These filmmakers need to be judged by the same standards that apply to the likes of Kevin Macdonald Edgar Wright and Christopher Nolan. Glasgow is a great city that lends itself to cinema and its people have a myriad of human tales to tell. It is a potential criminally untapped by Loach and Laverty.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having enjoyed Ken Loach's last film Looking For Eric I suddenly discovered he had a new movie out. So off to the theater I went. The movie starts off with a quick introduction to sociology while sentencing the protagonist Robbie to a few hundred hours of community service. Social issues is a recurring theme of the movie as it delves into the reasons of why people get themselves into a bad place which again stems from a bad environment which is literally spelled out. Ken Loach uses the same approach as in Looking For Eric and many of the same plot elements are present as Robbie and his cohorts hatch out a devious plan to deal with their situation. Most familiar is the protagonist's struggle to set himself straight but also in how he is trying to protect and salvage his family. Angel's Share starts off like a good movie we get to know the characters there's an involving plot and overall I was starting to like it. I found it easy to sympathize with the main character despite his conflicted personality. But then the movie starts to falter. The plot with the whiskey distillery falls short as the director takes the film in a most peculiar direction. I started to realize that I liked none of the supporting characters which are only mildly interesting due to the fact that they almost have no character and bring nothing interesting to the film except a few good laughs. By the end I was just waiting for something to happen and it didn't. The plot resolves itself in the most uninteresting manner and the jokes have long lost their steam and the film was simply running on an empty tank. To his credit Ken Loach does deserve some praise for trying to make a relatable feelgood movie.".

	schema:headline " Fantastic start lost its way";
	schema:reviewBody "The first part of this film was to me something that had never been seen before in cinema. We were drawn into the violent world of the Glasgow street thug. We saw the drugs the mindless violence the broken lives of the victims and the perpetrators. We saw the destitution of the young people in the worst parts of the city those without any hope of a future whose only recourse was to a life of drugs and crime. We saw that a selfcentred uncaring society itself had played a large part in forming these young people and had them under its heel where there was no escape. We saw the young thug facing his victim and his family in some sort of meeting as he recounted the terrible frenzied attack where he thought he was going to die. We saw the effect it had on the victim's family. And most touchingly we saw the deep remorse on the thug's face as the victim's mother remonstrated with him about the heartbreak he had created in a moment of madness and he thought about his own newborn son. And we looked at the broken lives on both sides of the table. I wouldn't have thought it possible to be so moved to compassion over a hood's life until I saw this film. Then there was the friendship and help offered to him by strangers as he tries to reform now he is a father. It would have been wonderful to see this life lifting itself out of the morass of crime and violence into a world of decency. It can and does happen and what a wonderful heartwarming tale this would have been if that had been the destination of the movie. Such an idea should not be seen as a fairy tale and discarded in favour of 'realism'. We could have seen redemption it does say it's there on the jacket we could have seen reconciliation we could have seen hope. To me the film slipped steadily after the opening scenes and the consummation of the story seems to be 'crime can pay  just be enterprising'. Or 'just one more heist and then we're through'. Really? The screenplay acting and direction were brilliant.".

His girlfriend is about to have his baby his old rival is out to get him and he can't get a job. He also has to do community service which leads him to the main plota growing love of whiskey a gift with his nose and an eventual plot to steal some of the rarest of the liquid.It's this last part that dominates the second half of the movie and it's fun for sure but also a little contrived compared to the first half which has a gritty realism to it. Brannigan and all his supporting actors is really good. If you don't know Scottish movies be prepared for some major swearing by everyone. And the Netflix version of the movie has the subtitles on because the accent makes a lot of the movie hard to hear. I think you'd be better off without them however and just get most of it without the distraction of reading.You might be able to read into the serious parts of the movie and see a valid commentary about the strength of community service and about the rough life on the streets of Glasgow. But this is more the hard nails backdrop to make the clever and rather fun almost joyous secondary plot shine brighter. It works. The movie pulls it together seamlessly maybe a hair too seamlessly by the end as you'll see. So yes an enjoyable surprise.".

As the film opens Robbie is being entered into a community payback scheme supervised by Harry John Henshaw a kindly whisky aficionado. One day Harry takes Robbie to a rural distillery. Here he learns that a percentage of whisky evaporates during the maturing process a process that is poetically named the angels' share.The second half of Loach's film watches as Robbie stumbles upon a priceless casket of whiskey. Thanks to an elaborate heist Robbie lifts several bottles of this whiskey and sells it on the black market for a large sum of money. This theft allows Robbie to skip town escape his circumstances and build a better life for his young wife and newly born son.The Angels' Share has been described by Loach as a fable. As the film unfolds Loach thus subtly injects a vein of incredulity or fantasy. Robbie becomes Loach's underclass underdog the angels' share becomes an allusion to surplus value  in this case reclaimed by the exploited  and Harry the social worker becomes Robbie's angel a kindhearted man to whom Robbie donates a share of his loot. That the film's resolution is fantastical and contrived doesn't seem to matter to Loach. What matters to him is the righteousness of Robbie the robbers theft a theft which most filmmakers would have Robbie rejecting in favour of becoming a mature reformed and upstanding citizen. But to Loach even rascals like Robbie are deemed worthy of a share. More importantly they have to take this share by force and deception.The Angels' Share is political in other subtle ways. Loach's Scots are alienated even within their own homeland inequality is widening the lowerclasses drink cheap beer and aren't privy to the fine booze their own motherland exports and even stigmatized men like Robbie are seen to possess sophisticated palettes and keen business acumen. Elsewhere the value of the film's whisky is seen to be entirely arbitrary dependent upon hype hot air market manipulation and old fashioned notions of supply and demand. Share's form and content are typical of late Loach simple camera work unfussy lighting and a plot packed with straightforward now nonthreatening leftistpolitics. Loach's workingclass archetypes also haven't changed much since the 1960s and female characters are still kept to the margins of his films. Audiences outside the United Kingdom are likely to find the film's accents incomprehensible.7.910  Worth one viewing. See Bread and Roses.".

If not for the buzz on the internet I would have never discovered this little gem. A special touch is required to make crime morph from dark to light more so to be truly original. The Angel's Share accomplishes this and more. Based around a young protagonist who is literally going nowhere other than head first into a loser's life of crime there comes a slowly built uplifting tale in spite of criminal activity. This simply isn't a bank job or normal heist retread it is purely original in that it revolves around that mysterious stuff fermented on the Scottish isle of Islay. Funnier still in this case after watching for a good 15 or so minutes I felt I was missing so much of the King's English I had to turn on the subtitles! If you love independent film without the high art you simply should see this movie. It's fiercely noncommercial universally accessible and amazingly entertaining all at once. Excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I noticed that Lawrence D. Cohen who'd adapted the Stephen Kingpenned outsider's revenge novel for the Brian De Plama original is again credited with this adaptation. Did he actually rewrite this or did they just reuse his old script? Either way I was shocked at just how closely this followed the 1976 film. Much of the same dialogue many of the same camera movements the pan shot up to show the bucket the camera beginning to spin around Carrie and Tommy as they dance etc. plus weak copycat shots of everything from the fire erupting behind Carrie to the blood falling on her from multiple angles laughably overdone in this one are all recycled here once again. They even cloned the silly getting ready for Prom montage and if you think the one here is any less corny than the one in the original you are mistaken. It is one thing to adapt a famous novel that's already been filmed and try to update it for the times but it is a whole other thing to weakly emulate another director's visual style when you are doing so.What few new things have been added here are sadly not to the overall betterment of the core story. Including cyberbullying in the mix is  in theory  a good way to update it but it isn't elaborated upon enough to make it the least bit interesting and is presented almost like an afterthought instead of it being an integral part of the story. Images of Carrie's locker room humiliation being projected in front of everyone at Prom were simply carried over from THE RAGE CARRIE 2 1999 where they project embarrassing videos of Rachel at a party. In other words this movie does absolutely nothing fresh or new with the concept. Nothing.Moretz's blossoming from an outcast to someone who could possibly be accepted by her peer group didn't come off at all. The transformation for Sissy Spacek in the original film was dramatic as she went from awkward mumbling Plain Jane to a nicelooking appealing Prom date. Here Moretz looks exactly the same before and after. Her freshfaced squeakyclean appearance throughout the film makes it's a hard swallow that Tommy vacantly played by Ansel Elgort could look at her wearing a dress and then suddenly be like Wow! when he barely paid her any mind before. I thought both Spacek and Angela Bettis in the 2002 version pulled this off better. Both actresses also actually modulated their performances something young Moretz simply does not yet have the gravitas or skill to do.It's not just Moretz who pales in comparison. Julianne Moore is one of the best actresses working today but she simply cannot compete with Piper Laurie's goforbroke thoroughly unhinged portrayal in the 1976 film. Moore is simply too lowkey and restrained to make the part the least bit memorable the same exact trap Patricia Clarkson fell into in the 2002 version. Whinyvoiced Judy Greer is just plain awful as the gym teacher and is absolutely no match for Betty Buckley's mixture of strength and compassion. A key scene in the original film Buckley's character discussing her own Prom night disaster with Carrie used as a sortof 'calm before the storm' has been removed from this one for no good reason. The fate of the character has also been altered stripping this of an important element of horror and tragedy. None of the young actors portraying the bullies are able to broadly paint their personalities on screen in a memorable or notable way. Portia Doubleday probably comes closest in her portrayal of ringleader Chris Hargensen but she still doesn't seem quite as nasty and vindictive as Nancy Allen.There was a haunting elegance to the direction score and photography in the original film and all of that is absent here. This film's ordinary visual presentation pointandshoot cinematography generic music score and CGI effects do absolutely nothing to spruce up the familiar story. In other words what exactly is the point? Like many other soulless cashgrabs remakes this will be completely forgotten here in a few years while the original film will forever live on as a genre classic.".

	schema:headline " Not terrible but you will probably find yourself bored and disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "First off let me start out by saying this isn't a terrible movie. It certainly is not one of the worst horror movie remakes out there but I can't help but feel disappointed from the 2013 version of Carrie. First off this movie does not really add anything new to the mix. It's basically a copy of the original 1976 film just with a modern setting. I generally am less critical of remakes than most so the fact that I didn't like this should indicate that it just wasn't that good. I found myself bored throughout a lot of the movie. I've already seen the original so why do I need to pay to see the exact movie again?The director really should have gone out of her way to differentiate this film from its predecessor instead of making a near shotforshot remake like 1998's Psycho. One example of a remake that attempts to add something new to the mix is Rob Zombie's Halloween. While that film was pretty weak also at least it tried to inject something new to the storyline. The only thing I can say that was better about the 2013 Carrie is that the gym teacher lived. I never understood why she died in the 1976 version since she was one of the few people that was nice to Carrie so her survival made more sense in this movie. Other than that the original far surpasses this version. If you haven't seen the original you might like this film as you have nothing to compare it with. However some that haven't seen the original still might find themselves bored. One last criticism with this version is the prom scene. You'd think with the special effects improvements between 1976 and 2013 this version's killer prom sequence would blow the original's out of the water. Not the case as the original killer prom scene was much better in my opinionOverall this wasn't a terrible film but cannot even remotely compare to the original. Those that haven't seen the first film might very well enjoy it but for those who have you most likely will leave the theater disappointed. This remake was completely unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the mix. If you've seen the original then you've basically seen this as it's a hollow copy of it.Final Rating 410".

	onyx:emotionText "First off let me start out by saying this isn't a terrible movie. It certainly is not one of the worst horror movie remakes out there but I can't help but feel disappointed from the 2013 version of Carrie. First off this movie does not really add anything new to the mix. It's basically a copy of the original 1976 film just with a modern setting. I generally am less critical of remakes than most so the fact that I didn't like this should indicate that it just wasn't that good. I found myself bored throughout a lot of the movie. I've already seen the original so why do I need to pay to see the exact movie again?The director really should have gone out of her way to differentiate this film from its predecessor instead of making a near shotforshot remake like 1998's Psycho. One example of a remake that attempts to add something new to the mix is Rob Zombie's Halloween. While that film was pretty weak also at least it tried to inject something new to the storyline. The only thing I can say that was better about the 2013 Carrie is that the gym teacher lived.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the epitome of pointless movie remakes. Never does a scene  improve upon the original or even introduce an element that might have  been overlooked or underexplored from Stephen King's source material.  It's not a shotforshot redo but in its attempt to be faithful to the  themes and subject matter nothing is presented with any spontaneity or  flair. There are no surprises and the creepiness of 1976's theatrical  adaptation has somehow completely vanished. Do the filmmakers honestly  believe they'll find audiences that are unaware of Carrie's plot or  the steady build to the spectacularly tumultuous finale?   Carrie White Chloe Grace Moretz is shy and odd attempting to stay  out of the spotlight whenever possible. At school she has no friends  and interacts with teachers and students as little as possible. Her  mother Margaret Julianne Moore is a fanatical abusively castigating  woman mentally traumatized from her own unhealthily zealous  upbringing. When the misinformed Carrie has her first period in Ms.  Desjardin's Judy Greer P.E. class she thinks she's dying and is  mercilessly ostracized by her classmates. Tormentor Sue Snell  Gabriella Wilde recognizes her cruelty and convinces her boyfriend  Tommy Ross Ansel Elgort to take Carrie to the prom as atonement. But  bullying ringleader Chris Hargensen Portia Doubleday and her violent  lover Billy Nolan Alex Russell decide to lash out at Carrie again  this time blaming her for their banishment from prom.  The opening sequence adds a touch of extra blood and distress to  Carrie's origins with Margaret's uncertainty foreshadowing the teen's  own naivety toward her physical maturation. But it also warns of the  primary visual difference with this update highly ineffective computer  graphics. Carrie is the sort of story that doesn't need to be  augmented with flashy manipulated imagery so it's particularly  disappointing that the use of CG only impairs the disturbing qualities  of the bloodsplattering conclusion. Viewers will also likely scoff at  the inclusion of a camera phone internet uploading and a Dancing  with the Stars reference. Slightly modernized recreations of  strikingly iconic sequences are almost laughable.  Chloe Grace Moretz is sadly miscast as Carrie clearly unable to convey  the unsettling awkwardness reclusiveness and eventual ghoulishness  necessary for deadly telekinetic mayhem. She's cute capable  reasoning opinionated on her own competent interpretation of the  bible and quickly learns to discipline her supernatural gift which  appears to drastically contradict the previously terrifying aura of an  abused soul pushed to the limits. Instead of snapping with her mind  spiraling out of control she is instead a lucid killer specifically  exacting revenge. As soon as she dominates her otherworldly powers  she's a superhero  not a crazed unresponsive medium of reprisal. It  also doesn't help that the supporting characters are entirely black and  white in their interactions with Carrie each one is either genuinely  remorseful or a vengeful serial killer in the making.  Julianne Moore is more comfortable in her role convincingly looking  the part but isn't scripted to bring fresh concepts to the table. And  Judy Greer is a pathetically comical choice for the gym teacher. In  compensation for an obvious avoidance of nudity a Cronenbergesque  body horror idea is appended along with a brief courtroom skit  perhaps for realism twin girl accomplices Karissa and Katie Strain  seemingly because they were handy and a supremely outofplace  dressing montage like something out of a romantic comedy. The bland  repetitive revisions to Brian De Palma's classic thriller repeatedly  summon questions as to why anyone thought it would be fruitful to  rethink Carrie so similarly especially in regards to informed  audiences of 2013.

	schema:reviewBody "Having followed this film from its initial announcement up to its release I can assure you it's not at all what we were promised. Several interviews with the cast and crew members claim it to be a more faithful adaptation of its original source the 1974 novel penned by Stephen King. It's not. No Screen Gems and MGM's 2013 revamp of 'Carrie' is more akin to that of the 1976 film which featured numerous changes from the book  all of which are still present here. This is only a minor gripe as its not an issue per say I just don't appreciate being misled. On we go.Moretz plays the titular character and whilst a fantastic young actress she was definitely lacking something here and her performance is just short of believable. Most of the time it just came off flat. I said from the getgo she was a miscast but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt  and she just didn't quite pull it off for me. It would've been advisable to hire someone a tad older with more experience but I digress.On the completely other hand Moore delivers an absolutely brilliant performance as Carrie's psychotic mother Margaret. Fantastically creepy and while she may be no Piper Laurie 1976's original her superb portrayal is the best thing in this movie  and one that longs to be in a better film.Let me compare with the original for one second. The 1976 film slowly builds Carrie's powers so when it comes to it the prom destruction is a complete shock. But here? Oh no. It was more like watching Matilda than Carrie. Levitating books humans... you name it. By the time it gets to prom the extent of her powers are no longer a surprise and it all comes off as rather tame actually. I certainly didn't get any satisfaction from it. They cranked the CGI up to 110 however. In this case less is definitely more. Director take note.The supporting cast do their best with what they're given notably Portia Doubleday as Carrie's nemesis Sue making the film not completely without its merits but when it comes down to it 2013's Carrie really just feels like a pale imitation of the 1976 film. It doesn't bring anything new or fresh to the table and it doesn't even feel like it tries to which I suppose is fine if you've never read the book or seen any of the film adaptations. But if you have you might be better off taking another visit to that prom.Like going to your own prom and not being crowned anything there's no real payoff. 410.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie ishardly a scenebyscene account of Brian De Palma brilliantly 'Carrie'. Yes it impossible not to compare any remake to its original version especially when the original is considered a classic. It is sad that with these days' shortage of originality even a seemingly talented director such as Kimberly Peirce succumbs to the commercial appeal of moviemaking in the sole interest of monetary gain resulting in watereddown quality. Well I'm not even sure if this movie will make its money back given the mediocrity in all aspects of its quality. But then again there are a lot of junks out there that make tons of money. All the efforts for the reimagining whether it be an attempt to create a franchise or sequel or to modernize the narrative has totally undermined the essence of this otherwise compelling story. The destructiveness of social isolation religious fanaticism BULLYING to name a few underlined in Stephen King's novel were in no way conveyed effectively in this movie. There is a lack of connection in Moretz's performance and she is unconvincing as a socially deprived and awkward girl. Julianna Moore as always delivers a competent performance. But she can only carry the movie so far. As talented as Moretz is she is a miscast for this movie. As such the movie is moderately entertaining at best.".

Yes it impossible not to compare any remake to its original version especially when the original is considered a classic. It is sad that with these days' shortage of originality even a seemingly talented director such as Kimberly Peirce succumbs to the commercial appeal of moviemaking in the sole interest of monetary gain resulting in watereddown quality. Well I'm not even sure if this movie will make its money back given the mediocrity in all aspects of its quality. But then again there are a lot of junks out there that make tons of money. All the efforts for the reimagining whether it be an attempt to create a franchise or sequel or to modernize the narrative has totally undermined the essence of this otherwise compelling story. The destructiveness of social isolation religious fanaticism BULLYING to name a few underlined in Stephen King's novel were in no way conveyed effectively in this movie. There is a lack of connection in Moretz's performance and she is unconvincing as a socially deprived and awkward girl. Julianna Moore as always delivers a competent performance. But she can only carry the movie so far. As talented as Moretz is she is a miscast for this movie. As such the movie is moderately entertaining at best.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have been eagerly awaiting this movie since I heard of the casting of Chloe Grace Moretz. I could totally picture her portraying the character in the style and feel created by Sissy Spacek and followed up by Angela Bettis 2002 TV movie. I knew she would be a worthy successor after seeing the film Let Me In. I was however skeptical of the casting of Julianne Moore as the religious fanatic mother of Carrie Margaret White.After seeing the film twice this weekend Julianne Moore turned out a creepy performance that should definitely garner her an Academy Award nod. Her portrayal of Margaret White was an emotional witches brew of fanaticism insanity and maternal instinct. For me it was an unexpected treat.As for Carrie Chloe Grace Moretz did a fine job. She had big shoes to fill and her performance does not top that of Sissy Spacek. However she does hold her own. In all three versions of Carrie each actress has portrayed Carrie in a different way. Each excelling in making the role their own while maintaining the artistic concept of Carrie herself. Chloe did deliver a chilling performance during the scenes where Carrie is exacting her revenge.As for the movie itself I would describe it as a remake of the 1976 film sprinkled with some additional elements from the Stephen King novel. It was very well made and the modernization is appropriate without being too obvious of the change in times i.e cell phones the Internet etc.In closing Carrie is an extremely competent attempt at remaking a classic. As I say with all remakes you have to go into it with an open mind and not with the mind set of comparing it to the original. If you do that you will find Carrie is a good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Disclaimer this movie can prove to be scarrie for those who are not a fan of the horror genre in general. For those of us who are at least for me this movie was everything but scary. First of all when I heard that Chloe Moretz will be taking the role of Carrie I was afraid that she might not be able to pull it off. In fact the only thing I was pleased to hear was that Julianne Moore will be playing Carrie's mother. She is a great choice for the role but the way she handled it as well as everything else about this movie is  over the top. I could sense the idea of wanting to make a good remake of a classic but in the end they just missed it... Chloe Moretz is a very good promising young actress I don't even wanna talk about acting abilities of Julianne Moore but they just didn't seem real here. What makes the original Carrie truly disturbing is that it's really slow paced. In its essence it's a drama about a teenage girl that is being deprived of an ordinary teenage life and experiences that come with it due to her fanatically religious and psychologically extremely questionable mother to put it lightly. And yes the plot is pretty much the same and everything but the general feel is that they rushed it. As I said everything is over the top the acting is exaggerated the relationships between the characters are unconvincing but it's biggest flaw is that you KNOW what's coming. You have Carrie doing her telekinesis stunts from the very beginning. It's almost as if she was practicing this skill from waaaaaay back making pencils float around the room flying the bread over to the toaster  you know the usual stuff. So when the real thing was supposed to happen the x was out of the equation making it quite frustrating to watch. It seems to me that to make a remake of such a classic film you need to put so much thought and effort into every little detail to make it at least convincing enough if you're not aiming to top the original. This movie seemed like someone got the idea hey let's make a remake of some classic horror movie... hmmm... which one should we pick... the Exorcist? no that's to heavy. hey how about Carrie? Sure! it has a young girl as a lead we sure have plenty of those and there's a mother  oh no don't tell me? are you thinking what I'm thinking? JULIANNE freakin' MOORE! And off they went with their brilliant idea and messed it all up. It was to hasty it was thoughtless unconvincing and at the end all I could to was to pick the flaws as I was comparing it to the original. I could go on and on about which aspects of the movie I disliked the most instead I'll just give it a 410 and never watch it again. The 2013 version at least.".

Chloe grace moretz is not my first choice to play carrie but from what I saw she did very well.

	schema:headline " WellDone Remake";
	schema:reviewBody "In the remake of the original Brian De Palma film and based off of the novel by Stephen King Carrie tells the story of young Carrie White Chloe Grace Moretz who goes through life being tormented by classmates and teachers. The only person she feels close to is her religion obsessed mother Margaret Julianne Moore. After a cruel joke one of the popular girls Sue Snell Gabriella Wilde decides to provide an act of kindness to Carrie by allowing her boyfriend to ask her to prom. But along the way Carrie starts to develop telekinetic abilities that could bring disastrous results if she's pushed too far.I believe that to compare this remake with the original and say which is better would be completely wrong and impossible. Both films have very strong aspects of their own that make them both able to stand on their own. But to discuss this version as a remake itself I would definitely have to say it was VERY welldone. The film really gets into the emotional side of the story we really get to know Carrie and get a sense of her loneliness. This in part is due to an excellent performance by Chloe Grace Moretz in what I really think is her best performance to date. She portrays the emotions of Carrie with such ease that you really feel for the character and think of her as a real person. But when it switches gears and her evil side appears Moretz provides a very chilling performance. We are also given Julianne Moore as Carrie's mother. From the start of the film and until the very end Moore shows just how unhinged Margaret White is and she does it perfectly. Her performances leaves the viewer really unsettled with her dead and haunting performance. As for the effects unfortunately this remake is filled with a lot of CGI. Does it completely ruin the film? No. But it does take away a lot of the effect. The prom scene for example while much more violent which I was pleased about the CGI was really noticeable. But despite this some of the effects combined with amazing camera shots is very welldone. One example being when two characters are involved in a car crash the impacts in the crash were very cool and slightly disturbing to watch. So overall Carrie is a very welldone and perfectly modernized remake that lets us get in touch emotionally with our lead plenty of bloody moments and most of all amazing performances by Moretz and Moore. My rating 810".

Because you had a 1976 film version a madeforTV film version which was serving as believe it or not a pilot for an ongoing series and a stage musical!. So why are we going back to this particular well? Then I heard the simply adorable Chloe Moretz was cast in the title role. It did not feel right for me at all primarily because of Sissy Spacek who played the role in the 1976 version at the age of 26. But Carrie White chronologically speaking was 16 in King's novel. As is Moretz. Okay. And then I heard this film would be closer to King's novel. So I was sold.But as I watched the opening credits I noticed the following Screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto AguirreSacasa. Up to this point I had only seen a single writing credit for the latter. And Cohen wrote the 1976 film. So why was it there? And then I found out There are several elements lifted from the earlier film version to the point I am certain the WGA required Cohen be given credit. This was making it less an adaptation of King's novel and more of a remake of a 37yearold film. So much for the promise of a closer adaptation.But then it gets worse. Much much worse. You get your first hint of foreboding when Carrie tells her mother where she got her power from. I was left thinking um..how do you know this? But then we get to the prom. The video slide show made no sense to me whatsoever. In fact I am sure it was placed there as a setup for what happens later which is lame lame lame. But I digress.Telekinesis is the ability to move andor manipulate objects with your mind. And what is Carrie doing? After she locks her mother in a room by way of superheating a sliding bolt the climax shows her levitating and hovering over a floor cracking open a stretch of road by stomping on it stopping a car from hitting her by creating a force field or shield and for good measure letting another girl know she is pregnant AND the baby's gender! Carrie doesn't merely have the power. She is a fullon mutant! I was half expecting Agent Coulson or Professor Xavier to make a cameo in a postcredit scene or something.I do not expect King to like this film. I know I didn't. Wait for it on Redbox if you feel you must watch this waste.".

In the '76 movie Sissy Spacek plays the outcast  teenaged girl abused by her classmates in school and by her mother at  home until she discovers her psychic powers...then all hell breaks  loose. It's a classic revenge tale and the original movie was good  enough to earn Spacek an Oscar.   Know this the 2013 version isn't a direct remake of the '76 movie.  While it does feel like a loving homage to the older flick it actually  stays closer to the book in terms of plot with some modern touches  perfectly sprinkled in allowing Carrie White to feel right at home in  2013.   Now know this This movie is good. Very good.  Julianne Moore takes us to a very creepy place as Margaret White and  Chlo Grace Moretz SHINES as Carrie proving that she's got more up her  acting sleeves than HitGirl. By the time you get to the end of this  movie even though you know damn well what's going to happen...you WANT  the prom to go smoothly. You WANT Carrie to be happy and you HOPE that  none of those terrible things actually happen. You're in Carrie's  corner the whole way.  And when revenge time comes along it's done with a purpose. Special  effects get dabbed in here and there but never overdone. Slomo makes  one scene sooo much more deliciously satisfying... Although I'll say  that it feels like there may have been a scene or two that didn't make  the final edit and you can really tell where that scene was...a bit  sloppy on that editing there...  Carrie does the source material justice. Welcome to our generation Ms.  Carrie White.  4 out of 5 on the BDBOS.".

Especially Julianna Moore is fantastic in this movie.Remakes are hard to like because people always compare it with the old movie. If they like the old movie they will complain about the new one. This is why this movie has low rating. But they don't understand one point if you don't remake Carrie new generation will not know about it at all. How many young person would watch 1976 Carrie? Carrie was one of the best choice to make a remake. It is not like remaking Oldboy movie which they did unfortunately.To sum up i liked Carrie 2013 and it was a good remake. I really enjoyed it because i am fan of the book and the old movie. If you don't know anything about Carrie you will like the movie. If you like the book and the 1976 Carrie movie again you will like this too. The only way to not like this movie is to have obsession about the old movie or you are not fan of this kind of movies at all".

When I heard of yet another remake of this movie I was excited to see it even though other remakes have been disappointing at best. Well I have to say that this remake was the worst of them all. It appeared this remake was trying to stick to the original but with a 21st century spin with cell phones and limos. This movie missed the mark. Since the movie was a dud from the beginning I was hoping that at least the Tommy Ross character was a dreamboat like William Katt was back in the day...NOT! Ansel Elgort not incredibly gorgeous and his acting left a horrible taste in my mouth. He was not believable at all. I have to give it to Julianne Moore she definitely gave the best performance in the movie the best of the worst. The prom scene was just a horrible regurgitation of the original movie. To say I was disappointed is just an understatement. This movie SUCKED! 6.99 to view this movie I want a refund. This movie is not worth your time. I actually had to watch the original to erase that blasphemy from my memory...and to see the dreamy William Katt again play the Tommy Ross I know and love.".

Julianne Moore delivered an unbelievably powerful and disturbing performance. She plays the absolutely crazy religious zealot mother. Judy Greer is the sympathetic gym teacher that comes alongside Carrie to help her and is pretty good she does not have a huge role but she does well with the screen time given to her. The effects were good overall they were a little lacking in a few instances but overall good. I want to say that Ansel Elgort was so good in his role I cried when his character died I mean real tears he played his role sooo well! I didn't like the slow motion death scene of Chris I thought that looked kinda strange and not really natural that was one of its few flaws. The sequences of violence weren't overly gory or too gross they were pretty moderate. The prom massacre scene is pretty well done the effects work and the teen reactions and performances work as well. Julianne Moore's death scene is well constructed with all the knives and scissors thrusting into her all at once at carries request. The other supporting actors besides the ones already mentioned did well too wanted to give them a shout out as well. So yah overall a pretty good job well done. 810.".

	schema:headline " Though remakes are tricky the cast of Carrie use their talents and special effects to make it worth seeing.";
	schema:reviewBody "Amongst the many actors and actresses who I love seeing in films or television shows is Chloe Moretz. Though mostly known for being the foul mouthed Hit Girl in Kick Ass and often being the little girl who seems more mature than how we usually picture 16 year olds in this film we are reminded that as much as she has the ability to be strong ferocious and cunning at the same time as shown in part in Kick Ass 2 she is still very much a young girl. Which leads to why Carrie perhaps was the perfect role for her for it seems to continue to show her evolution as an actress and show she isn't a one trick pony.However I would be doing a disservice to the movie if I didn't mention her co stars who really help push Carrie into a figure who you not only feel sympathy for but want to see get revenge. First I must mention Julianne Moore who plays Margaret White Carrie's mother who is a haunting presence with intense eyes and intense beliefs which makes her the parent you would only wish on enemies. Also I must mention Portia Doubleday as school bully Chris. She takes on the very familiar role of the popular girl who bullies a helpless girl and gives it new life. Then there is Gabrielle Wilde as the sort of innocent and seeking redemption Sue Judy Greer as Miss Desjardin the school gym teacher who is one of the few and first to stick up for Chloe and then there is Ansel Elgort who plays Tommy the boy who Carrie gets a crush on is Sue's boyfriend and is the one who takes her to that fateful prom.Now I'm sure most of you know the story since pretty much the trailer gives it away. A young quiet girl has a religious zealot for a mother and finds herself constantly bullied at school. One incident though begins to push her too far and with this she has an almost XMen like awakening in which powers manifest. At first she is confused then intrigued but as life gets harder and people become more difficult to deal with she stops being the victim to circumstances largely out of her control and decides to get revenge on those who have long been hurting her. Needless to say it is an interesting movie to release on Spirit Day. As for praise when it comes to this film though highly clich to say I must admit that the film was a bit intense but it is all thanks to Julianne Moore's performance. Her work as Margaret White is terrifying to the point where she could be the mother of all horror icons the one who nurtured them in such a way that no wonder they all became twisted that is how good she is. Her intensity her use of religious madness and the gruesomeness of the acts she commits against herself and Carrie make your heart race and sometimes makes you want to turn your head due to the things she does. As for Chloe Moretz she continues what we saw in Kick Ass 2 which is showing that as much as she is capable of being a badass she can also play soft someone you can sympathize with even imagine in a romance movie. And ultimately I feel that those who don't know the story may even have hope that all would work out in the end for her. Then with Portia Doubleday's Chris I feel she breaks the mold when it comes to what we think of when it comes to teenaged female villains. For a long time the standard has been based on Mean Girls Regina George specifically but I feel Portia has found a way to set a new precedent of the type of bully you love to hate. Lastly I must mention that one of the main things this remake benefits from is the special effects. Between Chloe's powers and the death of some characters you see some of the things which help justify the remake past making money.But no movie is without fault. First and foremost the amount of powers displayed by Carrie made me think I was watching a long introduction of a new X Men character or an alternate Jean Grey backstory. How often and how open she was with using telekinesis and studying it made it so that when it came to the big finish it didn't seem as grand as it did in the original movie. Also as much as I love Moore's performance it can be divisive due to it possibly being seen as over the top and maybe clichd considering she is a Christian who twists the bible to fit her sense of morality. But probably my biggest issue was the whole revenge plot which came from almost getting suspended and not getting to go to prom. It seems so ridiculous and juvenile that though you are willing to go with it at the same time as you see the effort put into the revenge you can't help but roll your eyes.Overall Worth SeeingThose who saw the original only have reason to see this due to the special effects you wish the original had and because Moore definitely goes further than the original mom. As for newcomers though not the best horror or thriller out there the performances and gore are sure to entertain you and give you something to talk about. However I don't know if this is the type of film I would rush to see since it is good but certainly doesn't have the makings of a classic. Still I think it made for a nice way to spend a little more than an hour and a half.".

	onyx:emotionText "Amongst the many actors and actresses who I love seeing in films or television shows is Chloe Moretz. Though mostly known for being the foul mouthed Hit Girl in Kick Ass and often being the little girl who seems more mature than how we usually picture 16 year olds in this film we are reminded that as much as she has the ability to be strong ferocious and cunning at the same time as shown in part in Kick Ass 2 she is still very much a young girl. Which leads to why Carrie perhaps was the perfect role for her for it seems to continue to show her evolution as an actress and show she isn't a one trick pony.However I would be doing a disservice to the movie if I didn't mention her co stars who really help push Carrie into a figure who you not only feel sympathy for but want to see get revenge. First I must mention Julianne Moore who plays Margaret White Carrie's mother who is a haunting presence with intense eyes and intense beliefs which makes her the parent you would only wish on enemies.

	schema:reviewBody "Caution This may contain spoilers.We all knew it would happenthe film would inevitably be compared to the 1976 original helmed by Brian DePalma with the estimable Sissy Spacek in the title role. A sharply divided reception was predictable. And that's a shame. The Kim Pierce iteration is one that pays homage to the original here and there but was ultimately meant to stand on its own as an adaptation of the classic Stephen King novel. But we all knew that a remake by simple virtue of being a remake would elicit the position that it is completely unnecessary. Again that's a shame. In the hands of Kim Pierce the plot focuses on social issues that necessitate a retelling. It is evident from how the present film is handled that it is not created in the same vein as remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Psycho or any other project meant to turn a quick buck for a studio at the expense of originality or a younger generation's unawareness of the original. Times have changed and the problem of bullying has evolved along with it. It is this problem that the sociallyconscious Pierce sought to address.Having watched both the original and the remake with a much younger nephew certain moments in the original while still terrifying were lost to him for stylistic reasonssomething a viewer might call campiness. This is something the remake has remedied. I suppose what was effective in the 1970s is not as effective to a less sensitized generation of moviegoers who crave realism over theatricality. A younger audience is likely to appreciate the naturalness of Julianne Moore's acting or relate far better to Chloe Grace Moretz's portrayal of the sheltered teen. While the target audience will surely appreciate the film so will fans of the Stephen King novel. Many but not all plot elements that were woefully omitted from the 1976 film are given a rightful place in the new film giving the story much more coherence and unity.The most striking aspect is the motherdaughter relationship. Pierce Moretz and Moore handle the dynamic beautifully. The lovehatefear relationship is more fully fleshed out than in the original. Whereas Piper Laurie's portrayal of Margaret White remarkable in its own right is of a maniacal fundamentalist who oppresses her daughter Juliane Moore's is of a damaged woman who has probably lived through one too many mental breakdowns. While viewers will always appreciate the theatricality of Piper Laurie there is a certain undeniable grittiness to Moore's more psychological version of Carrie's abusive mother. Moore's Margaret is not all fireandbrimstone either. There are flashes where one sees profound maternal instinct and care for her daughter. Certain added scenes give Pierce the opportunity to put Margaret and Carrie in a kind of Abraham and Issac scenario which makes it difficult for the audience to completely think of Margaret White as an antagonist. Moore's Margaret is at times Carrie's enemy and at other times her protectoran uncomfortable situation for the viewer and Pierce pulls it off flawlessly.I had misgivings about the casting decision with Miss Moretz. She is a beautiful young lady who I feared would not portray the outcast well. This misgiving was soon forgotten however early as the film progressed. Sure she's a beautiful girl but she pulled off Carrie's shy awkwardness convincingly. She is not Sissy Spacek but she didn't try to be. Comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges. We will always have Spacek's bloody wide eyed visage in our minds when we think of Carrie. But while Spacek gave off creepy Moretz's portrayal is more human and sympathetic. One might view Spacek's Carrie as robotically vengeful whereas Moretz's telekinetic feats lead to unintended regrettable consequences. To Moretz the power is at times too much for the girl to handle. Overall Moretz's Carrie is closer to the one I envision when I think about the novel. I prefer Spacek's iconic stare admittedly but that's not to say Moretz wasn't convincing. Rather her portrayal was prodigiousof high caliber for an actor her age.Perhaps the greatest pro the remake has over the original is the more wellrounded secondaries Sue Tommy Chris and Billy. Fans of the book may have been bothered by Travolta's drunken greaser portrayal of Billy Nolan. At last Alex Russell's Billy is closer to the sociopathic teen in King's book. Sue and Chris are not mere pawns in the storyline here. The acting ability of certain secondaries seems wanting at times but the characters themselves are given a greater purpose here.Does this live up to the original? I suppose that would be a completely subjective assessment. Both films have pros and cons. Taken on its own however the film is not a great one but it's strong. It flows naturally. It is deeply psychological not just for Carrie and Margaret but for the other characters too. Ultimately it was worthwhile and I don't doubt it will be memorable to its target audience as the 1976 film is for older viewers.There are some more concerns however. It is clear that some scenes were filmed and left out. Like the original bits and pieces of the deleted scenes found their way into various places in the plot. It makes me wonder whether Pierce envisioned the film to be even closer to the novel as stated in early interviews. Note that Judy Greer stated in a more recent interview that upon seeing the finished product from the beginning it did not follow the shooting script. Apparently there were huge and significant alterations made in the studio during the release date delay. Such is a common practice for a studio or test audience to trim excellent essential scenes out of a film for brevity. Here's to hoping for a Director's Cut for the home release honoring Pierce's original vision. Perhaps my rating will be even higher then.".

Carrie is bullied her mother abuses her and she's coming of age except her puberty is telekinesis with a little revenge. Had this been a drama it might work better instead of hiding behind the image of an all out horror film. The magic of the original is gone.

	schema:reviewBody "Allied Artists stunning INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is arguably the finest SciFi movie ever made. Produced in 1956 by Walter Wanger it was perfectly written for the screen by Daniel Mainwaring who also wrote Out Of The Past which derived originally from the Colliers magazine story and then a novel by Jack Finney. Beautifully photographed in black  white and in the short lived widescreen process Superscope by Ellsworth Fredericks the picture is a triumph on all fronts with bracing cinematic nous and expertise from all departments thanks to the committed and adroit direction by Don Siegel. This movie came from early in the great director's career. He had started off at Warner Bros. doing special effects on such things as Casablanca1942 and Edge of Darkness 1943 before he started directing. His first feature to direct was the Sidney Greenstreet classic The Verdict in 1946 and then garnered great praise in 1954 when he directed Walter Wanger's tough and gritty prison drama Riot In Cell Block 11. Latterly Siegel is better known for his association with Clint Eastwood for whom he directed some of the actor's most memorable films. In 1976 he directed John Wayne in his final film The Shootist and Siegel's own final film was the best forgotten Bette Midler vehicle Jinxed in 1983. Don Siegel died in 1991 but of all his films he will probably be best remembered for Wanger's two classics Riot In Cell Block 11 and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.On his return home after attending a medical conference in the city a young small town doctor Kevin McCarthy finds some of his patients acting somewhat strangely. It is not too long before he discovers much to his horror that their very bodies have been taken over by an alien life form. Further investigation establishes the strange life form germinated in giant seed pods that were placed near their victims as they slept. Without any noticeable difference in their physical appearance the aliens perfectly replicated the human form with one exception the new beings have no human feelings or emotions. Soon everyone in the town is affected including the police and all of the doctor's friends. Now together with his girlfriend Dana Wynter he must endeavour to escape from the town  get to the capital and warn the authorities. But in order to survive and make the journey they not only have to evade the now alien townspeople who are pursuing them en masse but ensure at all costs that they don't fall asleep.Although the cast is made up mostly of minor players the performances throughout are uniformly excellent. Kevin McCarthy  he of the chiseledjaw  a fine character actor in anything he did is good here as the main protagonist imbuing his role with just about the right degree of fear and trepidation. The lovely Dana Wynter  she of the cute little upturned nose  is as attractive as ever in what must be her most memorable role. Also interesting are well measured portrayals from such minor actors as King Donovan Carolyn Jones in one of her early films Virginia Christine Larry Gates and Ralph Dumke as the police chief. And watch out for the unknown Sam Peckinpah in a tiny part as a meter reading gasman and later towards the end  when an exhausted McCarthy finally reaches the busy freeway  Pechinpah leading the pursuers shouts Let him go......they'll never believe him. There are also some lovely moments of pure film noir! Ellsworth Frederick's monochrome camera makes ingenious use of light and shadow up and down narrow office corridors McCarthy and Wynter hiding from the police in an office closet and particularly brilliant is the clip when the pair are silhouetted against the dimly lit wet streets and alleyways at night as they race hand in hand to escape their incredible nightmare. And holding the whole thing together is the splendid score  if perhaps a tad over emphatic  from composer conductor Carmen Dragon.INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is not only a superb SciFi adventure but more significantly it is an imaginative intense and suspenseful thriller of a motion picture.

	onyx:emotionText "Allied Artists stunning INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is arguably the finest SciFi movie ever made. Produced in 1956 by Walter Wanger it was perfectly written for the screen by Daniel Mainwaring who also wrote Out Of The Past which derived originally from the Colliers magazine story and then a novel by Jack Finney. Beautifully photographed in black  white and in the short lived widescreen process Superscope by Ellsworth Fredericks the picture is a triumph on all fronts with bracing cinematic nous and expertise from all departments thanks to the committed and adroit direction by Don Siegel. This movie came from early in the great director's career.

Packs eerie suspense  chills  thrills  spectacular scenes  chilly events and pretty turns and twists . A ceaselessly inventive  ghastly rendition of the alien takeover paradigm  including a a nice builtin paranoia so well tuned for the times that some saw it a parable Communist Witch Hunts. The one and only postMcCarthy paranoid fantasy epic  where a small California town is infiltrated by pods from outer space that replace and replicate human beings . It profits from a winning and intense acting by Kevin McCarthy along with an enjoyable Dana Wynter  furthermore  a perfect direction by maestro Donald Siegel who proved himself master of the eerie clutch at the base of one's spine . Appropriately exciting and frightening musical score by Carmen Dragon . Very good cinematography and evocatively eerie ambient  including appropriate production design .

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Miles J. Bennell Kevin McCarthy is called back to his small California home early from a conference because a number of his patients have been frantically asking to see him. But oddly when he returns home most forget about their unspecified needs. At the same time it seems that a mass hysteria is building where residents believe that friends and loved ones are not themselves literally. Just what is going on? As of this writing it has been more than twenty years since I have seen the 1978 remake of this film so I can't compare the two at the moment. However it would have to be flawless to top this the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers.The sole factor that caused me to give the film less than a ten was the pacing during portions of the first half hour or so. While it's not bad exactly director Don Siegel does not build atmosphere and tension as effectively as he might have while the viewer is being filled in on the necessary exposition. Admittedly this section is directed in a standard way for its era but standard here is enough to subtract a point.However once we reach Miles' friend Jack Belicec King Donovan discovering a body on his billiard table the suspense and tension gradually increase and the remainder of the film is a very solid ten.The literal weapon of the film's horror could have easily come across as cheesy but it doesn't. Don Post and Milt Rice's special makeup effects and props are threateningly eerie. The transformation sequences involving the props are beautifully shot and editedshowing just enough to make them effective but not so much that the mystery is gone.It was ingenious to create a story where a whole town gradually turns into a villain and even natural unavoidable biological functions threaten our heroes' destruction. In conjunction it all creates an intense sense of claustrophobia and paranoia for the audience.McCarthy and Dana Wynter as Miles' girlfriend Becky Driscoll expertly convey a gradual transformation from common citizens to panicstricken desperate victims on the run. The film is also notable for slightly aheadofits time portrayals of relationships and divorce.Much has been said about the parallels between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the communist paranoia in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s especially as it was directed against Hollywood by the House of UnAmerican Activities Committee. And how ironic that the star of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is named McCarthy? However there is another very interesting subtext present that isn't so often mentioned. The film can also be looked at as a philosophical exploration of personal identity. Just what does it take for people to be themselves? Is it how they look act the things they say? Is it not the case that people are constantly transformed into something they weren't just hours ago or even moments ago? Among the many ways that these kinds of ideas are worked into the script is that sleep is a metaphor for unconscious physical change over time. It would be easy to analyze each scene in the film in this manner going into detail about the various implications each plot development has on the matter of personal identity.Despite the slight pacingatmosphere flaw in the beginning this is a gem of a film not just for scifi and horror fans and not just for its era. It's worth seeing by anyone with a serious interest in film and can be enjoyed either on its suspenseful surface level or more indepth by those who want to look at the film as more metaphorical material for societal and philosophical concerns.".

Many subsequent movies have been influenced by this one and there have been at least two remakes Philip Kaufman Abel Ferrara but it still takes some beating! Director Don Siegel is best known for tough guy crime dramas like 'The Killers' and 'Dirty Harry' but shows his versatility with this extremely effective and disturbing horror story. The legendary Sam Peckinpah had an uncredited hand in the script and keep an eye open for a small cameo as a meter reader. Kevin McCarthy is terrific as the small town doctor turned hero. His performance is excellent and made him a legend to SF and horror fans everywhere he reprises it briefly in Kaufman's excellent 1970s remake by the way. The lovely Dana Wynter leads a strong supporting cast and buffs will get a particular kick out of seeing Carolyn Jones a.k.a. Morticia Addams and Whit Bissell. 'I Was A Teenage Werewolf' 'Creature From The Black Lagoon' and too many others to mention! This movie has aged very well much better than say 'The Thing From Another World' and still stands as THE 1950s paranoid SFhorror movie. An absolute classic that I guarantee still packs a punch! Highly recommended!".

Then you'll see why the film scared studio executives so much that they forced Don Siegel to add an intro and outro to help soften the overall effect.

	schema:reviewBody "A chilling motion picture well directed by Don Sigel with a script cowritten by Daniel Mainwaring and uncredited Sam Peckinpah based on the novel The Body Snatchers aka Sleep No More by Jack Finney.The excellent musical score is by Carmen Dragon.  Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter head the cast of this fourstar classic in which the inhabitants of a small California town are being replaced by alien lookalikes.  The aliens come to Earth in the form of seed pods that burst open and spew out a foam which grows into human duplicates    complete with all the memories of the original.  The best scene in the film takes place in a greenhouse where several alien pods burst open and disgorge the halfformed copies of the horrified humans.A prologue a new ending and a voice overnarration were added after the film's initial release to help the audience follow the strange plot.  In the added scenes the story opens with Kevin McCarthy being brought into a hospital raving about alien invaders.  Two doctors Whit Bissell and Richard Deacon listen to McCarthy's strange story which the audience sees as a flashback.  At the end of he movie the doctors are understandably skeptical about McCarthy's weird yarn but an unexpected event lends credence to his story.Many film reviewers criticize these added scenes as unnecessary an unwise attempt to conclude the story with a happier ending.  But these scenes serve a valuable purpose increasing the viewers sympathy for McCarthy and his efforts to convince someone that mankind is in danger.  The alleged happier ending does not establish that mankind will win the battle against the aliens.  It simply implies a Chapter Two in this epic struggle.  Mankind will have a fighting chance in the war but the outcome is definitely open to debate.".

The aliens come to Earth in the form of seed pods that burst open and spew out a foam which grows into human duplicates    complete with all the memories of the original.  The best scene in the film takes place in a greenhouse where several alien pods burst open and disgorge the halfformed copies of the horrified humans.A prologue a new ending and a voice overnarration were added after the film's initial release to help the audience follow the strange plot.  In the added scenes the story opens with Kevin McCarthy being brought into a hospital raving about alien invaders.  Two doctors Whit Bissell and Richard Deacon listen to McCarthy's strange story which the audience sees as a flashback.  At the end of he movie the doctors are understandably skeptical about McCarthy's weird yarn but an unexpected event lends credence to his story.Many film reviewers criticize these added scenes as unnecessary an unwise attempt to conclude the story with a happier ending.  But these scenes serve a valuable purpose increasing the viewers sympathy for McCarthy and his efforts to convince someone that mankind is in danger.  The alleged happier ending does not establish that mankind will win the battle against the aliens.  It simply implies a Chapter Two in this epic struggle.  Mankind will have a fighting chance in the war but the outcome is definitely open to debate.";

A home a car and a career are all great to strive for in one's life. But love compassion and emotion are the true gifts to keep living in the first place. Imagine a home without love or any emotion what so ever. None. Good or bad. One by one Kevin Mcarthy and Dana Wynter are confronted by the loss of neighbors associates and friends. The horror of the loss of everything they new. Early on when a boy thinks his mother isn't his mother and a friend doubt's her uncle is who he says he is. Doctor Miles is confused and doesn't know what to believe. So he goes with common sense. His eyes see there is no problem. But The evidence piles slowly and precisely.

	schema:headline " A Very Exciting and Often Involving Noir Fantasy Thriller Recommended";
	schema:reviewBody "The decision to make this fascinating novel into a noir thriller worked very well on its own merits as an adventure with mostlyimplicit ideas as motivations however I believe the film could have been made into a dramatic work of unusual power It is BW swiftpaced intelligently acted and unusually welldirected by Don Siegel with a literate script by Daniel Mainwaring. The project is also interesting and disturbing for a number of reasons. Jack Finney wrote a novel in the 1950s which some read as a loss of American individualism and others as an attack on ColdWar mentality realpolitik. Whatever the wellsprings of this fine idea Finney's story treated of seeds from space the idea is that these came to Earth and have the power to reproduce themselves into any living thing's form right down to its thought patterns memories etc. But of course they have no emotionsthey are merely replicas not the originals. A mass hysteria grips the town of Santa Mira California shortly after their secret arrival on our planet and Dr. Miles Bennell is called home from a conference because a dozen people claim some relative or beloved friend is not who they were before. When this seems to die down Miles has time to pursue old flame and lovely Becky Driscoll now that both their divorces are final. But the problem does not disappear and cannot be explained away by a psychologist friend of Bennelle's thoughtfully played by Larry Gates. Bennell and his friend Jack Belicec and his wife Teddie find a body on Jack's pool table his wife think's it's an alien thingto replace Jack. They three flee to Miles's house and Bennell goes to get Beckycarrying her off into the night. The next day looks sunny and normal except that they find huge seed pods in Bennell's greenhouse turning intosomething else. Or someone? The remainder of the film consists of Bennell trying to call for help observing the distribution of seeds in trucks in the small town's center being trapped in his office overcoming two guards fleeing and losing Becky to the monsters before he finally convinces authorities that he is not insane this requires an accidentto a truck carrying giant seed pods from Santa Mira. As Bennell Kevin McCarthy is quite good if not ideal. Dana Wynter is classically good as Becky King Donovan and Carolyn Jones are the Belicecs she doing a great deal with little to work from. Ralph Dumke as the Police Chief and Virginia Christine as Becky's Aunt Wilma are also standouts. Others in the cast include Kenneth Patterson Tom Fadden Guy Rennie and Jean Willes as Bennell's nurse. The production values are all good by my standards but only the direction is outstanding except for the special effects. Carmen Dragon supplied eerie music suitable to the action. The loss to the film occasioned by its being made as a frightening adventure can be gauged best perhaps by comparing the qualities of Raymond Chandler's The Little Sister with the enjoyable adventurelevel film Marlowe made in the 1970s. What we have here is a taut and often moving entertainment what we might have had could have contained every element here but could also perhaps have been even more intriguing. The theme of the film is what makes a person human and no stronger idea for an idealevel fantasy can perhaps be imagined. But what we have here is a famous and interesting thriller in its own right I like the envelope involving Richard Deacon Whitner Bissell and others as the doctors at a mental hospital to which a raving Bennell is taken when he escape Santa Mira's nightmare. The original They're here! ending to me would have been unacceptably alarmist.".

Your memories come to life in another body that looks like you and acts like you but it's not you.  It's a podperson from outer space who has reproduced himself as you.  This is the terror of Invasion of the Body Snatchers one of the most dystopian and original science fiction stories ever written.  The DVD includes a 1985 interview with Kevin McCarthy who says he never thought the film had any symbolism or allegorical message.  That came later he says.  He quotes author Jack Finney as saying he Finney never wrote it that way.  I saw this movie in 1956 it is likely the first movie I ever saw in a theater and never felt then or now that it has any symbolic meaning.  It's a scary story that flat out rocks and I recommend you approach it as such.  But this does beg the question of all those comments about the aliens who don't need love or any emotion who believe humanity is better off without them.  Why are they in the script and what do they mean?  I want to suggest they are what makes the podpeople scary.  The notion of assimilation is inherently scary of course and one could argue that no embellishment is necessary but I think the story as a story is weakened without it. There is a continuity error in this story that has bothered me for more than forty years.  Spoiler alert just in case.  In the final sequence Becky falls asleep just for a moment and wakes up a pod person but that's not how the assimilation takes place.  They come at night during sleep and snatch human memories that are migrated into a copy of the original body. Miles speculates that the original body simply disintegrates and the soul perishes.  Becky should have died and another Becky with her memories should have appeared but that body should never have regained consciousness as a pod person or human.  A minor nit really that bothers me less now that I understand it is a nit.  The original movie does not contain the opening scene at the hospital or the epilogue also at the hospital.  They were added because the studio felt the original ending was too depressing.  Some feel these additions do not work but I am not one of them.  They add considerably in fact to the power of this story.  Miles' face in the closing scene is a vivid memory I've carried for almost half a century.  His reaction is a catharsis for him personally and his audience.  It's a powerful vicarious emotional experience and the movie would be not nearly as good without it. Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter are outstanding here.  Wynter is one of the most beautiful women ever to appear onscreen and her first entrance is stunning.  Jean Willes and King Donovan are good in supporting roles.  This is one of the best pictures of its year of its decade and dare I say it of all time.  9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the quintessential scifi film of the 50s praying on the particular fears and paranoias of the time as well as more basic instinctual phobias within each of us.  The story is simple enough about a benevolent intellectual doctor returning from vacation only to find that some weird unexplainable feelings have been generated in the small town of Santa Mira.  Some people say that relatives are not who they seem to be despite being exact duplicates physically and mentally.  This leads to one discovery to another for the good doctor his girl and two friends and what we have through each discovery is one more piece to the puzzle that an alien presence is at work.  What makes this film so successful is the pace and frantic mood it creates.  We are caught up in Dr. Bennel's work his fears and anxieties his discoveries and his uncovering of the truth.  We feel confined betrayed and even suspicious of everything he encounters. Credit for this certainly must go to director Don Siegel and his outstanding ability to create this almost claustrophobic atmosphere as well as to Kevin McCarthy who does an outstanding job playing the doctor.  There are scenes in this film that live on long after viewing it...and the last one in particular has forever been etched into my mind.

He and his sweetheart the beautiful DANA WYNTER are soon aware of the situation enveloping the small town residents and make an effort to alert the authorities but find that no one can be trusted to be whom they claim to beand are soon on the run themselves.It easily remains one of the most gripping of these films with an excellent score by Carmen Dragon. KEVIN McCARTHY DANA WYNTER VIRGINIA CHRISTINE WHIT BISSELL KING DONOVAN and CAROLYN JONES all deliver fine performances and director Don Siegel keeps the suspense taut until the final scene.Summing up Alien invaders have always been a big part of scifi stories but never quite as creepily as depicted here.

And again yes it is a great directorial achievement for Don Siegel. All that aside it is also an entertaining film that does what any great movie should do it moves. The dialog is not stilted or full of clichs. It is original and insightful without becoming preachy. Was Kevin McCarthy chosen because his name was McCarthy and the film runs counter to McCarthism? I think he was chosen because he was one of the gifted actors of the 1950's whose talents were not fully realized by the film industry. His fellow actors and actresses in the movie shared the same fate. The movie is also a top notch thriller as good as any Hitchcock. When you're talking about the films of the 1950's that help define the period only a few come to mind The Wild One Rebel Without A Cause and Bad Day at Black Rock are often cited. But The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the one to study. It epitomizes the American outlook and cold war hysteria of the era as no other film from the decade does.".

Now in daylight the suspense is made more potent the threat to humans seems greater. Kaufman does this scene at night losing the mundane horror that Siegel evokes so well.

As it turns out there's an alien race propagating via pods which take the face and form of human beings even absorbing their memories though not feelings. Their intention is to completely take over the human race by substitution with the 'pod people'.A lot has been said about the political metaphors that one can draw from this book and film  even without those metaphors I'd say it works fine as a 50's scifi paranoia piece. The plot is absolutely firstrate and the mainstay of the film's power. It builds up in a generally credible manner although there is some unintentional humor in scenes like when a couple that discovers a growing body in their home does little more than inviting the local physician and his fiance over for a drink to discuss this matter over. The pod people are depicted in a convincing way as beings that have the form and memories of people but not human emotions which they consider unnecessary baggage.Siegel directs the proceedings in a crisp fashion. There are some very nice visuals for instance the scene where they discover a host of pods in the greenhouse all tilted angles and tight closeups effectively conveying the tension of the scene. Another is when the leads hide in a mine while trying to escape from a mob of the pod people great use of shadows and perspective shots.The film ends on a somewhat upbeat note with the hero managing to convince the authorities of the dastardly invasion.".

Once back he begins to hear strange stories of people not being themselves  being replaced by cold emotionless imposter's. At first the doc laughs it off as some sort of mass delusion but evidence soon begins to mount that there may be more to the stories than he first thought  after seeing strange large seed pod type 'things' turning into people he know before his very eyes the doc is convinced that these alien seed pods intend to take over the entire Earth as they seek to clone very living person turning them into emotionless shells...Originally having the working title They Came from Another World this Don Siegel directed classic slice of modest low budget black and white 50's SciFi alien invasion flick is a terrific film  is far removed from most stereotypical cheap 50's potboilers with a real tense atmosphere  a pretty creepy  intelligent story. Clocking in at under 80 minutes with the studio tacked on start  ending with the original version running a mere 75 minutes this moves along like a rocket the story is tight taught makes sense people  character's behave in a fairly believable way  the central plot is both gripping intriguing  certainly draws you in. The plot relies on generating paranoia just like another classic 50's SciFi film The Thing from Another World 1951  it's no coincidence that the two are two of the finest genre films of the 50's. There's good tension  it is sustained  increased as the alien plot unfolds the basic concept of who one can trust is a very primeval instinct  that's maybe why these films are so effective. It's not perfect though it's never explained what happens to a persons body after they are cloned  the alien version comes to life  the climax at the cave doesn't quite work either with Becky going to sleep but then seemingly reawaken taken over. Why was she not cloned? Why was her mind taken over  not anybody else's? If she was cloned how did the alien version get inside the cave? Watch it think about it  the story  it just doesn't quite work which is a shame since otherwise it's a terrific film that still manages to be very effective even today in the ultra cynical world of 2008.While most 50's SciFi at the time featured actor's in badly fitting rubber alien suits  car hubcaps hung on string to portray a flying saucer Invasion of the Body Snatchers relies on atmosphere  tension in fact apart from the large alien seed pods there's no special effects at all. Proved iconic enough to spawn three direct remakes starting with Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978 which is my own personal favourite version  moves the action to San Francisco Body Snatchers 1993 which shifts the action to a US military base  the more recent The Invasion 2007 with Nicole Kidman  Daniel Craig while the highly entertaining teen horror flick The Faculty 1998 has basically the same plot.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about 417000 which really is no money even back then crisply shot in black and white although a computer colourised version has been released the film has a modest but nice look to it. The acting is pretty good but this is one of those films where the story really carries it.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a classic piece of 50's SciFi that stands head  shoulders above it's peers from the time a great film that still remains very effective even when viewed today. Often cited as a classic I find it hard to argue against that.".

There's good tension  it is sustained  increased as the alien plot unfolds the basic concept of who one can trust is a very primeval instinct  that's maybe why these films are so effective. It's not perfect though it's never explained what happens to a persons body after they are cloned  the alien version comes to life  the climax at the cave doesn't quite work either with Becky going to sleep but then seemingly reawaken taken over. Why was she not cloned? Why was her mind taken over  not anybody else's? If she was cloned how did the alien version get inside the cave? Watch it think about it  the story  it just doesn't quite work which is a shame since otherwise it's a terrific film that still manages to be very effective even today in the ultra cynical world of 2008.While most 50's SciFi at the time featured actor's in badly fitting rubber alien suits  car hubcaps hung on string to portray a flying saucer Invasion of the Body Snatchers relies on atmosphere  tension in fact apart from the large alien seed pods there's no special effects at all. Proved iconic enough to spawn three direct remakes starting with Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978 which is my own personal favourite version  moves the action to San Francisco Body Snatchers 1993 which shifts the action to a US military base  the more recent The Invasion 2007 with Nicole Kidman  Daniel Craig while the highly entertaining teen horror flick The Faculty 1998 has basically the same plot.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about 417000 which really is no money even back then crisply shot in black and white although a computer colourised version has been released the film has a modest but nice look to it. The acting is pretty good but this is one of those films where the story really carries it.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a classic piece of 50's SciFi that stands head  shoulders above it's peers from the time a great film that still remains very effective even when viewed today. Often cited as a classic I find it hard to argue against that.";

This movie doesn't feature monsters violent deaths or scenes of widespread destruction but instead focuses on a far more insidious threat that seems impossible to stop and robs people of their humanity. This quiet invasion deprives its victims of their individuality their emotions and even their objectivity because after being transformed the people concerned are conditioned to believe that a life without love desire ambition and faith is not only simpler but also preferable to the way in which they'd lived previously. The full horror of what takes place is conveyed through the experience of a small town doctor who as a result of all that he sees and learns goes from being perfectly calm and rational to being hysterical terrified and completely out of control.It's in this highly agitated state that Dr Miles Bennell Kevin McCarthy is admitted to a hospital emergency room where he's invited by a psychiatrist to describe the events that led to his current meltdown. Bennell explains that following a request from his nurse he'd returned to his Santa Mira practice from a medical convention to deal with a sudden high demand for his services but on his return the numerous patients who'd wanted to see him urgently had changed their minds. It soon became evident however that something unusual was going on in the town because first a little boy who insisted his mother wasn't his mother was brought in to see him and then he visited his exgirlfriend's cousin who'd reported that her uncle wasn't her uncle. As there didn't seem to be any rational explanation for the apparent delusions that these people were suffering Bennell had spoken to local psychiatrist Dr Kauffman Larry Gates who thought that what was happening was probably an epidemic of mass hysteria.Bennell started to rekindle his romance with Becky Driscoll Dana Wynter who like him had recently been divorced. When the couple were out on a date one night he'd received a telephone request to visit his friend Jack Belicec King Donovan who'd found what looked like a human body on his pool table. Disturbingly it resembled Jack but didn't have any fingerprints or all of his facial features. Later Bennell also found a similar incomplete duplicate of Becky in the basement of her house but when he called in Dr Kaufmann to see the bodies they'd disappeared and so Kaufmann simply assumed that Bennell was as deluded as some of his patients.When Bennell Becky Jack and his wife Teddy Carolyn Jones were together one night at Bennell's greenhouse and saw replicas of themselves emerging from huge seed pods it became clear to Bennell that the townsfolk were being replaced by duplicates and that the changeover was taking place when they were sleeping. Bennell tried to contact the FBI for assistance but failed because the telephone operator repeatedly told him that the lines were busy and soon after seeing further evidence that confirmed his theory and realising that he and Becky were the only citizens left in the town who hadn't been replaced decided that they had to go on the run. The events that followed had then led to his breakdown.Screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring's brilliant adaptation of Jack Finney's original story called The Body Snatchers features dialogue that's both economical and effective and this together with Don Seigel's superb direction clearly played a major part in the success of this movie which now enjoys classic status. Seigel injects great energy drive and pace into the action and also does a great job of building the looming sense of paranoia which becomes ever more prevalent as Bennell's predicament makes him increasingly isolated and desperate. The scene in which Bennell and Becky hide in a trench and watch their pursuers run over the planks that cover them is quite inspired and perfectly executed.The fears expressed on this movie e.g. loss of identity individuality and humanity reflected the anxieties of many people in the Cold War 1950s and explains why some commentators suggested that Bennell's story had an anticommunist antiMcCarthyite subtext which Mainwaring and Kevin McCarthy claimed was never intended.The quality of the acting in Invasion of the Body Snatchers is consistently good with Kevin McCarthy's performance standing out because of the range of emotions that he expresses so convincingly and the terror that he conveys so powerfully especially in some of his closeups. His performance was also vital to the movie's success because the whole story revolves around his character's experience.I".

The Pan Am building was also the location of the final scene where the helicopter takes off. The other reason I like this movie is that Eastwood is essentially playing Dirty Harry before Dirty Harry. Coogan is just like Harry Calahan without the 44. magnum. The story is solid but it's the locales and the  situations that Coogan finds himself in that sell the movie. Who cares of it's dated? Of course it's dated but that's part of the experience. Actually most movies made more than 20 years ago or less are dated.

	schema:headline " A smart career move for Clint";
	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood has always been one of the most careersavvy superstars of all time.  Looking over his filmography since his career breakthrough it is obvious he has never done a film strictly for the money and has solid reasons behind every film he has made.  Even his worst films have a purpose The Rookie for instance which most people would agree is a career low was obviously made to satisfy the brass at Warner Bros. by delivering a modernday Dirty Harry clone so he would be left alone to work on his Academy Awardwinning classic Unforgiven which came out two years later. So it is with Coogan's Bluff which most viewers would probably dismiss as secondrate Eastwood but in reality served as a savvy bridge from Westerns the type of genre he was primarily known for at the time into more modern day roles.As directed by his mentor Don Siegel Coogan's Bluff actually opens in the Arizona desert which strongly resembles the background of his spaghetti westerns.  Indeed the first character we see is a loinclothattired man who appears to be Indian so the audience is tricked into thinking they're watching a western.  Then we see a jeep driving down a dirt road with a stetsonwearing Clint at the wheel.  He is Dept. Sheriff Coogan and there we see our first view of Clint as a modern lawman.  It isn't long before he's in New York City chasing down an escaped extradited criminal Don Stroud romancing a beautiful parole officer Susan Clark and butting heads with a strongwilled police captain Lee J.Cobb a terrific yet sadly forgotten character actor of the day.  Therefore in a matter of fifteen minutes Siegel cleverly introduces Eastwood as a contemporary figure a transition that will be complete when he returns to modern times three years later in his most famous role Dirty Harry Callahan.But Coogan's Bluff is an enjoyable film on its own terms.  Eastwood at times is very funny herehis retort to an unethical cab driver is pricelessand the film moves along at a brisk pace.  Just don't expect action galore or a high body count.  Clint doesn't kill anybody here there's no broad conspiracy or mystery to solve his job is simply to find the prisoner and take him home.

	onyx:emotionText "Clint Eastwood has always been one of the most careersavvy superstars of all time.  Looking over his filmography since his career breakthrough it is obvious he has never done a film strictly for the money and has solid reasons behind every film he has made.  Even his worst films have a purpose The Rookie for instance which most people would agree is a career low was obviously made to satisfy the brass at Warner Bros. by delivering a modernday Dirty Harry clone so he would be left alone to work on his Academy Awardwinning classic Unforgiven which came out two years later. So it is with Coogan's Bluff which most viewers would probably dismiss as secondrate Eastwood but in reality served as a savvy bridge from Westerns the type of genre he was primarily known for at the time into more modern day roles.As directed by his mentor Don Siegel Coogan's Bluff actually opens in the Arizona desert which strongly resembles the background of his spaghetti westerns.  Indeed the first character we see is a loinclothattired man who appears to be Indian so the audience is tricked into thinking they're watching a western.  Then we see a jeep driving down a dirt road with a stetsonwearing Clint at the wheel.  He is Dept. Sheriff Coogan and there we see our first view of Clint as a modern lawman.  It isn't long before he's in New York City chasing down an escaped extradited criminal Don Stroud romancing a beautiful parole officer Susan Clark and butting heads with a strongwilled police captain Lee J.Cobb a terrific yet sadly forgotten character actor of the day.  Therefore in a matter of fifteen minutes Siegel cleverly introduces Eastwood as a contemporary figure a transition that will be complete when he returns to modern times three years later in his most famous role Dirty Harry Callahan.But Coogan's Bluff is an enjoyable film on its own terms.  Eastwood at times is very funny herehis retort to an unethical cab driver is pricelessand the film moves along at a brisk pace.  Just don't expect action galore or a high body count.  Clint doesn't kill anybody here there's no broad conspiracy or mystery to solve his job is simply to find the prisoner and take him home.  In fact the film is at its best when its dealing with Coogan as a fishoutofwater dealing with various New York thieves crooks drug dealers hippies and the aforementioned cab driver. There is however a wellchoreographed fight scene in a bar and an exciting motorcycle chase for a climax but that's as much action as there is.

The film will also contain no shots of the former location of the legendary Polo Grounds which were at that spot on Manhattan island. Clint Eastwood's charisma is what carries this film through because he's playing one of the most dislikeable characters he ever essayed on the right side of the law. He's a deputy sheriff from Piute County Arizona who has his own way of doing things. When we first meet him instead of following sheriff Tom Tully's orders and staying at a roadblock Eastwood follows a hunch and captures fugitive Indian Rudy Diaz in the inimitable Clint fashion.That he got the man doesn't cut it with Tully. He sends Clint on assignment to New York to extradite Don Stroud wanted in Arizona. When he gets to New York Stroud is in Bellevue Psych Ward. There are procedures to get him out says Police Lieutenant Lee J. Cobb but Clint cuts through them and while Stroud's in custody he effects an escape.Seduce them for clues is Eastwood's investigative technique as he works on parole officer Susan Clark and Stroud's girlfriend Tisha Sterling. Tisha proves to be a formidable adversary and bed partner yes she's both. Tisha's pretty unforgettable as the amoral hippie chick from the era.Also unforgettable is Betty Field in what proved to be her final big screen role as Stroud's tramp of a mother. Clint doesn't quite have to get down and dirty with her but I think he would have been up to it if needed.A lot of attitudes that were later exhibited in Dirty Harry are in Coogan's Bluff. Walt Coogan has the same attitude towards criminals and the rules that prevent him from dealing with them as he'd like.Some nice location shots of New York including an unforgettable chase scene through Fort Tryon Park in the upper reaches of Manhattan. Not as good as some of Clint Eastwood's other films still Coogan's Bluff is a must for his fans.".

For starters the man he has come to get Ringerman has been sent to Bellevue for observation.

Watching Eastwood work as Deputy Sheriff Walt Coogan with that cool Eastwood demeanor makes you realize just how hokey Dennis Weaver played the McCloud character in the TV series  while 'Coogan' inspired the series the series certainly didn't outshine it.

After learning that it might take a while before he can get his prisoner he decides to take it in own hands to bring him back but while doing so he is jumped at the airport and the prisoner escapes. So now it's personal and he uses his western methods to recapture his man but the city cops don't share his ways.Before they teamed up for the classic cop film Dirty Harry 1971  Don Siegel directed Clint Eastwood in an earlier and underappreciated cop drama Coogen's Bluff. I came across this film only knowing that it starred Eastwood and that's about it. But to my surprise it had more to it than Eastwood's strong persona but it was engaging and clever entertainment by director Don Siegel. What it generates is a violent and hardhitting police story that has superb attention to detail and is particularly well crafted. There's so many things going for it that you may or may not notice all the small hints that the film possesses on the clash of two different cultures city vs. western and the protagonist being dragged into the wicked and dirty side of the hippie drug circuit. This is when he learns that he is out of his league and that he has to adapt to this city way off life to get his man sometimes with dire consequences because he grows slowly attached to it. Add in some psychedelic overtones and a spaced out feel to evoke the carefree era. The whole setup is naturally staged and doesn't feel forced. Siegel seems to have a knack of creating a gritty mood but also capturing the life of the unique surroundings from the Arizona deserts excellent opening sequence to the harsh city life. This was helped by fluid camerawork with its high shots and smooth pans that are well staged. The location photography and dashing settings are two of the strong points of this production. Another is the rousing score that mixes some western tang into the equation. Throw in edgy and sharp dialogue with also scathing humour and an abundance of Texas gags against our protagonist. Siegel's paces the film perfectly and generates tension in some welldesigned action scenes one being the bike chase scene through the park. Though this film isn't overtly filled with just action and violence. It's an amusing watch with a setup that has more to it! Eastwood gives an iconic coolasice performance as the Texas ah I mean Arizona deputy sheriff who adapts his hunting techniques for the big city and who's quick with a sharp reply. Lee J. Cobb is good as the arrogant Det. Lt. McElroy NYPD who has no time for Coogan or his antics. Susan Clark plays Julie Roth a probation officer and possibly Coogan's love interest. A superb Don Stroud weaselly plays James Ringerman the criminal who Coogan's after and Tisha Sterling plays Ringerman's hippie girlfriend. There's also a small role by a feisty Betty Field as Mrs. Ellen Ringerman.Actually it's hard to find one thing that I didn't actually like about the film. Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Great Fun! and a whole lot more.";
	schema:reviewBody "It would be easy to dismiss this movie as lightweight entertainment however this is a much more interesting film if for no other reason than it is the first pairing of Siegel and Eastwood one of the most interesting partnerships in cinema that between 1968 and 1971 produced four good movies and at least one classic Dirty Harry. In this film Clint forged a bridge between his cowboy persona and the contemporary characters that he went on to play. While it was released to theatres the frame compositions look better in 43 TV ratio suggesting that like another Siegel film The Killers this was produced with TV in mind and released to cinemas when the quality of the piece became apparent. I think this might explain why it has taken so long for a 1.85 transfer to be released and why the quality of the DVD is so poor full frame prints look fine. Also the use of what looks like prestanding sets gives it a low budget TV feel. With Play Misty for me Clint became a director and Siegel appeared as an actor thus the partnership was ended the pupil became the master. Clints style as a director owes much to Siegel and he still has the economy which was a hallmark of Siegels work.

	onyx:emotionText "It would be easy to dismiss this movie as lightweight entertainment however this is a much more interesting film if for no other reason than it is the first pairing of Siegel and Eastwood one of the most interesting partnerships in cinema that between 1968 and 1971 produced four good movies and at least one classic Dirty Harry. In this film Clint forged a bridge between his cowboy persona and the contemporary characters that he went on to play. While it was released to theatres the frame compositions look better in 43 TV ratio suggesting that like another Siegel film The Killers this was produced with TV in mind and released to cinemas when the quality of the piece became apparent. I think this might explain why it has taken so long for a 1.85 transfer to be released and why the quality of the DVD is so poor full frame prints look fine. Also the use of what looks like prestanding sets gives it a low budget TV feel. With Play Misty for me Clint became a director and Siegel appeared as an actor thus the partnership was ended the pupil became the master. Clints style as a director owes much to Siegel and he still has the economy which was a hallmark of Siegels work. Another partnership that began in this film was with actor Albert Popwell who went on to appear with Clint in the first four Dirty Harry moviesportraying a different role in each film.

Susan Clark played a lot of these kind of roles in the late '60s to about 1980. Clint Eastwood and Don Stroud are the male leads and Eastwood fits the mold as a tough Arizona lawman going to New York City to bring back an escaped convict.

	schema:reviewBody "I've said it before and I'll say it again...I adore Clint Eastwood. I am more than a fan of all his work I idolize the man. This love came late in my life when I stumbled on The Good The Bad and The Ugly so I am just now watching all of his classic and not so classic films. As much as I love him there is no doubt he has had downs with his ups. I've also disagreed with fellow reviewers before...I thought the so called 'classic' Where Eagles Dare was one of the most boring films I ever sat through. Some of the things said about Coogan's Bluff literally blew my mind. Any comparison to Dirty Harry is just about obscure as they come. This film doesn't even touch Dirty Harry. Eastwood's Coogan is nothing short of a near 'wussy' compared to Harry. Calling this a 'solid action thriller' is the most ludicrous three words I can think of for a film that I very nearly turned off let alone stayed awake through. Action in tiny implements finally breaks out in the last half hour but even that isn't interesting enough because you've become so bored by the story and characters. Some reviewers did say the 'fish out of water' jokes get old quick but I didn't even see enough of that. The concept of the typical cowboy coming to big city is completely lost on this story.Clint Eastwood has had one of the most diverse and remarkable careers in Hollywood. His screen presence is legendary and his westerns are without a doubt the finest pieces of genre ever made. His character 'Coogan' is determined and full of spunk there is no doubt about that. But the womanizing is ridiculous and done in such a campy and silly way. When he finally gets down to truly catching his bad guy he already seems so soft and the last thing in the universe Eastwood should ever be is soft. Coogan is probably his worst character ever created. Susan Clark gives one of the more redeemable performances as tough on the outside cop Julie and the main object of Eastwood's desire. She is a strong female character until Coogan opens up the sexual can of worms and then she swoons like a 12 year old at a Justin Beiber concert. Tisha Sterling plays another Coogan conquest only this time he seduces her to find his man. Sterling is good in her role however I think she really pushes the envelope of over acting. The one big comparison I can make from Coogan's Bluff to Dirty Harry is that Coogan's criminal played by Don Stroud reminds me in many ways of Dirty Harry's Scorpio played later by Andrew Robinson. Only Stroud's criminal is not nearly as maniacal or interesting and has zero chemistry between him and Eastwood.I don't watch a ton of pre80's films so maybe expectations are far lower for older films. I mean one reviewer called this A good exciting action picture and my jaw literally hit the floor. I was so near bored during this picture it blows my mind. Yes there is one well done motorcycle chase scene and it did nothing to raise the merit of this film. I have to say now and probably again before this review is over how shocked I was by how boring this film truly was. I'm not someone who needs constant action by any means but the characters were so poorly done and the story was so thin that it could have been over in fifteen minutes and there lies the problem. There is so much silly filler in this film when there is just no reason for it. Legendary director and Clint Eastwood's mentor Don Siegel helms the film and I'm just amazed at how little he does with the plot. And considering you've got a Cowboy deputy coming to the most famous big city in the world New York there is little to no using the backdrop of New York like he did with San Francisco in Dirty Harry. I have to shun Coogan's Bluff from my Eastwood collection and go watch some true Eastwood classics to get my love for him back because this one simply bored me to death. I encourage every one of you reading this to go watch it right now...and try and tell me what a rip roaring action thriller this is. Sorry Mr. Eastwood...I love you deeply but Coogan's Bluff stinks. 310".

	schema:headline " Groovy baby!";
	schema:reviewBody "Coogans Bluff though widely forgotten when compared to the 'dollars' trilogy or the Dirty Harry movies is one of Clint Eastwoods best projects and boasts what I feel is his best onscreen performance.Arizona Deputy Sheriff Coogan is dispatched to New York to extradite a New York Junkie to face trial for his Crimes in the West. As soon as he touches down atop of the PanAm building he realises the alien environment he finds himself in and in stark contrast to the bleak and desolate Arizona desert in which we first meet him. Coogan on the other hand is just as alien to the native New Yorkers he encounters. He arrives at the district Police Station to pick up his fugitive and take him home but His task is not as cut and dried as he had hoped when he meets bad tempered but good natured veteran Cop McElroy Lee J Cobb who tells Coogan that his prisoner James Ringerman played menacingly by Don Stroud has already taken a 'trip' of a different nature and is in the Prison Ward at Belview Hospital.Coogan's set back means that he has to stay in New York longer than he had planned or hoped. but compensation takes the form of parole officer Julie Roth Susan Clark. After Wining  Dining her goes back to her place. His intended night of passion never gets off the ground as she is interrupted by a business call. After his first night in New York Coogan is determined that it is to be his last and 'Bluffs' his way in to the Prison Ward at Belview in the hopes of engineering Ringerman's release into his custody. he not only encounters Ringerman but also his spaced out girlfriend Linny Raven. His impulsive ruse pays off and he and his prisoner head off to the PanAm building and their awaiting Arizona bound flight. However Raven has arranged a welcoming party for Coogan and after the 'oldest trick in the book' type of ambush Coogan is lying unconscious on the airport floor and Ringerman is once again at large.Ringerman now has the upper hand knowing that Coogan's desert tracking skills are useless in the Concrete Jungle of 1968 New York but undeterred Coogan sets about making his enquiries despite a stern warning not to interfere by McElroy. He is arrested for impersonating a police officer and McElroy takes the liberty of arranging Coogan's prompt and immediate return to Arizona. Coogan's plans remain unchanged and he will not leave New York alone. He resumes his relationship with Roth and while she's out of the room takes a snoop at her parole files and finds the parole record of Raven. His nosiness reaps rewards and his legwork takes him to the physcodelic Pigeon Toed Orange Peel Club where he once again encounters Raven. He ruthlessly seduces her in the hopes that his lovemaking will make her betray Ringermans whereabouts but Raven is as manipulative as she is beautiful and she leads Coogan to a pool hall and yet another ambush. This time Coogan gives his attackers as good as he gets yet still manages to get the ass whippin' of a lifetime. He escapes the pool hall just in time before McElroy and his squad break down the door. Coogan returns to Raven's Apartment only this time he persuades her by using 'less romantic' methods.Fearing for her life she finally leads Coogan straight to Ringerman and the final confrontation.Eastwood's performance as the fish out of water cop is magnificent and is a great bridge between Clint the cowboy and Clint the modern day action hero as it is essentially an amalgamation of the two. The script calls for Clint to be ruthless violent and menacing as all his previous roles had but this movie showed a different side to Eastwood hitherto unseen since his rise to stardom half a decade before. Coogans Bluff required Eastwood to be Romantic and charming and witty in fact the character of Coogan is blessed with a wry almost deadpan dark sense of humour displayed in some of his classic one liners.Taxi Driver that'll be 2.95 including the luggage.

	onyx:emotionText "Coogans Bluff though widely forgotten when compared to the 'dollars' trilogy or the Dirty Harry movies is one of Clint Eastwoods best projects and boasts what I feel is his best onscreen performance.Arizona Deputy Sheriff Coogan is dispatched to New York to extradite a New York Junkie to face trial for his Crimes in the West. As soon as he touches down atop of the PanAm building he realises the alien environment he finds himself in and in stark contrast to the bleak and desolate Arizona desert in which we first meet him. Coogan on the other hand is just as alien to the native New Yorkers he encounters. He arrives at the district Police Station to pick up his fugitive and take him home but His task is not as cut and dried as he had hoped when he meets bad tempered but good natured veteran Cop McElroy Lee J Cobb who tells Coogan that his prisoner James Ringerman played menacingly by Don Stroud has already taken a 'trip' of a different nature and is in the Prison Ward at Belview Hospital.Coogan's set back means that he has to stay in New York longer than he had planned or hoped. but compensation takes the form of parole officer Julie Roth Susan Clark. After Wining  Dining her goes back to her place. His intended night of passion never gets off the ground as she is interrupted by a business call. After his first night in New York Coogan is determined that it is to be his last and 'Bluffs' his way in to the Prison Ward at Belview in the hopes of engineering Ringerman's release into his custody. he not only encounters Ringerman but also his spaced out girlfriend Linny Raven. His impulsive ruse pays off and he and his prisoner head off to the PanAm building and their awaiting Arizona bound flight. However Raven has arranged a welcoming party for Coogan and after the 'oldest trick in the book' type of ambush Coogan is lying unconscious on the airport floor and Ringerman is once again at large.Ringerman now has the upper hand knowing that Coogan's desert tracking skills are useless in the Concrete Jungle of 1968 New York but undeterred Coogan sets about making his enquiries despite a stern warning not to interfere by McElroy. He is arrested for impersonating a police officer and McElroy takes the liberty of arranging Coogan's prompt and immediate return to Arizona. Coogan's plans remain unchanged and he will not leave New York alone. He resumes his relationship with Roth and while she's out of the room takes a snoop at her parole files and finds the parole record of Raven. His nosiness reaps rewards and his legwork takes him to the physcodelic Pigeon Toed Orange Peel Club where he once again encounters Raven. He ruthlessly seduces her in the hopes that his lovemaking will make her betray Ringermans whereabouts but Raven is as manipulative as she is beautiful and she leads Coogan to a pool hall and yet another ambush. This time Coogan gives his attackers as good as he gets yet still manages to get the ass whippin' of a lifetime. He escapes the pool hall just in time before McElroy and his squad break down the door. Coogan returns to Raven's Apartment only this time he persuades her by using 'less romantic' methods.Fearing for her life she finally leads Coogan straight to Ringerman and the final confrontation.Eastwood's performance as the fish out of water cop is magnificent and is a great bridge between Clint the cowboy and Clint the modern day action hero as it is essentially an amalgamation of the two. The script calls for Clint to be ruthless violent and menacing as all his previous roles had but this movie showed a different side to Eastwood hitherto unseen since his rise to stardom half a decade before. Coogans Bluff required Eastwood to be Romantic and charming and witty in fact the character of Coogan is blessed with a wry almost deadpan dark sense of humour displayed in some of his classic one liners.Taxi Driver that'll be 2.95 including the luggage. Coogan Here's 3 dollars including the tip.or reprising this encounter with a hotel owner.Hotel Owner That'll be 7 Coogan The sign says 5 Hotel Owner 7 without luggage Coogan shows his briefcase That ain't luggage.

When he is told upon arriving in New York to extradite a fleeing murderer that he must wait whilst the bureaucratic elements are sorted through he decides to take matters into his own hands.Prior to Coogan's Bluff I had never encountered Eastwood pre1992's Unforgiven. My familiarity with and affection for Clint's modern directorial work combined with the release of a 35 film box set to inspire me to investigate the entirety of his legendary career. That being my original motivation I found something far more interesting in this film. Having recently explored the history and evolution of the western genre in Hollywood cinema Coogan's Bluff provided an interesting bridge in the aforementioned history. Eastwood's Coogan is the classic westerner the archetypal frontier hero his stiff opposition to established authority his overtly western appearance the regular reference to him by all else as cowboy. The film takes this character and dumps him in the urban landscape of New York city the massive contrast between the barren desert of the opening shots and the steel and glass of the city not the only obvious difference between the locations. Coogan's inability to subscribe to the systematic law enforcement of the city is the catalyst to the film's action and one which poses the questions the film attempts to answer. His brand of law proved in westerns of the past to succeed where conventional East American law has failed is on trial here explored and analysed by Siegel. The contrast between Coogan and Lee J. Cobb's McElroy the bythebook New York police lieutenant is crucial to this analysis. Fortunately both actors are perfect in their roles Clint's charm charisma and willingness to employ both seduction and force as necessary alluding to the darker side of his character. After ninety minutes of a perfectly entertaining film the ending perfectly sums up what the film is all about. Well constructed articulated and delivered surprisingly entertaining and effective and an interesting insight into the jump from the western to the urban cop thriller to the action films of the 80s. Worth a very brief mention is the scene in the delightfully named The Pigeon Toed Orange Peel nightclub in which Siegel employs Eisensteinian intellectual montage to presentor maybe this is just mea homophobic agenda along with an overall condemnation of hippie culture spectacularly executed by a series of highlow angle shots of the already tall Clint standing some steps above a woman. The apparent homophobia is just bizarre and leaves you wondering where it's come from.The missing link between the classic western and the Dirty Harry style of urban cop drama Coogan's Bluff gives an interesting glimpse into the evolution of genre.

Indeed this is where Eastwood and Siegel first pair up and the seeds of the subsequent violent thrillers are clearly visible. It is also significant in that being a 1968 film we get a depiction of sexual politics that still resonates today. There is an early scene where Tisha Sterling is talking to her 'client' or probationer played by Don Stroud and the slimy kid touches strokes and finally takes a hold of one of her breasts. Eastwood's 'country boy' from Arizona looking more like a cowboy than a cop takes exception and knocks Stroud away. Tisha's character who seemed to accept the sexual attention is upset that her 'client' is now upset. Even more odd as we now look back Eastwood then picks up his case takes her by the arm and announces he's taking her to lunch and more as it subsequently turns out. Within the storyline of a film of this period it doesn't seem all that strange no more it was but looked at now from the era of a new morality quite astonishing. The story moves well Siegel has an eye for composition and can choreograph a bar room fight or a chase as good as anyone. The final motorbike chase is set on the slopes of an autumnal Fort Tryon Park and looks very good. Also good looking and very well shot is a hippy gig with back projections coloured lights near naked boys and girls and painted faces. Well worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood was a pretty busy guy in the late 60's and early 70's. In 1968 he starred in 3 films Hang 'Em High Where Eagles Dare and Coogan's Bluff. Of the three Coogan's is weakest film. It was directed by Don Siegel who would later go on to direct Eastwood in the first Dirty Harry movie. You can tell that Coogan's Bluff is setting the ground work for that film.Eastwood plays Coogan a misogynistic sheriff from Arizona who has to travel to New York City to extradite a prisoner named Ringerman John Stroud back to Arizona for trial. When he arrives in the city he discovers that his Ringerman is not ready to transport because he is in a mental ward after taking some LSD.Determined to get his prisoner and head back to Arizona Coogan convinces the hospital to release Ringerman to his care. On their way to the airport Coogan is jumped by some of Ringerman's gang and and Ringerman escapes. Coogan now needs to track down Ringerman and bring him to justice.Coogan's Bluff is really just a classic fish out of water story. Picture Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee or Johnny Weissmuller in Tarzan's New York Adventure and you have an idea what is going in this movie.Eastwood's play's his usual stoic self in this one. He does a nice job keeping you interested in a character that is truthfully difficult to like. I thought Tisha Sterling was interesting in this movie as well as the drugged out hippie girlfriend of Ringerman.Coogan's Bluff has not aged well. There are a lot of scenes of the late 60's hippie counter culture and they seem pretty ridiculous by today's standards. This isn't really the biggest problem with the movie however. For me the biggest issue was there wasn't really anything going on in this movie. Ringerman isn't really a true villain he pretty much just hides out taking drugs until Eastwood tracks him down. The action scenes are few and far between and most of the movie seems to be about Coogan trying to get women in bed.Coogan's Bluff is interesting in that the character is pretty obviously the basis for the Dirty Harry role and that they went on to make a TV show based on the movie called McCloud. It is available to stream on Netflix if you want to check it out but there are much better Eastwood films out there.".

	onyx:emotionText "Clint Eastwood was a pretty busy guy in the late 60's and early 70's. In 1968 he starred in 3 films Hang 'Em High Where Eagles Dare and Coogan's Bluff. Of the three Coogan's is weakest film. It was directed by Don Siegel who would later go on to direct Eastwood in the first Dirty Harry movie. You can tell that Coogan's Bluff is setting the ground work for that film.Eastwood plays Coogan a misogynistic sheriff from Arizona who has to travel to New York City to extradite a prisoner named Ringerman John Stroud back to Arizona for trial. When he arrives in the city he discovers that his Ringerman is not ready to transport because he is in a mental ward after taking some LSD.Determined to get his prisoner and head back to Arizona Coogan convinces the hospital to release Ringerman to his care. On their way to the airport Coogan is jumped by some of Ringerman's gang and and Ringerman escapes. Coogan now needs to track down Ringerman and bring him to justice.Coogan's Bluff is really just a classic fish out of water story.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good example of a transition film. Clint Eastwood known primarily for westerns at this point in his career took a step towards one of his most recognizable characters Inspector Dirty Harry Calahan. Coogan's Bluff starts with a wide shot of a desert in the American Southwest. Dust is being kicked up as the protagonist rides... in a jeep! He has a holstered rifle classic western hat and boots and lights a cigarette all in the first scene. At thus point the terrain could have been from the 1860s but then were are shown a modern home and cars and then finally the vast urban expanse of New York City as a helicopter lands on a huge skyscraper. This opening sequence is really nothing more within the film itself but taken from an outside perspective it's actually a landmark in Clint Eastwood's career it foreshadows Dirty Harry and signals a waning of the western genre. 1968 was also the year Steve McQueen made the classic Bullitt which takes place in San Francisco which also makes it another prelude to Dirty Harry and the archetype of the tough city cop.Coogan's Bluff is potentially more enjoyable for some in that Walt Coogan is much less violent. Dirty Harry is a very cool character but the end of even the second movie he was just good escapism. Walt Coogan is actually convincing as a real character and his trek through New York is comparable once again to Bullitt. The film is more about the driving force of the character to get to the bottom of the problem which here involves tracking down a criminal who escaped Coogan's custody. Out of his jurisdiction and much to annoyance of a New York inspector Coogan starts to conduct the search by himself. He's a stranger in a strange land so to speak.The film may be a bit slow by today's action standards but this is more of an investigation cop movie more akin to a Sherlock Holmes story mystery throughout and a climatic set piece at the end here in the form of a terrific motorcycle chase. Coogan's Bluff came out in 1968 and was overshadowed by Bullitt with it's spectacular chase scene and Clint Eastwood's much bigger action hit of that year Where Eagles Dare but this film is essential for Clint fans if they haven't seen it.  810BsCDb Classification PG  violence".

	schema:headline " I FREAKING LOVED this movie!!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Cabin in the Woods is a spin on the horror genre from writer's Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard without giving away the spoilerish parts of the plot I'll simply say that it involves 5 friends who fit the horror movie stereotypes Jock Slut PartyGuy Nerd Virgin who go to a cabin in the woods to party and get away from it all. Trouble is its never really safe to go to a cabin in the woods is it?To be honest the less you know about this film the more awesome it will be. I felt that the trailer gave away a bit too much of the twists and turns one can expect from the film but at the same time the image of a bird flying into a giant forcefield is what will set this film apart from the generic horror films that hit the theatres today. The Cabin In The Woods tells you upfront You think you know the story... but of course you don't. This is Joss Whedon after all. Fans of Buffy and Angel will get a kick out of this as actors from that universe make their way into this film.It's been a long time since I've had a lot of fun at the movies and the Cabin in the Woods was a lot of fun. It's an odd movie to sell because a lot of it has to be kept secret to make the second half of the movie exciting and fresh. It blends a few genres together the two main ones being horror and comedy and it works perfectly. Both Whedon and Goddard worked on Buffy and Angel which was a balancing act of genres so they knew the right tone to get here and they nailed it. They take the clichd aspects of every horror film and put it in here to brilliant use. We actually get to see reasons for stupid character mistakes which made that whole aspect of the film fun. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford have great chemistry together and stole every scene they're in. I would love to see these two character actors work together again they made this film really fun and they are a joy to watch on the screen. The young actors including Thor himself Chris Hemsworth sell the clichd horror characters very well. In most horror flicks I can't stand any of the characters here I was rooting for all of them.There are some truly hilarious moments I am dying to talk about them but doing so would ruin the surprises. All I can say is that I was laughing throughout the entire film I cheered I clapped and I enjoyed myself. There are a lot of horror references most notably The Evil Dead so it's fun to spot things here and there. Horror fans I think will really get a kick of of this flick and I pray it does well cause it's the most fun I've had in a long time. Drew Goddard's first directorial gig he had a lot on his plate and he managed to pull off one hell of a film. It helps when you have someone like Joss Whedon in your corner but I applaud him for being able to pull off the tone perfectly I imagine the script to screen process was identical. This is a very clever script with laughs gore and surprises at every corner. When you have Goddard whose worked on Buffy Angel Lost and wrote Cloverfield teamed up with partner Joss Whedon who is one of the best writers working today then you know you're walking into something special.

	onyx:emotionText "The Cabin in the Woods is a spin on the horror genre from writer's Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard without giving away the spoilerish parts of the plot I'll simply say that it involves 5 friends who fit the horror movie stereotypes Jock Slut PartyGuy Nerd Virgin who go to a cabin in the woods to party and get away from it all. Trouble is its never really safe to go to a cabin in the woods is it?To be honest the less you know about this film the more awesome it will be. I felt that the trailer gave away a bit too much of the twists and turns one can expect from the film but at the same time the image of a bird flying into a giant forcefield is what will set this film apart from the generic horror films that hit the theatres today. The Cabin In The Woods tells you upfront You think you know the story... but of course you don't. This is Joss Whedon after all. Fans of Buffy and Angel will get a kick out of this as actors from that universe make their way into this film.It's been a long time since I've had a lot of fun at the movies and the Cabin in the Woods was a lot of fun. It's an odd movie to sell because a lot of it has to be kept secret to make the second half of the movie exciting and fresh. It blends a few genres together the two main ones being horror and comedy and it works perfectly. Both Whedon and Goddard worked on Buffy and Angel which was a balancing act of genres so they knew the right tone to get here and they nailed it. They take the clichd aspects of every horror film and put it in here to brilliant use. We actually get to see reasons for stupid character mistakes which made that whole aspect of the film fun. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford have great chemistry together and stole every scene they're in. I would love to see these two character actors work together again they made this film really fun and they are a joy to watch on the screen. The young actors including Thor himself Chris Hemsworth sell the clichd horror characters very well. In most horror flicks I can't stand any of the characters here I was rooting for all of them.There are some truly hilarious moments I am dying to talk about them but doing so would ruin the surprises. All I can say is that I was laughing throughout the entire film I cheered I clapped and I enjoyed myself. There are a lot of horror references most notably The Evil Dead so it's fun to spot things here and there. Horror fans I think will really get a kick of of this flick and I pray it does well cause it's the most fun I've had in a long time. Drew Goddard's first directorial gig he had a lot on his plate and he managed to pull off one hell of a film. It helps when you have someone like Joss Whedon in your corner but I applaud him for being able to pull off the tone perfectly I imagine the script to screen process was identical. This is a very clever script with laughs gore and surprises at every corner. When you have Goddard whose worked on Buffy Angel Lost and wrote Cloverfield teamed up with partner Joss Whedon who is one of the best writers working today then you know you're walking into something special. I can't recommend this flick enough. When it comes out you must go see it. Just makes sure you don't know much about it beforehand or it might ruin the awesome factor.";

I get the fact that it is a parody or an antihorror film or perhaps even a nod whether positive or negative to horror films generally but I still don't like it.It was predictable from the start why did that eagle have to hit the invisible boundary to the cabin? It made the later scene with the motor bike jump completely redundant. The acting was poor and even though the film may be satirical it is still painful to watch.The only thing I do like is perhaps the idea of an ode to all horror films and horror characters but if it is a parody than that wouldn't make sense.I am just so surprised that this film currently has 7.9  10.

It's also the part where your standard horror flick ends...but wait!3 The Prestige  The resolution. The end. The explanation to everything that's been going on and also possibly the greatest 20 minutes ever shown in horror movie history. This is the part where the audience is silent and speechless as every diehard horror fan's dream is realized on screen. All your dedication love and sacrifice for this genre is justified.

I found it online and decided to watch since I had nothing else to do. I was kind of intrigued after seeing Joss Whedon's name in the credits for producing and writing. Overall I loved this movie. It started off as your typical horror film but turn into something much bigger and more authentic. Every horror in the past twenty years has been predictable. You know who is going to die you know who the killer is you know if the dumb blonde runs off screaming into a dark hallway she's more than likely going to have her head get cut off. But this movie was the exact opposite because I had absolutely no clue what was going to happen next. I'm sure a high percentage of people will not appreciate the scifi twist to the movie but I loved and thought it was an awesome idea. All horror movies are kind of science fiction anyways. It seems like all the killers are super human anyway because they don't seem to ever die no matter how many times you shoot them stab them or hit them with a truck. This movie just did it on a larger scale.The script was solid as well. Joss Whedon writes the best dialogue and knows how to play off of clich's and those corny predictable monologues and speeches. To everyone saying they hated this movie it's obvious that they don't like change and are probably upset because the originality of this film pretty much slays all their favorite horror movies to dust. It's not Oscar worthy but it's a great Friday night movie with your friends that will keep everyone on the edge of their seat anticipating what's going to happen next.I have to hand it to the filmmakers. They definitely made a film that no one would have ever thought it. Just like my title says you either love it or you hate it.

	schema:reviewBody "I would normally be leery of giving out a perfect 10 rating but if ever there was a modern horror movie that was worthy of a 10 it's this one. Cabin in the Woods has done what I no longer thought was possible for a horror movie it blew my mind and showed me something I never expected. When I first saw a trailer for this on television I thought Oh great another recycled clichd horror flick. Can't they think of anything other than putting a group of young people in a stale setting and kill them off one by one? Well it would appear that they can. This is a film that is nearly impossible to market effectively without giving anything away. Some of the more recent trailers have included much more footage that gives a glimpse into what this movie REALLY is about. Word of mouth should be the biggest factor that helps make this movie popular. I just hope for your sake that no one spoils this brilliant gem for you. It's best to go into it with as little information as possible. I really enjoyed the pacing of this movie. They could've taken this in an entirely different direction if they simply wanted to shock you at the end. Instead they treat the film like a slow steady reveal. In fact the opening scene does not even feature the group of kids that we follow on their horrific trip to the cabin. Instead it opens with the other side of this story and the characters who get about as much screen time as our heroine and her pals. The result is a cinematic experience like none other. The audience is fed bits of information little by little throughout the entire film so you're always hot on the trail of this story's secrets. You won't know exactly what's going on but you'll feel like you have a pretty good grasp on things the further you advance into it. In reality every time this plot reveals a twist it also introduces more brand new questions into your mind. So the twists don't just come completely out of left field and shock you but they guide you through a very intriguing story that manages to keep expanding into something bigger and bigger. I'm so glad they wrote the script this way. I feel like 9 times out of 10 the writers of today would be too tempted to create a story that hides everything behind the curtain and focuses solely on the kids at this cabin. That way they can build up to a final payoff that no one would ever see coming. This payoff is too big to simply catch you off guard with. They got this right a movie that isn't only original for the end of the third act but a refreshing journey from start to finish. Go experience this film before you overhear people talking about it at the water cooler.".

You won't know exactly what's going on but you'll feel like you have a pretty good grasp on things the further you advance into it. In reality every time this plot reveals a twist it also introduces more brand new questions into your mind. So the twists don't just come completely out of left field and shock you but they guide you through a very intriguing story that manages to keep expanding into something bigger and bigger. I'm so glad they wrote the script this way. I feel like 9 times out of 10 the writers of today would be too tempted to create a story that hides everything behind the curtain and focuses solely on the kids at this cabin. That way they can build up to a final payoff that no one would ever see coming. This payoff is too big to simply catch you off guard with. They got this right a movie that isn't only original for the end of the third act but a refreshing journey from start to finish. Go experience this film before you overhear people talking about it at the water cooler.";

However after the buzz surrounding Cabin I knew it was something I had to see. And sure enough Cabin delivers in spades. It has everything a horror fan could want from our favorite clichs to some fantastic surprises. Suffice to say every horror fan should go see this.I won't spoil the story but to get into things a little we focus on the age old tale of horror films friends go to a remote cabin for some RnR and then the  hits the fan. And when it does it does so gleefully. It would be easy to blow this off as a simple parody but it's not. I won't say how but this is essentially a horror movie within a horror movie and it's mostly dead serious. There's plenty of humor throughout mostly due to Fran Krantz stoner character. And in fact pretty much all the actors play there parts well. They are likable characters even if they are clich but the clichs are part of the entire point. And in such areas these characters are great. If you're worried about the horror aspect of the film fear not it delivers immensely. There are plenty of chilling scenes though I wouldn't necessarily call them scary and there is plenty of gore for the gorehounds particularly at the end.To say much more would be to give away too much. I certainly had a few qualms about the film but they were few and far between. And the less you know the better. I will only say that if you've been looking for good horror film this is it. Whedon and Goddard have delivered in every way and their film will be remembered for some time in the same way Scream was remembered for shaking up the genre. This is similar but different in oh so many ways. Go see this movie. It's the kind of film that comes out once in a blue moon.".

This review is now sufficient enough to end right here but I'll soldier on anyway. With about a jillion comparisons to Wes Cravens criminally overrated Scream there was no reason to have high expectations for The Cabin in the Woods. Still I at least expected a mindlessly entertaining carnival ride of gruesomeness a la Demon Knight or Planet Terror. My expectations were too high. The reason for the Scream comparison stems from the fact that both films exhibit a self awareness of the clichs and conventions of the horror genre. This comparison however is not entirely accurate. As lame a film to ever masquerade as a horror film as Scream is The Cabin in the Woods' brand of stupidity has more in common with tripe such as Mars Attacks or even The Brady Bunch Movie. This is a film that looks and feels like a slightly sinister entry to the abysmal Scary Movie franchise. Another horror comedy that's never scary and never really funny. To call it convoluted or contrived would be a massive understatement. It's flimsy excuse for a premise is like a house of urine soaked cards. The 1st act set up plays every bit as clichd and predictable as any cut rate teen slasher movie of the past 30 years. The only difference is the inclusion of a vast network of puppeteers two of which offer constant explanations excuses for said predictability. Basically it's all a charade. The kids are being lured into the cabin as part of some laughable ritual of human sacrifice to appease some angry ancient gods. This charade of trite horror genre mediocrity is the only thing that keeps them from rising up and destroying the world. In other words the story is rotten because the Ancient Ones have wretched taste. For reasons far too ridiculous to bother getting into things don't quite go as planned. Two of the kids figure everything out and to make a very dumb bloated story short the world ends. There's a bloody finale involving about 20 or more simultaneous references to horror icons of the past several decades but don't think for a second that any of it's worthwhile. Lord Fornicus the obvious reference to Hellraiser's Pinhead looks like something out of a SNL sketch. Come to think of it the whole thing feels like some cutrate comedy sketch show rather than a horror film or even a horror comedy. Watching this thing one get's the impression that everyone involved was striving for mediocrity. The acting is soap opera level. The direction uninspired. The writing an avalanche of sloppy expository dialog and dumb forced humor people still think stoners are funny?. The camera work typical lets film each scene from every conceivable angle and hope it all cuts together well. The Special effects barely a step above what you'd see in an Uwe Boll film. The selfreferential conceit is just an excuse to unleash a torrent of awkward distracting exposition through each and every character's dialog. You half expect someone to look directly into the camera at any moment throw up the sign of the horns and proclaim Dude! It's a freakin horror movie! This brand of lazy storytelling is no different from what the storytellers proclaim to be ridiculing. The people who defend this technique by saying that was the point are simply defending mediocrity. Clichs ineptitude and lack of imagination cannot negate clichs ineptitude and lack of imagination. Nor can they be excused. Consider films like Kill Bill and Grindhouse which manage to pay homage to trash cinema yet still be incredibly entertaining and original. The Cabin in the Woods is still the same boring same old same old even with the realityTVshowofthegods slant. All in all the whole thing is about as clever funny and scary as a fart joke. Some have surmised that the story is actually a kind of metaphor for the horror film industry or horror fans expectations or whatever. If that's the case then The Cabin in the Woods isn't just lame it's insufferably pretentious. Merman this single star is for you and only you.".

Do not go to see this movie if you are over 20. I give it a 3 because I did LOL a few times so I guess I was mildly entertained once or twice. PS... The cameo appearance at the end is NOT by a horror movie icon as several have stated. Those are 2 completely different genres of movies.".

It's farfetched and I don't mean it in the way that it features supernatural beings no but in the way that its unpredictability is so predictable. It's as if the creators of the movie couldn't really decide what to do with it except to make it as ludicrous as possible. Furthermore while I am aware of Whedon's commentary explicitly stated ideas of the movie I consider it not important. Because frankly this movie couldn't function as a satire even if it got to the top of Mount Everest and shouted angrily at the world for not being what it was supposed to be.I mean the big red button? Convenient but completely needless. The machinery and the scenery was obviously just built to be destroyed. So expect the expected here. I mean conditioning people to do what is necessary so that the show goes on? I mean Sigourney Weaver telling us it's the end of times? I mean appeasing the gods by means of an ancient ritual okay okay but then what the hell are them all people doing there? How did they get there? They just gathered to save the world? It's incomplete the movie littered with inconsistencies that can hardly be called intentional. No explanations are offered no delving into the matter. All in all very superficial in nature. Also the movie funny? Seriously if this is considered to funny I really. Eh. Not even going to deign to finish that sentence. It has its moments to be sure but then again watching wallpapers crumpling has its moments too.It starts out promising though as promising a cabin movie can seem. But the more you see it the less you like it. And I wouldn't agree with whoever said that the characters were likable. The plot does not allow for that. In fact the plot forbids it. It manages to ruin their potential with clichs and clichd anticlichs be it intentionally or unintentionally. At the very end when they are about to die my reactions were poker face. No feeling of sorrow or compassion. Oh Hollywood why such lack of original originality I'll never know.".

	schema:headline " A Very Loving Hate Letter to Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "I love being scared. So said Joss Whedon in an interview with Total Film regarding The Cabin in the Woods which he produced and cowrote with director Drew Goddard. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had sung a little too far in that direction. When I first read that quote a few weeks ago I wished Whedon had been there with me for I wanted to shake him by the hand and thank him for publicly reaffirming what I've felt about horror movies for quite some time. But then I actually saw The Cabin in the Woods and I couldn't help but wonder why I wasn't seeing things as he saw them. Something wasn't quite right.The film promoted by Whedon himself as a very loving hate letter and a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies is nowhere near as clever or insightful as it has been made to seem. Whedon and Goddard clearly have fun with a number of threadbare horror clichs but never once do they actually say anything relevant about them. All these men really do is confirm that they exist which is shortsighted considering the fact that most horror audiences are already well aware of this. They think they're letting us in on the joke when in fact we were in on it all along. What I was promised was satire what I got was a confusing ridiculous and surprisingly depressing film in which archetypes and conventions are addressed but barely improved.Central to the story are five college kids who were clearly intended to be onedimensional caricatures. But pointing out their shallowness and actually commenting on it are two entirely different matters and frankly I would have preferred the filmmakers to go in the latter direction. There's Dana the reluctant virgin Kristen Connolly. There's her best friend Jules the perpetually horny sexpot Anna Hutchison who just dyed her hair blonde although she can't pronounce one of the words on Dana's math book it's declared that she's premed. There's Jules' boyfriend Curt the hunky jock Chris Hemsworth. There's Holden the scholarly gentleman Jesse Williams who will inevitably fall for Dana. Finally there's Marty the goofy pothead Fran Kranz who sounds like he knows more than he initially lets on.They leave campus and take an RV to a remote part of the woods where they vacation in a strangely decorated and certifiably creepy cabin. Little do they know that beneath the cabin lies a subterranean office superstructure where a bureaucratic team of workers in suits ties and lab coats watch their every move via surveillance cameras. Two scientists Hadley Richard Jenkins and Sitterson Bradley Whitford use a force field to seal the college kids into the wooded area and subject them to a scenario of their own design. They manipulate the circumstances as much as possible mostly by the release of airborne chemicals that can change a person's ability to think. They eventually open the cellar where amidst an eclectic mix of creepy Victorian paraphernalia Dana finds an old diary. Upon reading a Latin incantation zombies emerge from the ground and descend on the cabin.At this point I'm going to stop describing the plot in detail as there are numerous twists and turns that most will not want spoiled. I will say that the film is intended to be both frightening and funny and to an extent it succeeds at both. In the humor department we have more than the antics of the college kids we have the working environment of the subterranean office. Just as it would be in an urban skyrise we see division of labor and the formation of cliques. We see money pools and office partying and there's even enough time to work in the playful ribbing of the nerdy intern. When they're not working the scientists will gab about their personal lives in the opening scene Sitterson spends a great deal of time complain about his wife and her new cabinets.There's an extremely bloody confrontation involving every imaginable monster from the annals of horror from wispy spirits to werewolves to giant cobras to robotic slicing machines to zombies to carnivorous mermen. All leads to a Lovecraftian ending that was not only lamebrained and inappropriate but also needlessly upsetting. Was that the point of The Cabin in the Woods? To espouse a nihilistic viewpoint of humanity? If this is Whedon's idea of sticking it to the makers of slasher films and gore fests he might want to steer clear of the horror genre altogether. I hate to think that there are other genres he feels have been corrupted. If he were to write another very loving hate letter say for a romantic comedy or a musical would it too end in the same way?

This movie shouldn't be considered a horror movie but actually a comedy.If you are looking for a good laugh this movie is the one to watch But if you got the impression this movie in fact was going to be a horror movie as many of us thoughtexpect a huge disappointment therefore  do not go and pay for this film it is not worth your money. Perhaps if this movie was displayed as the typical Scary movie series then this movie would with no doubt receive ten stars. Save your self ten bucks or watch another movie!";

	schema:headline " Welcome to Sommerton  Essential Schwarzenegger action film from Kim Jeewoon";
	schema:reviewBody "Essential Schwarzenegger action movie from Kim Jeewoon. This is the last good solo decent action movie that Schwarzenegger did. I like this film I enjoy it for the action and gun blazing the story speed racing with cars I had blast watching this movie. This was good time enjoyable I have enjoy it. The same year come out Stallone's film Bullet to the Head not John Woo movie and yes it sucked. It's a viciously fun deliriously violent action film that successfully hearkens back to Schwarzenegger's 1980s days.The Last Stand was a good action movie from Schwarzenegger not his best movie or the greatest movie but it is a good for an action. So I call it essential Schwarzenegger action movie and no it is not so bad that is good it is so good that it is good. Arnold has returned into the leading man spot in the new film The Last Stand and bombed at the box office.Schwarzenegger stars as Ray Owens a former LAPD officerturnedsheriff of a quiet border town who is called upon by the FBI to stop a drug lord and his cronies from fleeing across the U.SMexico border.I know this is not Predator Terminator 2 Judgment Day Commando The Terminator The Running Man Conan the Barbarian or Conan the Destroyer but The Last Stand is a good return to Arnolds roots. I like The Last Stand because it has a good pacing it's violent gory very fun damn good action and Arnold shows that he's still an action movie star badass! Also those were some really bloody squibs when the mercenary got shot up on the stairs.The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger Johnny Knoxville Forest Whitaker Jaimie Alexander Luis Guzmn Eduardo Noriega Peter Stormare Rodrigo Santoro and they are believable.When Gabriel Cortez Eduardo Noriega the most notorious wanted drug kingpin in the western hemisphere makes a deadly escape from an FBI prisoner convoy and plans to head straight to Mexico right through the border town. He speeds with his fast car corvette and an FBI agent Ellen Richards Genesis Rodriguez as hostage to the Mexican border border town known as Sommerton Junction. The only thing in his path is a Sheriff Ray Owens a former LAPD narcotics officer and his inexperienced staff. At first Sheriff Owens is highly reluctant to become involved. But when U.S. law enforcement counts him out he rallies an unexpected team and takes matters into his own hands ultimately setting the stage for a classic fighttothedeath showdown.Schwarzenegger easily gives one of the most committed performances I've ever seen from him as Owens the central protagonist and biggest standout of this movie by far. There's never really a single dull moment when Arnold is on screen. And for the most part the same can be said for everyone else in the cast. Johnny Knoxville and Luis Guzmn in particular are absurdly hilarious as the movie's lowbrow comic relief. I know now what happened to Jaimie Alexander  Sif from Thor and Thor The Dark World who plays now Sarah Torrance a deputy of Sheriff Ray Owens. Jaimie Alexander did a wonderful perfomence as Sarah.I love the chase the street race between Gabriel Cortez Eduardo Noriega in his car 2011 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 C6 and Ray Owens Arnold Schwarzenegger with his car 2012 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 chasing Cortez in the corn filed. I love that Sheriff and his staff armed them self's and preparing them for their last battle. The Last Stand was a violent decent action film at least it wasn't Sabotage that sucked so much.".

But over time as super glossy and hyperkinetic and chaoticallyshot cinema floods theaters this almost comes as something of a refreshment. How do I simply say I got thrilled by the action laughed at the craziness in the setpieces and loved seeing Arnold tear it up and have oneline retorts How do you feel? asks a townsperson  OLD!But aside from the story which seems to be fairly cookiecutter with the Mexican cartel kingpin who is getting across from Nevada down to the border to get back to his safe land and with various tropes that can be read from not too far away given some heft by the fact that Eduardo Noriega cuts a very sharp figure as a madman with a zest for stunt driving  like a character one might find almost in RodriguezTarantino's Grindhouse or a hybrid of such characters they write what is there? How about that the director Kim JeeWoon has a track record from back in South Korea as being a hardcore aweinspiring action and genre director who can make them very very intense and harrowing I Saw the Devil or truly spooky and harrowing in a quieter more sinister way Tale of Two Sisters. But what got him the job I suspect was The Good the Bad and the Weird his wild homage to everything Western  Spaghetti yes but good ol' American variety. He must have read the script and said 'I can do this this is a Western to the bone just in 21st century garb... matter of fact it's Rio Bravo on steroids!'Well that's my suspicion anyway. Think about it  a Sheriff in a ponam town with not many residents at all and those that do stick around all day won't leave cause of some gunfire  there's a cheese omelette cooking after all at the diner and has some good deputies and some others he has to recruit not by his better judgment but by lack of other good officers and has a Big Bad Motherflipper coming right his way. I've seen a lot of blood and death. I know what's coming says the notquite quipping Arnold. And the first half does build somewhat decently if predictably the pieces of the characters the basic setups of who may die or will and what betrayals are happening and who knows what and what really Forest Whitaker can do as the Man in Charge in the suit  powerful but he's not a Schwarzenegger. It's the second half of the film as the preparations intensify and then the big attack comes to Sommerton Junction even the name is out of a Sam Fuller western or something that the film REALLY picks up steam. And by steam I mean lots and lots of bullets sometimes from huge guns that fire way too many bullets. What helps in JeeWoon's favor in The Last Stand is how he takes the fantasy of all of this to such a degree that you or I really can't help but admire how high it ends up going. It will please hardcore action fans but unlike the only other recent Schwarzenegger films so to speak of the Expendables franchise it doesn't really insult your intelligence either. The villains on display in this flick are not pushovers and it leads to some impressive action from the performers from the cameramen from the bullets themselves which become their own actors. And the final chase through a cornfield just when you think the film has nothing else to give you comes back for a surprise setpiece that feels fresh and inventive we haven't seen something quite like this where it's a cat and mouse chase through such a big space of land but we know it is just a matter of seconds. If you've grown up on Schwarzenegger flicks it's like visiting the older man at the condo and jogging his memory fullthrottle. I don't know if this is just a brief popup appearance for the how do I write this without laughing but he is veteran action icon or a third and final career trajectory after years as a bodybuilderupandcomer and superstar. But for now it'll do Johnny Knoxville's rambunctious comictiming not withstanding.".

I have waited a decade for his return to the cinema and I wasn't disappointed. The Last Stand isn't perfect but Arnold fans can rejoice for he truly is back!!The premise for those that haven't watched the trailer a dozen times like me is a Mexican cartel boss Eduardo Noriega has escaped custody during transport and is heading to the Mexican border and he is going to get there by going through the sleepy town of Sommerton Arizona. Arnold is the Sheriff in this sleepy little town and he is the FBI's last hope at stopping the ruthless gangster. This movie is full of intense bloody action exciting car chases thanks to a supped up Corvette ZR1 with over one thousand horsepower! and funny one liner's. The film never takes itself too serious which is good thing and is surprisingly funny throughout. Arnold's acting is a little rusty but he more than made up for it in the action scenes. And the many action sequences were exciting and bloody the theater kept cheering out loud. The pacing was perfect the film flew by.The cast was great...Luis Guzman is hilarious as Arnold's Deputy Forest Whitaker as the lead FBI agent Peter Stormare as the maniacal right hand man villain Johnny Knoxville as the town clown Harry Dean Stanton as the crotchety old farmer the list goes on...The film was everything I wanted from an Arnold movie it's fun! full of fast paced action and lots of funny one liner's.

	schema:headline " Arnold is back for the Last Stand";
	schema:reviewBody "After brief cameos in films like the Rundown and Expendables we finally got a glimpse of a possible return to form for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Finally his first full length solo action film is here with The Last Stand. As if this wasn't exciting enough add to the mix I Saw The Devil director Jeewoon Kim at the helm it has the makings of a great comeback.The Last Stand follows a former LAPD detective who is now the sheriff of a small quiet town and enjoying the peaceful life. When a notorious drug kingpin escapes FBI custody in a supped up corvette the only thing standing between him and the border is this small town and the sheriff who has vowed to protect it. The story here is pretty simple and in anyone else's hands would have probably been a throw away film. Thankfully Jeewoon Kim brings his signature dynamic style taking this film to a much more entertaining visual level. If there was any concern with Arnold being able to live up to his famous line I'll be back being accurate you can relax because he is back in a big way. This film takes a bit of a step back and moves a bit slowly at first letting the story build a bit instead of just flooding it with action. When the smaller action pieces if you can call any of them that do occur they are pretty high octane and fun to watch. All this builds up to a full on blood bath ensuing old west action show down featuring all the explosions guns blood and fun you could want in an Arnold film. Make no mistake this is a popcorn action film that hearkens back to the old school action films of the 80's and 90's when they delivered. The cast is great and each delivers a fun performance featuring Johnny Knoxville who while brief brings some of the funniest moments Luis Guzman who is right there holding his own Forest Whitaker and Peter Stormare. Arnold still delivers his cheesy oneliners like a pro but has moved on from the usual ones that were starting to run their course. His years in office clearly have made him a better speaker hence a better actor.Arnold may not be as fast or agile as he once was but he still manages to show he can hold his own with the best of them. This film not only gets Arnold back where he belongs on the big screen it also kicks off a movie year that almost feels like the old days of action again with numerous franchise and action icons bringing the pain in 2013. Arnold has always said he would be back and he is better than ever. If you were ever an Arnold fan then get ready for a film that will spark the visual crazy fun that's been missing in this genre for a long time.".

	onyx:emotionText "After brief cameos in films like the Rundown and Expendables we finally got a glimpse of a possible return to form for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Finally his first full length solo action film is here with The Last Stand. As if this wasn't exciting enough add to the mix I Saw The Devil director Jeewoon Kim at the helm it has the makings of a great comeback.The Last Stand follows a former LAPD detective who is now the sheriff of a small quiet town and enjoying the peaceful life. When a notorious drug kingpin escapes FBI custody in a supped up corvette the only thing standing between him and the border is this small town and the sheriff who has vowed to protect it. The story here is pretty simple and in anyone else's hands would have probably been a throw away film. Thankfully Jeewoon Kim brings his signature dynamic style taking this film to a much more entertaining visual level. If there was any concern with Arnold being able to live up to his famous line I'll be back being accurate you can relax because he is back in a big way. This film takes a bit of a step back and moves a bit slowly at first letting the story build a bit instead of just flooding it with action. When the smaller action pieces if you can call any of them that do occur they are pretty high octane and fun to watch. All this builds up to a full on blood bath ensuing old west action show down featuring all the explosions guns blood and fun you could want in an Arnold film. Make no mistake this is a popcorn action film that hearkens back to the old school action films of the 80's and 90's when they delivered. The cast is great and each delivers a fun performance featuring Johnny Knoxville who while brief brings some of the funniest moments Luis Guzman who is right there holding his own Forest Whitaker and Peter Stormare. Arnold still delivers his cheesy oneliners like a pro but has moved on from the usual ones that were starting to run their course. His years in office clearly have made him a better speaker hence a better actor.Arnold may not be as fast or agile as he once was but he still manages to show he can hold his own with the best of them. This film not only gets Arnold back where he belongs on the big screen it also kicks off a movie year that almost feels like the old days of action again with numerous franchise and action icons bringing the pain in 2013. Arnold has always said he would be back and he is better than ever. If you were ever an Arnold fan then get ready for a film that will spark the visual crazy fun that's been missing in this genre for a long time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying this is a straightup good guys vs. bad guys shoot 'em up action movie. Would you expect anything less from Ahhnold? I'll say that I was happy to hear Arnold was returning to the big screen for starring roles once his Governorship was over. I've been a die hard Arnold fan since I was 6. Sure he's a senior citizen now...but he's ARNOLD! The trailers for this movie don't really hide anything it's presented exactly how it is. It's an action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie does try and have these heartfelt moments which come off more as cheesy than anything else. But I will give the movie props for actually trying to develop its characters to the point they're not just cardboard cut outs. They have personality and emotions so you actually care if they live or die. Which is more than I can say for most movies of this type. Unfortunately the movie seemed to be relying heavily on Arnold's return to the big screen to put butts in the theatre seats. The movie only made 6 million on its opening weekend. Making it the bottom of the barrel at the box office. However I went and saw it on a Tuesday night at 7pm and the theatre was packed. So perhaps word is travelling that it's a fun movie and it'll be able to make some money back. Not that I'm crying for Arnold's bank account but it's a shame when a good movie doesn't do well.".

This is a straight up action movie filled with unapologetic violence the way it should be. The movie starts off a little slow but once the action picks up it never lets go. Arnold may be looking his age a little bit but that doesn't slow him down at all. Johnny knoxville is also good as the comedy sidekick and he has his moments to shine him and arnold are definitely an odd couple.

	schema:reviewBody "This is it Arnold Fans our long wait is finally over. Our favorite action hero is BACK! But after being out of the spotlight in a leading role for over a decade as fun as Expendables 2 was it doesn't count is Arnold really returning to the silver screen with the same flair for action and entertainment that he used to? Read on to find out!Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owens a former LAPD Narcotics Agent who left the big city excitement after a bad incident to become the sheriff of the sleepy New Mexico border town of Summerton Junction. Summerton is a town where nothing exciting happens except for the occasional drunk and disorderly or petty theft arrest but this sleepy town is about to get a rude awakening. A notorious drug lord Gabriel Cortez portrayed by Eduardo Noriega escapes from FBI custody and starts making his way towards the Mexican border at 250 mph in a stolen custom Corvette ZR1. Its faster then any chopper. Cortez also has an FBI agent hostage in tow as he dodges police barricades and evades helicopters usually with very bloody aftermath.The FBI task force leader Agent Bannister played by Forest Whitaker thinks it's a slim chance that Cortez will pass through Summerton but Arnold's character knows something isn't right. Immediately suspicious of some visitors one being played by the amazing Peter Stormare the Sheriff knows they clearly don't belong there.In his recent autobiography our favorite action hero describes his part in Last Stand as a great great role. The sheriff knows if he succeeds he writes it will mean everything to the town. His reputation is on the line. Is he really over the hill or can he do it?With 'Last Stand' Arnold has his own reputation to resolidify as leading man. Again the Megastar and Governor of California hasn't anchored a movie since 2003s 'Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines' and at 65 some worried that he's past his prime as an action hero. Is Arnold over the hill or can he still do it?From this Arnold fans perspective the answer is Hell Yes! The action looks great the acting gets better and better as the film runs and there are a few gruesome kills that will make any gore fan happy!The screenplay by Andrew Knauer doesn't give Arnold as many of his signature one liners. Many of them such as How are you Sheriff? to which he replies Old! was already given away in the trailer. But don't worry there are a few more hidden gems.Arnold and his team who consist of the moody veteran played by Luis Guzman the rookie cop played by Zach Gilford the beautiful but skilled deputy played by Jaimie Alexander her screwup ex boyfriend who is stuck in the towns single jail cell played by Rodrigo Santoro and of course the crazy eccentric goofball who happens to own a small museum of artillery played by Johnny Knoxville ban together to become the 'Last Stand' between Cortez and freedom.The shootouts are all high tension and there is plenty of high octane car chases for you Fast and Furious fans plus there are some amazing visuals as well. Kim JiWoons entry into US theaters keeps his edgy style engraved within the heart of the picture and is just as much fun as 'The Good The Bad and the Weird' yet still manages to capture traditional Hollywood flair.There is one thing about this picture that I want to warn you about it takes a little while to really get going. It's a large cast so each one needs a bit of an introduction and story to make you care so I understand. But the great juicy Arnold action starts little more then half way in. And at times I felt myself wishing there was just a LITTLE more Arnold. But all in all it's not a huge deal. Our Hero still steals the show here as he should.Overall I really liked this film. I cheered I winced I threw popcorn in excitement! Is it as good as say... Terminator? Of course not but it's on par with if not better then the likes of Eraser or Collateral Damage! And I really liked Eraser.Arnold is Back! With this being his first entry into cinemas in a long while and it turning out so well I'm now very excited for his next pictures 'The Tomb' 'TEN' and of course 'Legend of Conan'! Get your ass to the Theaters!8 out of 10 stogieswww.thearnoldfans.com".

The tone is serious enough but still has a good amount of tongue in cheek humor and the usual Arnie one liners. Arnold plays a sheriff in a small southwestern town and defends said town against an army of drug runners looking to escort their escaped drug kingpin back to Mexico.Good support cast with Forest Whitaker and Luis Guzman.Johnny Knoxville's screen time is minimal thankfully and doesn't ruin the film .

All in all it's agreeable that there were a couple of faults and a couple of scenes where that may have been silly and awkward. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting was a bit bad at times. But it's fun to watch. It's full of action gunfire and shoot outs. The action is nonstop and there many explosions as well. Any trailer for this movie should pull you right in to watch it. But the real thing that strained down on people the whole time was most likely the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger was finally back and taking the lead again.

In a battle of odds with FBI Agent John Bannister Forest Whitaker who is hot on the trail of Noriega Owens takes a stand with his deputies to stand firm and protect their little town.After a ten year absence during which it seemed unlikely he would ever return to acting it's easy to appreciate the void Arnold Schwarzenegger left in the world of action cinema and indeed cinema in general and for sheer nostalgia to overwhelm your opinion of this new film of his. The Last Stand unwittingly could make you hark for his films of old and want to re live the sheer unmistakable magic you could only get from an Arnold film all over again. Hell the length could even make you forget that his last few films before he became 'the Governator' were of mediocre quality at best or even make you think they weren't so bad after all. It is surprising and certainly very nice to see him back on the big screen again. And while The Last Stand is certainly not without it's qualities there are some big flaws that stop it from being a mesmerizing come back.While he seems to have exhausted himself with his own self publicizing with certainly a few TVmagazine interviews in the UK prior to the film's release it's weird how little publicity the film itself seems to have received I didn't even see a trailer before going to see it. It's hailed as Arnie's big new come back with him prominently headlined as the main star but it's strange how little screen time the big man seems to occupy especially in the first half. For a short while it sort of becomes the Forest Whitaker show as the big prison bus escape unfolds. Not a good thing when you think he's already drowning in a sea of co stars including Stormare Luis Guzman and Johnny Knoxville as the town's resident er jackass. He seems to have a slower more gentle considered presence here his scenes giving the film the same feel one of Clint Eastwood's more modern films would have. Given his age I think this is for the best as the thought of him on wires or using stunt doubles wouldn't be very good. The main problem the film has is it seems unsure of it's tone whether it wants to be a solid compelling action drama or more like one of Arnold's more wackier wise cracking earlier films. Rather than turning to more modern flashy directors like JeeWoon Kim it would be interesting to see how Arnold himself might prove directing one of his own films in the style his old mate Clint does.

	schema:reviewBody "Arnold is back just like he's always claimed! No matter what you think of him as a politician or family man one thing is for sure. Nobody can kick as much booty as Arnold Schwarzenegger. The man has fought and won against robots drug dealers terrorists giant serpents politicians and the Devil.He's battled everyone and everything in his forty plus year career in films and TV. What do you do for an encore after taking a break to be the governor of California? You jump back in the ring and do it all over again! That's exactly what Schwarzenegger does in The Last Stand.ExLAPD officer Ray Owens Arnold Schwarzenegger has retired to the small border town of Summerton Junction and taken the position of sheriff in the quiet community. Things get heated up when Ray discovers the leader of a drug cartel Gabriel Cortez Eduardo Noriega is heading through the heart of Summerton Junction as he speeds toward Mexico and freedom. It's up to Owens and his inexperienced deputies to stop Cortez and his gang as they prepare for a daring escape across the border.Although the film starts out rather slow it picks up and never lets the audience back down. I was getting a bit restless as they took their time establishing the story. As soon as those first explosions and gunshots went off I knew I was in for a bloody and gory good time.The Last Stand is the perfect movie for Schwarzenegger to return to the silver screen in. Its violence gun fighting and handtohand combat are overthetop in that wonderfully excessive 1980s style. However the story and Schwarzenegger's role as an aging lawman are quite convincing.Owens just wants to get away from the rat race of being a big city cop and settle down in a quiet little country town with one road. That doesn't stop him from wanting to protect his home and its citizens. It's completely believable that a guntoting patriotic sheriff and his deputies would do anything they could to protect their town from harm at the hands of murderous drug dealing criminals.Johnny Knoxville and Luis Guzman both do a great job of providing the comic relief we've all come to expect from these great action films. You can't have a great hero without having his inept sidekicks that accidentally help save the day. It just so happens that we get two for the price of one in The Last Stand.Eduardo Noriega is excellent as the pretty boy drug kingpin who lets other people do all his dirty work while he reaps all the benefits. He races towards the Mexican border in a fancy race car with a woman by his side while his gang members get blown away by Schwarzenegger and company. I spent the entire film just waiting for him to come facetoface with Schwarzenegger and get what was coming to him.The Last Stand shows that even in his 60s Arnold Schwarzenegger still has what it takes to carry a bigscale action movie. It might take him a little longer than it used to but he'll still end up handing your tail to you when it's all said and done. From the looks of his upcoming films he's just getting started.".

	schema:reviewBody "And splendid for us the audience. Arnie's back! After small cameos in The Rundown  This blinkandyoumissit cameo also served as passing the torch to new action star The Rock aka Dwayne Johnson and The Expendables finally comes an action film with Arnold as the lead. Directed by a South Korean Jeewoon Kim who is known for bloody and violent films so this information promises a great film filled with right ingredients for Schwarzenegger movie. The film starts off slow to develop the characters which is great at least you care about the characters. Arnold might be older now but he's still go it to be an action hero. The only problem is that this film is not doing well at the box office. The planned return of the 80's is not going according to plan which is sad because the films reminding us of the most probably best times of action films are well made films. I have seen it in a packed theatre so I guess that is a sign positive word of mouth will bring a lot of Arnold's fans to theatre. Johnny Knoxville is not only tolerable but he is also funny. His character bring some of the funniest moments in the film. Jaimie Alexander shows once again that she can pull of amazing kickass heroine. Let's hope she gets more screen time in the next Thor movie. Harry Dean Stanton who is her for one only scene is just unforgettable just as the dialogue in his scene. Forest Whitaker an Oscar Winner gives his usual magnificent performance which sometimes seems very funny given the context of the film and its ridiculous plot. The violence in modern movies is not the same as in the 80s 90s. I don't want to sound like a maniac but given the credit of Jeewoon Kim I expected this film to be more off the chain. It is like the studio executives came on the set and told the director to tone the violence and blood down. Even when things get violent it is just not the same as it used to be. Despite some flaws this film still is a great mindless fun action ride and that is exactly what I expected and it's great to see Arnold back on the big screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "And splendid for us the audience. Arnie's back! After small cameos in The Rundown  This blinkandyoumissit cameo also served as passing the torch to new action star The Rock aka Dwayne Johnson and The Expendables finally comes an action film with Arnold as the lead. Directed by a South Korean Jeewoon Kim who is known for bloody and violent films so this information promises a great film filled with right ingredients for Schwarzenegger movie. The film starts off slow to develop the characters which is great at least you care about the characters. Arnold might be older now but he's still go it to be an action hero. The only problem is that this film is not doing well at the box office. The planned return of the 80's is not going according to plan which is sad because the films reminding us of the most probably best times of action films are well made films. I have seen it in a packed theatre so I guess that is a sign positive word of mouth will bring a lot of Arnold's fans to theatre. Johnny Knoxville is not only tolerable but he is also funny. His character bring some of the funniest moments in the film. Jaimie Alexander shows once again that she can pull of amazing kickass heroine. Let's hope she gets more screen time in the next Thor movie. Harry Dean Stanton who is her for one only scene is just unforgettable just as the dialogue in his scene. Forest Whitaker an Oscar Winner gives his usual magnificent performance which sometimes seems very funny given the context of the film and its ridiculous plot. The violence in modern movies is not the same as in the 80s 90s. I don't want to sound like a maniac but given the credit of Jeewoon Kim I expected this film to be more off the chain. It is like the studio executives came on the set and told the director to tone the violence and blood down. Even when things get violent it is just not the same as it used to be. Despite some flaws this film still is a great mindless fun action ride and that is exactly what I expected and it's great to see Arnold back on the big screen.";

Actors like Arnold are undying icons that is carved in the minds of many generations and i doubt if anyone ever will be known as permanent as they are. too much has been discovered and too many talents are out there these days. its no longer a surprise to see a massively muscular man or a great singer or a great dancer.. the more people succeed doing a certain thing the less chance there will be an ultimate star. so lets make the best out of the ones we already have while we can. keep up the good work !!".

The Gril Who Knew Too Much which is widely considered to be the very first Giallo ever The Indian Scarf is a murder mystery that takes place in a mansion where a bunch of relatives of a recently deceased man are to spend a week together in order to inherit his money. As the week goes on the bodies pile up... The murders are shown from the killer's perspective as it is the case in most Gialli. This may not be the most suspenseful thing in the world but it is definitely a highly entertaining little murder mystery with a nice style and interesting characters. The performances are fine especially the immortal Klaus Kinski who is still quite young here is once again excellent in his role. Other very good performances include Elisabeth Flickenschildt as the imperious lady Lebanon Eberhard Junkersdorf and Hans Nielsen. Every actor delivers but of course Kinski steals the show as always. Fans of murder mysteries and cult cinema should not miss out on this moody little flick that promises a highly entertaining hour and a half!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another Germanlanguage Edgar Wallace movie from the 1960s over 50 years old and as in some others of these Heinz Drache plays a main character. The cast is pretty good in general. Clarin Uhlen Junkersdorf and Aren't are known names to German audiences and the rest of the cast are all pretty experienced as well. The standout here however is Klaus Kinski before his big breakthrough and it is already easy to see from this film why he became such a big star. He only really fills one niche which is people with disorders of any kind that always have a touch of insane with them but he fits these characters better than pretty much anybody else.The film runs for clearly under 90 minutes is in blackandwhite and has a fairly simple premise. A rich man is killed and all his relatives come to inherit a part of his wealth. However the deceased included in his will that they have to spend six days and nights at his place and so they do. And one by one of them get killed usually after showing their true colors and threatening members of the group. A simple yet entertaining premise. Sidequestion What's with their testament by the way? And you can guess yourself which member of the group the killer is. As always with these films it's not the most obvious choice. Not at all. Alfred Vohrer was one of Germany's most known filmmakers back then. The writer has a decent body of work too worked a.o. on the multiple AcademyAward winning The Sound of Music. The film ends with a pretty spectacular finish. It's not really logical all in all but still interesting to watch and one of the best German Edgar Wallace films in my opinion. Recommended.".

Performancewise I've only recently become acquainted with many of these actors but I particularly enjoyed the performances of Elisabeth Flickenschildt as Lady Isabel Lebanon Hans Clarin as Lord Edward her son the more familiar Klaus Kinski as Peter Ross and regular comic relief Eddi Aren't as the family butler whose trolley seems to have a life of its own. Of the killings  all strangulations using one of a set of distinctive scarves  possibly the most inventive was that carried out in a sauna where the victim's neighbour both survives unscathed and remained oblivious to the killer's presence. The film boasted more external scenes than one is usually accustomed to in films of this typeincluding a number of frenetic chase scenes also some of the cinematography was quite inventive particularly in those external scenes.I managed to figure out who the killer was quite early on but not the final scene and I suspect only friends and acquaintances of the scriptwriters were able to do that.Undemanding entertainment nicely handled by director Alfred Vohrer who was already establishing himself as a stalwart of the series".

And the Tuch is after Der Hexer the best one. It just got everything. As a rule of thumb the ones with Drache are best the ones with Fuchsberger are all okay. If Kinski is in it great. But really important is the presence of Eddi Aren't and Siegfried Schuerendorf. Luckily they are in practically every of the 38 or so of the series.Alfred Vohrer one of the unrecognized geniuses of Film directs his incredible cast through a story that is both negligible and a highlight of mystery. Lord Lebanon died and his greedy family is forced to spend a week in the castle if they want to inherit. Of course they are cut off from the outside world because of a storm or something. And so and this is hardly a spoiler I hope as one after the other gets strangled they are on their own. And Frank Tanner Drache the lawyer has to solve the crime. He does it with his usual light spirit. Unfortunately not to successful for he suspects each and everyone and is suspected by the others and even after there are only three members of the family left  one of them the beautiful women well not so beautiful to be honest who has literally no other role than to bring in some female presence he still suspects the wrong one namely wonderful Elisabeth Flickenschildt. Well. Of course the whole thing cannot be taken seriously and is not meant to be taken seriously. There are funny scenes throughout the film. Eddie Aren't as butler Bonwit is superb but easily overshadowed by Schuerenberg who only has to say Was sind denn das fr Sachen? to make my heart jump from joy. Even better when he imitates his parrot saying Murderer murderer as Aren't leaves his room. At the end all the dead are present as ghosts as the will is read to the final family member the above mentioned young lady Gisela Uhlen. But she does not inherit no. Guess who is the lucky one? Try to rent this one somewhere. An easy ten out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sara Campbell Virginia Madsen and her husband Peter Campbell Martin Donovan decide to move to Connecticut when the long journey for the treatment of cancer to her son Matt Campbell Kyle Gallner is taking a huge toll on his body. The 5 children and her move into a cheap rental home but it is quite huge. The father stays back at his job and only comes to Connecticut at weekends. The house has a history behind it. It was actually a mortuary in the 1920's where Ramsey Aickman was famous for his seances which were attended by Harvard professors and all kinds of big shots. He had an assistant Jonah who was a kid and he was a medium who could amplify the nature of these seances. During one of their seances all the sitters around the seance were killed except Jonah who was never found again. But now Jonah is haunting Matt and things start to get weirder as the days go by.This film is 'based on a true story'. How many times have we seen a horror movie which proclaims itself to be based on true events? Most of the times its just a cheap trick to make more money. So I had decided long back never to watch a horror movie by thinking that it was actually a true event. This film is clichd and sort predictable upto a point. Do we have a kid who can see ghosts? Check. Do we have parents who think he is hallucinating? Check. Some cute adorable children? Check. A haunting history to the place? Check. A guy of faith to help them in their time of need? Check. A friend who will believe Matt? Check. Cats or other animals possessed? No. Surprising isn't it? Possessed animals are quite a hit among horror movie directors. Anyway the thing which makes the movie a believable true story is the ending in which Sara says her son is fine and has no cancer now. That would be a kind of proof that this was a true story.Even with all of the clichs this is a very well made movie which is worth a watch. The real high point of the movie is Kyle Gallner who gives a haunting performance as Matt the cancer kid who can see the dead. We can see the subtle change in him when he is kind of possessed by the ghost in the scene where he makes his little brother sleep on a metal table used for autopsies in the funeral room and spins the boy round and round and the look on Matt's face was extremely creepy. He is truly an amazing actor and looks frightening throughout the movie. Virginia Madsen needs no special mention we all know that she was an Oscar nominee and a good actress. She pulls in the necessary requirement of the character. Elias Koteas as Reverend Popescu didn't do enough justice to the role. That's just my opinion. The father character played by Martin Donovan did a good job except in the drunk scene where it really didn't add anything to the story. The graphics are quite cool and it is very stylistically shot which makes it quite a good horror movie. The editing is slick and the ghost scenes look really cool. There are no false jump scares and the background score is well done.710".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure it helped that I was in the right mood and the right atmosphere when I saw this movie at a midnight screening at South by Southwest but The Haunting in Connecticut was a horror movie that really struck a chord with me.I'm a longtime fan of this genre getting acquainted with all the old classics and cult films through USA Saturday Night Horror when I was young and continuing to see and love newer ones such as The Ring throughout college. However when I go on a rant about the current state of horror movies I tell people that today's movies make you heighten your sense of disbelief too much in order to be scared  I call it fantasy horror. There aren't enough movies like The Exorcist anymore where it absolutely feels real like something that has always existed but you've just been lucky enough to avoid.I loved The Haunting in Connecticut because it is much closer to reality horror than fantasy and I suppose that's because it's based on a true story. It just doesn't feel like it came straight out of someone's imagination. It was the kind of movie where not only did I find myself wondering about the true story of the Snedeker family but when I went to sleep that night I couldn't help pondering the history of my own home and its previous tenants. If you're the type of person who loves horror movies I assume that's the exact creepy way you want them to resonate.Besides the background story one of the other reasons I think this movie worked was because of the performance of Kyle Gallner. This young man plays a much more complex and believable protagonist than most of the ones I've seen in horror films lately as his character Matt has a very familiar and scary in its own right disease that makes him question whether the haunting is real or a symptom of his sickness. I venture to say that his character could have made an interesting movie even BEFORE the paranormal activity starts but Gallner was exceptional in this role and I think we'll still be talking about the boy in The Haunting in Connecticut 10 years from now.So for true horror movie fans I definitely recommend checking this one out. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with a horror movie based completely in fantasyland like Nightmare on Elm Street but the creepiest horror usually has a dose of reality. This film will scare you it will make you think and it will leave a lasting impression.".

I loved both despite the obvious difference in style.I found The Haunting In Connecticut disturbingly fun. It definitely had its own style which at times made me wonder when the signs of it bombing were going to appear. I think that was part of why I enjoyed it because it never did disappoint me. This mixture of reality and the supernatural kept me on the edge of my seat. Was it the trauma of cancer causing so much grief for this family or the chillingyet burning hidden secrets of the dead in this funeral home that kept expectations from settling on one aspect or the other? The fact is both were enough to draw attention away from the other while we try to make our own conclusions.An innocent everyday family deals with the possible yet probable death of young Matt who at times suffers excruciatingly from dealing with the unknown and death that he is convinced is his destiny. Squeezed between what is and may be real was enough but then deal with the likes of a stranger who claims to be a reverend...c'mon this is classic stuff. You can't take all this in without suffering a little especially when the family itself starts to fall apart when they need to stick together.While there are some questions that may not be answered the story itself was more than satisfying. Special effects were kept to a minimum but used effectively and when needed. Acting was not Oscar worthy but good enough to make it all seem real. Fun when you want it and scary when you need it.It's definitely a 710".

You really get the nerves on during the movie and it plays you well. As for the acting it is quite obvious but all in all it's not that bad. You can really see the effort to make it look real. The soundtrack has its way through your brain not getting that much annoying and keeping you awake in case you're watching it at a late time.

	schema:reviewBody "So before I watch any movie I come here to see what it is about and what other people thought of it. I came here to see about The Haunting in Conneticut and most of the reviews I seen were bad. I wasn't looking forward to this movie because of it but I had a chance to watch it at a friend's house and I was completely amazed by what people thought about it.Now I am not going to say it was the best haunting movie ever because it wasn't but the movie as a whole was pretty good. The acting was good it made you feel for the characters in the movie espically the boy it was definitely different as far as the plot and even though the scary moments weren't terrifying there were plenty of them to keep me interested.This movie has a lot of what you would call assumed and interpreted stuff in it. I'd bet a lot of that got cut so it is up to the user to interpret and assume what they were going for. Maybe some people aren't smart enough to do that and need the in your face dramahorror to be satisfied. I love movies that make you think and also movies that someone else said...a reality movie. These other movies like nightmare on elm street and all those coming back from the dead killing people for 10 plus movies are just fantasy. Some would argue hauntings are also but I do not agree. Maybe not to the extent of the movies but I do believe in real hauntings. The movie people have to make it interesting and I am not one to bash them for it  Overall The Haunting in Conneticut is a good movie. I will not tell you what happens  but I will tell you that do not always listen to what other people think. This movie was well acted had some very innovative scenes the plot itself while not completely different from other movies was made it's own and I do not think it deserves the bad reviews it got. I enjoyed it.One last thing before I go. People who watch movies just to pick them apart have no business writing reviews for it. Critics have their job for a reason so leave it to them to defile a movie. Sit there and enjoy the movie. That's it. You do not have to sit there and try to guess what happens next. You do not have to pick apart the acting and how bad you think they are. I understand when the movie really is crap I've seen a lot of those too but if you have seen so many movies and can't sit there and watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is then keep your opinions to yourself!".

	schema:reviewBody "2009. The year of the almost good horror film. Less then half way through this movie season we have had a whole wad of horrorslasherthriller movies that have come so close yet haven't make the cut. Instead so far we only have The Univited that can lay claims to being a solid entry but lagging behind in the justnotgoodenough clan is Friday the 13th My Bloody Valentine The Last House on the Left and now The Haunting in Connecticut. I have actually seen the Discovery Channel documentary of the same name and the movie is not exactly loyal but does take numerous elements into consideration when crafting this consistently creepy but ultimately familiar ghost flick. I do enjoy a film that relies on atmosphere and character drama to build tension and a sense of dread over the Hostel philosophy that spend all your budget on fake blood is the best way to proceed. Yet as with many fright flicks the director loses confidence in the audience to stay interested on atmosphere alone and perforates the story with boo moments and just enough clichs to make it forgettable. Diagnosed with cancer teenager Matt Campbell Kyle Gallner is suffering far more from the lengthy car rides to treatment then he is from his tragic disease. Taking charge Matt's mother Virginia Madsen finds a rental property in Conneticut just a short trip from the clinic. Moving away from their hometown Matt his father martin Donnovan younger sister and brother Sophi Knight and Ty Wood cousin Wendy Amanda Crew and mother think that they have found a godsend in the old but charming property. But the home has ties to something far more satanic as strange occurrences begin to plague Matt. Is it his medication or is something more sinister after the weakened teen?Director Peter Cornwell builds tension very well throughout the opening half of the film peppering the atmosphere with terrifying visions from the eyes of Matt. Like most horror films however things begin to dissolve in the latter portions as we are introduced to the token priest the boo moments mount and we are subjected to silly flashbacks that do nothing to heighten the mood back to its original lofty footing. Thankfully some credibility is returned in a extremely creepy climax that will make you reconsider hiring a home inspector next time you look to move.The performances especially from Madsen and Gallner are quite solid and they keep things grounded as best they can as things go awry. But presenting its PG rating as more of a limitation than an opportunity to raise the bar ultimately left me fairly numb even if I checked the closet an extra time the night after.6.5  10.0Read all my reviews at httpwww.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

If you hate gore like me and actually like good scares then I recommend this movie.The acting is superb Matt can make you believe anything with his creepy smiles and the true scare and possessed look in his eyes he is an actor worth watching and can really put on a show. His ragged breaths and shaking limbs can give you a scare on its own.And the ending I loved it in particular since I am a sentimental girl and a sucker for heroic endings. The climax leading to the ending is what got me and put everything together with the hauntings the weird visions and that burned boy.All in all this delivers actual scares with a lot of gasping and jumping moments and will actually make chills run up and down your spine and maybe shed a tear or two. Great movie props to everyone who made it happen definitely gonna watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw The Haunting in Connecticut pretty much as soon as I could the day it came out. I don't know why really it just seemed interesting in the previews. I'm extremely glad I got to see it.The movie starts off pretty shaky showing generic creepy looking pictures and stuff in the opening credits. You'll be thinking oh great here we go again.. The movie starts to gradually pick up showing a pretty sad story of a family that's been in some trouble with a 16ish year old son Matt who has cancer and a dad who is recovering from alcoholism. The family decide to rent a house in Connecticut near the hospital Matt is going to pretty much to make it easier for them to get Matt treated and whatnot.Obviously some weird stuff starts happening in the house. Matt starts seeing things blah blah. You've all seen stuff like this before. There are some key elements that make this movie stand out from other horror movies involving ghosts.For a movie that's PG13 there are some ballsy scenes here. One that particularly stands out in my mind is where a mysterious man is scratching words onto some man's skin and then he proceeds to cut off his eyelid with scissors. That's serious business.Another thing that makes this movie a lot better is the lack of stupid little children ghosts that crawl around and make creaky noises and the lack of needless nudity and blood. This movie has no deaths or gore or stupidly awkwardmoving ghosts.The movie isn't so much scary as it is pulsepounding and jumpy. I a crazy horror movie fanatic even jumped multiple times in this movie. The director really knows how to pull out a ghost at the perfect times and make you nearly pee your pants.The rest of the movie is predictable but satisfying. There are no needless twists at the end of the movie like the ghost coming back out from the ashes or something. The end of the movie is the end everything is happy.All in all if you think ghost horror movies have declined in the past ten years think again cause this movie breaks the mold. It's a fantastic ghost story and I would recommend to any horror fan.".

The director really knows how to pull out a ghost at the perfect times and make you nearly pee your pants.The rest of the movie is predictable but satisfying. There are no needless twists at the end of the movie like the ghost coming back out from the ashes or something. The end of the movie is the end everything is happy.All in all if you think ghost horror movies have declined in the past ten years think again cause this movie breaks the mold. It's a fantastic ghost story and I would recommend to any horror fan.";

However when I go on a rant about the current state of horror movies I tell people that today's movies make you heighten your sense of disbelief too much in order to be scared  I call it fantasy horror. There aren't enough movies like The Exorcist anymore where it absolutely feels real like something that has always existed but you've just been lucky enough to avoid.I loved The Haunting in Connecticut because it is much closer to reality horror than fantasy and I suppose that's because it's based on a true story. It just doesn't feel like it came straight out of someone's imagination. It was the kind of movie where not only did I find myself wondering about the true story of the Snedeker family but when I went to sleep that night I couldn't help pondering the history of my own home and its previous tenants. If you're the type of person who loves horror movies I assume that's the exact creepy way you want them to resonate.Besides the background story one of the other reasons I think this movie worked was because of the performance of Kyle Gallner. This young man plays a much more complex and believable protagonist than most of the ones I've seen in horror films lately as his character Matt has a very familiar and scary in its own right disease that makes him question whether the haunting is real or a symptom of his sickness. I venture to say that his character could have made an interesting movie even BEFORE the paranormal activity starts but Gallner was exceptional in this role and I think we'll still be talking about the boy in The Haunting in Connecticut 10 years from now.So for true horror movie fans I definitely recommend checking this one out. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with a horror movie based completely in fantasyland like Nightmare on Elm Street but the creepiest horror usually has a dose of reality. This film will scare you it will make you think and it will leave a lasting impression.Evren Buyruk from USA".

	schema:reviewBody "Matt Campbell Kyle Gallner has a terminal cancer and is submitted to an experimental treatment in the St. Michael's Hospital Goatswood in Connecticut. The responsible for the trial Dr. Brooks D.W. Brown advises that if Matt starts seeing things he should drop the experiment. His religious mother Sara Virginia Madsen drives almost eight hours with her son since he has nausea and needs to vomit during the travel. She proposes her husband Peter Martin Donovan who had trouble with booze to rent a house in Connecticut to be close to the hospital despite their second mortgage. Sara finds an old house with an affordable price and she questions the catch to the owner and he explains that the house has a history since it was a funeral home in the past. Sara hides the truth from Peter and the family moves to the house. While in the treatment Matt befriends Reverend Popescu Elias Koteas who has also cancer. When Matt has weird visions and nightmares from the past he calls Popescu that tells him that an evil entity is trapped in the house and they are able to see him because they are in the borderline of the worlds of the living and the dead. The Haunting in Connecticut is an above average movie of haunted house since it blends a very well developed family drama with spooky scenes of a ghost story. There are many realist situations like the bad financial situation of the Campbells that are usually forgotten in American movies. Further there is a beautiful message of faith and Sara truly believes that God works in a mysterious way. The drinking problem of Peter and how it affected the relationship with Sara is just glanced and could be better explored. I do not like the sensationalism that highlights on the cover of the DVD that the story is based on a true event since this movie is better than that. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Evocando Espritos Evoking Spirits".

Ghosts haunt houses appear in your sleep bother you scare you... the works. That is agreed on by those of us who believe in ghosts. Plus a ghost haunting a random neck of the woods would just be stupid or a stupid twist to Jason. Only reason I didn't give the movie a 10 was because they had some stupid stuff happening like taking a shower in a house you officially know is haunted. Cast was well picked script was pretty decent. Go watch it.OH and the story not even all that predictable.. and I should know I guessed the end of the first two Saw movies.".

Going in to this movie I had decided that it was going to be cheap and predictable but fun anyways. I am not the cynical movie critic who blasts movies on their typical themes or plot lines but this one left me stunned. I cannot believe that the casting screenplay and special effects on any Hollywood movie could be so terribly amiss. Casting. In truth this entire movie was impossible to believe because the acting was so pathetic. The mother seemed completely out of her league rattling off transparent lines that were shallow but were made to be serious. The possessed boy had the same constipated look on his face the entire time but his acting was not entirely to blame. Do not even get me started on the reverend. He was absolutely ridiculous. During every single one of his lines I started laughing. Plot. The ghost boy Jonah is a medium for seances conducted by an evil man who tries to augment his power by making him throw up a liquidy substance that is said to be the power of the dead. This death vomit is intended to be frightening. So he haunts the house along with other dead people for a reason that is to say the least ambiguous and abstruse. A shaky hurried plot is matched with horrid special effects to create the ultimate farce. If you find a burn victim flashing on the screen thirty times behind a character terrifying then this is the movie for you. Please do not waste your money. I go to the movies a lot and I have learned to appreciate movies with little substance that still offer entertainment. This movie was not even able to attain that stature. Save your money go rent something better.".

I would have actually given this movie a six but they kept trying to make out like this story was pure fact and that rather ticked me off I mean what do they take me for a moron. I know a bit about the story it is taken from and there are so many differences it is pathetic. I realize that you have to add some stuff or the movie is going to be kind of boring heck I am even for embellishing the story to the degree this one did but do not have the this serious voice over telling me how this is true and have the writing at the end tell an out right lie. So what is the story you ask? Well a teenage boy has cancer and his mother is having to drive him a great distance quite often for a special treatment. Mother decides to find a place to rent closer to the place the son gets treatments so he does not have to endure the long drive in pain and vomiting. Of course the family's financial situation is not to good so when the house with the history comes up for rent you know our family is going to make that their new stomping ground. So spooky reflections and such start to take place as well as strange visions and we even have a reverend enter the picture to give our youth guidance. So yes the typical haunted house formula is here. Add in a pointless stretch of film where the father drinks and you have your movie though I am betting that part of the film is actually true but they changed so much around why not just omit that part all together as it really did not bring anything to the film. So I say add some more scares perhaps a little gore do not try to pass off the movie as being a reenactment or something and this film might have been really good...just like a lot of horror movies it is usually might have is it not?".

The actors playing the siblings  the cousin were good  believable.But my least favorite was Martin Donovon playing the father.He just had no personality.What really made me angry was how he acted at the end of the movie.He didn't seem to care that his son miraculously survived a terrifying ordealhe just stood there like it was nothing not even hugging him or acting like he gave a sht! I don't know if this is the fault of the director or the actor for being so cold and pathetic.It just seemed everyone else was so close knit.The Reverend Popescu character was more like a father to Matt and genuinely cared what was happening to him  the family.

The whole mythology of it was really compelling. I saw some bad reviews and have to say what are you talking about??!! They criticize it because we've seen a priest in a Haunted House film before? Isn't that like criticizing a crime drama for having cops? It's like all the people who trashed The Ring. I just don't get it. Here's the real lowdown This is a great film.

I had watched the Discovery Channel program about the haunting and I loved it. I came out of the movie theater VERY disappointed. The biggest flaw in this movie is that a logical reason is given for about 90 of the paranormal activity that occurred. The family's son has cancer and he is on an experimental treatment. The experimental treatment causes visual and auditory hallucinations and the son is the only one that sees the paranormal activity. So when they son starts seeing things he thinks it is a side effect of the medication and doesn't tell his mother. The writers attempt to explain why the son is the only person that sees the ghosts in the house later but it just seems like a cover up to try and make the story believable. The other part of the story I found disappointing I actually discovered AFTER I had seen the movie. I started researching online and discovered that this movie is loosely and I mean VERY loosely based on a true story. There's a very interesting interview with the author of the book that the movie is based on at this website httpwww.horrorbound.comreadarticle.php?articleid61.

	schema:headline " The Haunting in PG13 Horror Movies";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror movies of today why are most of them PG13? Why are we relying on the loud noise factor to scare us? Why is everything now always based on a true story? Is it supposed to make it that much scarier? But when I saw the trailer for The Haunting in Connecticut it actually sent chills down my spine. I never had the opportunity to see it in the theater so I did the rental and to be honest I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater for one reason the loud noises. Seriously I watched this in the dark with the volume turned up and I can't tell you how many years this movie possibly took off my life with every single skip that my heart beat took. The Haunting in Connecticut is not a bad movie by no means it's a fun ghost story definitely gave me the creeps in a few scenes. While I'm a little iffy on some of the effects this was an effective story. I just wish they would stop pulling the based on true events crud because you know that if this really did happen Hollywood emphasizes the person was emphasizing the person was crazy or the person was definitely looking to fill up their wallet during the writing of this script.Matthew Campbell is being treated for cancer on a trial therapy in a remote hospital. After seeing the effect the long commute has on Matt his mother rents a nearby house which she learns was previously a funeral home. They discover a mortuary room in the basement that they are unable to enter initially. The family begins experiencing violent supernatural events that the parents first blame on stress and hallucinations from Matt's medications and treatment. Matt also experiences several disturbing visions of a sance from the point of view of a young man named Jonah and witnesses a doctor inscribe runes onto the skin of a corpse. They investigate the house's past and discover the previous owner Doctor Aickman conducted sances in the house using his assistant Jonah as a medium who convinced many skeptics of his abilities. Doctor Aickman and his guests all died during one of the sances and Jonah went missing. But things keep getting worse as the family descends into the house's madness.Over all I did like the movie it had a very decent story but of course it has it's flaws. The father is an alcoholic now I admit that he was intense to watch but it didn't further the story by any means so it didn't have much of a point. The ghost coming out of Johah's mouth that we see on the DVD cover was a bit cheesy it just looked like one of those fans that are blowing ribbons around and makes the ends flap like crazy. Also I think this would have been a bit more scary with less noise and more Rated R adult content. But I have to admit that this did have some very effective scares like Matthew's descent into madness. A scene that was so subtle but was perfect on the scares was when Matthew is in the funeral room and he puts his little brother on a metal table that was used for autopsies and starts spinning the boy around and around and to see the look on Matthew's face was extremely creepy. So to finish this up the acting was OK the story despite it's not being so original as The Amityville Horror is still pretty creepy the effects could have used some work the loud noises need to be cut down a notch I'm just going to say this is worth the watch for a rental but just don't expect too much.510".

	onyx:emotionText "Horror movies of today why are most of them PG13? Why are we relying on the loud noise factor to scare us? Why is everything now always based on a true story? Is it supposed to make it that much scarier? But when I saw the trailer for The Haunting in Connecticut it actually sent chills down my spine. I never had the opportunity to see it in the theater so I did the rental and to be honest I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater for one reason the loud noises. Seriously I watched this in the dark with the volume turned up and I can't tell you how many years this movie possibly took off my life with every single skip that my heart beat took. The Haunting in Connecticut is not a bad movie by no means it's a fun ghost story definitely gave me the creeps in a few scenes. While I'm a little iffy on some of the effects this was an effective story. I just wish they would stop pulling the based on true events crud because you know that if this really did happen Hollywood emphasizes the person was emphasizing the person was crazy or the person was definitely looking to fill up their wallet during the writing of this script.Matthew Campbell is being treated for cancer on a trial therapy in a remote hospital. After seeing the effect the long commute has on Matt his mother rents a nearby house which she learns was previously a funeral home. They discover a mortuary room in the basement that they are unable to enter initially. The family begins experiencing violent supernatural events that the parents first blame on stress and hallucinations from Matt's medications and treatment. Matt also experiences several disturbing visions of a sance from the point of view of a young man named Jonah and witnesses a doctor inscribe runes onto the skin of a corpse. They investigate the house's past and discover the previous owner Doctor Aickman conducted sances in the house using his assistant Jonah as a medium who convinced many skeptics of his abilities.

Another factor why I wanted to see this is because I'm pretty fascinated by all things unknown and especially anything related to extraterrestrial life. Well when this movie was brought to my attention I made a selfnote and marked it on my tosee list. And I'm thankful that I did. Cause what followed was a pretty cool flick with gore and one badass little alien.Altered is about a group of guys who are looking for a little bit of revenge. They're looking for vengeance because years before they were all abducted and tortured by some Evil Aliens good movie. Anyways they manage to capture one little alien who for some reason was lurking in the woods. There could be a reason behind this....but I'm a little forgetful sorry. Well this little alien isn't just you're little E.T. lookalike he's one tiny ripped up angry little sh!t with sharpass teeth. I'm still wondering if he is or isn't part of the Verdant's IFSP Intergalactic Federation of Sovereign Planets maybe as some supedup fighter alien. Most probably not though. Anyways they get there hands on the little bugger and take him hostage. Obviously things go awry and what follows is a cool little horror movie filled with some nice makeup and gore...and one mean little s.o.b. The movie obviously isn't a flawless piece of work...the acting is average the script is average and the decision making is questionable. But these weren't any of the reasons I rented Altered. I rented it to see a alien flick with gore and violence and hopefully some tense moments and I got those. So if you're like me and you want to catch a neat horror flick with aliens and gore check out Altered. A surprising 8 outta 10.".

Convincing performances from all the players and a well paced plot make altered a great film that just plane works. In recent years B movies have been plagued with bad CGI effects and I for one cant stand them. Altered on the other hand has Thomas Floutz who was the special makeup effects artist on films like Underworld 1 and 2 Xmen 3 and The Caveand many more. So were talking top notch old school special makeup effects with only one or two really nice CGI shots where needed. It also has a great little appearance from James Gammon as the local sheriff. All in all its a cool movie thats nicely shot with solid performances good direction a well paced plot and lots of lovely gore so if that sounds like your kinda flick then don't hesitate rent it kick back and enjoy.".

First of all if they kill this creature his buddies may declare war on humanity. If they don't kill it the thing could escape and either brainwash or kill our heroes the only ones who are even aware of the alien's existenceAltered grabs your attention from scene one and it maintains stability but the climax isn't quite as solid as the rest of the film. The manner in which the last twenty minutes play out are the result of one coincidence or contrived moment following another. Of course it could have been worse. Sometimes these movie fall to pieces when trying to bring the stories to a conclusion. Some films don't even have a conclusion at all. I won't give any names I will say this for the climactic finale The makeup job is sensation as we get to see the creature show us the full works and the scene ends with a sensational wide shot of a spacecraft unlike anything I've seen since maybe Star Wars.Altered concludes on a note which hints that there could be a sequel. One may doubt that something as small as this will see a followup movie but lets not forget that even Uwe Boll's movies like Bloodrayne and Alone in the Dark which most critics put on the worst films of the decade list have somehow managed to get funding for even worse sequels.

Once they get the creature indoors the movie takes off. It's a little hokey at times and some of the dialogue is horrid but the cast makes it work. I was really surprised by the actors in this project. The only lead I had heard of beforehand was Michael C. Williams also from The Blair Witch Project. But they are all quite good and help me stay with the movie when a Scifi Saturday cast would have ruined it. There's a fine line between cheesy and cool sometimes. I believe with a bigger budget the cheese could have been spread thinner. The alien could have used the Stan Winston touch if you get my drift. But I can't complain too much because it is a guy in a suit as opposed to CG silliness.

	schema:reviewBody "After being taken by aliens 15 years ago a group of good ol' boys decide to capture an alien themselves. Not really believing they will succeed the guys actually do trap one and take it to a reclusive friend who seems to know an awful lot about the aliens. Made on a low budget Altered does an admirable job sustaining tension dropping just enough hints along the way to keep us engaged. Being that The Blair Witch Project wasn't really directed so much as improved I had my doubts about Eduardo Sanchez's credentials however he displays a canny sense of the genre. Makeup and visual effects were superb belying the production's budget. Although the script was the weakest link in this alien stew the film remains engrossing. Lead performance by Adam Kaufman is excellent. He carries the film well. Once again Eduardo Sanchez creeps us out by setting the film in the woods. This guy must really hate camping! A genuinely scary movie that won't disappoint its audience.".

Not really believing they will succeed the guys actually do trap one and take it to a reclusive friend who seems to know an awful lot about the aliens. Made on a low budget Altered does an admirable job sustaining tension dropping just enough hints along the way to keep us engaged.

To their surprise they manage to do so! However capturing the alien is as far as their plans have ever gone. What to do with this being becomes the focus of the story as well as revealing the back story of their past through heated dialogue. Their alien hostage proves to be far more dangerous and menacing than they ever expected. It seems that all horror films these days tend to inject ridiculous humor into their script. Altered stays on point the serious tone remains throughout the entire film. This was a rare and welcome surprise. This film also manages to do something with its characters that I have rarely seen before. The characters that I really disliked in the first 20 minutes of the film I found myself having great sympathy for by the end. Such character development is very rare in low budget horror. The gore FX were excellent and the makeup work was second to none. There's no doubt in my mind that this film will become an instant cult classic if not already.".

	schema:reviewBody "Altered is a scifi revenge film done by the same team that made The Blair Witch Project. Like Blair Witch this film is not for everyone. Some will like the film while others will hate the film. I am one of those people who liked this film for the most part. The movie has a very depressing atmosphere but I think it fit the story. I liked most of the characters and felt their plight though there are two that I did not care for. The effects I think are very well done for the low budget that this had.Fifteen years ago a group of men were abducted by aliens and altered. One of them died from the alterations. Now the aliens are back again and these men are out for revenge. The film starts out with them capturing an alien and bringing it back to the lead guy named Wyatt. They cannot kill it because more come then. The alien escapes and it is then a fight to stay alive.Like the Blair Witch Project this film gets a lot of hate. Many people do not even know about this film. I think this film is pretty decent though nothing great. I like most of the characters and definitely had sympathy for them. Even if you do not like the characters in the movie you can at least sympathize with them. Even the characters I did not like I felt sympathy for. I especially like the main character Wyatt because he is the most calm and collected in such a dire situation and is a good leader. I also like the characters Duke and Otis. They were also levelheaded most of the time and can also be funny. I also liked the sheriff character that appeared near the middle of the film. He was not there long but was in the film long enough for me to like him.I did not like the girlfriend of Wyatt. In the beginning I thought she was really annoying. I get what she is going through but I still thought she was annoying at first. She gets better by the end but I still do not really care for her character. I do not like the character Cody either. Again I sympathize for what he is going through. His brother was killed by the aliens he was imprisoned for a long time before the start of the film and by the end of the film he dies in a horrific way. However I still found him to be an annoying prick throughout the first half of the movie and he did a lot of stupid things. The other at least could still be level headed during the situation.I thought the effects for this film were great. The budget for this film was only eight million but they used it effectively. There is no CGI. The effects are all practical. The alien looks great. It looks kind of like the alien from Signs but even better looking. Also in the film there is a character that is bitten by the alien and his body gradually deteriorates throughout the movie. When you see him with his body deteriorated and fragile it looks great. That effect looked amazing.Another issue I have is the ending. It seemed a little outofplace when compared with the rest of the film. It is kind of left up in the air but I felt that the film ended too happily but maybe that is just me. I am not usually a fan of downer endings but the tone of this film makes a happy ending seem outofplace.Overall Altered is a fun alien film horror film and action film. It has decent characters for the most part great effects and some good action in parts. If you are a fan of any of those genres of films then check this out. It is not a masterpiece but it is not supposed to be.".

The acting is without exception dire and seems to consist mostly of the actors screaming obscenities at each other. The special effects were poor. The plot holes were huge and seemingly endless. The aliens were about as scary as a bowl of ice cream.All in all a complete waste of time and DVD rental fee. Avoid like the plague.".

Be they silent black and white no budget or big budget there are very few of them that I can't find something to like about. That said I'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all. This is a case of effects over story. Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film. Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good original story. A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie doesn't even have good acting only good effects. So unless you can only about the gore pass this one up.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez who helmed the wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Besides this is an alien movie of sorts and sounded something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers one of those movies that the critics hated but I enjoyed.But nope unfortunately I felt that for the most parts Altered is a waste of time so I shall keep this review short. Premises are always promising and Altered's no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger and as usual others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff. Stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices so I shall not go into details but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable and something you'd like to forget.What if you're given a chance for revenge? That is you manage to successfully hunt down and capture one alive. What will you do? For this group it's a gleeful payback time or so they thought. And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest with bad uninspiring dialogue and even worse acting. Even if it's low budgeted there aren't many redeeming factors be it strength of storyline or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting. It's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.What's good though is the makeup. Much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which I shan't mention because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. Other than that there are the usual cheap special effects blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before.Watch this only as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in town  Feast this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously. Bogged down by an uninspiring direction you've been warned.".

But in Blair Witch you never get layed. Here you get up close and personal. This film has guts. It is one of the very few mixtures of Horror and Science Fiction that you love. Best of all this is old school. No computer dimensional cross dressing. This is straight up monster. My only complaint they don't give you many perks. No extras but two boring deleted scenes.

Further the stupid trio of characters that open the film is non charismatic. However after 30 or 40 minutes running time there is an explanation and the viewer finds that Altered is an original scifi story with touches of horror and the plot finally becomes interesting.

I don't care about the fanboys who think it's scarycreepy etc...I found it nauseating due to the shaky camerawork and dull to the point of narcoleptic. ALTERED is from one of the directors of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT which is why I wasn't in a rush to pick this one up. At the recommendation of a few people I trust I decided to give it a shot. I have to say that although I didn't find it the film to be as BRILLIANT EXCELLENT or FANTASTIC as other reviewers  it's an entertaining piece of scifihorror that while flawed has an interesting premise and is worth checking out.A trio of hicks who had been abducted by aliens years earlier are bent on revenge. Going back to the abductionpoint repeatedly they finally accomplish their goal and abduct an alien of their own. They take the creature back to their pal's house who was also an abductee to either find out some answers or mete out a bit of backwoods justice. Thing is the alien is a wily little creature that isn't easily defeated...Even though I hated the director's previous film I have to say that when I heard about the premise of ALTERED I was intrigued. Luckily for me the film works on most levels  but I can't say it's anything truly great either.The good points again the concept is pretty original. The FX work is pretty damn good for a relatively lowbudget film and I like that there is very little CGI in the film instead opting for the alien to be a pretty wellmade costume. There are a few decent gore scenes that are notable especially the guy that starts deteriorating after being bitten by the alien.As for lowpoints the redneck characters seemed a bit clich and simple. I personally would have found it more interesting had the abductees been more intelligent individuals. I was also hoping that we'd get to see more revenge on behalf of the humans instead it turned into more of a typical usagainstit film as the alien quickly escapes the abductees grasp.A decent and entertaining film that I personally thought didn't make the most of it's concept. Worth checking out but I can't say that ALTERED is anything truly groundbreaking either...710".
