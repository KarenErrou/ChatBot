All this is said on the package therefore I truly do not understand people who criticise this film for slowness. OF COURSE it is going to be slow what do you expect? After this private note some review. The film is excellent and highly recommendable for many reasons. First of all the shooting the use of nonprofessional actorsauthentic settings and a reallife focus makes this film feel like a documentary although it is set over a hundred years in the past. It therefore gives an unprecedented opportunity to peek into the life of rural Lombardy at the turn of the centuries. Secondly the plot. Slow as it is it sucks you in nonetheless as you get emotionally involved with the beautifully depicted community of families. Full of small and big dramas the film does not cease to surprise till the very end. Finally perhaps the biggest asset of the movie is the loving but realistic depiction of the times. There is dirt hard work and cow dung but there is also nature family and most importantly  love. If you speak some Italian the additional perk is the beautiful dialect. Highly highly recommend!".

I'm not Catholic would pronounce myself an atheist if that didn't suggest the arrogance of certainty but this movie comes as close to touching the soul as any I've ever seen. It is one of the most shattering delightful and profound works of art ever created. After first seeing it I sat in my car clutched the steering wheel and sobbed for half an hour.Since that day many years ago moments from it continue to haunt me. I'll be walking down a street lined with trees and remember the boy walking home from school. Out of the blue the looks on the faces of the justmarried young couple as they adopt a child will come to me. And of course the image of the villagers watching the lone wagon disappear into the darkness is one which will live with me until I die.In short as I stumble my own way through life this film is one of the touchstones that reminds me why I'm here.".

Olmi's extraordinary command of imagery movement rhythm and lighting conveys a potent nostalgia for Earth and the family of man. There is a scene in which images of a father carving clogs for his shoeless boy are intercut with the lives of the farm families. The music accompanying that scene is a Bach organ chorale. The effect is almost sacramental and entirely overwhelming and may be one of my favorite scenes in all cinema. That scene alone is worth more than all the digitalized special effects car crashes ocean liner sinkings and the deafening Dolby vapidity of so much of the inane junk embraced undiscriminatingly by so many. If they only had the eyes to see ears to hear and the soul to love this wondrous work of art!The most authentic version on this film has the original Bergamasco dialect track.

I do not want to reveal too much of the story because I think it will spoil it for the viewer.The film can serve as an educational tool for viewers with children.  It's like going to an outdoor historical museum only the viewer gets to see everything  that it would take one whole year to see at the museum without the crowds.  For example the director takes the time to show painstakingly what it was like to wash clothes one hundred years ago.  It's essentially a living documentary of late nineteenth century Italian provincial life.Most American audiences will have to get used to the slow pace of the film. Even the humor is extremely subtle.  Surprisingly I enjoyed the pace. The pace was silent peaceful and steadfast just as the families are in the film.  To me it is an escape ironically an escape from an escape from many of today's films that just explode with sound effects and rock music films that move at blurring speed with scene cuts that are made with the intent to maximize audience stimulation but often with the result of increasing our stress level.

I know Italy and love it though. Taking place in around the turn of the previous century the simple life of farming tenants on a lord's estate is portrayed with great charm and simple respect. You get a fascinating look at what to us now of course seems a backward combination of ancient religious myths and medieval magic all believed in the hope of a better life in what is a difficult existence. Yet there is a hint of the modern world to come in the distant shouts and arrests of political activists glimpsed to the side who are advocating a more fair economy and less dependence on outmoded beliefs. The warm and dignified life of the loving families is quite believable and no need to judge the comforts they cling to. In terms of length an pacing it takes its time it is true but it is really worth it. A sort of living demonstration of the enduring human spirit and the passing of time and historyeven as old ways are dimly remembered and treasured for their sentiment.".

I know Italy and love it though. Taking place in around the turn of the previous century the simple life of farming tenants on a lord's estate is portrayed with great charm and simple respect. You get a fascinating look at what to us now of course seems a backward combination of ancient religious myths and medieval magic all believed in the hope of a better life in what is a difficult existence. Yet there is a hint of the modern world to come in the distant shouts and arrests of political activists glimpsed to the side who are advocating a more fair economy and less dependence on outmoded beliefs. The warm and dignified life of the loving families is quite believable and no need to judge the comforts they cling to. In terms of length an pacing it takes its time it is true but it is really worth it. A sort of living demonstration of the enduring human spirit and the passing of time and historyeven as old ways are dimly remembered and treasured for their sentiment.";

It is almost like watching a documentary about peasant life right down to its hand held camera techniques. It is subtle though. Not the shakycam or vomitcam stuff you see today.The cast is entirely made up of nonactors. Real peasants. And apparently it was shot using its local dialect Bergamasque which then had to be dubbed into Italian for the Italian market. Olmi explains in the DVD extras that all of the nonactors did their own dubbing which I have to say is quite a technical accomplishment for amateurs.The film opens with a farmer chopping the head off of a goose. A little later on the controversial scene depicting the slaughter and butchering of a hog is played out in almost real time. It is very graphic and quite disturbing. But just when I thought you would never want your kids to see this Olmi cuts to two three yearold peasant kids watching the hog die with unbothered fascination. This is real life on a real farm.And you can tell that it is done by a proficient butcher and is not a gratuitous addon for exploitation. It is just something that Olmi has selected to include in the film.I'd suggest this one for a change of pace.".

You'll learn how things were done before electricity the automobile etc.  Watching this film reminded me of visiting Bali or Morocco I felt immersed in another culture in another time.  The downside is that of course peasants don't live terribly exciting lives and this is a long movie.  There isn't really a plot driving the film.  What I considered to be the action scenes are grisly livestock is slaughtered on camera and it's clear that you are watching the real thing. I almost started crying while watching a pig as it is was slaughtered it was squealing loudly as it was literally eviscerated while it was still alive.This is a contemplative film.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers ahead.An unusual film and a definite change of pace from the rapidfire filmmaking that Americans are used to.  This film follows a year in the life of rural Italian peasants living at the turn of the century.  There is a central plotline a family who wants their son to know a better life then they have tries to send him to school.  However the clogs that carry him on the long and hard journey to school are broken making the path impossible. The central message of the film is that God will provide.  It is a sermon on the virtues of simple faith.  However this central plot very similar to a fairy tale is only a device to allow the film to devote three and a half hours to showing in great detail the lives of the Italian peasantry during this period the way they worked loved and lived.  It's a slice of life film like Fellini's Roma or Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing but it's much less frenzied and sensationalistic then those works.  Like most Italian cinema that I have seen it is more focused around intense images then around plot of dialogue I will never forget the shots of the landscape or the scene of the peasants preparing a pig for eating.  Central to the film is the beautiful sermon that we hear the village priest offer.Interestingly the film focuses on the lives of those people that Pasolini glorified in his films and novels.  Pasolini died a few years before the film was released during most of his life he considered the values of the peasants to be sacred an antidote to the fierce and brutal ethic of the modern world.  By the end of his life he had given up hope in the peasants believing that the mass media had exterminated their native culture and way of life.  It would be economically and culturally impossible to revive in the modern world the system of living that the peasants shared.The Tree of Wooden Clogs is a requiem for a dead way of life released at precisely the time that that culture was drawing its last breath.  Watching it is a beautiful and melancholy experience.  It's a wonderful film but one cannot escape a feeling of irrevocable loss.".

A pig and goose are killed and some might find this pretty disturbing...but it is realistic and is an important part of peasant life.This film is sort of a more modern Neorealist sort of film because like the Neorealist films of the 1940s and early 1950s it is an Italian film that consists of nonprofessional actors in natural settings. However the reason why this was done is quite different. During the time of WWII and postwar Italy sets and actors were hard to come by and directors such as De Sica and Rossellini had no choice but to make these sorts of films. However in 1978 the film was made this way for entirely different reasonsto heighten the sense of realism as the film was about simple folks and having professionals playing these roles might have detracted from this realism.The film is set on a farming collective owned by a landlord. Five families work the land and share a large compound broken down into separate apartments and stables. The life is pretty simple and rather grim and the film does a very good job of portraying this life. And this is much of the problem with this film for the average viewer. While history teachers like me might find it all pretty fascinating and like how accurately this is all portrayed will the average viewer? Probably not. That's because not all that actually happens in the filmand it lasts about three hours. As a result the film does drag and I even found myself feeling sleepy as I watched. It's exceptionally well crafted but also a bit of a chore to view.Tree of Wooden Clogs is a film that film critics will adore but the average person will probably hate...and many folks will feel guilty because they didn't 'get' the movie and think they should have.".

Carefully photographed around Bergamo indeed many scenes remind you of Renato Castellani's mini series Verdi' 1982 and accompanied by pieces of Bach played by Fernando Germani though I also recognised  pieces of Mozart on the piano and Italian popular songs on an old gramophone this film seems to seek keeping some of the past for posterity. With great success it would seem though I cannot ascertain to this in Italy I can assure you that people here in Spain react as though seeing part of their own past history in the villages........ and some of the scenes appear to be almost replicas from Requiem por un Campesino Espaol' Ramn J. Sender or even Melquiades the gypsy in Macondo from Cien Aos de Soledad' that timeless magnificent classic by Gabriel Garca Mrquez. L'Albero degli Zoccoli' is a magnificent documentary a beautiful portrait lovingly painted through the joys and pains of its people played by amateur actors full of real human feelings not forced superficiality. If you like this film I can recommend you also try Las Ratas' 1998II or Tasio' 1984 which though Spanish have certain parallels in being films set in rural landscapes and with a similar unfolding of scenes with very little storyline. Ermanno Olmi directed wrote photographed and edited this great little masterpiece a treasure.".

With great success it would seem though I cannot ascertain to this in Italy I can assure you that people here in Spain react as though seeing part of their own past history in the villages........ and some of the scenes appear to be almost replicas from Requiem por un Campesino Espaol' Ramn J. Sender or even Melquiades the gypsy in Macondo from Cien Aos de Soledad' that timeless magnificent classic by Gabriel Garca Mrquez. L'Albero degli Zoccoli' is a magnificent documentary a beautiful portrait lovingly painted through the joys and pains of its people played by amateur actors full of real human feelings not forced superficiality. If you like this film I can recommend you also try Las Ratas' 1998II or Tasio' 1984 which though Spanish have certain parallels in being films set in rural landscapes and with a similar unfolding of scenes with very little storyline. Ermanno Olmi directed wrote photographed and edited this great little masterpiece a treasure.";

Director Ermanno Olmi conjures a whole world in this quiet epic  that of rural farm life in turnofthe20thcentury Lombardy Italy. We gain a most intimate view of several poor families as they cope with issues both small and majestic from the communal slaughter of a hog to widowhood marriage and perhaps worst of all eviction in a hardscrabble world in which having a roof over one's head seems the ultimate blessing.Olmi grew up in Lombardy and reputedly based this quiet meadering work on tales related by his grandmother. Indeed storytelling is a theme in this film which captures a world on the cusp of electrification when people still had little entertainment other than the spoken word. While peasants in the story live by candlelight their wealthy sponsor boasts a new phonograph on which he plays Italian arias. This film is highly atmospheric infused with evocative images of earlymorning fogs and the cacophony of farm animals. Of the latter we witness two butcherings. I am a lifelong city person and a carnivore but I found these interludes to be shocking  a squawking goose's demise being only a pale foreshadowing of a sow's slaughter. Her shrieks are indeed heartwrenching. But she feeds a population that cannot afford to be sentimental. Survival is an everyday challenge in this world whose daily struggles are punctuated by a country priest who is both pragmatic and practical. When protagonist Battisti questions the necessity of sending his son to school when he himself has never seen the inside of a classroom the cleric tells him that is not a good answer and you know it. What fine and necessary words! And how prophetic they turn out to be for Battisti makes a horribly selfdefeating decision later in the film that will change the course of his family's fortunes. Olmi has captured a place that probably is lost to time. At three and a quarter hours it takes some effort to fully absorb. But I imagine its remarkable imagery will remain with me.".

The landlord is a horrible person expelling a peasant from his property for felling a tree in order to make the shoes of the title for his little child but amazingly this never seems to cross the mind of the peasants who accept their destiny stoically.

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to see what comedy should be instead of the grossout humor passed off as comedy in movies like Austin Powers see this film. This forgotten gem stars a very young Grard Depardieu as adetective hired to find the missing daughter of a business.  It is shot in the French tradition of visual comedy and is very very funny.POSSIBLE SPOILERSGrard's character a nononsense detective who does not believe in superstitions or luck has been teamed with a hapless man whose life seems to disprove the notion that bad luck does not exist.  The missing girl also has had a life of extraordinary mishaps and her father believes that this poor schmuck will be like a guide dog leading  Depardieu straight to her. Depardieu's mission becomes more and more simply trying to keep this poor shmoe alive as he searches for the businessman's daughter and continues to disbelieve his claims of bad luck until it starts to rub off on him.  By the end of the film he is a superstitious nervous wreck and it is fun to see this handsome leading man developing a nervous tic and believing the smallest occurrences are a sign that something bad is about to happen. A long stream of unpredictable and inventive incidents occur throughout the movie that would convince anyone that carrying a lucky charm is not such a bad idea after all.  The end is a masterpiece of French visual humor.  If you like Depardieu check this out sometime.  There are worse ways and movies to spend your evening.  By the way Martin Short and Danny Glover remade this movie a few years ago and it was not a tenth as funny as the original proving that American screenwriters need to smarten up their writing.  Seven stars for me.".

One only has to read the comments  almost exclusively raves  to guage the quality and I can only add one more voice slightly hoarse from so much laughter in support. The concept is simplicity itself take one accidentprone girl and because her father is an industrialist ergo wealthy let her predilection for bad luck result in her playing into the hands of kidnappers THEN instead of hiring a team of SASmercenaries to track her down hire just One private investigator and supply him with a human bloodhound in the form of as big a dork as the missing girl. Pierre Richard breathes life into a dork who doesn't wait for a banana skin to trip on he brings his own. Team him up with a pragmatic Gerard Depardieu who refuses to give house room to the concept of bad luck and just stand back and let them get on with it. The Mexican setting is largely irrelevant it could just as well have been set in Marseilles but laffs are laffs wherever they occur. The ending is particularly effective  it's always something of a problem to end a story like this  as the two Dorks fall in love as expected but then Veber rounds it off with one last neat and very apposite visual gag. Not to be missed. 1010".

	schema:headline " A hilarious French comedy only the way the French can do it.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those cool French movies with weird characters and it makes me want to come back to them. Unfortunately like all movies there are some good and some bad. This is one of the good ones.The extremely clumsy daughter of a Paris businessman is kidnapped on a trip to Mexico. She is not taken for a ransom but for a prostitute but ends up proving too much trouble. The father desperate to find his daughter again decides to listen to his weird psychologist who suggests that he look for his daughter by using another clumsy person. As such this movie becomes an odd couple with a detective and a clumsy oath having to work together to find this woman.This is a good little movie with a lot of slapstick humour. Slapstick done well can be very funny. I think it is done quite well in this movie. In fact the clumsy characters mean that a lot of the comedy relies on slapstick and the occasional stupid statement. I think that it is done quite well.The one thing that comes out of the movie is the idea of true love. This only comes in right at the end but it works on the idea of the soul mate  that is one person has somebody who is so much alike that they will find each other and be instantly attracted to each other upon meeting. We don't understand this until the end where they see each other and simply walk out onto the pier hand in hand. There is not sweet talk or anything they simply take each others hands and walk out  as if it was always meant to be. This to me is one of the most beautiful scenes that I have ever seen.I of course don't believe in the idea of the soul mate or true love. There are people which we are more attracted to than others and sometimes things like this will happen but the idea that everybody has a soul mate is not true. Some people say that God has a person set aside for us but that is not what the bible says. In fact the bible says that some people will not get married preferring to do God's work alone. People like my mother and father love each other very much but are hardly considered to be soul mates. In fact the saying that opposites attract is more true than not.Still this is a beautiful little movie and I really did enjoy it.".

	schema:headline " I only hope you'll be LUCKY enough to discover this gem of French Comedy ...";
	schema:reviewBody "With so many scripts such as The Tall Blond with a Black Shoe A Pain in the Ass and the internationally acclaimed The Birdcage Francis Veber already confirmed in the 70's his status as one of the most promising and talented comedic screenwriters of French Cinema the equivalent of Billy Wilder if we also take his directing into consideration. But in the early 80's he had only directed one movie called The Toy starring Pierre Richard and released in 1976. And although the film was a modest commercial success it was not until the release of The Goat in 1981 that Veber made his deserved entrance in French Comedy's Hall of Fame.The Goat is now regarded as a classic of French comedy and a film that didn't lose its appeal after 30 years. Featuring for the first time the duo made of Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard who would appear in two other films the film uses the basic ingredients of the typical buddy movie with the funny guy and the straight one in other words the eternal odd couple but that's only on the surface don't let yourself fooled by the poster. Behind the laughter The Goat accomplishes something more impressive it makes us care for the two characters and not just on a comedic aspect. Indeed no matter how funny the gags are what makes the film so impacting is the progressive bond going between Campana Depardieu and Perrin Richard who'll learn to get along despite their differences. Any other director would have made this material clich but Veber always finds the right note and seems to get the best from the two lead actors making the supporting cast more forgettable and guilty of providing a false feeling of Bmovie. For instance the movie is set in Mexico but people there speak good French with no accent whatsoever these details were perceived as futile precisely because the story was the most important.I don't want to make the film sound serious when it's indeed a great comedy still funny and fresh by today's standards. My point is that the core of the film is the relationship transcended by Depardieu and Richard's incredible performances. Pierre Richard is like the 'Steve Martin' of French comedy with a natural clownface that made him the perfect lovable loser of French Cinema. Richard plays Franois Perrin a modest accountant so unlucky and accident prone that no day of his life passes without him being victim of a misfortune. What could have lead to a series of goofy situations is not overdone in the film as the point is not Perrin's bad luck but how his bad luck would lead to the rich businessman's daughter Marie. This point is essential because it explains the failure of the dreadful American remake Pure Luck starring Danny Glover and Martin Short. Marie appears in the first scenes she's kidnapped in Mexico and apparently suffers from the same badluck syndrome than Perrin. After many fruitless investigations the father's psychologist suggests that the detective Campana goes back to Mexico with Perrin feeling that this time Perrin's bad luck would be the compass guiding them to Marie.We laugh at this premise that flirts with fantasy and of course Campana the toughguy detective played by Gerard Depardieu comfort our feelings and embodies our thoughts. He's a nononsense guy reasonable and don't believe in luck or hazard but It's a lastchance mission and Perrin after having given a luminous demonstration of his daily bad luck through a funny test involving chairs is chosen for his remarkable intelligence and perspicacity to look for Marie with Campana as an assistant. The duo works perfectly because Perrin is not naturally funny but funny despite himself he takes his role his mission so seriously that he's incapable to realize his total incompetence. And we see him trough the condescending eyes of Campana. I read in the Trivia section that Depardieu wanted to play Perrin's part this proves that he's one hell of an actor but not much of a casting agent. Depardieu as the duo's straightman is the one who makes the situations funny. When Perrin accidentally burns Campana's tie it's funny okay but the look on Depardieu's deadpan face is the laughoutloud payoff. Depardieu's reactions are almost as equally hilarious as Richard's clumsiness if not more.And as the story progresses and some of Richard's misadventures start to give clues about Marie's disappearance we understand that the psychologist's theories are not without validity but at this precise moment the focus is more on Depardieu and Richard's odd couple and its evolution especially when Campana's confidence about the nonexistence of bad or good luck starts to be seriously shaken through his companionship with Perrin. At one point both are in jail with another prisoner and then they're informed that every day the guards take one prisoner to beat him badly Depardieu's pitiful face while looking at Richard made me laugh so hard but the twist that went after literally killed me. If only for the 'prison part' which is pure comedy gold the film deserves to be a classic among the classics. Although I would have done it without some gags like the inexcusable gorilla coming from nowhere while there are no Apes in South America. Apart from this one the rest works perfectly.And speaking of South America the film also possesses an undeniable escapist value from the setting something that would appeal to every audience and it's beautifully served by whom I believe to be the greatest French composer ever Vladimir Cosma. Cosma who scored Veber's films and some of the most classic French comedies beautifully conveys this mix of exoticness and melancholy in his theme and it perfectly serves the film's conclusion which is as poetic and satisfying as any other movie's endings magnificently closing the first opus of one of the most defining duos of French comedy Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard.".

	schema:reviewBody "With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot. It is a shame how bad he uses good talent. Many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors.".

	onyx:emotionText "With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot. It is a shame how bad he uses good talent. Many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors.";

	schema:headline " Hound it down";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hound of the Baskervilles is almost certainly the Sherlock Holmes story most adapted for screen versions. In a sense that's not surprising because it's so good but in another it is since the character of Holmes himself is absent for much of the story. Filmmakers tend to resort to awkwardly rewriting the original or leaving the story in the hands of a bumbling unbelievable Watson. This film however from a series of excellent films made for Soviet television and starring Vasili Livanov as Holmes benefits from a Watson who is perhaps the screen's best  excellently acted by Vitali Solomin as both a man ready for action and a sensitive writer and always three dimensionally written. He's more than capable of driving the middle section of this Hound of the Baskervilles  a production which apart from that also seems to get just about everything else right. In two parts it runs to almost two and a half hours and that long running time is invaluable. It never drags being excellently directed with attention to detail in every shot and a nuanced sense of suspense and the extra breathing room allows every minor and supporting character to be given a significant role. That's huge as they are all illuminated with wellwritten scenes and inhabited as character parts with good performances. It gives a great sense of scope and complexity to the mystery. Part of the success here is that this production somehow manages to treat the original without too much reverence but still to recreate its atmosphere perfectly. This means while Sir Henry is introduced as a very funny figure of comedy he can slowly become more of a figure of pity. It is actually quite effective the way heart is added by playing on Sir Henry's unrequited love for Mrs. Stapleton and his interactions with Barrymore become a delightful whole movie in and of themselves. As with the other films the cinematography as well as the locations and settings are gorgeous and evocative of a very rich and detailed Victorian world  with a slightly Russian flavor mirrored in the language naturally spoken by the actors. The music sometimes strikes a contrast this time but always seems to work despite itself. The hound itself  which in other films comes off as silly  is realized with wonderful and spooky simplicity as per its actual explanation. And as in his previous appearances Vasili Livanov is a sublime Sherlock Holmes  an immensely appealing and wellacted version of the character. In short as close to a perfect screen version of The Hound of the Baskervilles as I have seen and a cracking good film on its own.".

And it is true. There were made several movies about the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr.Watson for Russian TV in the late 70ies and early 80ies including such films as The Meeting The Hound of the Baskervilles Bloody Script and many more about 10 total number. Livanov as Sherlock Vitaliy Solomin as Watson Rina Zelenaya as Mrs.Hudson Borislav Brondukov as Inspector Lestrade all make these series directed by Igor Maslennikov an alltime masterpiece. Almost all of actors started their careers in theaters Livanov Solomin and Zelenaya continued giving performances even after their success on the big screen which gave films amazing atmosphere of reality. The images of old London were carefully reconstructed in Baltic cities almost untouched by time which gave movies a lot of similarities with real XIX century London. All movies it wouldn't be right to call them episodes are set on very high level and from the opening unforgettable music score they charm every viewer. It's very hard to distinguish the best film of the series every of them has something unique. The Hound of the Baskervilles for example has the greatest number of participating celebrities including Nikita Mikhalkov internationally known for directing and playing in such movies like An Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano The Barber of Siberia Oscarwinning Burnt by the Sun etc. Oleg Yankovskiy Nostalgia by Tarkovskiy Evgeniy Steblov and many more. This set of movies is a mustsee for everyone whether you've read the book or not. It's rather difficult to find these movies with English subtitles but they exist and trust me they worth searching for them. 10 out of 10 for all films.".

Seeing it once does not satisfy.No doubt  Vasili Livanov is the best as Sherlock Holmes. I could not imagine any actor who could play this role as beatiful as he did. His especial tones in the voice make him incredible and unforgetable as the greatest consulting detective of all times.Greatest part of the glory goes to Vitaly Solomin who has played John Watson  great actor great scene of drunk baronet Watson and BarrymoreOf course Nikita Mikhalkov. This actor and director is known now for many movies he participated in.Then we saw him still young and already known but not so famous as he is now. He makes this movie as amusing as he can. Maybe this feature and all the twists and turns as he plays them as Henry Baskerville make this movie so different from those of other countries' ones.  His performance makes you applauding him for thisAnd of course Barrymore as played by Aleksandr Adabashyan will be remembered in years.  His announcements in the process of the movie and calm servants' character which sometimes grows into overwhelming care for the young baronet adds to this movie another aspect as a result of which we too starting to worry about Sir Henry not less than Barrymore himself.Many other actors also played their part in this movie on their best side. Oleg Yankovsky as Stapleton Alla Demidova as Laura Lions Yevgeni Steblov as Doctor Mortimer and many others. We have to thank them all otherwise this movie would not ever been what we are used to see today. In two words in this movie we got the best of Soviet cinematograph and its actors.All the glory I think should go to the director of these series of movies of Sherlock Holmes adventures Igor Maslennikov.I have seen Hound of Baskervilles many times as well I also saw movies that were made by Americans and English. Of course it is only my subjective opinion but the russian movie is the best of them all. If you did not see it then it is a must for you to do it now.Even at those distant times of 20 years ago when the movie was done no computerized special effects or whatever else was available this movie involves you deeply into the dark and brilliant story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who brings you into the age where there were no electricity cinema or planes. This was the age of Victorian England the age of the British Empire the age of Sherlock Holmes.".

In two words in this movie we got the best of Soviet cinematograph and its actors.All the glory I think should go to the director of these series of movies of Sherlock Holmes adventures Igor Maslennikov.I have seen Hound of Baskervilles many times as well I also saw movies that were made by Americans and English. Of course it is only my subjective opinion but the russian movie is the best of them all. If you did not see it then it is a must for you to do it now.Even at those distant times of 20 years ago when the movie was done no computerized special effects or whatever else was available this movie involves you deeply into the dark and brilliant story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who brings you into the age where there were no electricity cinema or planes. This was the age of Victorian England the age of the British Empire the age of Sherlock Holmes.";

With these bare bones versions of the Sherlock tales you'll get a setting they want you to believe is in London circa the time they were told but you can plainly see that the backdrop is Soviet with the architecture and style. Even with this it's very charming the Soviets take on the Sherlock series.I can't tell anyone enough how good this series is. They couldn't have picked a better pair to play the title roles.

Faithful to the original novel this probably isn't the best introduction to the series as Holmes is absent through much of it while Watson investigates alone. With so little HolmesWatson interaction some of the appeal must certainly be missing.That said I very much like how Watson seriously diligently and intelligently carries out his investigation not unlike numerous other successful fictional detectives. Except when tipsy he is rarely the stereotypically foolish Watson. If I had never heard of Sherlock Holmes I might even have expected Watson himself to solve the mystery. However because he is so serious it makes his character a bit too dry through much of film though that in turn makes his actual flashes of foolishness and his reunion with Holmes more effective illustrations of Watson's true character.What was interesting about the supporting characters is that they definitely seem to have more than a little Russian in them from the humorously extroverted Sir Henry Baskerville to the archslavictragedian portrayal of Beryl Stapleton. I found it a bit jarring at first expecting more British reserve in the characters but eventually just let them be themselves and let myself be entertained. Much of Dartmoor also looks far more Russian than English but that's only to be expected and easily overlooked.Overall this is a well done 'Hound' true to the story and true to the characters of Holmes and Watson. I got some hint of Vasili Livanov and Vitali Solomin's vast appeal but not enough for me to become a wildly enthusiastic myself. At least not yet. Because that hint is more than enough for me to nag my sister into getting me the rest of the LivanovSolomin Holmes series. And then we'll see....".

But it is so and after Rathbone Cushing and Peter Cook and two years before Ian Richardson it is Vasili Livanov's turn to don the deerskin cap and disappear for one third of the movie.One of the reasons I find it peculiar that The Hound became the most popular filmic Holmes adaptation is that Holmes is absent for a good chunk of the running time. And while it's an engrossing murder mystery on its own it so happens that in franchises of this sort people generally come to see the hero being a hero. And one of the flaws of this Russian adaptation is that unlike Nigel Bruce Vitali Solomin doesn't have the charismatic presence and weight to carry the movie while Livanov is away.Still like its predecessors this sixth entry in the Soviet Sherlock Holmes saga with Vasili Livanov in the titular role is every bit as stylish entertaining and endlessly watchable. Exchanging the baroque opulence of London for the rural atmosphere of Devonshire and benefitting from the natural beauty of real locations The Hound builds and sustains its mystery and suspense even though the novelty of the story has been worn out by now.Excluding the natural flaw of a Sherlock Holmes movie with not enough Sherlock Holmes the movie has been wisely split up in two parts making the 2.5 hour duration a manageable task. The murder mystery of a demonic hound terrorizing the last heir of the Baskerville family is great and from a technical perspective the movie even though made for TV has a lavish cinematic feel.Definitely among the handful best adaptations of The Hound of the Baskervilles.".

Thanks to an up loader on Youtube I think he is also the same person who writes the number one review here I was able to watch it.Perhaps due to issues not related to this film issues of my life I cannot say that I have been enthralled with this film. HOund of the Baskervilles of course is the most famous of all Sherlock Holmes stories. You have the 1939 film with the most famous of Holmes Basil Rathbone and then you have the 1959 version color courtesy of Hammer with Peter Cushing.Having seen the Hammer version first before the Rathbone version The Hammer version has always been my favorite even above the more critically acclaimed 1939 version. Also for me Peter Cushing will always be Sherlock Holmes Andre Morrell Dr. Watson and Christopher Lee the young Baskerville from Canada. Even the actor in that version playing Doctor Mortimer was great as well. I would suspect that anyone having watched the 39 and 59 versions first will have a tough time with any other Hound of the Baskerville movies.Watching the Hound of The Baskervilles in the Russin version while the acting by most is good I have problems with the gentlemen playing Mortimer and the young Baskerville. Sorry that I cannot give names of the actors I saw the actors film Slave of Love which I did enjoy. I just can't stand both of their characters though I kind of like it when this Dr. Mortimer holds his dog. Another big problem that others I think will have if they have seen the two more famous Baskerville movies is that their is no suspense if one has seen those movies one already knows what is going on and their is no mystery. Also what is with this Wild West style music did Russians think that the Wild West extended to England in the 1880's as well? I have to admit one scene of the carriage ride going to Baskerville Hall reminded me of Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence.Perhaps a mistake is to watch this Russian Holmes version first perhaps at the time the producers of these shows realized that the Hound story is the most famous and decided it would be better to show first what might not be as familiar as this I believe was the 6th story. I might be better off to see those other stories first also as they might be more interesting to me to do so as I may not know what is going to happen. Also being English Speaking and having heard Holmes always speaking English with an English accent something that other viewers from other nonEnglish speaking countries who may have heard Rathbone and Cushing dubbed by other actors might also be a difference.".

All the actors do an excellent job and the movie filmed some 60 years go does not seem dated. The writing directing acting etc all stand up even now some years later. I also liked the 1959 Hammer Version of this story but Peter Cushing is not the perfect Sherlock Holmes. Basil Rathbone is the definitive Holmes as Nigel Bruce is the perfect Dr. Watson. Watch this sometime soon and enjoy!!!".

The two actors embody the characters of Holmes and Watson and it's a delight to see the interaction between the two. This movie is great on all levels from the creepy atmosphere of the moors where the hound from hell roams to the performances of all the actors involved. Richard Greene who plays Sir Henry Baskerville and John Carradine also give solid performances. I remember watching this movie on late night TV with my sister when I was a kid and being genuinely frightened by the scenes on the moor when Richard Greene is being chased by the hound. For me this is the best of the Sherlock Holmes series of movies that was made in the late 1930's and 1940's. A must see!".

Very rarely is a movie entirely faithful to an original book and usually for good reason. This movie stands on its own merits as a spectacular film.Basil Rathbone brings Sherlock Holmes to life vividly.  The working relationship between Holmes and Dr. Watson is so well fleshed out on film that it is fun to watch.  Holmes disguises are nothing short of entertaining.  The young Henry Baskerville is portrayed by a handsome young actor who has screen presence.  The spooky moors and the Baskerville Estate become a presence just as if they were a character in the film.  The entire array of characters introduced to us in this film were all well played and endlessly interesting to watch.This movie is a must see for folks who like good movies.

In this first outing that is down to a minimum. His Watson while maybe not the ladies man in Doyle's stories is still a competent medical man athletic if stocky and the perfect counterpoint to Rathbone's Holmes.I did enjoy the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes episodes but still prefer Rathbone and Bruce because of the remarkable chemistry between the two. I can see these people and believe they actually shared rooms together and liked each other enough to keep that arrangement for many years.Supporting characters in Hound are noteworthy as well. Lionel Atwill is awesome as the mysterious Dr. Mortimer and John Carradine is perfection as always.Highly recommend watching this on a rainy evening.

And it was the first time that Basil Rathbone portrayed the worldfamous sleuth from Baker Street  the beginning of a very successful and very highclass film serial produced by 20th CenturyFox that would comprise all in all 15 movies over the next eight years.And Rathbone certainly was an ideal choice for the role both physically and regarding his onscreen image very British and slightly haughty but still with a sense of humor  only most of the time at the expense of his friend and assistant amiable Dr. Watson who was wonderfully played by Nigel Bruce. In fact many Sherlock Holmes fans regard Rathbone as THE personification of Holmes only we mustn't forget Arthur Wontner who had also played Holmes in five movies and was at LEAST as close to Conan Doyle's original character if not even a little bit more....Actually the whole cast is superb idyllically handsome young Richard Greene as Sir Henry Baskerville the heir of the huge estate of the Baskervilles whose father has died under mysterious circumstances in the moor recently Lionel Atwill as the strange Dr. Mortimer Wendy Barrie as beautiful Beryl Morton Lowry as her young stepbrother... And no less superb is the direction foggy Dartmoor probably had never been photographed in such a uniquely creepy way before providing a perfect background for the murderous ongoings that revolve around the old legend of a horrible hound that scares or bites people to death... But Sherlock Holmes of course has got another much more reasonable theory! The whole film is immensely suspenseful with England around 1900 being marvelously recreated in every detail but especially the dramatic climax in the end is REALLY made for strong nerves  a real thrilling classic MUST for every fan of the crime genre!".

	schema:reviewBody "Of the half dozen or so different takes on The Hound of the Baskervilles that I've seen this one is my favorite  just barely edging out the Hammer film from 1959. Why? There are a number of reasons I could cite.1. Acting  The 1939 version of the Hound of the Baskervilles has to have one of the strongest casts ever assembled for a Sherlock Holmes film. It's a veritable Who's Who of 1930s40s horrorthriller stars. Basil Rathbone Lionel Atwill John Carradine Wendy Barrie and Eily Malyon all give outstanding performances. Even E.E. Clive appears in a small but enjoyable role. And Nigel Bruce whose bumbling Watson could really get on my nerves gives one of his best performances as Holmes' sidekick.2. Atmosphere  If there's something that filmmakers from the 1930s knew how to do and were especially adept at its creating atmosphere. From the fog shrouded moors to the dangerous London streets there's enough atmosphere in The Hound of the Baskervilles for two or three movies. The cinematography and lighting go along way to helping create this feeling. It's something that seems lost on many of today's filmmakers.3. Direction  While nothing outstanding Sidney Lanfield is nonetheless solid in the director's chair. One key is the pacing he gives to the film. The movie moves along quite nicely with very few moments that slow things down. Sure this version of The Hound of the Baskervilles may veer away from the original source material but it's for good reason. The film would have been too slow and ultimately quite dull had it stuck too closely to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work. I've read the book but as much as I enjoy it I realize changes have to be made for the screen.While there are a number of other things I could mention in The Hound of the Baskervilles that appeal to me I'll stop here before this thing gets out of hand. In the end I've always found this a solid production and a very enjoyable film. I've got no problems rating it a 910.Finally one thing that has always seemed odd to me is the appeal of The Hound of the Baskervilles. Don't misunderstand it's a good story. But I'm not sure I understand why it has been filmed more often than any other Sherlock Holmes story. Why would a plot that has its main character Holmes in this case disappear for about half the movie be the most famous and most often filmed story from the character's casebook? Like I said it's just always seemed a bit odd to me.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast I'd LOVE a 100 faithful adaptation of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES but as a realist I know that the only way that would happen is if a group of actors read the book word for word on radio or audiotape. After all what works in a book doesn't always work on screen and Ernest Pascal's adaptation is faithful to the spirit if not always the letter of Conan Doyle's novel just watch the scene in the hut on the moor when Watson meets up with Holmes who explains what's going on 'Murder my dear Watson. Refined coldblooded murder.' The scene as written by Conan Doyle is a bit dry Pascal expands on it in a way that makes the scene work on film and in doing so shows that he was clearly in tune with the source material. Yes some key characters were dropped or had their parts reduced others were built up so there would be a few more suspects. In the end however we're left with what is still the best version of HOUND ever committed to celluloid. Basil Rathbone IS Holmes even if he had never played the character again he would still be guaranteed a place among the great portrayers of the detective. Nigel Bruce's Watson is brave and loyal and not the somewhat bumbling sidekick he became in the later films and there is a real friendship between his Watson and Rathbone's Holmes which is a crucial element of any portrayal of the characters yet which is so often missing. As is only natural with a film made more than sixty years ago it does creak a bit in places but it's still a wonderful way to spend ninety or so minutes.".

	schema:headline " Rathbone's Introduction to the Ultimate Sherlock Holmes!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "1939 was a great year for Basil Rathbone. Not only did he star in Son of Frankenstein but he began his string of Sherlock Holmes flicks that even now are as popular as ever. For anyone who enjoys mystery suspense good vs evil or just a fun intelligent film The Hound of the Baskervilles is definitely worth a serious look. The film stands out for many reasons. One of them is the classical atmosphere and its mysterious feel. The characters are all excellent and make great suspects in the case especially John Carradine as the butler. Another thing is that this is one of only two Holmes films that are placed in the Victorian time period giving it a truly natural feel the way that Doyle intended. This is before Sherlock Holmes became the victim of antiNazi propaganda just like everyone else. Don't get me wrong I love all of the films for some different and some similar reasons. I just wish that there were a few more from the Victorian period that's all. Anyway in this film Rathbone is brilliant as Holmes. He is full of life and seems genuinely intrigued and excited in his portrayal. Nigel Bruce is also very good as a competent Dr. Watson before the funnier but less competent version was invented shortly thereafter. The movie is the most true to its original source Doyle's novel as well. I think that its also more of a movie in itself rather than a Sherlock Holmes movie which accounts for Rathbone being credited second under the charming leading man. Finally this movie contains the only jokelike reference to the famous detective's implied cocaine use. To fans of Holmes Rathbone mysterysuspense good acting and great films I say this Check out this series starting with this movie!! Oh and Watson the needle.".

I have recommended this movie to many people over the years since I first saw it after reading the book in 8th grade English. I couldn't believe just how much it followed the book to a T. Maybe a very few variations from book to movie but I have never seen another movie follow a book so closely. I am a stickler for detail this one had it all.

	schema:headline " An excellent take on the classic Doyle story";
	schema:reviewBody "This classic take on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel is a fantastic thriller. Although I prefer the Hammer Horror version this one is a more than worthy second. The story will be familiar to most people that know anything about classic literature and it features a family that have been cursed by a mythical hound due to an ancestor's actions years earlier. After the death of his uncle Sir Henry Baskerville moves into Baskerville Hall which is located on the Moors in Dartford and claims his family fortune. However the hound may still be a large and Sir Henry's life may be at stake. Enter ace detective Sherlock Holmes. Hired by the doctor and friend of the family Sherlock sends his assistant Dr Watson down to Dartmoor to investigate the goings on down there while he attends to some other business back in London. What follows is an exceptional exhibition of atmosphere mystery and tension as the enigma of the hound of the Baskervilles unfolds in front of the audience's eyes! The Moors serve as an excellent setting for a story like this. As the film is keen to profess it's location is as rich in life as the story itself and that's what makes the Moors all important for the film's story. The Moors are also extremely atmospheric with it's many pitfalls creating a foreboding atmosphere and the smoke that protrudes from it's many pores helping to make the horror elements more potent within the story. Sherlock Holmes is of course one of the best and most important characters ever written and Basil Rathbone portrays him excellently in this film. It's a great honour for an actor to be given the role of this magnitude and Rathbone makes Doyle proud. The story is constantly intriguing thanks to the interesting characters and also due to the fact that the story is very well paced. This makes the film a pleasure to view as the audience is constantly kept on the edge of their seats for the duration and that's the sort of reaction that you want when watching a mystery thriller.".

This film is often shown during the holidays on TCM and last Christmas along with the new Sherlock Holmes release with Robert Downey Jr. was a festival on TCM classics. Introduced by Ben Mankiewicz.Excellent film complete with dark foggy moors moor ponies getting trapped on the heath a savage beastdog and John Carradine as a very sinister houseman.Holmes shows up at the Devonshire estate after Watson has already been received as a guest. There is a wonderful scene where he pretends to be a denizen of the moor and an old odd transient man wandering the heath.

This film is often shown during the holidays on TCM and last Christmas along with the new Sherlock Holmes release with Robert Downey Jr. was a festival on TCM classics. Introduced by Ben Mankiewicz.Excellent film complete with dark foggy moors moor ponies getting trapped on the heath a savage beastdog and John Carradine as a very sinister houseman.Holmes shows up at the Devonshire estate after Watson has already been received as a guest. There is a wonderful scene where he pretends to be a denizen of the moor and an old odd transient man wandering the heath.

	schema:reviewBody "For Holmesians I've given this an eight. For everyone else it's a seven. It's the best known of ConanDoyle's Sherlock Holmes stories or at least it's the one that's shown up most often on the screen. It's reasonably faithful to the novella it has good production values and it represents the first appearance of Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson.Ernest Pascal adapted the story to the screen and did a reasonably good job. He swept a couple of incidents and characters under the rug true and he turned some obviously harmless people of the story such as Dr. Mortimer into sometimes sinister characters to act as red herrings. Presumably the rearrangement was done to get rid of secondary characters such as Miss Linney or whatever her name was in order to save time. At 80 minutes it's a rather short main feature. But then why stick in a scene with a sance that goes nowhere and adds nothing? The writer must have hoped it would quicken the tempo of the film. That was Pascal's wager but I'm not sure it was a such a brilliant move. Changed too is the relationship between Stapleton Morton Lowery and Beryl Wendy Barrie. In the film she's Stapleton's unwitting stepsister. In the novel she's Stapelton's reluctant but knowing accomplice. She's the one who writes Sir Henry a warning note when he arrives in London to claim his estate. Making her an innocent leaves unanswered the question of who then wrote the warning note. Not that this would make any viewer wince. The pacing is sufficiently hurried that by the climax the warning note has been long forgotten. And Pascal has included a final exit line that is the only reference to cocaine that I can remember in a Sherlock Holmes movie. Watson  the needle! I wonder how it got past the board of review. Maybe the censors hadn't read the stories. Maybe the producers passed the line off as an allusion to Holmes' being a diabetic or being secretly into knitting.Nothing was shot on location. It's all studio back lot and sound stage. This was standard practice at the time. The Magnificently Collosally Stupendiferous Gone With the Wind released the same year was also studio bound. I'm glad they discovered location shooting in time for Lawrence of Arabia. But in this case the moors of Devonshire great Gothic swamps punctuated by skeletal black trees and lumpy papiermach rocks all shrouded in studio smoke suggest almost a stylized reality rather than a cheap set. They're quite well done. The only distracting feature is that the outdoor scenes SOUND as if they were shot indoors because of the acoustic liveliness of the sets. You hear an echo on a desolate plain. There actually is a moor near Dartmoor with clumsily arranged piles of rocks surrounded by a mire. There still are moor ponies rehistoric remains and abandoned tin mines. The set decorators did a good job. Basil Rathbone injects some animation into the character of Holmes his being new to the role and all that. In a few years the franchise would be moved to Universal Studios updated mixed up and Holmes would turn almost wooden while Nigel Bruce would sometimes become a buffoon which he is not here. There's no denying that Rathbone was a very good Sherlock Holmes probably the best. Jeremy Brett in the TV series was more nuanced but not as masterful nor as tall and he didn't LOOK like the Sidney Paget illustrations that went with the original stories in Strand Magazine. On the other hand Arthur Wontner may have LOOKED more like Paget's drawings but he couldn't act.This is likely to be as good a Sherlock Holmes story as we're liable to get. It's a little clumsy but it's exciting suspenseful and well acted. Besides all that how can you not see it? Holmes is an icon of vernacular culture and this shows him at his best. Oh  the puckish title for this comment Heir of the Dog? I stole it from the episode list on the DVD. One less item for the confessional.".

Nigel Bruce was a good Dr. Watson I never could figure why they made Watson a comic character.Wendy Barrie is the love interest.this was then  still is a staple character. I do not think she figures into the original Conan Doyle story. The made a few changes to the original.Sydney Lanfield a studio director did his usual good work. The screenplay was written by Ernest Pascal. Look for Lionel Atwill  John Carradine in supporting roles.

The cinematography is superb and the moor scenery makes up the suitably macabre atmosphere. Throw in some great acting haunting music score and a truly terrifying hound you have a near perfect adaptation. What let it down for me though was the last five or so minutes of course I loved the clever reference to Holmes's drug addiction though people may think Holmes had taken up sewing but the revelation of the culprit was too rushed for me.However apart from that this is extremely good stuff. The script had a strong sense of intelligence and the climatic scenes with the hound itself were suspenseful and chilling to say the least. The acting is of high calibre while I personally think Jeremy Brett is the definitive Holmes Basil Rathbone is absolutely superb here. He looks as though he is having a great time making Holmes witty dynamic and sophisticated and that was a sheer delight to see. Nigel Bruce while not as good as Rathbone makes a fine Dr Watson. Out of the stellar supporting cast John Carradine and Morton Lowry stood out as Barryman and Stapleton while Lionel Attwill's Dr Mortimer is also effective. Also as Sir Henry Baskerville Richard Greene has the screen presence and charm to make himself memorable.

It was entertaining and welldone but nothing spectacular. I am certain not knocking this film. I love these old Basil RathboneNigel Bruce SH movies. An average Holmes film with these two guys still gets an 8star rating!This was the first pairing of the abovementioned two actors and Bruce as Dr. Watson was not the bumbling buffoon as he was in subsequent episodes. However I prefer Watson in that role because he added a lot of humor and entertainment. In this movie Watson is pictured as fairly intelligent for a change!I enjoyed the lighting in this story. It made for some superb cinematography. The stark blackandwhite shots inside the Baskerville mansion were great as were the many facial closeups in this movie. The gray of the moors outside were in stark contrast to the indoor shots.Although the sance fizzled the credence given the occult in the story put a frown on a my face. It's amazing how many ignorant superstitious people there have been in the world who actually believe they can talk to dead people. The rest of the story was a lot more intelligent and credible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Terence Fisher actors Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and Andre Morrell and the Hammer production crew bring Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous story of the legendary hound of the Baskervilles into colour for the first time.  In point of fact this is the first Sherlock Holmes story filmed in glorious colour and it does the story proud with its phospherescent glow on the dog its swirling mists and the natural tweed colours of Holmes and Watson.  Though some argue that Cushing was miscast as Holmes I argue most vehemently THAT he is perfectly cast as the great detective.  His features cry out Doyle's character and his obvious inner quest for perfection resonates strongly through the character as well. Cushing lends his class to the role and in my opinion gives us a fine Holmes perhaps one of the screen's best.  I always enjoy watching a Cushing performance as he was an actor that loved to play with props and as Christopher Lee states in his autobiography a man who could play with the prop and act to perfection often making it look so very elementary. Watch his Holmes.  Very few scenes go by where he isn't playing with something. Lee is good in his role though the part is rather lacklustre.  Andre Morrell is a fine Watson.  He does not do the Nigel Bruce buffoon act but rather he plays a man capable of having graduated from medical school.  The rest of the cast is good with Francis DeWolff standing out as a doctor in love with himself and the sound of his voice and the ever affable Miles Malleson adding comic relief as a befuddled bishop.  The story stays pretty close to the word according to Doyle.  Fisher gives what you would expect tight direction lush cinematography and loads of beautiful shots of the fogridden moors.  The film has a clever prologue about the curse of the Baskervilles as an introduction and it is wonderfully executed.".

Holmes Peter Cushing and WatsonAndre Morell are contracted by Doctor Mortimer Francis De Wolff for the investigation of killing Sr. Baskerville who is now inherited by his niece Sir Henry . Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to help protect Sir Henry Baskerville Christopher Lee who has returned to England to take his place at the family seat following the death of his uncle Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles died of cardiac exhaustion and Dr. Mortimer believes he was frightened to death. There appears to be a curse on the family dating back nearly 200 years to when Sir Hugo Baskerville was supposedly killed on the moor by a huge hound. Holmes dismisses the supernatural elements of the case but there are a sufficient number of odd events to pique his interest. Holmes soon realizes that someone is making sure the legend becomes real . Watson goes to the mansion there are the servantsJohn Le Mesurier and he meets Stapleton and his daughter Marla Landi. Meanwhile an inmate has escaped and on the moor sound the barking of a savage beast.This is an excellent and thrilling film with horror elements in Hammer style based on the splendid novel by Arthur Conan Doyle .It's a genuine ripping yarn with much suspense and moody intrigue . The film gets mystery tension thrills  detective action and packs an exciting deal of outstanding surprises with great lots of fun despite to be a known story . Magnificent Peter Cushing's interpretation although the best Sherlock is forever Basil Rathbone. Cushing plays as Holmes as an intelligent obstinate broody pipesmoking sleuth  his acting is similar to Jeremy Brett for TV or Nicol WilliamsonSevenpercentsolution or Christopher PlummerMurder by decree.

Spooky and murky cinematography by Jack Asher . Eerie and creepy musical score by James Bernard . This atmospheric motion picture is accurately directed by the Hammer House of Horror master  the great Terence Fisher . Other version about this story are the following  the best version that still can be called a classic filmed in 1939 by Sidney Landfield with Basil Rathbone  Nigel Bruce y Richard Greene  English adaptation 1983 by Douglas Hickox with Ian Richardson as Holmes and Donald Churchill as Watson and TV rendition with Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke . directed by Peter Hammond .".

Lee obviously relishing playing a romantic lead and not a monster puts his all into the role.  The support is good especially the comedy bishop portrayed by Miles Malleson. Thankfully the hound is rarely seen but its howling add  greatly to the tension.  Typically Hammer change the original story and anyone familiar with it will be surprised to see Dr Mortimer being portrayed as the prime suspect. The style and direction of the film is very similar to other Hammer films made at around the same time the film moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to think about logic and dialog.

	schema:reviewBody "Devonshire GP Dr Mortimer FRANCIS DE WOLFE consults Sherlock Holmes PETER CUSHING after his long term friend and patient Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead near his home on Dartmoor. Sir Charles suffered from a chronic heart condition for many years and when the body was discovered there was a terrible look of fear on his face which suggested that he was frightened to death. The circumstances lead Mortimer to believe that it was a ghostly hound which according to legend is cursed to bring misery and misfortune upon the Baskerville family that brought about Sir Charles's death. The curse was started after Sir Hugo Baskerville DAVID OXLEY an evil ancestor of the family murdered a farm girl on the moor and was then brutally attacked and killed by a huge hound. On the death of Sir Charles the family fortune and Baskerville Hall go to the only living relative the deceased's nephew Henry Baskerville CHRISTOPHER LEE who is arriving from South Africa the following day to claim his inheritance. Dr Mortimer is gravely concerned that the heir to the fortune may meet the same fate. This leaves Holmes and Dr Watson ANDRE MORELL with a taxing question. Is there really a curse upon the Baskervilles or has someone come up with a scheme in order to get the Baskerville fortune for themselves? Hammer films made the first Frankenstein and Dracula films in colour and this admirable version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective story was the first Sherlock Holmes movie filmed in colour. The film was intended to be the first in a series of HammerSherlock Holmes pictures but the lukewarm reception it got from cinema audiences at the time sadly meant that these plans were shelved. However in the sixties Cushing reprised his role in a popular BBC television series in which he remade THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES although that version is nowhere near as good as this one and he also turned up as the Baker Street sleuth again in THE MASKS OF DEATH 1986 a TV movie made by Tyburn. Meanwhile Christopher Lee would later don the famous deerstalker in the 1962 production SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE DEADLY NECKLACE. But despite a good cast and director Terence Fisher at the helm the picture proved to be a completely wasted opportunity due to poor production values and the fact that Lee's voice was dubbed by another actor didn't help matters either.THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is now rightly regarded as one of Hammer's greatest movies. Peter Cushing is exemplary as Holmes portraying the character as incredibly intelligent resourceful and at the same time very arrogant when he needs to be. Although when he is arrogant he usually has good reason to be. His performance not only makes him the definitive screen Holmes but it is another addition to his impressive portfolio of fine performances up there with Dr Van Helsing in Dracula 1958 and his many incarnations as Baron Frankenstein. Andre Morell is also on top form as Dr Watson who wisely chooses not to play the part as a bumbling muddle head which so many actors have made the mistake of doing in the past. Christopher Lee is also excellent as Sir Henry Baskerville and he makes the best of what appears to be an undemanding role. Terence Fisher's direction is outstanding as he invests the proceedings with a genuine sense of evil and menace that has never been equaled in any other Sherlock Holmes film before or since. Fisher is most ably assisted by cameraman Jack Asher and composer James Bernard who turns in a wonderfully haunting and occasionally romantic score. Today this picture is considered by some to be the best ever Sherlock Holmes film and it is certainly a strong contender for that title.".

	onyx:emotionText "Devonshire GP Dr Mortimer FRANCIS DE WOLFE consults Sherlock Holmes PETER CUSHING after his long term friend and patient Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead near his home on Dartmoor. Sir Charles suffered from a chronic heart condition for many years and when the body was discovered there was a terrible look of fear on his face which suggested that he was frightened to death. The circumstances lead Mortimer to believe that it was a ghostly hound which according to legend is cursed to bring misery and misfortune upon the Baskerville family that brought about Sir Charles's death. The curse was started after Sir Hugo Baskerville DAVID OXLEY an evil ancestor of the family murdered a farm girl on the moor and was then brutally attacked and killed by a huge hound. On the death of Sir Charles the family fortune and Baskerville Hall go to the only living relative the deceased's nephew Henry Baskerville CHRISTOPHER LEE who is arriving from South Africa the following day to claim his inheritance. Dr Mortimer is gravely concerned that the heir to the fortune may meet the same fate. This leaves Holmes and Dr Watson ANDRE MORELL with a taxing question. Is there really a curse upon the Baskervilles or has someone come up with a scheme in order to get the Baskerville fortune for themselves?

The rest of the cast are pretty good too don't get me wrong but Cushing puts them to shame. Though he is rather ominous in some scenes it's nice to see Christopher Lee opposite Cushing as a good guy for a change. I really liked the classic plot full of surprises great characters humor and lots of chances for Cushing to shine. The atmosphere is great foggy and dark like many Hammer films. Perfect for horror. All in all this is a really fun film though it does have a few pretty cheesy moments. Good film overall though.7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "Shortly after their brilliant adaptations of the classic tales of Frankenstein and Dracula the glorious British Hammer Studios decided to have their take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal detective Sherlock Holmes with The Hound of the Baskervilles 1959. This turned out to be a splendid idea as the Hammer formula works magnificently with Doyle's work. Hammer once again teams up Horror's greatest duo Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes and Christopher Lee as Sir Henry Baskerville in what is another one of many memorable collaborations of the two British Horror deities. In addition the film features Andr Morell who would also star in several other Hammer productions including The Plague of the Zombies of 1966 as Doctor Watson. Hammer's trademark eerie Gothic atmosphere with foggy grounds dark forests etc. fits the Baskervilles story like a glove. It has been a while since I've last seen the classic adaptations with Basil Rathbone and I do not wish to discuss which version of this particular tale is 'better' but I can say that this Hammer version is a truly great gem for every admirer of classic Mystery and Gothic cinema.The film begins truly creepy with a prologue set in the early 18th century when Sir Hugo Baskreville a cruel nobleman who likes to play sadistic games with peasants gets what he had coming when he makes the encounter of a mysterious beast. From then on the wild doglike creature is known and feared as the 'Hound of The Baskervilles' according to a curse this hound is supposed to return and kill any Bakerville who dares to enter the moorlands where Sir Hugo found his end... In the 1880s the great detective Sherlock Holmes is told about the sudden and mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville a descendant of Sir Hugo. Holmes and Doctor Watson travel to the Baskerville estate in order to investigate and to meet the new owner Sir Henry Baskerville who does not believe in what he considers to be 'old wive's tales'... at first...The film does change the plot of Doyle's classic novel in some details mainly by adding Horror elements that underline the Hammertypical creepiness and Gothic atmosphere. Cushing simply is the perfect choice to play Sherlock Holmes. This brilliant actor was fantastic in any role he played of course but that of the most famous detective in fiction is one of those that he is particularly predestined for. Andr Morell is great as Dr. Watson and Christopher Lee is as always magnificent in his role. Cushing and Lee truly were the ultimate duo in Horror cinema and this is yet another fantastic collaboration of these two great men. It is easy to see why Christopher Lee and the late Peter Cushing were best friends in reallife when watching their ingenious work in any of the films and they did together. Directed by Hammer's Nr. 1 director Terence Fisher The Hound of the Baskervilles is another great example for Hammer's glorious style of eerie yet beautiful settings haunting atmosphere and suspenseful storytelling. The settings and photography are wonderful as in most classic Hammer tales and the entire film is greatly crafted. Many years ago this was one of the first Hammer films that I saw as a kid and after many reviewings I still immensely enjoy watching it as an adult. This great little gem only ranks slightly below the brilliant Dracula and Frankenstein adaptations and definitely is a mustsee for all Hammer fans. Highly recommended!".

For whatever reason the film didn't do what Hammer was expecting and they decided to scrap any further Holmes movies. Too bad because I really enjoy this version of the famous story and would have enjoyed seeing Hammer take their turn with some of the others. And I would have enjoyed the opportunity to see Peter Cushing again play the famous detective while still in his prime. I can only imagine what might have been.As for the movie itself Hammer's The Hound of the Baskervilles plays as loose and free with the original story elements as any other I've seen. It doesn't necessarily hurt my enjoyment but those seeking something that follows the book to the letter would be better off looking elsewhere. Because this is Hammer the horror aspects of the story are quite naturally highlighted  and to good effect. Cushing makes a wonderful Holmes. Not only does Cushing act the part in my mind anyway he looks the part as well. I often go back and forth about which Holmes' portrayal I enjoy more  Cushing or Rathbone. Andre Morrell makes for as good a Dr. Watson as you're likely to find. The rest of the cast including Christopher Lee and Francis De Wolff is as solid as any that Hammer ever assembled. I get a real kick out of Miles Malleson's delightfully forgetful Bishop. Finally and unlike a lot of the more stagebound Hammer productions The Hound of the Baskervilles benefits from some excellent location shots. All together this is one very enjoyable film. If it weren't for Rathbone's The Hound of the Baskervilles this would be my favorite version of the story  even with or should that be because of the numerous deviations from the source material. The Hound of the Baskervilles is also in my top 5 favorite Hammer films as well. A 910 seems about right to me.".

He's much closer to the way Doyle wrote the character. Unfortunately people couldn't get used to a Holmes not played by Basil Rathbone any more than they could accept a Frankenstein not played by Boris Karloff.Hammer could teach today's directors a thing or two about how to make a movie for not much money. I doubt this film was all that expensive to make but the monster a dog with a mask was far more effective than some fake CGI monster who would probably play the beast in a modern version.Yes it is interesting to watch a film with Cushing and Lee where neither of them is playing a monster or a mad scientist ... which is how most team ups with them went.No spoilers if you are a HOlmes fan you know how this goes... The movie is largely faithful to the book even to the point of having Holmes absent for about half of it.".

Unfortunately people couldn't get used to a Holmes not played by Basil Rathbone any more than they could accept a Frankenstein not played by Boris Karloff.Hammer could teach today's directors a thing or two about how to make a movie for not much money. I doubt this film was all that expensive to make but the monster a dog with a mask was far more effective than some fake CGI monster who would probably play the beast in a modern version.Yes it is interesting to watch a film with Cushing and Lee where neither of them is playing a monster or a mad scientist ... which is how most team ups with them went.No spoilers if you are a HOlmes fan you know how this goes... The movie is largely faithful to the book even to the point of having Holmes absent for about half of it.";

Suffice to say I was not disappointed as both were very good in their respective roles as was the fellow who played Watson. This one has Sherlock investigating a curse that kills the head of a family named the Baskervilles. The next target is Lee's character after he inherits his uncle's house after his untimely death. The movie moves at a very brisk pace and is a bit predictable but still executed very well though they never explained the doctors part in the movie. There is also a scene at the end I found rather amusing as Sherlock and a couple of others are standing on a hill and this person is sinking in quicksand. They don't really make much of a movie to save the person even though they clearly could. All in all though this one is a well acted move that was interesting to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen the Basil Rathbone version and personally this remake from British Hammer Horror Studios deserves its 10 points and five stars from critics because it is much more exciting especially in colour from director Terence Fisher Dracula Prince of Darkness. Basically the Baskerville Manor has had many members of the family being victim to a legendary creature known as the Hound of Baskerville and the opening scene with Sir Hugo Baskerville David Oxley is an example of this monster. Famous detective Sherlock Holmes Star Wars' Peter Cushing and his assistant Dr. John Watson Andr Morell are brought in to investigate and keep an eye on who seems to be the last family member Sir Henry Baskerville Christopher Lee. As characters ignore the rule of stay away from the moors after dark more clues emerge in the investigation and Holmes thinks he is getting closer to finding who or what is responsible for these attacks and deaths. In the end there really was a hound dogtype creature I expected a werewolf and Cecile Stapleton Marla Landi feary daughter of Stapleton Ewen Solon is part of this terror that hunts the family on the moors she is also victim to die when the hound is killed and the case is solved. Also starring Francis De Wolff as Dr. Richard Mortimer Miles Malleson as Bishop Frankland and Dad's Army's John Le Mesurier as Barrymore. Cushing and Morell make a great double act as Holmes and Watson Lee is good as Sir Henry and the film has great moments of case solving and questioning with the many clues that pop up. The line I was hoping to hear Elementary my dear Watson was in it and it is number 65 on 100 Years 100 Quotes. Outstanding!".

So I bought the DVD of the Hammer version with Peter Cushing Andre Morrel and Christopher Lee without having seen it before. I enjoyed the film so did my kids and we would  recommend this version. Cushing surprised me as Holmes  he enjoys  himself from start to finish. He is clever in a selfsatisfied and almost playful way not as intense as Rathbone. He's simply terrific to watch. Too bad Hammer didn't continue with Holmes because this could have become his signature role. Morrel also is a better Watson than Nigel Bruce for all the reasons stated by others. Christopher Lee seems a bit out of place here but nonetheless he's so young in this film  he looks like Nicholas Cage!  that it is nice to see him a different role. The movie itself is uneven and the departures from the Doyle story struck me as odd. But if you one of those who believes Rathbone is the preeminent Holmes I would encourage you to see this film.

The cast is good although the fact that Cushing and Morell both look a little like Rathbone and Bruce which was a little bit offputting at the start.  However Cushing delivers a solid Holmes he is sharp mentally and the only downside of his performance is that he doesn't prevent Holmes from stepping over the line between intellectual and overly superior.  Morell plays Bruce very lowkey.  In a way this is for the best but I do actually enjoy the more comedic sidekick played by Bruce and I missed that.  Christopher Lee is a good presence and watching it now he adds more mystery to the film with his inclusion.

That nightmare for Sir. Henry Baskerville was about to come tragically and prophetically true. It takes a while for Holmes to find out just whom that person is.

	schema:headline " When you are poor no one wants to know you. Hammer studio's attempt at the classic Holmes mystery.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hound of the Baskervilles starts in the mid 18th Century as Sir Hugo Baskerville David Oxley is enraged after a peasant girl escapes his lecherous clutches Hugo chases after her  murders her but ends up with his throat torn out by a Hound from Hell that has been said to terrorise the Baskerville family ever since... The most recent Baskerville Sir Charles has also been found dead with a look of terror on his face although it has been officially put down as a heart condition however Sir Charles best friend Dr. Richard Mortimer Francis De Wolff thinks other forces may be at work  asks the worlds foremost detective Sherlock Holmes Peter Cushing  his trusty assistant Dr. John Watson Andre Morell for help in discovering the true nature of Sir Charles death. The last of the Baskervilles Sir Henry Christopher Lee is set to inherit the entire Baskerville estate  fortune after an attempt is made on his life Holmes is convinced that he is facing great evil  that Sir Henry is in grave danger. Sir Henry Watson  Dr. Mortimer travel down to Devonshire where the town of Grimpen  Baskerville Hall are located as Sir Henry introduces himself to the locals  Watson starts to investigate it seem almost everyone has a strong motive for murder...This British made Holmes mystery was directed by Terence Fisher  produced by Hammer who are perhaps both better know for their Dracula  Frankenstein series of films  a fine adaptation it is too with plenty of Hammer horror overtones  aspects. Maybe this version is not for the purists though the script by Peter Bryan based on the novel by Arthur Conan Doyle changes quite a few things in an attempt to add a bit of tension a few dramatics  quicken the pace up considerably. The film opens with flashback to the Sir Hugo incident unlike every other version I've seen which opens with Sir Charles Death  subsequently Dr. Mortimer tells Holmes about the legend later. While Watson  Sir Henry travel to Baskerville Hall on their own Holmes absence is probably only a few minutes as he turns up almost immediately again unlike other versions where he virtually disappears for the majority of the film I think the idea behind this was to have Holmes on screen as Hammer thought audiences wanted to see him rather than Watson. Sir Henry is no longer American the relationship between him  Cecile Stapelton Marla Landi develops in a different way  is barely touched upon there is a scene in a mine shaft in which someone tries to kill Holmes  the ending is slightly different to any version I've seen. None of this makes it a bad film far from it in fact as I rather enjoyed seeing Hammer taking the basic story  trying to make a commercial film out of it that the paying punters would flock to. This version still retains the strong story elements that make this such a timeless  entertaining tale but tries to spruce things up a bit. Director Fisher presents the typical image of Holmes complete with deerstalker cap cape  pipe I'm not sure what happened to the Hound in this version as it only gets about 2 minutes worth of screen time right at the end.

The acting is good with Hammer regulars Cushing  Lee always fun to watch with the rest of the experienced cast doing a good job. Not the best version of The Hound of the Baskervilles but by no means the worst  if your familiar with the story then this may throw a few surprises  those without the patience to sit through a 2 plus hour adaptation then this is the one to go for as it runs for less than 90 minutes  considerably condenses things yet still manages to retain the ingredients that make the story such a success.

	onyx:emotionText "The Hound of the Baskervilles starts in the mid 18th Century as Sir Hugo Baskerville David Oxley is enraged after a peasant girl escapes his lecherous clutches Hugo chases after her  murders her but ends up with his throat torn out by a Hound from Hell that has been said to terrorise the Baskerville family ever since... The most recent Baskerville Sir Charles has also been found dead with a look of terror on his face although it has been officially put down as a heart condition however Sir Charles best friend Dr. Richard Mortimer Francis De Wolff thinks other forces may be at work  asks the worlds foremost detective Sherlock Holmes Peter Cushing  his trusty assistant Dr. John Watson Andre Morell for help in discovering the true nature of Sir Charles death. The last of the Baskervilles Sir Henry Christopher Lee is set to inherit the entire Baskerville estate  fortune after an attempt is made on his life Holmes is convinced that he is facing great evil  that Sir Henry is in grave danger. Sir Henry Watson  Dr. Mortimer travel down to Devonshire where the town of Grimpen  Baskerville Hall are located as Sir Henry introduces himself to the locals  Watson starts to investigate it seem almost everyone has a strong motive for murder...This British made Holmes mystery was directed by Terence Fisher  produced by Hammer who are perhaps both better know for their Dracula  Frankenstein series of films  a fine adaptation it is too with plenty of Hammer horror overtones  aspects. Maybe this version is not for the purists though the script by Peter Bryan based on the novel by Arthur Conan Doyle changes quite a few things in an attempt to add a bit of tension a few dramatics  quicken the pace up considerably. The film opens with flashback to the Sir Hugo incident unlike every other version I've seen which opens with Sir Charles Death  subsequently Dr. Mortimer tells Holmes about the legend later. While Watson  Sir Henry travel to Baskerville Hall on their own Holmes absence is probably only a few minutes as he turns up almost immediately again unlike other versions where he virtually disappears for the majority of the film I think the idea behind this was to have Holmes on screen as Hammer thought audiences wanted to see him rather than Watson. Sir Henry is no longer American the relationship between him  Cecile Stapelton Marla Landi develops in a different way  is barely touched upon there is a scene in a mine shaft in which someone tries to kill Holmes  the ending is slightly different to any version I've seen. None of this makes it a bad film far from it in fact as I rather enjoyed seeing Hammer taking the basic story  trying to make a commercial film out of it that the paying punters would flock to. This version still retains the strong story elements that make this such a timeless  entertaining tale but tries to spruce things up a bit. Director Fisher presents the typical image of Holmes complete with deerstalker cap cape  pipe I'm not sure what happened to the Hound in this version as it only gets about 2 minutes worth of screen time right at the end. Technically The Hound of the Baskervilles is solid this was the first Sherlock Holmes film to be filmed in colour  it looks a little garish at times the sets are great  the Hammer horror influence shines through with fog enshrouded ruins dark Gothic type castle interiors  creaky old mines  as a whole it's well made throughout.

Cushing's Holmes is very good he brings across Holmes' pettiness out of his attention to detail and the shrewdness that helps him catch criminals in the first place also represents a darker and certainly more annoying side of his own personality.  This is similar to the way Cushing had played Van Helsing and Dr. Frankenstein in previous Hammer Films so it's not surprising they tried it here but it is a little surprising how well this goes along with the Sherlock Holmes character.  Cushing brings enough warmth to the character effectively through his action with a solid Watson Morrell to make an audience still like the old blighter.  Good visual look photography B.

	schema:reviewBody "After their success with The Horror of Dracula Terence Fisher Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee would come together again to great success with this fine entry into the Hammer series. I have to confess to never having read the original novel or ever seeing another Hound of the Baskervilles film so this tale of mystery is completely new to me. Peter Cushing stars as the eccentric Sherlock Holmes one of the most famous detectives ever written. He is called in when the lord of the Baskerville family is found dead on the moors in a way that appears to be reminiscent of the way the former lord of the family was found dead. This ties in with a mythical curse on the family which tells of a vengeful ghost known as the hound of hell. The film starts as it means to go on with an atmospheric and mysterious telling of how the curse on the family came about and from the beginning until the end this is a macabre but not violent tension filled tale of terror that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.Peter Cushing has had the pleasure of playing many of literature's finest characters  Baron Frankenstein and Van Helsing among others and he brings just the right amount of eccentricity panache and arrogance to this one Sherlock Holmes. In fact this is arguably his best performance ever as this role fits him like a glove. He is given excellent support by Andr Morell Plague of the Zombies who brings class to the role of Dr Watson Sherlock Holmes' friend and fellow investigator. The fantastic Christopher Lee tops off the cast excellently and as usual approaches his role with the great charm and charisma that horror fans have come to expect from him. Lee wasn't as big a star when this film was released as he went on to be but I wouldn't be surprised to find that this was one of the roles along with Count Dracula obviously that won him the acclaim that allowed him to go on to become the first billed star for many of Hammer's later films. Terence Fisher deserves much of the praise for the fact that this film turned out well his rural sets and macabre atmosphere help turn this tale into a fascinating ride and he executes all the sequences wonderfully so that the finished product is an exciting and invigorating piece of film. Well done I say.".

What follows after an impressive opening is a distinct letdown.By no means one of the better Hammer films.  Give me the BW 1939 version with Rathbone Bruce and the handsome Richard Greene as Sir Henry any day.

Whatever minor flaws this film has I felt the beginning wasn't quite as atmospheric as the rest of the adaptation this is still a wonderful film with a great atmosphere and cast.It looks good the sets are detailed the cinematography is innovative and the costumes are great painting a sort of romantic atmosphere in a dark way while the hound is quite scary. The score is also suitably eerie the story doesn't meander the direction from Terence Fisher is excellent and the script is well written. And the acting is wonderful.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I don't know a great deal about Krimi creator Edgar Wallace but I would guess that he's a fan of Sherlock Holmes as this film takes obvious influence from the classic story 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'. It's not a direct ripoff however despite several similarities and it has to be said that once again the German writer has created an inventive and off the wall story that is sure to delight mystery fans. The film begins with an amusing pop song played over the credits. As the title suggests the bulk of this film takes place in an around the grounds of an old castle named Blackwood Castle. There's a problem in the area as several people have turned up dead  but the police can't work if they've been killed by a dog or died from snake venom. The owner of Blackwood Castle has passed away and so his daughter has come to claim the castle but she is hassled by a stream of visitors who seem extremely interested in the castle. Also added into the mix are an insurance investigator and a couple of Scotland Yard detectives.The film is set in England and despite the fact that everyone speaks German the film does actually have a British feel to it. The thing I like most about the Krimi genre is undoubtedly the style of it and once again director Alfred Vohrer has created a beautiful world for the film to take place in full of rich colours and grandiose locations. The film was obviously shot on a budget but that's not a big problem. The mystery itself can get a bit messy but there's always plenty going on and the film easily fills its ninety minute running time. In fact it's quite unbelievable the range of characters that have somehow been fitted into this film! It does have to be said that the story is not as wacky as some other films in the genre but there's still plenty of odd goings on the whole deal with the murders and the dog is a particularly imaginative highlight! The film is clearly not meant to be taken 100 seriously and indeed the script does allow for some humour which actually works well with the plot. It all boils down to an entertaining conclusion that somewhat makes sense and although this film is not for everyone it is very entertaining and I'm sure Krimi fans will enjoy it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Hund von Blackwood Castle or The Monster of Blackwood Castle is a German color movie from almost 50 years ago. It is another addition to the long series of German films that were based on Edgar Wallace novels that were made in the 1960s and 1970s. The director is Alfred Vohrer like so many other times and the film runs for roughly 88 minutes and is thus slightly longer than they are in average. German movie fanatics may be familiar with actors Heinz Drache Karin Baal and especially Horst Derrick Tappert who seems to be on the other side of the law in here? Or is he really? The film is once again from start to finish packed with plot twists about who the bad guy is and who is good. And this time not even the one listed first in the cast which is usually the cop investigating the crimes is left untouched which shows how these films really do not take themselves seriously at all. The title includes the antagonist once again even if the dog is obviously not killing everybody on his own because he wants to. There is a man behind these killings which should surprise nobody. The dog murder scenes seem fairly ridiculous occasionally especially the very first one but the snake poison at least makes it slightly credible I guess. But I would have expected the dog to really brutally mutilate the victims but oh well.. this would have been too much for the films I guess. All in all this was a fairly absurd film and I did not find the dramatichorror contents too credible or too interesting so i was glad the film did end before the 90minute mark. I give it a thumbsdown.".

It was a highly enjoyable adventure film that could have been placed in lots of different historical times.Besides being a great adventure film it masterfully dealt with a most wide range of emotions.  There were many undertones and harmonics dealing with fear desperation horror escape passion love honor and divine or natural justice.What was so fascinating to me was how the movie showed the power of freedom courage and focus.  The protagonist was raised by his mother a most curiously powerful presence in this movie even though we never see or hear herto be independent and freedom loving and this movie shows how strong and almost invincible this makes him because he believes it and lives it with all his heart.  All around him the world is literally falling apart and going mad from fear and disease and yet by neither railing against it nor taking on these thoughts he triumphs with his will to live and being true to his own vision at all times.And as an added bonus the visual artistry of this movie from the titles all the way to the end is beautiful to behold.  The scenery costumes sets actors camera angles and etc. are all brilliantly satisfying.  The movie was a joy to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Provence provides a stunning locale for this romantic adventure.  The camera work is exquisite and every opportunity is taken to capture the natural beauty of this region.  The story is simple enough.  Angelo an Italian colonel handsome Olivier Martinez escapes from Austrianoppressed Italy to raise funds in the continuing battle against Austria. He finds more than an unsympathetic acceptance in France.  Most of the towns through which he rides are beset with cholera.  The camera scenes of the dead and dying victims horsedrawn carts packed high with bodies and funeral pyres are terrifying enough but it is the fluttering of black wings as crows seek out the eyes of the dying victims that frighten most. Some of the closeups are pretty grim.  In lighter vein I liked the scene where a cat befriends our horseman and he talks to it on the roof about how wars are won with money as much as guns.  The cat is a great little actor. The horseman an accomplished swordsman carves his way through many a desperate situation What hero doesn't? He acquires a bottle of medicine from a dying stranger who has taught him a massage technique to avert death from cholera. On his way back to Italy with a bag of gold coins he gives protection to Pauline a doctor's wife Juliette Binochewho is seeking out her missing husband in the cholerainfected area. The young 25year old colonel who sends almost daily letters to his mother in Italy they are really a diary of events behaves as the perfect gentleman at all times but his protegee is obviously drawn to him.  Here is a love story where the lovers admire from a distance never submitting to the chemistry which is drawing them together.  When the woman collapses with cholera all existing barriers are forgotten as he works on her frantically with his acquired knowledge to save her life. One of the great joys of this film is to watch the handsome faces of Martinez and Binoche. Their beauty contrasts sharply with the agonised plight of the villagers and the devilish black crows which hover continuously about the dead fluttering out through open doors and windows. The ending may not satisfy some but it leaves us with the thought that somewhere sometime all will be well again.".

From start to finish this is an excellent historical chick flick and is likely to excite the passions of many female viewers but I am a guy at least the last time I checked and I STILL enjoyed it. The acting was excellent and the cinematography outstanding. About the only minor problem with the film was the occasional stupid behaviors by the female lead Binoche. A couple times she just seemed too stupid to livebut of course the handsome hero came to her rescue.An excellent film but a little disturbing due to its graphic depiction of plague victims.

Juliette Binoche in her preThe English Patient role was as gorgeous and subtle as ever. The thing about this movie though that it's billed as a romance but you don't see it anywhere but just hints of it and feel the sexual tensions between the 2 main characters. Rather disappointing for some but it's that exact same formula which makes it such a beautiful movie to watch. To top it off it was filmed in the French countryside which is so breathtaking that you could just watch the movie for the cinematography alone. All in all it's a superb movie in the tradition of finely crafted French costume dramas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Italian patriot Colonel Angelo Pardi is fleeing his country in 1832. He enters the cholera ridden French Provence. There he meets Pauline who is lovelessly married to rich Marquis de Thus. Together they will look for him. The road movie starts pretty slow and chaotic. More often than once I was confused about what was going on. A lot of swashbuckling dead people crows and crows again some chases. There seemed to be no real plot or focus.

If you are not too daunted by subtitles in French then you will find an original tale superbly acted by both the leading characters and entire supporting cast. It will keep you on the edgeof yourseat. Emotionally it's touching gripping packed with exciting swashbuckling action and crammed full with beautiful photographic scenery or backdrops. Every scene or line spoken is tightly relevant to the story. At no point does this engaging film lose focus or become predictable.The period is set in Central Europe during the 19th Century where Europe is beset by war and worse disease. People are more wary of strangers or mad with fright should they be murdered or fall victim to the rampaging cholera. One crazed or inspired thing happens after another throughout the captivating story. However there's a fine balance between the hectic frenzy and the subtle quieter moments as an unspoken love develops between the honourable dashing young nobleman Colonel and his new companion the confident aristocrat married woman Juliette Binoche in search of her lost husband. The manner by which he chances upon her to begin with is unique and amusing. Juliette Binoche and Olivier Martinez should have deservedly walked away with Oscars as should everyone involved for script cinematography music costumes and direction!

I watched it again recently I think it still holds up surprisingly well compared to many modern scifi movies. The plot is intriguing I keep thinking that there might be some truth to the concepts presented and the fact is that our own brains are still largely unexplored territory. A special mention to the extraordinary music written by John Corigliano and for which he was nominated for an Academy Award.

I watched it again recently I think it still holds up surprisingly well compared to many modern scifi movies. The plot is intriguing I keep thinking that there might be some truth to the concepts presented and the fact is that our own brains are still largely unexplored territory. A special mention to the extraordinary music written by John Corigliano and for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. It dares to be loud and violent and complements the visuals extremely well. This is a wild original movie unlike any other.";

Of course if you've seen Russel's Tommy some of the overthetop sequences will look familiar and tinged with peculiar Britishisms.

In the scene where Blair Brown is trying to cope with the trauma of the events in the isolation tank room there's a very beautifully conceived long single shot through house windows. Russel needs credit especially for the argument between Balaban and Haid  some of the best acting I've ever seen  character actors hardly EVER get to put this kind of stageacting energy on film. It stays with me still. They truly seem absolutely furious with each other their lines overlap it's absolutely convincing. Some of the greatest effects of this movie are simply good movie craft  when Jessup first sees the love of his life walk through the door fantastically backlit and the music comes up and crossfades into the next scene  it's breathtaking.It's the moments like that and the very intro of the movie with the slow title crawl the deadpan lines read by Balaban the first shots of Hurt in the tank the eerie music ...

	schema:reviewBody "Altered States is not everything that it could be and that's because director Ken Russell was more interested in assaulting the viewer with a series of startling by 1980 standards images than he was in exploring the stories subtext.  Eddie Jessup is a scientist so introverted and afraid of human connections that it's not enough to abandon his family he also has to further deprive himself of any and all stimulation performing sensory depravation experiments on himself to attain better understanding of ultimate truth.  Jessup proclaims himself to be an atheist but the visual content of his hallucinations reveals him to be a man who's more at war with God than a man who disbelieves.  His descent into a more primal state of being is an obvious metaphor for how easy it is for a man with commitment issues and fear of intimacy to turn completely inward leaving the real world behind.  Some of what the character says early on about family and love make his motivations clear... Jessup is a man shattered by his father's death and unable to accept the vulnerability of the human condition.  A viewer has to really work to absorb and enjoy these metaphors though as Russell never slows his onslaught of special effects.  The movie also suffers from smart but unrealistic dialogue and hamfisted performances from some of the principle characters watch Blair Brown's overthetop breakdowns in the last act. Altered States isn't the total package it doesn't combine the visceral and the philosophical as well as movies like Jacob's Ladder or Natural Born Killers.  But it's better than most of today's equivalent movies Donnie Darko etc that want to stimulate and provoke the viewer and don't quite pull it off.".

I put it on my Netflix queue without realizing it was directed by Ken Russell. If I had seen that earlier I would have avoided it. Thankfully I didn't. It contains everything that is good about Russell that is his crazy imagery and none of the bad stuff. That is it's not an enormous bore. The script was written by Paddy Chayefsky based on his own novel. Not the writer you would associate with horror or scifi which is the proper genres to which Altered States belongs. He disowned the film before he even saw a cut of it despite the fact that Russell was contractually obligated not to change a word of the script. The greatest asset of the film is the fantastic acting. William Hurt makes his screen debut as a mad scientist a Harvard professor actually who is experimenting with sensory deprivation mixed with some choice hallucinogens. He hopes to lose his modern mind in the sensory deprivation tank and regress to a primitive state. Unfortunately some mushrooms that he finds in Mexico help him regress not only mentally but physiologically. Blair Brown plays his estranged and worried wife and Charles Haid and Bob Balaban love the Balaban! play colleagues who help Hurt do his experiments. The plot is silly but it's legitimately eerie and frightening thanks to Russell's surprisingly excellent direction. The film ends up in territory very reminiscent of 2001 A Space Odyssey but I thought it all worked pretty well. Drew Barrymore makes her film debut at age 5 and also keep an eye out for John Larroquette.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was a huge letdown for me especially considering all the hype surrounding it. The first half an hour or so up until the parts after the Mexico scenes seemed to hold tremendous promise and I couldn't wait to see where and how the train of thought would be followed in the rest of the film. Unfortunately from there it becomes less of a train of thought and more a train wreck. The film starts out with a brilliant but decidedly narcissistic scientist seeking to explore the boundaries between conscious and unconscious and finding what lay beyond the boundary. Would it lead him to a deeper understanding of himself and the human race and our oneness with the universe? Well apparently not. Basically it led him into a decidedly overthetop melodramatic JekyllandHyde type scenario involving his 'devolving' into more and more primitive states of being. The film took an extremely interesting premise and instead of following it to a thoughtful conclusion twisted it into a thirdrate horror film. The crowning turd in this punch bowl was Blair Brown's overly dramatic performance. From the moment she meets the protagonist she goes from being an incontrol competent woman to a hapless damsel in distress complete with incoherent overlysentimental babbling fainting and flailing about. The socalled love story which sadly takes center stage after the first half hour is not in the least a meeting of minds but more of a lame fairytale.".

Unfortunately from there it becomes less of a train of thought and more a train wreck. The film starts out with a brilliant but decidedly narcissistic scientist seeking to explore the boundaries between conscious and unconscious and finding what lay beyond the boundary. Would it lead him to a deeper understanding of himself and the human race and our oneness with the universe? Well apparently not. Basically it led him into a decidedly overthetop melodramatic JekyllandHyde type scenario involving his 'devolving' into more and more primitive states of being. The film took an extremely interesting premise and instead of following it to a thoughtful conclusion twisted it into a thirdrate horror film. The crowning turd in this punch bowl was Blair Brown's overly dramatic performance. From the moment she meets the protagonist she goes from being an incontrol competent woman to a hapless damsel in distress complete with incoherent overlysentimental babbling fainting and flailing about. The socalled love story which sadly takes center stage after the first half hour is not in the least a meeting of minds but more of a lame fairytale.";

In my favorite scene The main character Eddietakes hallucanagetic mushrooms and tumbles out into the open desert night and he lies down to see his lover holding her torso up with her hands and her legs straight along the ground. Slowly the wind makes the sand from the desert cover the two up and after they are fully covered the figures disintegrate away from the wind until the sand is flat. This scene makes you feel impermanent and disconnected from your body. It was almost the feeling of a good meditation.

	schema:headline " Trippy thriller from Ken Russell";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a novel by Paddy Chayefsky Altered States is a mind bending thriller based on the highly exaggerated dangerous effects of drug use. The film was allegedly passed on by twenty seven directors before Ken Russell eventually took the chair and while the subject material is undoubtedly meaty it's not really surprising that so many did pass it up as this film doesn't follow a usual progression by any stretch of the imagination and there were certainly many chances for it all to go wrong. Russell accepts the challenge with relish however and despite a few problems this is still an interesting and well made film. The plot focuses on a scientific experiment at Harvard University. Professor Eddie Jessup has begun experimenting on himself by taking a hallucinogenic drug inside an isolation chamber. He begins to believe that the drug is allowing him to see an alternate state of conscious but as the experiments go on it soon becomes clear that they are having an effect on both his body and mind.The thing I'll no doubt remember for the longest about this film is the special effects and while they are undoubtedly dated they're still pretty special. Once the film reaches the final third Russell really goes overboard with the visuals and they are interesting to say the least! It has to be said that the film is rather slow at first and it does take a while to really get going but at least the build up isn't boring and it does give us a chance to get to know the characters. The central character is a little unlikely it has to be said but this can at least be partly explained away by his extended drug use and obsession with his work. The dialogues are generally a bit trite too and the delivery is not always great. However all this is offset by the plot line which remains interesting throughout. I get the impression that the writer intended the story to have some depth and pose some questions but it didn't really or at least not for me. Anyway all in all this film is certainly worth a look and comes recommended.".

The script comes from Paddy Chayefsky who also wrote the book upon which the film is based. Though Chayefsky disowned the film and Russell's direction it remains among the best films in both they're careers. The best thing about the film is easily the script which is intelligent and thoughtprovoking. Russell's direction is quite good as well the editing on this film is truly topnotch. The actors gave great performances especially a very younglooking William Hurt as the lead. In my opinion Blair Brown's performance was at times a little uneven but that never hurt the movie. The makeup effects from Dick Smith were terrific.

As usual Ken Russel has made an interestingtolookat movie that's a real chore to watch. Highly unrecommended. Only for filmschool devotees who use words such as 'subtext'. Roger Ebert are you listening?".

It explores questions that some other films are scared to even mention all while working its way towards the final conclusion in the last scene before the credits.However large sections of this film are dull. A lot of it looks visually flat. When combined with conversations that seem to lack any energy from either the actors or the script itself it makes the film feel like it's dragging. There aren't any memorable lines of dialogue it's only really there to move the plot along in most places. This is a film about hallocinations and the mysterious not about its characters.Overall I enjoyed it for the impressive dream sequences however it was let down by several of the scenes in between. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Eddie Jessup is a Harvard professor researching into the effects of hallucinogens on schizophrenia sufferers. After an experiment on himself involving a rare Mexican drug and an isolation tank his body appears to partially regress into some prehomosapien form. What is happening to him and does he dare to continue with this work ?Everybody should have at least one stonedout movie they like. For most people it's Easy Rider or Head or The Cool And The Crazy but for me it's the much more disturbing and visually dynamic Altered States. I think the reason for this is that the trippy effects in this film are terrific and an integral part of the plot as opposed to just the usual psychedelic rubbish prevalent in some late sixties flicks. Russell's setpiece montages of disturbing horror and sexualreligious iconography are familiar from earlier movies like Tommy and Lisztomania but the opticals and visual effects makeup by Brian Ferren Dick Smith Robert Blalack and Jamie Shourt are astonishingly eyepopping rendered all the more unsettling by an ominous growling score by John Corigliano. I guess Russell's style isn't to everybody's taste but if you're willing to go with it I think he's one of the most visually and thematically exciting directors there has ever been my favourite of his films is the goofy lowbudget vampire flick The Lair Of The White Worm. All the more amazing in this movie is despite the crazy story and the wild imagery the whole thing works well as a drama of obsession and redemption. This is largely because of the fearless cast who hurl themselves into character with terrific abandon. They're crazy people but crucially they are believable crazy people. They yell at each other in complicated anthropological lingo about stellar conceptual notions but in a way that brings the story to life with many touching scenes like the one where Hurt tells the story of his father's death the genesis of his quest for truth amongst the infinite. All four leads are excellent it was Hurt's first film and Puerto Rican dancer Godreau gives a great physical performance as the simian alterego of Hurt's primal urges. Look fast for Drew Barrymore in her movie debut aged five. Based on a book by Paddy Chayefsky Marty Network who wrote the script but is billed here as Sidney Aaron his real forenames after falling out with Russell. This is a tremendous horror  sciencefiction  drama which  whether you like it or not  you won't forget in a hurry. Movies are my drug of choice they don't screw up your body but they can give you a terrific high and open up your mind and this one is a terrific fix.".

	schema:headline " Pretty average 70's Italian sex comedy with Nadia Cassini";
	schema:reviewBody "When it came to lowbrow Italian sex comedy Nadia Cassini was probably the third most famous actress in 1970's Italy after Edwige Fenech and Gloria Guida. But unlike with the other two none of her movies has yet received a legitimate Englishlanguage DVD release. Physically the three actresses were quite differentFenech was bigbreasted and voluptuous Guida was a petulant Lolita while Cassina had a lithesome dancer's body she unfortunately does one horrid disco song and dance number herebut what they all had in common though was an ability to constantly lose their clothing and drive men everywhere mad with lust. In this film Cassini is a singershowgirl who poses as a nurse to recover some stolen paintings which for some reason are hidden in a military insane asylum.Lino Banfi who else? plays the head doctor. He's hot to get in the new nurse's panties because his own wife Nieves Navarro is both frigid and perpetually naked. He tries to give her a Chinese aphrodisiac at one point but his plan goes awry and he ends up being cuckolded bothby Alvaro Vitali and a delivery boy who's even more unattractive than Vitali or Banfi. Vitali wearing an afro frightwig plays a painter who I think is one of the patients but he is somehow able nevertheless to land Carmen Russo a reallife Italian version of Jessica Rabbit as his nude model. I think this movie sets some kind of record for casting really hot women and really ugly guys. Rounding out the cast is future porn star Karin Schubert as the mistress of Cassini's art thief employer.All the women in this movie get naked natch but unfortunately so does Banfi. The director Mariano Laurenti was less talented than more wellknown Italian comedy directors like Sergio Martino or Pasquale Campanile Festa but on the other hand he was definitely better than Michele Tarantini or some of the other hacks who worked in the genre. As these movies go this is pretty average. It might be worth seeing simply for the frequently unclad female cast. And the comedy while not very funny is not as annoying as it could be.".

We first meet an Italian General followed by Nazi Field Marshal and inevitably Napoleon himself. Other inmates include a trumpeter very handy with all those high ranking military men a big game hunter a painter a midget boxer and an old broad who thinks she's Ginger Roger. Lino Banfi plays head of staff Amedeo La Russa and plays along with each of those nutty fruitcakes so he can get close enough to give them their medicine. At the gate stands Jimi Il Fenomeno who is on the verge of losing his marbles himself.In a mostly unrelated part of the plot Full time club owner and part time gangster Johnny is convinced some valuable painting that once belonged to his mother have ended up amongst the loonies. So he sends the singer from his club Nadia Cassini under cover as a night nurse to find them. Naturaly as Nurse Grazia Nadia soon has both the staff and the patients after her perfectly rounded tush but don't despair ladies Lino Banfi bares his big fat behind too!. Confusingly Grazia finds herself working the day shift too and still finds time to perform at the club dancing with four unbelievably camp 'Rugby players'.Meanwhile still when Prof Amedeo is not dreaming about Nadia he is trying to get his three star refrigerator wife Susan Scott to unfreeze with the help of special Chinese medicine. The pills do their stuff but because of his own incompetence and extreme clumsiness I soon lost count of how many times Banfi hits his head or any other body part in this film she ends up with the curly wigged artist Alvaro Vitali or the squeaky voiced delivery boy Lucio Montanaro instead. Come to think of it this movie really breaks new ground in this department normally Vitali and Montanaro never get any!Also making an appearance is Karin Shubert as the Gangster's moll and Carmen Russo has a bit part one of Vitali's models. After a side trip to the beach that mainly serves to show Cassini in the tiniest bikini imaginable the plot involving the paintings is wrapped up by an uneventful car chase thats hardly worth the name and a declaration of love that comes out of nowhere. Oh yes and of instead of any of the patients being cured a new inhabitant is added to the mad house at the end.7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Currently clocking in at a mere 2.75 hours  following the lopping off of 100 minutes from Kurosawa's unreleased original version  this barely scratches the surface of the plot of Dostoevsky's tremendous novel. Kurosawa modernizes the story and moves it from Russia in summer to Hokkaido in winter. The great Russian director Grigori Kozintsev thought this film captured the spirit of the novel remarkably well  and who am I to disagree. I seriously wonder whether someone unfamiliar with the novel could follow this film in its currently disjointed state  but for those who know and love Dostoevsky's story and characters this film is a delight and a revelation. By and large the actors do a remarkable job of capturing the essence of Dostoevsky's cast. I simply cannot imagine a more suitable Rogozhin Akama in the film than Toshiro Mifune  especially when watching him merely standing in the background looking like a bomb ready to explode. Next most convincing was Chieko Higashiyama as Satoko Ayako's mother not Takeko's as IMDB incorrectly records Elizaveta Prokofyevna Yepanchin in the novel. This Edith Bunker as Russian noblewoman character has always been one of my favorite Dostoevsky creations  and CH gets every aspect of the character right. Setsuko Hara as Taeko Natalia Fillipovna and Yoshiko Kuga as Ayako Aglaya Ivanovna are wonderful as is Takashi Shimura as Ono Ayako's father General Yepanchin. Masayuki Mori as Kameda Prince Myshkin the eponymous hero of the tale is hard to assess  as the idiot role is hard to envision. I am not certain that he is the perfect Myshkin but he is certainly a touching one.Interlinked with the extraordinarily fine acting is Kurosawa's tremendous direction here or what's left of it. I recently also saw an otherwise fine Russian version of Crime and Punishment which failed to capture the richness of tone of the novel missing every trace of any sort of humor an essential element of the book. Kurosawa on the other hand managed to ricochet from melodrama to humor to tragedy without missing a beat  sometimes within the bounds of a single shot. Frankly I never would have thought this possible. Another interesting facet of the direction here  this often looked more like a silent film from the 20s or 30s than a film of the 50s.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Kurosawa's leastseen films is The Idiot. The film is set in Hokkaido the northernmost area of Japan. Deep snow covers the earth and is shoveled into barriers seeps in through the ruins of a warehouse in great drifts piles up against the windows in crescents howls fiercely as Toshiro Mifune's character and Matsayuki Mori's Prince Myishkin step foot off a train into a blizzard.Dostoevsky's great novel is the resource material.The Prince Myishkin character is Christlike in the novel and as transplanted to Japan may be seen as a Boddhisatvalike character an Avalokiteshvara or Kanona saint of compassion. Matsayuki Mori does an amazing job of portraying a damaged but compassionate soul..one that feels deeply the pain of those he encounters and who speaks the truth simply with a pure heart and an awareness of suffering. In one scene he holds Toshiro Mifune's face between his small gentle hands and there is such a tender sensibility his hands seem to communicate love and absorb the pain of Mifune's character. It is a breathtaking moment.Toshiro Mifune is brilliantly cast as the thuggish suitor who vies with Mori for the soul of the beautiful and doomed Taeko Nasu character played with uncharacteristic drama by Setsuko Hara.This complex rich layered frightening deeply disturbing film has been underappreciated from the outsetbeginning with the studio which cut the film drastically Kurosawa was outraged! see trivia. Japanese audiences didn't understand or like the film and other audiences have found it weird. Some of this relates directly to Donald Richie's seminal work on Kurosawa and his conclusion that The Idiot was a failure. Unfortunately Richie's conclusion seems to have put replaced the nails in The Idiot's coffin with screws. It's very hard to pry open the film.Sure it is a weird film...that's what is so interesting. Kurosawa has made one of the most powerfully strange films while stretching the range of his actors have you ever imagined you would see Setsuko Hara like this? She's terrifying in her desperation and pain! giving the scenes a grounded reality and allowing us to enter into the lives of these tragic doomed souls.This is one of the finest films of world cinema although one of the leastviewed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before watching this film I read the 700 page novel. Obviously Mr. Kurosawa had to omit characters and even chapters but he has made a coherent wonderful and even a little disturbing film about obsession. Kameda Masayuli Mori is given a reprieve from being shot by the Americans in Okinawa post war a good context to begin this film the book is set in Russia in the 1850's and goes to relatives in Hokkaido. He sees a portrait of Taeko Nasu Ms. Hara and is just struck by it. He meets her and though she was about to give her answer to one man regarding marriage she asks Kameda a veritable stranger whom she feels knows her to make the decision and he says no. She runs off with Akama Mr. Mifune and Kameda follows. Also in the mix is the young very pretty Ayako Yoshiko Kuga who may instead be be throed to Kameda. The choices have to be made but bear in mind Kameda is still beguiled by Taeko. The acting with many actors you've seen before or since in films of the period from Japan are all uniformly good but no one holds a torch to Setsuko Hara's Taeko. Her role is all about expressions and emotions and she is absolutely perfect. You see her anguish her foreboding her sarcasm in every scene. The beautiful Ms. Hara is just amazing in this role as she was in so many others. If you are ambitious read the book first and you'll see what a great job Mr. Kurosawa did in adapting and directing this film. Without reading the book I don't think you'll like it as much but it will definitely hold your interest. Lastly the term The Idiot is more about Kameda having fits somewhat like epilepsy not being weak of mind. One of Kurosawa's best Setsuko Hara is phenomenal and it is an excellent adaptation to the classic novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "Masayuki Mori the slain husband from Roshomon is fantastic as Kameda a pure and simple yet insightful man who remains mentally frail after recovering from a breakdown. The film chronicles his relationships with two very different women both in love with him and with the volatile and violent Akama a perfect part for Toshiro Mifune. Prior to reading the novel I found the plot disjointed and difficult to follow. I think this film is best appreciated as a series of set pieces. The interaction among the players in each scene is completely absorbing as Kameda through his passivity and selflessness elicits a whole range of emotions from the rest of the cast. Minoru Chiaki the woodchopper samurai from Seven Samurai has a small but absolutely riveting role. The 2003 Russian miniseries by Vladimire Bortko at nearly 10 hours captures far more of Dostoyevski's novel than does this film. However somehow Kurosawa has been able to capture the essence of the novel. It's a shame that over an hour was cut from the film and is now lost.Setsuko Hara is tremendous as the Natassya character from the novel and Chieko Higashiyama as the Lizaveta character. Both are regulars from Ozu films but its unusual to find them together in Kurosawa. If you have read the novel you won't have any trouble following the story even though it has been transposed from czarist Russia to PostWW II Japan. If you don't know the story just enjoy the incredible acting and direction of Kurosawa.".

	schema:reviewBody "Books are not like movies but they have more similarities than at first meets the eye. Just as a novelist can focus us entirely on one object or one person a film director can use the closeup for the same effect. Alternatively a director can use a long shot to describe a setting or select angles to give us one characters point of view all of which brings cinema closer to the novel than it does to a stage play which cannot give us such controlled focus. And just as a good novel will make careful use of language to give tone or atmosphere a good film will do the same with lighting sound design cutting and so forth. Probably the biggest difference however is one of overall structure. Whereas books are designed to be picked up and put down digested over a period of time a motion picture is supposed to be enjoyed in a single sitting and as such must tell its story in a smooth and succinct manner. This is where Akira Kurosawa fell down in his ambitious lineforline adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Idiot.Considered one scene at a time the style in which The Idiot is filmed demonstrates how the shots and scenes of cinema can work like the sentences and paragraphs of a novel. Kurosawa uses a plain direct approach close to the action with few props or elaborate backgrounds to distract from the people  just as Dostoevsky's words focus us on people and what they do rather than bothering with elaborate descriptions of places. He makes a lot of use of intensely emotional closeups just as a sentence or two in a book might be devoted entirely to depicting someone's reaction without distracting us with whatever else may be going on in the room. What little business there is going on apart from the actors is generally minimalist and for purposes of mood for example a light sprinkling of snow around Masayuki Mori as he looks at Setsuko Hara's picture or the eerie chimes at the Akama residence.It wasn't often during their period working together that Kurosawa would not cast Toshiro Mifune in the lead role. He would only cast someone else when it was really necessary and this is one such case. It's hard to imagine the brash Mifune as the titular idiot whereas Masayuki Mori is perfectly meek doing everything with an acute look of sensitivity. The only trouble with Mori is that he isn't credible enough and is little more than a caricature of selfeffacing timidity. Female lead Setsuko Hara was a big star in Japan and will be familiar to Yasujiro Ozu fans. However I find her a little hammy here and some of those grimaces she pulls look absurd. Mifune himself plays a supporting role and although he plays quite a wild and exaggerated character he does at least give the part an entertaining intensity. The other supporting roles are not bad either with some calm and mannered turns from Takashi Shimura and Chieko Higashiyama.While individual bits of Hakuchi may come close to the spirit of Dostoevsky's original the problem lies in the bigger picture. Because Kurosawa's original literal adaptation of every portion of the novel ran for over four hours it's clear some truncation was needed. However this is a process that should have begun while the movie was still in preproduction. As it is whole chunks of narrative have been removed sometimes replaced by text other times with inexplicable jump cuts. Rather than cutting down the number of sequences the editing job seems to have pared each sequence down to its highlights. The picture is so stopstart the neat flow of Kurosawa's images is spoiled. We don't really feel we get to know characters and while the plot just about makes sense it seems incredibly fragile and disjointed. It's not that an abridged form of a novel is unacceptable for a motion picture just that it has to be done in a way in which it still has continuity and meaning. Instead this looks like a halffinished project and yet at 166 minutes it is still long enough to be wearingly tedious. Ironically the 265 minute full cut while certainly being a bit of a strain on the old buttocks would probably have moved far faster.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first and only previous viewing of Hakuchi came while our local yet world famous Pacific Film Archive was relatively new. I'd been working my way through George Sadoul's Dictionary of Film naively fantasizing catching everything in it checking off items I did manage to see and lucking into complete or nearly retrospectives of a number of directors including Renoir Ray Mizoguchi and Kurosawa. The Idiot may have been for me as a reader the most special of the translated Russians and Sadoul's runningtime entry for Hakuchi  265 mins. original version 166 minutes general release version  broke my heart. In the years since though I haven't actively looked I've encountered no clue as to the content of the destroyed footage no hint as to whether anything at all even memory or hearsay may remain. Can there be anyone still living who saw the full version? Are there accounts in untranslated Japanese film literature?The film as it stands strikes me as Kurosawa's most imperfectly realized. Whether he or someone else did the criminal reedit it begins with disparate scenes linked by narrative intertitles. These intrusions so closely resemble the apologetic substitutions for unrecoverable scenes in recent film restorations that I imagine they represent the cuts. Background and setup seem the most obvious place to have cut. The explosive scene around the fireplace and wad of money now just bizarre unsupported seems precisely where an airhead producer might have begun the film. As the film nears its end scenes flow into one another with increasing ease. But really who knows? What have we lost if even those delicate later convolutions suffered the knife? Donald Richie in The Films of Akira Kurosawa nods at the controversy over the film's length and Kurosawa's failed defense yet whines about the early intertitles as if they were part of the original design.Despite all that the casting of Setsuko Hara as Taeko Nastasya Filippovna makes me wonder if the film was doomed anyway. Her beauty as least in this film is a cold thing. I recall Nastasya as a flighty sometimes generous woman able with varying success to hide her feelings behind goodnatured laughter. Men's verbal ploys and attacks often ratcheted upward her gaiety. As much as beauty unpredictability drew men to her. We  I mean men  both desire and fear beauty and we both desire and fear women's unpredictability. Taeko's so deliberate nearly always that there's too little explanation left in the film for the other two men's entrancement with her and too little for Myshkin's. She's so dark and so darkly clothed almost as if in mourning so sedate so prone to miming each thought before she speaks it that she appears fifteen years older than her rival Ayako. No small part of The Idiot is the spontaneity of Nastasya the irony with which the fight over her turns a fluid creature into an achingly deliberative one. Taeko's silence should resound while the two men mourn her. It doesn't because she never lived anyway in Hakuchi. Did cut scenes destroy Taeko's mirth imbue in its place this haggard wisdom? Did somebody cut Taeko's laughter?".

The story based on Dostoyevsky's novel feels chopped to bits. I think I got the gist of it by the end but it's only barely comprehensible by itself. Perhaps the film stands decently if you've read the source material. However there is plenty of legitimate criticism of what we do have to justify calling it Kurosawa's worst anyway. This material just doesn't fit Kurosawa's talent. He always has a penchant for melodrama and that works fairly well in the historical films as well as his crime films. In fact in every other film I've seen from him it has worked at least okay. Here it feels hopelessly misplaced. The setpieces are so overperformed and even overdirected that they become painful to sit through. Of course it might help if I knew what the heck was going on. About the only real piece of interest is Ozu's muse Setsuko Hara playing a rather nasty woman a femme fatale of sorts. It's kind of playing against type and she does a pretty good job.

	schema:reviewBody "Japanese screenwriter film editor film producer and director Akira Kurosawa's ninth feature film which he edited and cowrote with Japanese writer Eijir Hisaita 18891976 is an adaptation of a novel from 18681869 by 19th century Russian author and journalist Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky 18211881. It was shot on locations on the Island of Haikkado the largest and northernmost prefecture of Japan and is a Japanese production which was produced by film producer Takashi Koide. It tells the story about Kinji Kameda a soldier who due to his experiences during the Second World War has been staying at a sanatorium in Okinawa for several years. After being released more or less recovered the uncommonly compassionate Kinji returns to his home place and during that winter in the 1950s he meets a woman named Ayako who is the youngest of a wealthy man's three daughters and a kept woman named Taeko whom he becomes emotionally involved with. The young man is looking for a woman to spend the rest of his life with but things change when he learns that his friend Akama is in love with one of the two women.Distinctly and precisely directed by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa 19101998 this heartrending and profoundly humane fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view draws an afflicting portrayal of an emotive and trusting man's return to society after serving his country and his relationship with two women. While notable for it's atmospheric rural milieu depictions picturesque blackandwhite cinematography by cinematographer Toshio Ubukata production design by Japanese production designer and art director Takashi Matsuyama 19081997 the fine editing by Akira Kurosawa and use of sound this characterdriven dialogdriven and literary love triangle about human dignity human cruelty social distinctions and love depicts an indepth and internal study of character and contains a prominent score by Japanese film score and classical composer Fumio Hayasaki 19141955.This somewhat melodramatic romantic and involving psychological drama from the early 1950s which has an incomplete narrative structure due to a studio that shortened the filmmakers original cut from 265 minutes to 166 minutes is impelled and reinforced by it's voiceover narration at times trancelike and colorful characters substantial character development and the fine acting performances by Japanese actor Masayuki Mori 19111973 Chineseborn Japanese actor Toshir Mifune 19201997 and Japanese actresses Setsuko Hara and Yoshiko Kuga.

	onyx:emotionText "Japanese screenwriter film editor film producer and director Akira Kurosawa's ninth feature film which he edited and cowrote with Japanese writer Eijir Hisaita 18891976 is an adaptation of a novel from 18681869 by 19th century Russian author and journalist Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky 18211881. It was shot on locations on the Island of Haikkado the largest and northernmost prefecture of Japan and is a Japanese production which was produced by film producer Takashi Koide. It tells the story about Kinji Kameda a soldier who due to his experiences during the Second World War has been staying at a sanatorium in Okinawa for several years. After being released more or less recovered the uncommonly compassionate Kinji returns to his home place and during that winter in the 1950s he meets a woman named Ayako who is the youngest of a wealthy man's three daughters and a kept woman named Taeko whom he becomes emotionally involved with. The young man is looking for a woman to spend the rest of his life with but things change when he learns that his friend Akama is in love with one of the two women.Distinctly and precisely directed by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa 19101998 this heartrending and profoundly humane fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view draws an afflicting portrayal of an emotive and trusting man's return to society after serving his country and his relationship with two women. While notable for it's atmospheric rural milieu depictions picturesque blackandwhite cinematography by cinematographer Toshio Ubukata production design by Japanese production designer and art director Takashi Matsuyama 19081997 the fine editing by Akira Kurosawa and use of sound this characterdriven dialogdriven and literary love triangle about human dignity human cruelty social distinctions and love depicts an indepth and internal study of character and contains a prominent score by Japanese film score and classical composer Fumio Hayasaki 19141955.This somewhat melodramatic romantic and involving psychological drama from the early 1950s which has an incomplete narrative structure due to a studio that shortened the filmmakers original cut from 265 minutes to 166 minutes is impelled and reinforced by it's voiceover narration at times trancelike and colorful characters substantial character development and the fine acting performances by Japanese actor Masayuki Mori 19111973 Chineseborn Japanese actor Toshir Mifune 19201997 and Japanese actresses Setsuko Hara and Yoshiko Kuga. An empathic poignantly atmospheric and epic story.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's pretty difficult to judge this film fully. The first half is erratic and filled with jolting edits characters that appear and disappear without any introduction. It's a damn shame. The scatological nature of this epic project adapted from the Russian classic by Fyodor Dostoyevsky was due to it being horrendously cut down by the studio that funded it. Originally Akira Kurosawa had created a 266 minute cut of the  incredibly faithful to the source novel  was shortened by 100 minutes. Unfortunately it would seem that the world may never see the original version as even when Kurosawa hunted for the missing scenes in the vaults several decades later he was unable to locate them.As it is in its now 166 minute format the longest version available it is still an incredibly important piece of melodrama. After the devastation of the war Kinji Kameda Masayuki Mori and Denkichi Akama Toshiro Mifune travel back to a remote island. Kameda claims that he suffers from an illness cause by the suffering of war and simply referred to as idiocy  when expressed on film this idiocy seems simply to be an innocent and fundamentally naive view of people. He simply only sees good in people even if this is not the case. On arriving they both seem to fall for a disgraced woman Taeko Nasu Setsuko Hara who was someones concubine since the age of fourteen and is being offered for marriage at a price.What ensues is a strange love triangle that divides not only the two male protagonists but the community. The film is beautifully shot in black and white by Toshio Ubukata who had worked with Kurosawa on his previous film Scandal 1950. It is unfortunate that the films first half suffers so evidently due to extensive cutting. However it is the relationship between Kameda and Akama that provides the climax which is seemingly more intact that provides the films central theme and its most poignant elements.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Idiot The 1951  out of 4Adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel about a man Masayuki Mori labeled an idiot due to hardships he suffered and the impact he has on those around him including a woman Setsuko Hara who falls for him and the other man Toshiro Mifune who loves her. I knew going into this 166minute film that it originally ran 265minutes and as expected there are certain times that the film seems jumpy. While watching this movie I couldn't help but admire the acting directing and cinematography but I must admit that the story never really brought me into the drama and in the end I'd have to call this a major disappointment from the legendary director. This certainly is no where near what I'd call a bad film and even though I didn't like it it's easy to see why some might love it. I'm sure I would have been one of them but the story to me just wasn't strong enough to pull me into everything that was going on and when this is happening during a nearly threehour movie you're going to eventually grow bored with what you're watching. I'm not sure if I had read the novel if it would have made much difference but there were times when I felt rather lost as to what was going on and I'm not sure if this was due to me not being knowledgeable of the source material or if my boredom in what was going on just kept me from connecting to certain plot points. With that said there's still quite a bit to admire here including the wonderful cinematography by Toshio Ubukata who really creates a nice atmosphere with his camera. I especially loved the scenes outside in the snowy streets and another segment with the ice skating. Another major plus were the performances from the cast with Mori leading the way as the Christlike figure. I think a lot of actors would have loved to play a part like this but I'd be willing to bet that most would really overplay it but thankfully Mori never does this. I think he finds the perfect blend of kindness as well as that Christlike figure and makes a rather memorable character. Hara also gets to shine in many scenes including the dramatic one of her letting Mori pretty much pick her future. Mifune as always is terrific and really adds a nice punch in the second half of the film. Kurosawa certainly handles the material well but the story is a very important thing and all the positives this film offered me just couldn't get over the fact that I didn't care too much for what I was seeing.".

He falls in love with a kept woman after viewing her picture but he has a rival in Toshiro Mifume of samurai fame a bullying unstable brute who still seeks his mother's approval. The Idiot has become the way he is after being pulled from his execution at the last minute. He was falsely convicted of war crimes. He is unbalanced but is able to see in people what their fears and weaknesses are. He's also not afraid to speak his mind and this leads to great pain.

	schema:reviewBody "Not a bad film at all by all means but considering that it was directed by Akira Kurosawa one of the greatest directors of all time and based on a novel by one of the great novelists of the 19th century Fyodor Dostoevsky it was a bit of a letdown.The Idiot's biggest problem was the extensive cutting originally intended to be a 266minute long film and very faithful adaptation it was cut by one hour to Kurosawa's outrage and the problem is that this interference quite badly shows. The first half felt rather fragmented and erratically paced jumping around so much with things starting and ending very abrupty that it was not always easy to follow and it would have been even more so if I was not familiar with the source material already and character motivations rather confused and irrational. Luckily the second half does calm down significantly and the drama more linear. The dramatic scenes do get a bit overwrought and pedestrian in pace and the cutting robs them of the depth and detail that would have made them better.Some have said they found the performances weird and offkilter for me they were mostly decent if nowhere near among toptier Kurosawa standard. Those adjectives that said do apply to the performance of Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune and to a lesser extent Setsuko Hara a fine actor but he overacts quite wildly here and it does hurt the tone of the film as well as being very unlike his usual standard of performing. As an adaptation it does come up short not just how the film was treated but also with how little of Dostoevsky's style comes through the philosophical social and literary meanings almost completely stripped and overshadowed by the soapoperaish melodrama that the sometimes thoughtprovoking but also a little heavyhanded and disjointed script.However Masayuki Mori carries the film solidly in a sensitive and wisely underplayed performance and Setsuko Hara brings a moving dramatic intensity to hers although like Mifune some of her delivery is a little overegged. Takashi Shimura can also be relied on to give a great performance. Kurosawa directs with his usual technical brilliance and command of the story the cutting disallows his style to shine even more but he does a solid job seeing his calibre as a director however one does expect something more than that. Despite the treatment the film got which stopped it from being the faithful adaptation it was intended to be it doesn't completely disgrace the novel at all even with the updating setting change and that it feels more lesser Kurosawa than a novel by Dostoevsky. The basic story apart from a large gap where it really does feel like an hour was cut out and of course not enough of Dostoevsky's style is here even if not used to its full potential a lot of it is introduced and then treated in an onthesurface way and the story does transfer to the culture of postwar Northern Japan reasonably well.The music score is hauntingly beautiful and hairraising and the settings and costumes are authentic and strikingly detailed. But the best asset and the only really exceptional one is the cinematography the best parts absolutely exquisite and astonishingly vivid and almost on par with the production values of Kurosawa's best work. All in all largely uneven and disappointing film with some impressive elements if left uncut it would definitely have been a much better film. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " some of the best Dostoyevsky adapted to film...";
	schema:reviewBody "For any adaptation of a Fyodor Dostoyevsky story to work the filmmaker has got to know what he's in for with the source. Dostoyevsky writes like the sky is falling in every beat but it's such a breathtaking sky that there needs to be some poetry in the midst of all the torpedoes falling down on consciousness. Getting through Crime and Punishment or Notes From the Underground is hard going at times but about the most rewarding if you give yourself to the prose that literature can provide. I haven't read the Idiot yet but I can gather just from what I've read about it and hitherto seen in this Akira Kurosawa adaptation that it's not a whole lot set apart from his other works. The difference in this case is that there's a more wholesome Dostoyevsky character here than say Roskolnikov. With a bit of Forrest Gump a squeeze of Jesus but a lot more head trauma Prince Mishkin here Kinji Kameda sees the best in people the love but also the sadness and pain and he can't do much but offer some advice and those eyes full of whatever the other person wants to project onto themselves from him.One thing I found really interesting in the Idiot is Kurosawa's use of eyes. Eyes give away a lot sometimes in movies but in this case they convey almost as much as in a straight silent film. Odd considering how much Kurosawa sticks to the program of Dostoyevsky's original text not sure how much it stays true to it especially translating to 20th century Japan but it seems close by the tone and depth of the language that body language and the perspective of eye contact and movement and range is so important. But it's this facet that creates at times the benchmark of the emotion in some scenes specifically one that takes place late in the film where there's the start of an emotional confrontation between Takeo Nasu and Ayako the two women of Kameda and Akama's lives and before a word is spoken in this tense scene where sides are chosen and fates are laid out eyes go back and forth Nasu's wild hurt eyes and Akayo's more direct composed orbs. Under any other direction it might go into overacting but with Kurosawa it's just right.So much has already been written about the problems of the Idiot stemming from the fact that a third of its original running time from 265 to 166 minutes detracts from how it really should be perceived. I couldn't agree more but it should be noted that the picture when it does work well on the usual fronts of Kurosawa at his prime and it is often does have some triumphant status to it. For a movie that however long length is filled with this much talk going through motions that should be considered torrid melodrama and to actually surprise one with the effects from its actors and its lucid storytelling is thrilling. The cast is terrific everyone from Toshiro Mifune in a role that has him as a kind of human timebomb where he could go off any minute but there's a lot of moments where he suddenly comes down to Earth thanks to Kameda Satsuko Hara whom we might remember from Rashomon doesn't stray too far from her character's range which allows her to plunge headon into a role that's dark and depressing and strange and Mori also in Rashomon and noteworthy in Ugetsu has a nice quality all around him as the one innocent soul of the bunch innocent as in not totally corrupted in his emotions or swayed easily by his passions one way or another.And as mentioned Kurosawa's camera is limitless in how it can navigate around during a scene quietly sneaking up and getting a good strong composition with everyone in frame a certain way or spinning around to another one that keeps you on your toes to expect something else. It's suffice to say at least his skills don't dull in this time in his career between Rashomon Ikiru and Seven Samurai. So really it all comes down to The Idiot being a piece of a great movie or pieces to put it that way. It's frustrating for example to actually KNOW where the producer cut into the frames added in a cheap wipe or two ones that would not be the norm for Kurosawa and put in those irritating cards early on in the film rushing things along it also doesn't make sense for that matter that the film's first part is 90 minutes while the second is 14 minutes shorter than that equivalent. Like Magnificent Ambersons Kurosawa got the rough end of the stick on distribution if to say that he went too far in making a 4hour plus Dostoyevsky adaptation for Japanese audiences in 1951. Unlike Welles who was an upstart at the comparative time Kurosawa was just starting out getting some hits but not quite a superstar in international cinema yet.It's a bit of a shame because taking in all of the sappy melodrama and the highrising music and the occasional maudlin touches The Idiot in its completed form could be as great a Kurosawa at his very best. As it is it's only better than average but should be a welcome treat for Dostoyevsky fans at least.".

Meanwhile his best friend Patrick is the only villain so to speak only because he's a bit defiant as his mother labels him and he almost spoils everything for Omri.It's a solid family film that is fun for both the parents and kids to watch at the same time. Both will get a lot of entertainment out of it. With just a bit of profanity early on and a bit of obvious political correctness there is nothing in here which should offend viewers. Critics didn't seem to care for it so you know it truly was a nice wholesome film....and fun to watch.".

While I gave it a 10 I fully expected at least a mid 7 from the IMDb audience. It is a wonderful film that I love to show to my children. What's not to like? It has a unique plot  that of an Indian coming to life in a young boy's cupboard and wonderful acting and music. Through the boy's experiences with the Indian wonderfully played by Litefoot he comes to a new level of maturity. Hal Scardino's acting is natural and totally believable. If you are tired of the cutout child actors that Hollywood gives us too often then you'll love Hal. What a fabulously underplayed performance. The ending always makes me and my wife cry. There are so few really good films for children. I hate to suffer through other films I bought for the kids like Inspector Gadget  a truly awful film and I wish that there were more films like this one. This is a wonderful film and I heartily recommend it.".

It's not to say it ranks high amongst the worlds films technically which is not to say it fails in this regard  it simply does not depend upon special effects but the underlying theme is gentle and beautifully presented. The child actors' performances are solid. Especially the lead 'Omri' and his friend whom I really liked and really disliked respectively  hence his acting ability. It's an innocent story with great imagination and doesn't take itself too seriously. The relationship and growth that the main character develops with Little Bear the Indian in the cupboard is special. It eventually takes on a fatherson dynamic after a role reversal or sorts from the Creatorcreated dynamic the boy has with Little Bear at first. I was touched by this relationship and by Omri's innocence. Frank Oz imagination is conveyed well through this work. I can easily imagine being in Omri's shoes and enjoy this film each time I watch it. Whether you watch this with kids or not odds are you'll enjoy it.".

The big problem is the fact that the books take place in England. And if you read the rest of the books you'll know how important the location is to the entire story. The movie Americanizes Omri. The movie cuts out and replaces a lot of scenes as well. For instance in the movie Boone never sits in the art class drawing his microscopic sketch of his town...a scene that would play an big role in a book to come. Another scene they cut was the principal seeing Little Bear and Boone the way Omri and Patrick do...another big scene that follows them throughout the series. Perhaps they did this because there were no plans for sequels. However it makes for a huge disappointment for viewers who had read the books before or ran right to the books afterward. The acting and casting for the time travelers however was wonderful. As I read the books I picture Litefoot speaking all Little Bear's lines Steve Coogan speaking all Tommy's lines and David Keith speaking Boone's lines. I loved the special effects throughout the movie. The fact that all the others were Americanized causes me to realize they don't fit the Omri Patrick etc in the books. Overall I say that if you enjoy it then you enjoy it. But chances are when you read the books you'll find it a definite disappointment as it is with so many other bookbased movies.".

It also mediates on life and death at certain points and was the first film in a long time to be genuinely emotionally shocking. The relationship between the Indian and the cowboy was very well developed as they started to bond over their tragedies. The film does have a number of loose edges. Rishi Bhat was particularly annoying at times but in a way he was necessary to play off Scardino. Even Scardino wasn't always a lovable protagonist. In one scene he kicks his brother's pet rat down the stairs in an event where the rat clearly would have died. As the film hadn't relied on cartoon logic up until that point it was a bit out of place. Great effects and seeing Darth Vader vs. a TRex kind of made up for those moments.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies you watch as a child and you love it and when you watch it as an adult you hope it will live up to your memory. A little boy receives a few unique gifts for his birthday an old cupboard an old key and an old Native American Iroquois toy. When combined something magical happens. The toy becomes a living man. The young boy is at first excited about being able to make his toys come to life until he learns that with the people being truly alive it also means they can die. He learns a lot from the Native American about the man's culture and brings the information to school. But when the boy's friend learns the truth he decides to bring an old cowboy to life which causes fights between the toys. This is a heartwarming tale of friendship love and the meaning and consequences of life. For that reason this movie is sweet and good. However from a technical standpoint this movie is terrible. Therefore I must say if you have kids then this would be a sweet movie to watch with them. Otherwise never see this film.Soundtrack 4 There were moments of soundtrack that worked usually when putting in bits of Native American chants but for the most part it was just bad.Script 4 There are so many plot holes. Not only that but the script sounded choppy and not well thought out. However there were some moments that seemed to try to be character development and for the sake of what the script had to offer it was OK.Originality 10 This was definitely an excellent idea and might even work if redone better.Cinematography 5 The cinematography was not spectacular. There were some strange camera choices. However the special effects blended pretty decently giving this an average score.Casting 2 There were a couple people that worked but for the most part the cast just wasn't right.Acting 1 The man playing the Native American was decent and the only reason the acting is not a zero. No one else in this film could act at all.Overall 4.3".

A little boy receives a few unique gifts for his birthday an old cupboard an old key and an old Native American Iroquois toy. When combined something magical happens. The toy becomes a living man. The young boy is at first excited about being able to make his toys come to life until he learns that with the people being truly alive it also means they can die. He learns a lot from the Native American about the man's culture and brings the information to school. But when the boy's friend learns the truth he decides to bring an old cowboy to life which causes fights between the toys.

There are so many good teaching moments for parents regarding what kids go through growing up. The effects were well done for the time playing the small vs. big people visuals. I was absorbed in the story well beyond picking on every detail. Omri was decent not great but believable as the kid star the casting and scripting both for Little Bear are compelling fascinating and wonderful. I would recommend this film to almost anyone if their reality can be suspended for 96 minutes. It is a great story if only a good film. Entertaining and more gripping than many films since.".

Litefoot plays a wonderful role as the Indian brought to life but I also suspect he may have had a little hand in the production guiding and eliminating several Native American stereotypes from the production. I do admit being quite a bit intrigued by the power of the cupboard andor key as by some of the toys brought to life seem to actually hold the consciousnesses of actual individuals returned to life. If so then the cupboard is merely a time machine of sorts but there is a very cute albeit brief scene where Omri brings to life a few of his action figures and discovers how dangerous they are with their phony weapons transformed into their real life equivalents. Among which is a dinosaur possibly from his Jurassic Park collection. He could have kept the creature alive and sold it for a million at his local Natural History Museum. He also doesn't have any comic book superheroes to bring to life what a chance he missed ! I can only wonder if a barbie doll would have come out looking like Anna Nicole Smith ! Despite infinite possibilities the movie is really better centered on Omri's selfdiscovery through the Indian than several experiments with the cupboard. Little Bear Litefoot explains it all so well You should not play with magic you do not understand !".

When the director Franco Caspio Giuliano Montaldo quits the project Bonomo is forced to offer another screenplay to RAI which is Il Caimano a screenplay he stumbled upon written by the young director Teresa Jasmine Trinca. The filminthefilm is centered on the figure of Italy's prime minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi a subject so controversial that even the public television refuse to produce it. While Bonomo's private life collapses piece by piece as he's divorcing from his wife Margherita Buy and the bank is pressing him hard to pay back his longstanding debts he finds out that struggling to get this movie filmed is the only thing that keeps him alive.";

	schema:reviewBody "Il Caimano belongs to the Nanni Moretti style of filmmaking that I prefer filmmaking with the imaginative uniqueness delightfully neurotic smartass polemic and personal flair of Palombella Rossa as opposed to the neardocumentary style of the albeit very pleasant but a tad too autobiographical Aprile or the more traditional drama of La Stanza Del Figlio. Il Caimano opens with a sequence very reminiscent of Bianca a grotesque Communist party gathering in what looks very much like a classroom from the Marilyn Monroe high school featured in that surreal 1983 movie. It's a scene from Cataracts a Bmovie produced by Bruno Bonomo played with gusto by Moretti regular the Neapolitan actor Silvio Orlando responsible also for such gems as Assassin Mocassins Maciste against Freud and Susy the Misogynist. Bruno is a bumbling likable fool of a producer on the brink of professional and marital failure Margherita Buy a delightful 40 Italian actress perhaps best known outside of Italy for the female lead in Ozpetek's Le Fate Ignoranti plays his estranged wife Paola. One night while settling into the lonely makeshift bed Bruno sets up for himself in his office in the first phase of his marital separation he is deeply struck by a screenplay a young director Teresa has given him in the hope of funding her first fulllength feature Il Caimano... Absurdly Bruno decides to produce it without having read the screenplay in its entirety and more importantly before having realised that the caiman of the title was none other than Berlusconi! Though this may surprise some as Moretti himself has famously said this movie isn't really about Berlusconi. This said the sequences in which Bruno imagines some scenes from Teresa's movie do indeed reenact familiar episodes in the rise to wealth and power of Italy's richest citizen most notably the courtroom scenes at one point the Berlusconi character is accused of going into politics in order not to go to jail. Not to mention some real footage including Berlusconi's joke regarding a German member of the European Parliament being perfect for the role of a Nazi guard in a film as an Italian citizen rewatching such footage makes you want to be instantly swallowed by the depths of the earth but it's actually worth staying on the surface just to study the look of stunned mortified murderous embarrassment spreading onto Fini Italy's thenvicePM's face as his boss cracks the infamous joke!. Nanni's as opposed to Teresa's Il Caimano is about the creative process of an artist. It's also a disillusioned comment on a certain kind of Italian leftwing citizen that has arisen from Berlusconi's Italy whom Nanni's cameo character in the movie describes in less than flattering terms for their spinelessness and pettiness. Artistic integrity the power of money not just Berlusconi's but what wealth stands for in the creative process and last but not least personal and artistic success and failure are also other important themes present in the movie. Some comments on this board also include homosexuality and gay parenting as a theme of the movie but to me these two elements were included into the story in such a matteroffact way that they were no more thematic than a Julia Roberts romantic comedy is about heterosexuality.Moretti is in top form as far as visual humour is concerned the sequence of a gigantic suitcasefull of Italian banknotes from the 1970s falling through the ceiling and crashing onto a desk in the middle of an office amid the earnest question Where did all that money come from?! is among the most memorable of the last five years that I've seen. There's much of the trademark Moretti photographic flair in Il Caimano a child's feet treading a sea of gawdily colourful lego pieces strewn all over a floor as if he were a fakir walking on hot coals a group of young men and women gently swaying to Rachid Taha's infectious North African rhythms while painting the walls of the film set representing key moments in Berlusconi's life a nocturnal scene with a reconstruction of one of Christopher Columbus's caravels sailing down a Roman Avenue called Cristoforo Colombo only a Roman would know this! there's even a nod to Fellini in the sequences of a historic movie being filmed on a beach just outside Rome reminiscent of Lo Sceicco Bianco both in humour and visuals Il Caimano boasts some noteworthy performances though I found some of the minor players a bit wooden Teresa is played by Jasmine Trinca a bright young star of contemporary Italian cinema first seen playing Nanni Moretti's daughter in La Stanza del Figlio and then to great critical acclaim the mentally disturbed Giorgia in La Meglio Giovent The Best of Youth. Michele Placido a performer I have never considered a favourite has a ball playing the comically repulsive actor who is first cast to play Berlusconi in Teresa's movie and is very funny in the process. Polish star Jerzy Stuhr known to international audiences for the lead roles in Kieslowski's Three Colours White and Dekalog 10 plays the rich Polish producer Sturavsky a choruslike character who provides the bemused foreigner's point of view on the absurd Italian situation an essential Nanni ingredient  in Aprile for instance it was a French journalist who covered that role For all its delightful humour Il Caimano is also predictably a bitter movie and also a deeply allegorical one see the final sequences for instance. On whether Berlusconi will win the next elections meaning the ones that have just passed Nanni Moretti's cameo character prophetically says He has already won  according to this movie and Nanni Moretti himself the caiman's steady corrosive action onto Italian culture which has been dumbed down beyond recognition the damage he has inflicted on all aspects of life that'll take decades to mend the opportunistic cynicism he has left as a legacy to his citizens are battles that he has steadily been winning for the last 20 years.".

	schema:headline " The producer";
	schema:reviewBody "Nanni Moretti the director of Il Caimano is one of the most important directors working in the Italian cinema today. We have admired his previous work a lot and it was a complete surprise when this movie showed up on cable recently. The film owes much of its success to Silvio Orlando an actor who has worked with Mr. Moretti before and is without a doubt one of the most accomplished actor on the scene today as he has demonstrated in past collaboration with Mr. Moretti.Il Caimano is a fine film in which one can see the talented Mr. Moretti doing impressive work. It is in a way a tribute to the Italian cinema past and present and clearly demonstrates the quality behind the people that were involved in the project.The film starts with a retrospective of the work of Bruno Bonomo a producer of exploitation films. As he is leaving the auditorium a young woman holding a child approaches him with the manuscript of a film she has written. Bruno's own life is unraveling at this point he and his wife Paola are going through a nasty divorce. It's clear Bruno loves her and he adores his young boys. Bruno after reading the manuscript decides to sell the idea for a feature film and starts assembling a production team to work on it. What starts as a product of love ends up in being a disaster production where everything seems to fall apart. Only at the end when he decides to begin shooting the movie the mood changes and we are taken to a quite different film being made with political undertones based on recent events in Italy.Silvio Orlando is amazing as Bruno. He gives an excellent performance as the troubled producer whose life has unraveled against his best wishes. Mr. Orlando is the best excuse to watch the movie. Margherita Buy is seen in the double role of Paola the estranged wife and the heroine of Bruno's own action movies. They are joined by a wonderful cast and even Mr. Moretti who appears in the last segment of the film.This film which hasn't been shown commercially in this country as far as we are concerned is worth a look because of the winning team of the director and the leading man.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never seen a Nanni Moretti movie previously and I was pretty curious since he is the kind of respected author among the European critics. Actually a bit more than respected and quite frankly a critics' darling. Knowing this I could fear a selfindulgent movie with little creativity and a bunch of private jokes for the gallery but I was open minded and ready to be charmed by the story of a delightful raconteur.Unfortunately this movie is a mess depicting a bland movie producer at a loss with his professional and private life. This alone could have been the subject of a good even very good movie Fellini could have shot this with gusto and the necessary grandeur to make us love a pitiful character but Moretti maybe feeling he is on a mission to tilt on the intellectualpolitical side of Italian cinema wanted to add an inconsistent background story about the project of a Berlusconi biopic.This background  which is supposed to be the main focus of the story  never blends in with the personal story of the main character. Is there a parallel between the midlife crisis of Bruno Bonomo and the political vacuum that brought Berlusconi to power in Italy? Nope we never feel something of that kind. Bruno Bonomo is at a loss maybe he wants to assert himself and then the Berlusconi biopic project lands in his life where it doesn't belong but it is very difficult to understand why he would be interested at first since he doesn't realize what the project is about. Then he is stuck with it and won't back away which only further isolates this weakened character.With this big mess of a plot you've got long minutes to get bored waiting for the movie to get set on a precise track. And beyond this chore trouble Moretti's directing is not worth more than a TVstint his vignettes about Bonomo's Zmovies are painfully ridiculous selfindulgent have nothing to do there except reassure Moretti that he does shoot Amovies. Almodovar did this kind of Zmovie jokes decades ago because he started his career shooting those cheap yet energetic movies on his way to polishing his skills as a wonderful director with lovely stories to tell. Almodovar doesn't even need to be branded an author he proves it every time even when his movies are not on a par with his best works.I don't know what is supposed to be Moretti's best work but with what he failed to prove here I'm not too eager to get my eyes on it.PS about Berlusconi maybe I was expecting more of a fierce political story and it's a shame that while bragging it is one Il Caimano's backstory could have been about the private affairs of some Italian soccer star without changing the main story. Moretti could have been brave and have shot a movie about Berlusconi when he was elected head of the Italian government years before. Or even ten years ago when he was already Il Cavaliere riding through Italy the way he liked. Now this movie is not convincing at discussing the difficulties to make a movie about Berlusconi let alone being a movie that deals with Berlusconi's obscure connections or about his rise to power as a demagogue opportunist.".

Il caimano is a marvellous film talking about a family and a dream in the Berlusconi era. Bruno Bonomo is a producer of Bmovies. He's stubborn and dreamer and one night he receives a screenplay from a girl during a film festival. This girl wants at all costs realize a film about Berlusconi called Il caimano. Bruno doesn't understand the main character is just Berlusconi and so he decides to please the girl preparing this film. All happens while the Bonomo family falls to pieces. Bruno Bonomo is played by Silvio Orlando an actor present in a lot of Moretti's films who gives a splendid performance. His wife Paola is played by Margherita Buy the best contemporary Italian actress according to me I'd drool for seeing her in the whole Bmovie at the beginning Cataratte and the young director Teresa is played by Jasmine Trinca a nice and quite good promise of Italian cinema together with Silvio Muccino Cristiana Capotondi and Riccardo Scamarcio. To complete the cast there are Michele Placido Jerzy Stuhr Anna Bonaiuto a lot of directors and he Nanni Moretti. A marvellous film who wants to study the Berlusconian Italy well he or she has to watch it.".

Indeed the infamous PM isn't really a character at all or rather that is all he is a character in a film script. Instead it's all about Bruno a director of very cheesy exploitation pictures who hasn't had a hit in years and whose marriage has also gone down the tubes who suddenly finds himself energized again when a radical young lesbian presents him with a script which turns out to be a searing indictment of Berlusconi well maybe not that searing. The film is about Bruno's efforts to get the bloody thing made in a conservative Italian film industry scared of its own shadow.It's at its best in the domestic scenes and not in the filmmaking parodies which already have been done to death and Moretti shows a real empathy for all concerned. Bruno in particular is beautifully played by Silvio Orlando as a basically sad fat unattractive little man bemoaning his lot yet finding a kind of redemption by making the one 'serious' film of his career. When finally he is able to finance a punchy film centering on the end of the trial the filmwithinthefilm shifts up a gear leaving us in no doubt where Moretti's sympathies lie.".

Moretti is above all a director and you can like him or not but his movie is something completely different. You will continue to enjoy this movie in 20 years while apart from some history students I foresee no such a future for Fahrenheit 911... Back to The Caiman. This is the first movie ever on such a slippery topic like our beloved Prime Minister oh yes FORMER Prime Minister now.... As many readers may know he was by far the main actor of Italian politics for nearly 15 years now and no one dared to take a picture of the Italian society so widely influenced by him and his TVs good or bad doesn't matter here. Why you may ask? Because it's too easy to flatter or offend such a controversial guy Moretti managed to softly skim over the whole thing trying to take a picture of Italy in these years... Silvio Orlando's character voted for him and he never quite criticizes him the scenes of the wouldbe movie are soft never judging in some cases even childish. As Moretti said the aim of the movie is not to let the people know the facts about Berlusconi they are widely known even by his supporters. But then it comes to an end. And here is no more softness or light. Orlando manages to have the money to shoot only the end of the movie here Nanni is the actor interpreting the Caiman. He is impressive bitter sharp and his grin is something hard to forget. But still he is Him freed from the restraints of physical similarities it is the same Moretti we've seen as Botero in Il Portaborse only Botero now is not so fictitious or unreal. Botero has become the Caiman.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a bit like Aprile except that it's not autobiographical. It is about a smalltime producer battling against personal and financial problems who tries to make a movie about Mr.B as I shall call Berlusconi. The idea has potential and for about the first half the movie is fairly entertaining but it goes downhill from there. In the end the personal problems of the producer degenerate into the pointless psychological sadomasochism that Woody Allen has recently inflicted upon us and Mr.B becomes increasingly peripheral to the plot.People hoping to learn about Italian politics from this movie will be disappointed but it is still possible to gain a few insights. One insight I had is that the most interesting thing about Italian political cinema is which movies are never made Mr.B. has vastly greater resources but he doesn't bother to make movies or documentaries critical of his opponents. He probably thinks that it would not be worth his time and money. Soon after the Left lost the 2001 elections Moretti himself said that with the leaders it's got the Left is never going to win  and he got a standing ovation at a rally of the Left. He was too pessimistic but at least he is a man who says out loud what he thinks.For the record I believe both sides of Italian politics to be about equally bad at the time of writing for very different reasons but contrary to Moretti I don't think that Italian politics is worse that that of some other European countries. Anyway I'll volunteer a piece of advice to the Italian Left if you want to criticize Mr.B make a documentary some of the best scenes in this movie were archive footage of the real Mr.B.By comparison to that footage the final scene looks like a lame coda whatever its artistic merits this scene did not grip my attention because there is no buildup to it. Also I believe that the end of this scene grossly overstates the effect of Mr.B's propaganda on the Italian public.In conclusion coming from the director of Caro Diario this movie is a disappointment but it might still be worth seeing at least the first half.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie for so long I was bound to be slightly disappointed. And indeed I was. But I loved parts of it all the same. Silvio Orlando's performance as a bankrupt producer for one was magnificent. I thought his three or four minutes in Aprile were the highlight of that movie and in The Son's Room he practically stole the show. So I was delighted to see Moretti giving him a leading role. Throughout the movie you can see on his face the effect of the blows and of the suffering that have been his lot but despite it all he's goodhearted and optimistic and enthusiastic about his work. The depiction of his growing friendship with the young director played by Trinca is also moving and natural.And while our Italian friends may be known worldwide for their cultivation of il dolce farniente Il caimano happens to be a celebration of the joys of work. Some of its finest scenes are simply depictions of Orlando's producer talking to the people he needs to talk to get his movie made. In The Son's Room too some of the best scenes involved Moretti's therapist at work talking to his patients one of them played by Silvio Orlando as it happens. And now that I think about it some of the Italian books I've been reading lately by Primo Levi and Laura Grimaldi also celebrate work. Strange. And here I was thinking that the only people who loved work in Europe were the Germans Arbeit macht frei and all that.Mindful of the gruesome fate of the critic in the Bmovie excerpt shown at the beginning of The Crocodile I'll remain silent for the most part about the things I didn't like as much. But I still can't help wondering why our Italian friends throw such hissy fits about this former prime minister of theirs. Did his companies launder millions in illgotten gains? Did he corrupt the judiciary and the police and muzzle his critics? Did he make a whole generation of Italians cynics? Who cares! That's what politicians are supposed to do isn't it? At least his government had the guts to ban smoking in bars and restaurants and for that alone he can steal all the millions he wants!".

I guess to do effectively so it's better to make a documentary about him but not a movie. The plot was boring cursory and sometimes really dumb.

Pointless. Oh but we Italians cannot live without good pointless polemics or a juicy scandal or some gruesome crime possibly involving a minor and weeping relatives thereof. Here I think we're talking about a movie like raising hell on science research vs. animal rights because the main characters have a cute Guinea pig pet... This said the documental and fictional content on Mr.Berlusconi is correctly defined by Moretti'character he plays himself in the movie as something that no one in Italy who wanted to know does not know. Anyone who is motivated enough to read one in the plethora of books on the history and deeds of our Man of Destiny knows that even darker more upsetting and obnoxious relationsfacts sparsely punctuate his ascension to the financial and political scene anyone who is otherwise oriented to believe his journalists and TVs will find in this movie the standard attack to the cando selfmade defensor fidei which can be dismissed with the usual reference to orchestrated iconoclastic communist hatred. I must say that the J'accuse against Berlusconi and the ethical degeneration of our poor Country is weak and deja vu. From the man who managed in just two lines to represent the ineptitude of a political class and the discouragement of a generation D'Alema d qualcosa di sinistra... D'Alema d qualcosa..... Sorry this can be understood just by Italians I am afraid it'd take half a page to explain it to someone who didn't have the mishap to live in Italy in the 90s I was expecting much much more... The movie is the story of a declining producer whose last chance to avoid existential and professional bankruptcy comes as the script of a movie on the Premier. Then there comes the wellknown plotoverplot concerning the making of the movie. There are a few hints on the scare that the proposal of this movie scatters on the characters coming in touch with it but not half as effective as what Viva Zapatero! was able to do. The story of the producer is alas the standard Nuovo Cinema Italiano clich the marriage and existential crisis the worries for the children the problems on the job the irruption of a fresh lively challenging feminine character with the pale touch of lesbianism here... nothing that could not be found in La finestra di fronte or Ricordati di me or Cuore sacro see my comments on those. Luckily we are spared the relations with the parents... Sorry Nanni you have been dealing with much higher profiles on some of these items in La stanza del figlio and other former movies... Some of the developments are phoned italian term for dead giveaway such as the betrayal of the main actor Placido or the wink to the unending closeness among Orlando and Buy in the final scenes. I could not believe this from Moretti... The final scene is didascalic and ineffectively exaggerated seems that the audience at the premiere was upset by it but its content is not that devastating... a reference to true facts  e.g. the covered masonic Loggia P2 to which our former premier was affiliated n.1816 would have been IMHO more to the point. I read on the TV teletext that a selectionner for the Cannes Festival stated that this movie overthrows Fahrenheit 911 by Moore and will be a rage in Cannes... now GIMME A BREAK... easy now madam... On exiting the cinema both sad and depressed my companion overheard a housewife sorry for the politically incorrect reference asking her pal Hey was this movie against the Left or against the Right ?.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well what do you make of that? 'Il Caimano' is certainly different! It has a magnificent central performance by Silvio Orlando who makes the whole film work. He plays a man who is trying to make a film about Berlusconi and his performance is heartbreaking and poignant funny compassionate sad desperate all of those things as his life unravels around him but he keeps on smiling. It is rare that an actor gets such a chance and Orlando delivers everything which could possibly have been expected of him and far more besides. His estranged wife is played by Margherita Buy with just the right level of exasperation. The film is also enlivened by the charm of Jasmine Trinca a gamine creature like a sleek young cat and the lanky figure of a boy who looks wonderingly around her and seems to be seeing the world for the first time. There is much less about Berlusconi in this film than one might have expected. The film is really about the filmmaker. Nanni Moretti the director has taken a rather eccentric mixed salad approach towards the story throwing bits of lettuce and cucumber and tomato and slices of yellow pepper in mixing it up with a very fine dressing and has produced a delectable feast. It may be all mixed up but we like it. Dino Risi's 90th birthday is mentioned he is now 92. This film has the same carefree air of Risi's 1960s classic 'Il Surpasso'. A fair amount of political satire appears in the film and Berlusconi is shown both in genuine TV clips and in staged scenes where he is played by three different actors which has the eerie effect of reminding us that he would like to be 'all things to all men' and also be 'whatever or whoever you want'. Do not all politicians want to be whoever you want them to be? 'Just love me' or failing that 'at least elect me but whatever you do don't reject me'. Somehow the strange slapdash manner of Moretti's film suits the subject. After all Italian politics is a hundred times more chaotic than even the most peculiar film about it could ever be.".

	schema:reviewBody "I try to go into a movie uncolored with opinions and thankfully hadn't heard any negative reviews on this one prior to seeing it for the first time in 1980. That allowed me to view it with an open mind.The score is superb. It's what makes the movie what it is. The songs fit the mood in every scene and are all wellplaced. The acting while not the best I've ever seen isn't nearly as bad as made out to be by critics. Let's face it. Neil Diamond is not an actor. He is a singer a performer. In this movie he does that very well. And yet he manages to pull off his character Yussel Rabinovich without a hitch. His scenes with Sir Lawrence Olivier are touching and believable. They are indeed a good match as father and son cantors. But for Yussel his heritage isn't enough. His music roots drive him and that's what he sets out to discover. Against the will of his father and over the protest of his wife Rivka he leaves his home in New York for L.A. and seeks his destiny.Lucie Arnaz turns in a good performance as Molly Bell a retired music promoter who sees potential in Yussel and takes him under her wing. What follows is a tugofwar a battle of valuesold and newas Neil's character now Jess Robin climbs the charts professionally yet never really forgets where he came from.Watching Neil perform in this movie is like seeing one of his concerts. He's allshow and not a bit shy. When he picks up a guitar you know you're in for a treat and he does music as only he can. It's a great story welltold and on the whole wellacted. Neil gives emotions where called for. But in this movie the music's the star. That's where Neil really delivers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay... all these submissions below?  Ignore them.  Here's the real scoop.The biggest problem most folks have with this film is that they're comparing the two male leads' acting ability.  BIG MISTAKE.One is Neil Diamond one of the greatest singers of all time.  The other is Sir Laurence Olivier one of the greatest ACTORS of all time.  Think of it this way if Sir Larry accompanied Neil in a recording of Cherry Cherry people would rave about Neil's performance but then spend an hour going on about how much Olivier sucks.The fact is this neither of them suck.  Everything is great!  Neil Diamond is a fine actor.  Not an AMAZING actor mind you... but a fine actor. He'd even beaten out Dustin Hoffman for the role of Lenny Bruce in Lenny but turned it down... leaving the door open for Hoffman.I made the mistake of reading all of the below jeers and whines about Neil Diamond's terrible acting performance in this movie.  I then watched it over at my girlfriend's house with very low expectations.  But I was very impressed and greatly enjoyed the film.  Granted there are some times when Neil's performance isn't exactly as dramatic as it should be... i.e. when his father shrieks I HAVE NO SON!! Neil doesn't exactly seem to be heartbroken.  But then there are times when he manifests a great deal of emotional power... especially in the scenes where he gets angry.Okay so I'm a huge Neil Diamond fan yes.  I love his music and I think it's cool that he's had a lead in a major motion picture.  BUT from an acting perspective he has my respect.  From one actor to another.  YES I consider him an actor too... and so does the IMDb. I only have two complaints one is that this is the only movie he's been in until Saving Silverman where he had just a cameo.  That sucks.  I want to see Neil in more movies.  The other complaint is what everyone else doesn't like The Jazz Singer. AL JOLSON sung Jazz.  NEIL DIAMOND sings Pop.  Soooooo... couldn't it have been called The Pop Singer and had an addition in the credits that read Based on 'The Jazz Singer' by Al Jolson or something?Anyway... the music is great even Love on the Rocks and I'm not a big ballad fan... as they depress me.  But I can't dislike a Neil song. the movie is a great story and the acting is FINE.  Watch it.  If you're a fan of Neil's or even just a fan of 20 year old movies that have good stories.... check out The Jazz Singer.and by the way.... neil diamond rules.  thank you.".

In this case it IS pretty good and historically important too.It was the first popular talkie and not all talkie either. It was pretty amazing in depicting New York Jewry in a way gathered from the reality of the era and on that score alone is fascinating. It was perhaps overly melodramatic but suitably severe. And its message though simple wasn't quite dumb that jazz music can be sacred work if delivered so. Along the way we got still! entertaining songs. Now this. I do not know what prompted the remake. It seems that they simply had Neil Diamond and saw a fit. He is Jewish. He has a fantastic portfolio of songs some of which seem written for the project and he is at least a credible actor. So they tromped through the old script modernizing as they went. They shifted the focus to the music and the self discovery of the musician. The rift with the father is recast as upset over sex rather than jazz something I think is a big mistake.And the script and production values other than the songs is horrible Laurence Olivier embarrasses himself and us all every thing he speaks with some sort of faux stage accent. he is truly dreadful. Everyone is save one but he is the worst. The only good actor is on screen only a few times he is the booker played by Sully Boyar and every time he shows up to speak the sun shines. Doesn't kill the mold though.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

Had it not been the first movie with sound I don't think many people would remember it.The storyline has been updated so the cantor's son is now off to the music field particularly rock. Now I ask you if you could get an actor to star in your big Christmas movie which is a remake of a famous film would Neil Diamond head the list? Or perhaps every actor with a brain read the script and turned it down. Let's face it folks  Diamond is a terrible actor. Yes he has a great voice and the songs are the only worthy thing in it. You know things are going to go all wrong from the first scene when Diamond dons black face. Was this an ode to the Al Jolson scene from the original or a stupid misplaced piece of humor? Either way the scene goes terribly wrong and you end up feeling uncomfortable watching it.The great Laurence Olivier reached a career low as the role of Diamond's distressed father. As he did in Marathon Man and Dracula and The Boys From Brazil Olivier over emphasizes a bad accent and spends most of his time yelling. When he cries I Hef No Son the result is unintended laughter. It's a bad performance by a great actor. Surprisingly it is Lucie Arnaz Desi and Lucy's daughter who gives the one good performance as Diamond's tough but tortured love interest.My suggestion to those Neil Diamond fans is to buy the soundtrack and forget the movie. It's silly and stupid and not worth a minute of your time. It was a bomb for a reason.".

That said let me say that i really enjoyed this film.Diamond does and admirable job as the young would be cantor caught between his love of music and his love for his father and he doesn't seem to be intmidated by the fact that Laurence Olivier plays his father. The film moves fairly well once Yussel decides to follow his dream and pursue a career in music. It probably isn't the best movie ev er made but it is certainly worth a look. And the music score is wonderful. America coming to America became an anthem for immigrants at the time the movie was made.Definitely worth a look".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't see the 1927 cinematic version so have no means of comparison. However I was very disappointed in this movie about a young man named Yussel who defies his father a Jewish cantor and goes off to California to pursue his dreams of becoming a pop singer. I had expected better given the combination of Lawrence Olivier's acting prowess and Neil Diamond's music as I am quite a fan of both.This is definitely not Olivier's best role or his best performance either as the disapproving disowning father though he is a magnificent actor so viewer's expectations are high. True Neil Diamond isn't a great actor himself by any means though I found he comes across better than some reviewers seem to indicate. As for Lucie Arnaz who plays the woman sharing his musical dreams it's been awhile since I saw the movie and I cannot recall anything whatsoever about her role. I'm sure she was suitably charming and talented but for me this story is all about the father  son relationship the importance in the father's eyes of the son's faithfulness to Jewish traditions and using his musical talents within the synagogue.The only aspect of this film that failed to disappoint was of course the music. Neil Diamond is a great musician here as always with songs such as Hello Again and Love on the Rocks. As for the America finale it was without question the best part of the picture...impressive stirring and emotional. As others have also noted it's a film only for dyed in the wool fans of Neil Diamond and Lawrence Olivier. While I am definitely both other than its rousing finale The Jazz Singer certainly failed to live up to my expectations.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the fine old plot of The Jazz Singer was dusted off for the fifth and last time of the last century it might do well to remember that it wasn't really that great a play to begin with. It was a mediocre piece of writing that Georgie Jessel starred on Broadway with and was made into a film to exhibit that new invention of sound with the singing talents of Al Jolson.Jolson was America's greatest entertainer and he got to reprise some of the great standards that he made famous most particularly that climax of getting down on one knee and singing to his Mammy in the audience. That's what the first film version of The Jazz Singer is famous for nothing else.Poor Neil Diamond also got a great showcase for some wonderful songs he introduced and little else. I did enjoy Love on the Rocks Coming to America and Hello Again great songs by a great singer. But in making his screen debut he was overshadowed by the 20th century's greatest English speaking actor who played his cantor father.Sir Laurence Olivier dusted off that patented middleEuropa accent that had served well on so many occasions. At that point in his career Olivier was doing many things strictly for the paycheck to build a nice estate to leave his kids. That trend started with The Betsy for him. Certainly he had nothing left to prove as an actor.Someone else mentioned that Olivier would look ridiculous trying Neil Diamond's art. Actually he did on screen and maybe one day The Beggar's Opera will be available on DVD and VHS or shown on TV so we can all judge.I count five versions of The Jazz Singer. Jessel on stage the Jolson and Diamond versions and another in between with Eduard Franz as the cantor and Danny Thomas as his son. And a fifth done for television by Jerry Lewis which is supposed to make this one look good.For Fans of Neil Diamond only and don't expect him singing to Mammy in the climax. The plot has Olivier as a widower.".

Opening with the statue of liberty the camera showcases all the different colors faces and cultures that New York City is made of. Yes Neil Diamond is not a terrific actor....HE'S A SINGER! The amazing talent of Laurence Olivier helps cancel out the bad acting from Neil Diamond. Still for a singer Diamond does a good job in this role. For fans of Neil Diamond this is worth watching for the music alone. Still I was hoping out of respect for the original Jazz Singer have some of the remake made into a silent film.

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently the Razzie people thought this movie was so bad that it belonged in their top 100 list of worst movies. They were especially critical of Neil Diamond's performance. However after seeing the film I think this is a bit too harsh. Now I am not saying the movie was good. It does clearly suck. However it isn't bad enough to merit all the hype about the film and it's abysmal awfulness. I see it as the Ivory Soap of films...it's only 99.44 bad! First let's talk about Neil Diamond. He has a very pleasant voice and while I've never particularly liked his style of music most of the songs are bouncy and enjoyable. Most. A few such as the party song and seeing and hearing Neil dressed as a cowboy and singing You Are My Sunshine are truly craptastic. As for his acting it isn't bad for a nonprofessional actorwhich is exactly what he was. This is perhaps why they really didn't give him all that much acting to dohaving him sing again and again and again to cover up this deficiency. His acting was not good sure but also not that bad. I say give the guy a break...except for that scene with the cowboy hat! Second while Neil Diamond can't be faulted too much I certainly can fault Sir Laurence Olivier! At times he's not bad. But at other times it's like he's on something....some drug that makes him either THINK he's playing the same guy he played in THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL or that prevents him from recognizing that he was awful. While this might offend a lot of Olivier fans however it must be said that late in his career he appeared in anything...provided the check cleared. And his acting to put it bluntly was terrible and hammy an apropos word for this film.However despite these two major deficits the biggest problem actually isn't with any of the actors. The writing to put it nicely is poo. Yes folks...poo. The film is laced with clichs and dialog that couldn't help but make the actors look like dopes. My theory is that the producer's cat wrote the screenplay...a very very dumb cat at that.But although I've said a lot of harsh things about this film I must add that the songs were not bad and made the film passable...at times. Painful but not abysmally bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE KING OF JAZZ Universal 1930 directed by John Murray Anderson is the fourth and final of Hollywood's all star musical revues during the 192930 season and ranks the most impressive of the four outdoing MGM's THE Hollywood REVUE OF 1929 1929 Warners THE SHOW OF SHOWS 1929 and PARAMOUNT ON PARADE 1930. Filmed in early twostrip Technicolor it is fortunate to have survived after all these years with color footage intact since most color footage used during the early sound films mostly musicals are either lost or exist today solely in black and white. The titled character goes to bandleader Paul Whiteman in his feature movie debut but THE KING OF JAZZ is remembered today only as the motion picture debut of Bing Crosby who in reality mainly appears as part of the Rhythm Boys in a couple of musical skits.Virtually plot less the revue opens with Crosby's offscreen vocalizing of Music Hath Charms during the opening credits. This is followed by Charles Irwin standing in as master of ceremonies. After introducing himself he goes on to tell and show how Paul Whiteman became crown The King of Jazz. A cartoon segment follows compliments of Walter Lantz the creator of Woody Woodpecker which shows Whiteman himself hunting in darkest Africa being chased by a lion. After a merry chase Whiteman sooths the savage beast by playing music with his violin to the tune Music Hath Charms. After an elephant squirts water through its trunk on a monkey up a tree the angry monkey throws a coconut towards the elephant which in turn hits Whiteman instead. The bump on his head thus forms into a crown. Then comes the introduction of th Paul Whiteman Band who present themselves by playing individual tunes with their instruments. Production numbers and comedy skits follow. The most striking numbers are The Bridal Veil which ends with costumed brides carrying the biggest veil ever made which covers the entire flight of stairs the ten minute spectacle of Whiteman conducting his orchestra to George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue and the Happy Feet number sung by The Sisters G which has chorus girls descending onto a largescale miniature of New York City highlighted by the eccentric rubberlegged dancing of Al Norman which should be seen to be believed!Other songs presented include The Lord Delivered Daniel sung by the cartoonish Paul Whiteman Mississippi Mud and So the Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together both sung by The Rhythm Boys Bing Crosby Harry Barris and Al Rinker It Happened in Monterey sung by John Boles Oh How I Would Like to Own a Fish Store sung by Jack White A Bench in the Park sung by Glenn Tryon and Laura LaPlante The Brox Sisters and the Rhythm Boys Ragamuffin Romeo sung by Jeanie Lang I Like to Do Things for You sung by Jeanie Lang to Paul Whiteman Grace Hayes and William Kent danced by Tommy Atkins Sextette with Nell O'Day Has Anyone Here Seen Nellie? sung by Churchill Ross John Arledge Frank Leslie and Walter Brennan with his wriggling ear The Song of the Dawn sung by John Boles and the finale The Melting Pot Medley. Brief comedy skits include THE DAILY MEOW with Laura LaPlante Jeanie Lang Merna Kennedy Grace Hayes and Kathryn Crawford IN CONFERENCE with Glenn Tryon Laura LaPlante and Merna Kennedy SPRING TIME with Slim Summerville Yola d'Avril and Walter Brennan ALL NOISY ON THE EASTERN FRONT with Yola d'Avril Slim Summerville Walter Brennan others FOREVER MORE with William Kent as the drunk and Walter Brennan as the butler the risqu A MEETING WITH FATHER with Slim Summerville meeting his future fatherinlaw Otis Harlan and how he feels about her wait for the punchline and wonder how that got past the censors and much more. There's also Joe Venito playing his wild violin to the tune Pop Goes the Weasal.Unseen in many years THE KING OF JAZZ was presented on television during the early years of cable TV circa 1984 and later that year distributed on video cassette compliments of MCAUniversal with its excellent clear copy which makes it worth purchasing and having as a part of a movie lover's collection. For a while THE KING OF JAZZ did enjoy frequent revivals on American Movie Classics in the early 1990s.The biggest surprise about this revue is that it was released by Universal the studio not known for lavish musicals yet coming out with the best of its kind. Aside from lavishness it's quite advanced especially with its camera techniques which remains impressive even today. The comedy skits might seem out of date but are just a reminder as to what vaudeville was like and the humor that made its audiences chuckle way back when. Even similar comedy skits of long ago are still being used today especially by standup comics or on current TV sitcoms which try to make old material fresh and original. One final note the special effects. Although not a first in early sound cinema the early portion of the film where Paul Whiteman introduces his orchestra by opening his suitcase from which many tiny musicians emerge in front of the lifesize face of Whiteman as he watches from behind then growing to normal size is quite impressive considering the time frame this was made. Remember this wasn't done by computers as it would be today.THE KING OF JAZZ has many bonuses to impress a firsttime viewer. The production gets better with each passing comedy skit and musical numbers. Like its predecessors it predates the bygone era of TV's variety shows. And for diehard Bing Crosby fans even if the famous crooner doesn't have enough footage to call this movie his own there's enough entertainment here by others to go around.".

In The King of Jazz he also shows himself to be a decent comic actor as well. He's best remembered for his recording of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue which is featured in this early revue film.King of Jazz is solid entertainment with some lavish and grandscale production numbers that boast Bing Crosby John Boles Laura LaPlante the Brox Sisters Jeanie Lang and of course Whiteman's band.Best songs are Happy Feet A Bench in the Park The Song of the Dawn and a jazzy Bluebirds and Blackbirds number with Crosby as one of the Rhythm Boys with Harry Barris and Al Rinker.Al Norman does an amazing dance number to Happy Feet. Jeanette Loff is rather bland in the bridal veil number. The Sisters G in their Louise Brooks hairdos are OK in their dance numbers. And there's a lot of short comedy bits that feature Walter Brennan Slim Summerville Grace Hayes Merna Kennedy William Kent and others.Although I still prefer The Hollywood Revue of 1929 this revue is also excellent in its use of lavish production numbers color and special effects.

	schema:headline " Truly the oddest of the early sound revues";
	schema:reviewBody "1930's King of Jazz is the strangest and most surreal of the early sound cycle of movie studio revues. Very few films shot completely in twostrip Technicolor survive  this is one of them. Warner Bros. probably made the most allTechnicolor films in the early sound era but since most of them were Vitaphone the films have long since been lost in most cases.The 1929 and 1930 early sound revues were made by the studios primarily to showcase their talent in an alltalking setting. MGM's Hollywood Revue of 1929 started the cycle and did a pretty good job. However other studios lost sight of the goal and the revues that followed were often clumsily put together and didn't even showcase talent that belonged to the studio.The King of Jazz is a surprise not only because it holds up so well with time but because it is such a nontypical product for Universal Studios of that era. Universal of the 20's and 30's mainly made westerns for rural moviegoers with an occasional prestige picture and they were beginning to dabble in the horror genre for which the studio is most remembered. However at this time they were also known for their thrift which went out the window when they made this film. The film starts out with a cartoon showing how Paul Whiteman  who called himself The King of Jazz  discovered Jazz. What follows are a sequence of musical and comedy routines. This film doesn't make the mistake of trying to sew the numbers together with some maudlin backstage melodrama. It simply presents the numbers in sequence. Most of the talent here is not under longterm contract to Universal. Laura LaPlante is one of the rare exceptions to that rule. The musical numbers are a delight and it is great to see Bing Crosby at the very beginning of his career. The Brox Sisters light up this film just as they did MGM's revue with Singin in the Rain. The whole thing is so lively and done with with such innovation and energy considering the static camera of the early talkie era that I can't believe Universal has never thought to put this on DVD. They made this one great musical and didn't really make another one until 1936's Showboat.My favorite number is Song of the Dawn featuring handsome John Boles with his piercing eyes in close up during most of the number belting out a song with that wonderful tenor voice of his. The most memorable number though has got to be Happy Feet with dancing shoes and the Sisters G as singing heads in a shoebox. This number also has the aptly named Al Rubber Legs Norman showing us the moon dance 28 years before Michael Jackson was even born. Highly recommended for the fun of it all.".

From the perspective of today the glaring omission is that the American Negro influence is not given any acknowledgement whatever. In the melting pot scene at the end the American Negro influence is glaring conspicuous by its absence. Although there is certainly a European influence in American jazz music it is less of an influence than African music or  don't forget  Mexican music. But the film was of its time and at that time the Amrican Negro playing jazz was not officially referred to and it would be some time before black artists could be spoken of as musical heroes. Funnily enough Paul Whiteman's star singer Bing Crosby who appears in this film with the Rhythmn Boys would have a huge role to play here by his collaborations with black artists like the Mills Brothers. In spite of all this we must regard this film in the context of the period it was made regret the Negro omissions and enjoy the film for its own sake.Other impressive acts are the trick violinist playing Pop Goes the Weasel bel canto singer John Boles and that amazing rubberlegged dancer Al Norman. Eat your heart out John TravoltaAlthough I was not born till a quarter of a century after the release of this film I cannot but help a feeling of nostalgia. We will certainly never see the like of these acts again. But for this film the magic of Boles and Norman and the Whiteman orchestra would be gone for good.".

	schema:reviewBody "The King Of Jazz 1930 is a wonderful example of just what the movies could do in the late 20's early 30's if they put their mind to it. The technical achievement is extremely high for a film of this period and one wonders at how cinema audiences of 1930 must have been amazed by this picture. It is photographed in a system called Two Strip Technicolor. Full 3strip Technicolor would not be invented until 1932. The 2strip Technicolor system managed to capture Red and Green but not blue. To get around this they would use dyes that were a kind of orangered and aquamarinegreen to trick audiences into thinking there was blue on screen.In this movie the Rhapsody in Blue number is very convincing.There is no plot to The King Of Jazz it is just one mammoth musical number after another and that adds to its unique charm. My three favourite numbers are Ragamuffin Romeo It Happened In Monterey and My Bridal Veil.The Bridal Veil number utilizes one of the biggest indoor sets I have ever seen. A lot of money was spent on this picture and it shows. The Bridal Veil itself looks to be about 100 feet long and the bride needs about 40 bridesmaids to help hold it up.The print that is currently in circulation of The King Of Jazz is sadly not in 100 excellent condition. It seems to be made up of pristine sections of print and battered and scratched dupes. Its a real patchwork version that is probably in need of some restoration work. The title sequence with vocals over the titles by Bing Crosby singing Music Hath Charms is very clear and in good shape but then halfway through cuts to an extremely battered dupe copy? The same occurrence happens during the It Happened In Monterey number and also Bench In The Park we are given a beautiful print with rich colours and rock steady picture stability only to cut variously to scratched beaten dupes. I cannot understand why certain sections of the film were preserved but others were not. I am eagerly awaiting the DVD release of this unique and wonderful film and hope it wont be too long before it gets its well deserved release. There don't seem to be any plans as yet and the only way to see this movie is on television or VHS. This is a true lost opportunity to DVD producers because the film has many wonderful Bing Crosby numbers in it and would be very popular with Bing's fans.".

You will see firsthand why Paul Whiteman was truly The King of Jazz some absolute jazz immortals are in his 40piece orchestra see a few breathtaking moments of Joe VenutiEddie Land doing Wildcat.  And the Rhythm Boys! And the Brox Sisters!  And the original jazz version of Rhapsody in Blue with the entire 40piece orchestra inside a giant blue piano!

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this film I was amazed at some parts and extremely disappointed at others. To be sure the comedy acts are absolutely abysmal. Audiences in 1930 didn't find them any funnier than audiences today so don't feel too bad about hating them. Also a lot of the vocalists are grating and painful to listen to. Of course the parts where the film really shines are the parts that feature the magnificent Paul Whiteman orchestra. This band has been unfairly maligned because although Paul Whiteman was titled The King of Jazz his orchestra was not a jazz band per se. But man were they ever good musicians! Just get a load of the Meet the Boys segment towards the beginning...Harry Goldfield doing his best Henry Busse impersonation Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang playing Wildcat in one of their few film appearances the entire violin section playing a lovely rendition of Caprice Viennois Chester Hazlett and Roy Bargy doing a pretty rendition of Nola followed by Wilbur Hall's trombone virtuosity display on the same number. And let's not forget little Mike Pingitore on Linger Awhile!Oh yes and did I mention it has Bing Crosby's first appearance in a feature film? He's with the Rhythm Boys and man those guys are HOT! Just get a load of them on Happy Feet. And check out eccentric dancer Al Norman if you want to see something really crazy.Last but not least I would like to mention Wilbur Hall's wonderful trick violin act and might I add the most unique rendition of a Sousa march you'll ever hear in your lifetime. You haven't heard The Stars and Stripes Forever until you've heard it on a bicycle pump!Go get yourself a copy and have fun!".

	schema:headline " A masterpiece! One of the very best early musicals";
	schema:reviewBody "Universal spent over a year making this movie  Paul Whiteman's band set forth for Hollywood on a chartered train called the Old Gold Special in January 1929 Old Gold Cigarettes sponsored his CBS radio program and arrived ready to work only to find that no one at Universal had bothered to come up with a script. Seven months later he headed himself and his band back to New York after telling the suits at Universal he wasn't coming back until there was a finished script and the film was ready to shoot. During the standdown Whiteman lost the best musician he ever had Bix Beiderbecke to Bix's chronic alcoholism and Universal lost the originally assigned director Paul Fejos when he had a nervous breakdown while shooting another film. By the time Whiteman returned the Great Depression had hit the Zeitgeist had changed and the American people weren't in the mood for lavish musicals anymore. So King of Jazz became a legendary boxoffice flop.It's a fate the movie didn't deserve though there are a few scenes in which director John Murray Anderson falls back on the typical longshots of chorus lines that make them look like ants on a wedding cake for the most part his direction is vividly imaginative fully the equal of what Busby Berkeley was doing on his first film Whoopee another allcolor musical being filmed at the same time. Anderson gives us numbers from overhead from side angles and uses the swooping camera movements of the socalled 'Broadway' Crane invented by cinematographer Hal Mohr and director Paul Fejos for Universal's 1929 film of the hit musical Broadway to deliver dazzling images and splendors to delight the eye and avoid the static quality of many of the early musicals. Anderson had come to Hollywood from his experience directing most of the Ziegfeld Follies on stage and running an acting school that trained Bette Davis and Lucille Ball and for this film he was given virtually unprecedented authority. King of Jazz should have been his ticket to a major film career but instead after its failure he retreated to the stage and only worked on two more films the 1944 Esther Williams vehicle Bathing Beauty for which he staged the incredible final number often misattributed to Berkeley! and Cecil B. DeMille's circus drama The Greatest Show on Earth 1953. It's a crime against culture that Anderson wasn't given the job of directing The Great Ziegfeld 1936 since he knew Ziegfeld's style indeed had helped create it and he knew how to make a movie an Andersondirected Great Ziegfeld could have been a masterpiece instead of the ponderous bore redeemed only by the acting of William Powell and Myrna Loy MGM and hack director Robert Z. Leonard actually gave us.King of Jazz was one of the handful of revues a Broadway term for a musical with no plot filmed in 1929 and 1930 including MGM's Hollywood Revue of 1929 Warner Bros.' The Show of Shows Fox's Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and Paramount's Paramount on Parade. There was also a British version Elstree Calling in which the framing scenes showing actor Gordon Harker tuning in variety performers on an early TV were directed by Alfred Hitchcock who didn't think the assignment was important enough to put the film on his official rsum. But King of Jazz is better than all of them even though Universal's list of contract players was far less illustrious than those of their majorstudio competitors the biggest names in this movie who weren't part of Whiteman's organization were Laura LaPlante and John Boles. It helps that the comedy scenes between the big musical numbers are kept to a minimum and are short genuinely funny and surprisingly racy for a 1930 film. The only thing that badly dates this movie and led me to rate it 9 instead of 10 are the unfunny and badly dated novelty songs including Oh How I'd Love to Own a Fish Store Has Anybody Here Seen Nellie? and Wilbur Hall's performance of Stars and Stripes Forever on a bicycle pump.King of Jazz is a towering musical masterpiece rivaled only by Whoopee at the top of the heap for pre42nd Street musicals. The Lubitsch and Mamoulian films for Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald are in a separate category altogether. The film is a tribute to the genius of its director John Murray Anderson though the one Academy Award it won was for its art director Herman Rosse probably the first individual ever to win an Oscar for an allcolor film. King of Jazz is a music that will dazzle you with spectacular moment after spectacular moment including the Rhapsody in Blue sequence that along with the New York Rhapsody sequence in the 1931 film Delicious does more justice to George Gershwin's music than any sequence using it until the 1951 ballet in An American in Paris.".

	schema:reviewBody "They called Paul Whiteman the King of Jazz  only real enthusiasts knew he wasn't. He was big in every way and by 1922 was making a million a year and it was only natural that when movies found their voice Hollywood would beckon. That was Universal in 1929 Carl Laemmle was seeking a headliner band for a big budget musical. The Whiteman Special train bringing the band including Bix Biederbecke who unfortunately didn't make it on film from New York to Hollywood was highly publicized with public appearances at every stop but the story writers couldn't come up with a story so the band who had sat around idle for months temporarily went back to New York.Whiteman then suggested hiring John Murray Anderson whose spectacular New York revues had made him Ziegfeld's closest rival and his futuristic and inventive influence made him the real star of the movie. There are so many tantalizing stories  Bing Crosby was all set to be the lead singer with the songs It Happened in Monterey and Song of the Dawn a dazzler sang with a cowboy chorus handed to him but he was involved in a drink driving incident in which he was sentenced to 60 days which was converted to a 40 day furlough but still saw the songs handed to John Boles who vocally was much better suited with his fruity tones. Years later in a documentary Crosby felt Boles carried the songs far better than he could have. Another story involved Jeannie Lang whose Helen Kane rendition of Ragamuffin Romeo and I Like to Do Things For You had preview critics raving but she had already been cut out of the soon to be released movie so editors had to quickly splice her back.The film begins with Bing Crosby singing Music Has Charms over the credits one song that Crosby retained and after an animated cartoon the first in colour showing how Whiteman became King of Jazz he steps out to introduce his boys  there's Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang playing a marvellous duet and a startling shadow looming down on banjoist Mike Pingitore as he strums Linger Awhile. Then it's the girls turn and the marvellous Rockettes dressed in spangley peach and silver go into a precision formation dance and show why they became legends.Colour lends such a beauty to the Bridal Veil number with gorgeous displays of bridal gowns through the ages. Jeanette Loff with the longest bridal train ever looks as pretty as peaches and cream and sings very prettily too. Next are the fabulous Rhythm Boys who come out of the shadows of Mississippi Mud to sing a super super special kind of production Harry Barris's words of When the Blue Birds and the Black Birds Get Together. Bing's sense of humour and comic timing is so spot on even though he was still only one of the Rhythm Boys. A Bench in the Park features Stanley Smith and Loff as a pair of lovers joined in harmony by the Brox Sisters accompanied by the Rhythm Boys then the girls get together for a dance that was obviously the inspiration for Pettin' in the Park. Rhapsody in Blue is just awesome initially showing Jacques Cartier in a futuristic setting beating out rhythms on a huge drum. This sequence was supposed to have cost 500000 with a huge centrepiece of a gigantic blue grand piano the Paul Whiteman Orchestra inside dancing girls on top of the keys a kaleidoscopic effect of dazzling blue feathers and flowers. WOW!!Where do you start with Happy Feet  from a pair of dancing shoes the Rhythm Boys giving it their unique interpretation with plenty of piano banging the Sisters G are shown singing with their heads reflected against a shiny silver surface below  very psychedelic they then give an all too brief but spirited dance then the Rockettes dance out of a New York skyline to do another precision tap then Al Rubberlegs Norman takes centre stage to do another of his dazzling eccentric rubberlegs routine!! and lastly Paul Whiteman or his double has a go at a vigorous Charleston. Ragamuffin Romeo is another eccentric dance with Marion Stattler whose gymnastics have her being thrown around like a rag doll.The Melting Pot of Music is almost too much with a succession of sounds and images dances and countries strangely no mention of the African American which then blended into the finale. Interspersed throughout the film were comedy hot spots but unlike other reviews of the time they were short snappy and not labored and with the clear print you were able to recognise the stars Laura La Plante etc. Another reviewer mentioned a preference to Hollywood Revue of 1929 but I'm sorry for me there is no comparison. This was a true spectacle enhanced greatly by colour and showcasing legends of the music world to say nothing of Paul Whiteman's ease in front of the camera the other just relied on movie stars out of their comfort zones being able to bring in a curious public.Highly Recommended.".

Radio was in its infancy and Paul Whiteman's band was the first orchestra to achieve popularity through that medium. Whiteman records were the biggest sellers of their time. And The King of Jazz was his auspicious debut in motion pictures.The King of Jazz was also how Whiteman billed himself. He was maybe taking a bit much on to himself with that one he surely didn't have anything to do with the development of jazz as an art form. But he did help a great deal to popularize it with a wider white audience. That was primarily done with that famous jazz concert that Whiteman gave in the mid twenties where George Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue made its debut. And Rhapsody is reprised here in the movie.Whiteman's greatest contribution may have been the training of the greatest group of musicians ever. At one time or other the Dorsey Brothers Benny Goodman Bix Biederbecke and so many others were members of the Whiteman orchestra. And of course he was the very first band to hire a vocalist specifically for that role. Previously singers were just musicians who just stopped playing and sang a chorus or two. Whiteman hired a trio the Rhythm Boys whose lead singer was Bing Crosby. They are prominent in the film and in fact Bing Crosby made his singing film debut here over the opening credits as he sang Music Hath Charms. He was Whiteman's biggest discovery.The film is just a musical review done in the style of some of the great musical reviews of the time like the Ziegfeld Follies Earl Carroll's Vanities George White's Scandals. Some of the acts are better than others but's The King of Jazz encapsulates a great era in show business.The biggest song from the film was It Happened in Monterey sung by John Boles who was Universal's biggest musical star at that point. Boles also got to do the film's finale The Song of the Dawn when Crosby who was guzzling a little too much bathtub gin got himself arrested and missed doing the finale which he was scheduled for.Shortly after recording some of the songs from The King of Jazz the Rhythm Boys left Whiteman and broke up soon after that. Bing Crosby would be heard from again.For a wonderful piece of nostalgia and filmed in early technicolor at that as an added treat you can't beat The King of Jazz.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been fascinated by and mesmerised whenever watching the King of Jazz and I'm glad to see I'm not alone. I wanted to check whether a DVD remastered or not has been released yet as I taped my copy off TV in 1987 and am in danger of wearing it out. The copy I've got would need some heavy visual remastering too! Although ironically the sound quality generally was good and the lipsync nearly always spoton. A good 2nd feature on a DVD release would be the UK's lesser copy from 1930 Elstree Calling.I'm glad most everything good and bad appears to have been commented on  especially by lugonian! I love the music throughout and some of the visuals costumes and sets are dazzlingly striking even today  but it really is a rollercoaster ride for the viewer with so much crap to wade through as well. The music andor the acting can change from good to bad impressive to cloying realistic to embarrassing sublime to ridiculous and back again in a couple of seconds. All subjective however!

I wanted to check whether a DVD remastered or not has been released yet as I taped my copy off TV in 1987 and am in danger of wearing it out. The copy I've got would need some heavy visual remastering too! Although ironically the sound quality generally was good and the lipsync nearly always spoton. A good 2nd feature on a DVD release would be the UK's lesser copy from 1930 Elstree Calling.I'm glad most everything good and bad appears to have been commented on  especially by lugonian! I love the music throughout and some of the visuals costumes and sets are dazzlingly striking even today  but it really is a rollercoaster ride for the viewer with so much crap to wade through as well. The music andor the acting can change from good to bad impressive to cloying realistic to embarrassing sublime to ridiculous and back again in a couple of seconds. All subjective however!

He was not an actor and so the film is given over to actors and other entertainers. The accent here is on 'entertainer' as this movie is festooned with lots and lots of them. Ever see Bing Crosby with his real hair? Ever see the Radio City Rockettes thunderthighed in the late 20's? Ever see George Gershwin in a movie? How about vaudevillian Al Norman with his rubberlegged dancing? It's all here in a nonstop revue of old and almostforgotten songs and dance numbers there are 18 in all interspersed with blackouts and comedy skits. Plus it's in color sort of  actually it's primitive 2 strip color. I could go on and on but if you are a hardcore movie fan or a film historian King Of Jazz is for you. The jokes are stale the singers still trilled their 'R's and the gowns in the bridal number are so out of style they are probably coming back. The overall effect was both sheer delight and visually overwhelming and I wished it would never end. It is available only on VHS and hasn't been seen on TV in years.

Comedy acts are corny and quaint. The big production numbers were lavish and very new some seemed experimental and fresh.

But you can tell Whiteman and his band was quite the powerhouse when you see this 1930 film and put it in perspective compared to other Hollywood films from the same year. First very very few films had any color in them in 1930 and when they did have TwoColor Technicolor it was used for only a few minutes at a timesuch as for big production numbers. Yet amazingly this film is in Two Color Technicolor for the entire moviea very very expensive proposition! Second the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish and look amazing. The bridalstyle dresses in one of the numbers is just eyepopping! Third the cinematography and sound are state of the art. Watching the tiny people climbing out of the handbag is STILL a technically amazing scene...and for 1930 it's really astonishing. As far as the story goes there is none. The film consists of one production number after another as well as a few comedy sketches and animations. This isn't a complaint...but it also makes it one of the most unusual films of all time. It's not really a musical in a traditional sensemore a record of a bygone era and acts. Some of the skits or musical numbers are pretty dated and haven't aged too well some are still impressive. In many ways this film is more something for film historians than the average viewer. Fortunately the National Film Preservation Board recognized this as well and a pristine or at least as close to pristine as possible copy is being held by them for posterity. Well worth seeing and really NOT a film I could easily score. It's a wonderful artifact but might be tough viewing for some viewers.".

Fortunately the National Film Preservation Board recognized this as well and a pristine or at least as close to pristine as possible copy is being held by them for posterity. Well worth seeing and really NOT a film I could easily score. It's a wonderful artifact but might be tough viewing for some viewers.";

	schema:reviewBody "Back in the 1920s and 30s Paul Whiteman was a hugely popular big band leader...so big that the term 'King of Jazz' was created to describe him. Not surprisingly this is also the title of this 1930 film as it essentially is an entire film featuring the Whiteman orchestra and a bunch of mostly unfunny short comedy skits.What immediately strikes you with this film is the TwoColor Technicolor. While it's obviously not full color it is a decent early color process and looks very nice in the recently restored movie. This means that colors tend to be rather orangy and greenishblue...but compared to other TwoColor films I've seen this one is very nice.Since the film is essentially a talent show it's hard to really rate the thing. I noticed one reviewer preferred the Hollywood Revue of 1929 though I thought King of Jazz was a better film. I particularly enjoyed a few of the acts such as the very limber guy who seemed to have arms and legs made of rubber his dancing was incredible the enormous 'giant' ladies walking about the streets of New York Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue' written for Whiteman as well as the strange violinist with the enormous shoes....you just have to see them to believe them. You also get a couple chances to see Bing Crosby before he hit the big time as he was one of three 'Rhythm Boys' who worked for Whiteman.Apart from the acts the film shows some incredibly complicated and amazing footage...due to some neat camera tricks inventive camera angles and some very artistic cinematography. It really is an amazingly beautiful picture...even though some of the production numbers did drag on a bit and the humor was mostly unwelcome. Well worth seeing...particularly if you are a fan of early cinema...though nonbuffs might find it slow going and dated.".

Every comic interlude no. Nonetheless I still think Mordaunt's definitely on the right wave length This sparkling extravaganza reveals John Murray Anderson to be a magician of far greater powers than one imagined even from his stage compositions.

	schema:headline " The most enthralling musical biography of all time  you ain't heard nothin' yet!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Jolson Story must be one of the most outstanding musical biographies to ever come out of Hollywood with a multitude of unforgettable popular songs luxuriant colour photography and a noteworthy performance by Larry Parks in his most accomplished role as Al Jolson. The stunning Evelyn Keyes sparkled as Julie Benson and the eminent William Demarest was entertainer Steve Martin later Jolson's manager. Give that boy a spotlight!!. Ludwig Donath and Tamara Shayne were an inspired choice as Jolson's parents Papa Asa isn't Asa any more!. Bill Goodwin was Jolson's close friend and singer Tom Baron later theatrical impresario and talented Scotty Beckett gave an appealing performance playing Jolson as a boy. William Demarest had also appeared with Al Jolson years earlier in The Jazz Singer 1927 so it is intriguing to speculate whether they reminisced about that during the production of The Jolson Story. William Demarest received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his part in The Jolson Story but was beaten by Harold Russell for The Best Years of Our Lives. Larry Parks was also nominated as Best Actor but lost to Fredric March again for The Best Years of Our Lives.  As some small consolation the film did win Oscars for the Best Musical Score and the Best Sound Recording. For some obscure reason it wasn't even nominated for the best picture award much to my surprise.The film has an absorbing storyline even though it is not entirely accurate and it does take some liberties with the facts. Jolson's mother died when he was eight years old yet in the film she lives on to see him become a big success on Broadway. Many people who played active parts in Jolson's real life story did not even get a mention in the film version. His long time manager Louis Epstein his dresservalet Frank Holmes and his brother Harry were all eliminated from the plot!  The character Steve Martin played by William Demarest did not actually exist and it has been suggested that this role was probably a composite of the three men referred to above plus several other people. Jolson's first two wives were not even mentioned and Ruby Keeler Jolson's third wife would not allow her name to be used in the picture so ravishing Evelyn Keyes had to play the fictitious Julie Benson instead. Ziegfeld This is Julie Benson  the star of my next production Show Girl. Jolson Mr Ziegfeld you will please not advertise on my time!.Harry Cohn the notorious head of Columbia Pictures is to be congratulated for going ahead with this film when all the other major studios had turned it down. Even Warner Bros. for whom Jolson had starred in several films were not interested.  Filming was started on a small budget and in black and white. However when Harry Cohn saw the early rushes he decided to film in colour and make The Jolson Story a major prestigious production.  This certainly paid off for him in a big way as the film became one of Columbia Pictures top money earners.  Jolson desperately wanted to play the leading role himself and was opposed to another actor portraying his life. Unfortunately at that stage in his career he was obviously too old he was 60 but the studio could not have found anyone better than the young Larry Parks 31 who perfectly captured the Jolson style and threw himself into the part with relish.  However Jolson did manage to play himself in one scene singing Swanee on the Winter Garden runway all filmed in longshot with no closeups. When I saw The Jolson Story for the first time it had a major impact on my life and for weeks afterwards I was quoting lines from the film that had stuck in my mind such as these from Jolson to Julie Benson Broadway ha what a street you know something baby  it belongs to me. You know something else if you want it I'll give it to you!The musical numbers were absolutely magnificent and with popular songs like California Here I Come You Made Me Love You Toot Toot Tootsie April Showers Robert E. Lee Liza Mammy Liza About a Quarter to Nine I'm Sitting on Top of the World and Rockabye Your Baby how could it miss! If there is one film I could take to a desert island it would have to be The Jolson Story as I never tire of seeing repeated showings of this timeless classic.  As Jolson himself would have said Settle back folks you ain't heard nothin' yet! and he would be right about that. 1010. Clive Roberts.".

Unfortunately at that stage in his career he was obviously too old he was 60 but the studio could not have found anyone better than the young Larry Parks 31 who perfectly captured the Jolson style and threw himself into the part with relish.  However Jolson did manage to play himself in one scene singing Swanee on the Winter Garden runway all filmed in longshot with no closeups. When I saw The Jolson Story for the first time it had a major impact on my life and for weeks afterwards I was quoting lines from the film that had stuck in my mind such as these from Jolson to Julie Benson Broadway ha what a street you know something baby  it belongs to me. You know something else if you want it I'll give it to you!The musical numbers were absolutely magnificent and with popular songs like California Here I Come You Made Me Love You Toot Toot Tootsie April Showers Robert E. Lee Liza Mammy Liza About a Quarter to Nine I'm Sitting on Top of the World and Rockabye Your Baby how could it miss! If there is one film I could take to a desert island it would have to be The Jolson Story as I never tire of seeing repeated showings of this timeless classic.  As Jolson himself would have said Settle back folks you ain't heard nothin' yet! and he would be right about that. 1010. Clive Roberts.";

	schema:reviewBody "THE JOLSON STORY Columbia 1946 directed by Alfred E. Green is a nostalgic tribute to the world's greatest entertainer Al Jolson the man who loved to sing as portrayed by Larry Parks covering his life and career from the turn of the century to about 1940.This Technicolor production opens in Washington DC at the turn of the century where a young teenage boy named Asa Yoelson Scotty Beckett and his girlfriend Ann Murray Ann E. Todd are seated in the audience at Kernan's Burlesque House watching Steve Martin William Demarest doing his comedy act. He asks for the audience to sing along as he plays his cello but it is Asa who's the only one brave enough to stand up and start singing. Amazed by this young lad's natural talent Martin locates Asa's home asking permission of his parents Cantor and Mrs. Yoelson Ludwig Donath and Tamara Shayne to have him as part of his act. Papa Yoelson says no to the idea and feels that the only place where his son should be singing is not in a theater but in a Synagogue. Respecting the Cantor's wishes Martin leaves for his tour. However Asa leaves home hopping on a freight car to find Martin ending up in the residence of a Catholic Church run by a Father McGee Ernest Cossart. Learning about the boy's background and purpose the priest sends for both Steve and the Yoelsons who arrive to find Asa singing in the choir. Not wanting Asa to be constantly running away from home Mama Yoelson's convinces Papa to have their boy pursue his dream. Years pass. The act of Martin and Yoelson prove successful. Because Asa now Al Jolson wants to advance himself it is Steve who breaks up the act by sending him over to perform in Lew Dockstader's John Alexander minstrels. With Steve's help once more he arranges for Al to start his long and successful career at the Winter Garden on Broadway with former blackface singer and friend Tom Baron Bill Goodwin acting as manager. Jolson who has never forgotten Steve hires him as his agent. Now the biggest name in show business Al Jolson's career takes a turn to success starring in the first talking picture THE JAZZ SINGER his courtship with Florenz Ziegfeld's Eddie Kane latest attraction Julie Benson Evelyn Keyes star of the musical show LIZA their marriage screen careers and finally retirement to the country. Problems arise as Julie learns she's competing with a fulltime husband who would rather be a fulltime entertainer.The success of THE JOLSON STORY may not necessarily rely on the plot or its leading stars but mainly the songs long associated with Al Jolson throughout his years in show business. The songs used for this production include Let Me Sing and I'm Happy On the Banks of the Wabash The Sabbath Prayer traditional Jewish prayer Franz Schubert's Ave Maria When You Were Sweet Sixteen After the Ball By the Light of the Silvery Moon Goodbye My Blue Belle Ma Blushin' Rosie I Want a Girl Just Like the Girl That Married Dear Old Dad Mammy I'm Sitting on Top of the World You Made Me Love You Swanee TootToot Tootsie Goodbye The Spaniard Who Blightened My Life April Showers California Here I Come Liza There's a Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder Latin from Manhattan Avalon About a Quarter to Nine The Anniversary Song Waiting For the Robert E. Lee Rockabye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody and April Showers. Trivia The Swanee number is actually performed by the real Al Jolson in long shot not Larry Parks. As a musical THE JOLSON STORY is grand entertainment. As a biography it plays too much with the facts adding inaccuracies to the screenplay. For example a scene where preview audiences attend THE JAZZ SINGER 1927 hearing Jolson singing There's a Rainbow Round My Shoulder that was actually introduced in his second movie THE SINGING FOOL 1928. Or one where Julie Benson based on Ruby Keeler in her movie debut 42nd STREET 1933 performing a dance number Latin From Manhattan that was really introduced in her latter musical GO INTO YOUR DANCE 1935. One fact the writers got right is that Jolson and Benson aka Keeler collaborated on screen in GO INTO YOUR DANCE and the number About a Quarter to Nine that accompanies the film is true to life. Other titles involving Benson's career SHIPMATES FOREVER DAMES and GOLD DIGGERS are used in the montage but not presented in the order of their release. The costumes and hairstyles acquired by Evelyn Keyes and other actresses are strictly 1946 modern not fitting into the period for which it is set. The same can be said for the orchestration sounding more like the BigBandera than 1920s or 30s. Larry Park's lip sync recording of Jolson's voice is deeper and softer than the recording of decades ago. Parks a Columbia contract player since 1941 earned him an Academy Award nomination. So successful was THE JOLSON STORY that Al Jolson then a forgotten entertainer was rediscovered again winning the admiration and charm of a new and younger audience.THE JOLSON STORY as it stands fully deserves its place in motion picture history as one of the finest and most entertaining biopics ever produced.Thanks to cable television's Turner Classic Movies where THE JOLSON STORY premiered November 13 2006 the Jolson legend can be seen and rediscovered again along with the original Al Jolson musicals produced at Warner Brothers period 19271936 especially his best known and historical film THE JAZZ SINGER. THE JOLSON STORY available on video cassette and DVD formats formerly presented on the Disney Channel in the mid 1990s and occasionally on other commercial free cable channels is pleasing both to the eye as well as to the ear.

What I thought was going to be average monaural sound turned out to be fantastic stereo surround sound with the original singing voice of Al Jolson coming across magnificently ..... and all long before Dolby this and Dolby that. I later read somewhere that the stereo treatment may have resulted from a rerelease of the film in the 1950's. All I can say is it sounded great and deserved its Oscar win for Best Sound. The color cinematography also deserved its nomination from the Academy. All in all great acting and story development even if not completely accurate as a biography. I had only seen Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer but Larry Parks seems to have pulled off the mannerisms quite well and exuberantly too. Watching this interesting film makes it very clear why Al Jolson was so well loved and admired as an entertainer throughout the world. Every young person should see this film in order to appreciate what came before in the world of musical entertainment  from minstrel shows to vaudeville and the advent of the talkies.The superb musical numbers A Quarter To Nine and She's A Latin From Manhattan were actually in the 1935 film Go Into Your Dance in which Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler starred together. To my astonishment that film is not available on DVD yet but apparently can be seen on cable TV via Turner Classic Movies. It would be really interesting to see how close the musical numbers in The Jolson Story copied the original treatments in Go Into Your Dance.The Jolson Story seems to end suddenly and rather unexpectedly and I felt the director and screenwriter should have added a bit more emotion and drama to the climax of having Julie Benson as Ruby Keeler walking out on Al Jolson. You have the feeling that you want the film to continue at that point rather than end. This was perhaps planned that way. The sequel Jolson Sings Again is also an excellent film.".

The Film doesn't attempt to factually explore his life although we do get a chance to see some truths of the relationship with his real life wife Ruby Keeler who in the Movie was known as Julie Benson played by Evelyn Keys. Interesting to note was the fact that Columbia Pictures who released the Movie failed to give Warner Bros.the Film company responsible for giving Jolson the role in The Jazz Singer any recognition whatsoever presenting further evidence of the Producer's and Jolson's desire to give us some entertainment as opposed to a lesson in history. And entertained we are as Larry Parks with his unbelievable miming to Jolson's songs......apart from a cameo from Jolson singing Swanee....takes us from Vaudeville days in the twenties with all Jolson's great songs and routines to his semi retirement in the thirties.

I don't knowThe sets lighting and photography are wonderful because they are used to tell the story rather than draw attention to themselves. Casting is perfect. Larry Parks as Jolson is excellent as he brings enthusiasm and verve to the role. His singing gestures are right on. In terms of content Jolson's bold style influenced many performers in his own time and to this day. His popularity lasted many many years. Jolson's use of blackface make up was a convention of its time but he appeared to hold onto it long after his fame would have allowed him to drop it. Despite that I happen to like Jolson's songs and style and the producers wisely used Jolson's own voice on the music tracks. Apparently liberties were taken with some of the facts of Jolson's life in this movie bio but the essence of the story is true. It was and is a very entertaining film that did big box office and is still being sold and rented today on VHS and DVD. For young people who want a time capsule of show business in the first half of the last century this is a must see movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Al Jolson along with Frank Sinatra were perhaps the two greatest singerentertainers of the 20th Century. This film made in 1946 was both the launching pad and ball and chain for Larry Parks. His performance was so good it earned him an Academy Award nomination. He spent countless hours perfecting the Jolson mannerisms and lipsyncing the songs that the great Jolson recorded for the movie. Unfortunately he became so typecast in the role that his reprise of the role in the sequel in 1949 was his only other claim to fame. That and his admission and subsequent subliminal blacklist from Hollywood for being a member of the Communist Party between 19411951 stopped his career before it ever really had a chance to bloom.My father had me watch this movie as a kid on Million Dollar Movie and I was taken by the personality drive energy and talent of this great entertainer. Hearing about and seeing silent movies made me all the more in awe of the talent Jolson must have been since Hollywood banked it's future on talkies with The Jazz Singer.Besides Parks excellent performances are also put in by William Demerest who many of us remember as Uncle Charlie in My Three Sons Evelyn Keyes as Julie Benson Jolson's first wife and the rest of the cast. The 1949 making of Jolson Sings Again is also worthwhile if for no other reason than watching Parks do the masterful lipsync and the incredible vocals of Jolson.".

Unfortunately he became so typecast in the role that his reprise of the role in the sequel in 1949 was his only other claim to fame. That and his admission and subsequent subliminal blacklist from Hollywood for being a member of the Communist Party between 19411951 stopped his career before it ever really had a chance to bloom.My father had me watch this movie as a kid on Million Dollar Movie and I was taken by the personality drive energy and talent of this great entertainer. Hearing about and seeing silent movies made me all the more in awe of the talent Jolson must have been since Hollywood banked it's future on talkies with The Jazz Singer.Besides Parks excellent performances are also put in by William Demerest who many of us remember as Uncle Charlie in My Three Sons Evelyn Keyes as Julie Benson Jolson's first wife and the rest of the cast. The 1949 making of Jolson Sings Again is also worthwhile if for no other reason than watching Parks do the masterful lipsync and the incredible vocals of Jolson.";

	schema:headline " Great movie about a true show business icon";
	schema:reviewBody "Al Jolson can be considered to show business what Babe Ruth is to baseball Hank Williams to country music Jordan to basketball Gretzsky to hockey  in a field with many prominent and great figures over many decades still the one individual who stands at the top among his peers. Although he was far from the altruistic person portrayed here this doesn't diminish his greatness. Neither do the fictionalized aspects of the story which stretch the facts well beyond the normally wide boundaries common to biographical pictures especially from the 1930's through the depression and WW II years into the '50's. For example the William Demarest character is an obvious composite of others with whom Jolson appeared early in his career  his brother never even hinted in the story and other partners before he joined Dockstader's minstrel show. In actuality his mother died when he was eight  several years before the time period where this story begins and yet she is a key character in the film commenting upon advising and to a degree influencing some of Al's decision process  even when he is an adult. And the Evelyn Keyes character Julie but actually Ruby Keeler was hardly his first love as indicated by the movie but his third wife they married when he was nearing his mid40's and she had just turned 19 and after not during his shooting The Jazz Singer. In this film William Demarest now his manager advises him to have some fun as if he didn't even date for concentrating so much on just performing  which in actuality would have been a period in his life when he was well into his second marriage or even after it might have ended. A friend of mine who while not famous has starred with his wife as an entertainer in Branson and other venues appeared in movies and television and is an avid member of The Jolson Society heard a story from someone who at one time had been in the Jolson entourage. Far from eschewing feminine company for love of only performing as indicated in the film Jolson is said to have often engaged the companionship of a couple of showgirls in his dressing room to help him relax prior to a performance. He also said that Ruby Keeler had indicated the accuratelyportrayed scene of his rising from the audience to sing during her show was not simply a loving charitable act. Rather it was a reflection of Al's extremely immense ego and his desire for the spotlight to be on him as much as possible. And the shows he headlined on Sundays largely for other entertainers of Broadway weren't solely the benevolent act portrayed here. He supposedly often engaged in banter from the stage pointingout to those assembled the contrast between his level of success and theirs and the like. Finally the movie indicates Julie's absolute desire completely to retire while Jolson is depicted as doing so to accommodate this strong obsessivelyportrayed need on her part. Actually at this time in real life Ruby Keeler was barely 30 and with a far busier career than his. In addition to the movie depicting this contrary to fact even the way this fiction is shown is somewhat silly. He wants to stay home as usual and strongly indicates this near the film's close. But the Bill Goodwin Broadway producer character visiting their secluded home and even Jolson's parents insist on going to a night club. Then when he reluctantly accedes to the emcee's request to sing and gets caughtup in once again performing onstage after a supposedly long lapse of years Julie summarily walks out while he's singing  and then later at the outset in the sequel even his father chides him about it clearly indicating the blame is his alone. But ... all these fictional histrionics aside this movie is a great work about the most iconic of entertainers. The music is marvelous  and the sequel 3years later unique among Hollywood biopics is an outstanding continuation beginning precisely where this original leaves off. Many have criticized this shorter followup as being inferior to the original. I would characterize it as great also  perhaps just not quite as great and recommend one view both pictures in tandem. Give both 10 stars this original would be 10 .".

Glossy production values a great cast a script that whitewashes the true Jolson character but still has enough bearing on reality to make it an interesting bio.

The Cantor and his wife reluctantly give in and there son is handed over to William Demarest to get his start in show Buisness. William Demarest not only becomes his manager friend and the only one who can keep pace with the fast roller coaster life that Jolsen felt he had to live. Larry Parks plays the young Jolson who mimes Jolson's songs to perfection. The hand movement and the actions aren't as energetic as Jolson was in real life but you cannot imagine anyone else playing the lead role. Jolson has a cameo role as he sings swanie and runs down the run way you have to be quick to spot him but you can't help but reconise the old master. Evelyn Keys does a good job as portraying Jolsons wife Julie. Julie realises he is a workaholic and says If ever he wants to sing more than he wants to be with me  their marriage would be over. Julie realises this when at the end of the movie he goes to a night club and sings one song for old time sake. That is when she realises what he was missing at home were the faces. So she walks out. this movie is loosely based on Jolsons life. He had more than one wife and could be a rogue when he chosed to be but that is something you don't even think about when you watch this movie. When they made  Jolson sings again they did a very rare thing which is seldom done when a sequel is made. They picked up where the first Jolson movie left of. In this movie you got to know more about the man how he was the first entertainer to go overseas to entertain the troops even though his style of singing was long gone as other entertainers such as Bing Crosby etc pushed him from the charts. If you watch The Jolson Story you always have the urge to watch the sequel  Jolson sings Again as it is the same cast playing tribute to one of the best entertainers who ever lived. The Jolson story revived Al Jolson's career.".

Every time Parks plays Jolson singing all is forgiven. In the opening scene in which Scotty Beckett plays young Jolson I am always stunned at the beauty of that singing voice. Does anyone know whose voice it was? Was it Scotty's? I am disappointed at criticism of this movie on the issue of Al Jolson's performing in black face. It is a historical fact that he did it and to attempt to write it out of history is not helpful to anyone. The fact that this movie was presented after World War II and was a resounding hit is evidence I believe that it is the music and the way it was performed and not the black face that people loved.

Bruce Willis lookalike Larry Parks performs admirably even with Jolson's real voice Lina Lamont style and some clever makeup big rouged bottom lip and pop eyes does enough to outline Jolson's look to put the part over. Othe comments here will tell you the ridiculous mistakes and glossing over of real events and other people all to condense his chatterbox career into a containable 2 hours. For me the silliest section was the transition from stage to talkies thru The Jazz Singer and Ruby Keeler's rise as a musical star. Here she is called Julie Benson  Ruby would'nt play ball for this pic and somehow it goes from 1927 and The Jazz Singer premiere straight to 42nd St 1933 as if it is the next day. One really stupid scene set in 1927 shows Broadway day and then night... with the Empire State Building in the distance! It wasn't built and opened until 1932! Yeesh. And this pic was made in ' 46. How bad did Columbia's front office expect the awareness of the audience to be! It muddles songs from the later Keeler pics into Keeler's '42ND ST' and then somehow mashes it all together and jumps straight to about 1940. Mom and Pop Jolson are treated with the usual simpleton ethnic manner food! food ! MUMMA food! that tormented Italians in the Marx Bros films. The production is really that star and Columbia certainly presented a handsome art direction effort if incredibly mangled storyline. A massive hit in its day it spawned a great sequel in 1949 JOLSON SINGS AGAIN. Warner Bros reissued their 1935 KeelerJolson musical GO INTO YOUR DANCE in 1946 cashing in on the wake of this Columbia mega success.... maybe also as payback for mangling the mid section of The Jolson Story and their real years at Warners making musicals like DAMES and DANCE. .... GO INTO YOUR DANCE actually a great 30s musical and deserves a DVD reissue of its own.. It is better than a lot of other 30s musicals and with a really beautiful score and terrific dance numbers..... Anyway in the early 50s poor Larry was harangued in the HUAC hearings that grinded many Hollywood careers to a halt. The pic did get a widescreen reissue and a stereo bump... then shelved.. However amazingly in the late 60s after Columbia won the Best Pic Oscar for OLIVER in 1968 and then more Oscars again in 1969 for FUNNY GIRL there were big plans to reissue THE JOLSON STORY now amped up to 70mm and widescreen like GWTW at the time and 6 track stereo. I actually saw trailers for this 'coming attraction' in cinemascope here in Sydney in 1969 and it was all a big deal.... until it never happened. I am assuming it is these excellent stereo soundtrack separations that allow the DVD to be so audibly fantastic as I hear it tonight. Also the color original Technicolor is gorgeous. It is also very easy to get sick of Jolson... as poor Ruby did in real life and after their divorce refused every to speak of him again for as long as he lived. Jolson died in 1950. Ruby about 1990.".

	schema:reviewBody "To his credit innovative singer Al Jolson did indeed transform the tone of American pop songs in the early part of the twentieth century. He was quite a showman with his natural improv skills and that pleasantly unique singing voice.But this biography is only quasifactual. If you knew nothing about the man before watching the film you would be hard pressed to figure out that some parts are fictional. The Jolson Story is chock full of inaccuracies. For one thing his mother died when he was young in this film she plays a major role throughout his life. For another Steve Martin a major character in the film never existed. And his marriage to Julie Benson cinematically rewrites his real life. In fact there never was a Julie Benson. There were indeed three wives not just one as implied in this film. Maybe back in the 1940s films could get away with such misrepresentations. Sixty years later viewers are not so easily fooled.I have no idea what the real Jolson was like as a person. In the film he comes across as ambitious energetic creative and irritatingly ... hyper. Larry Parks gives a fine portrayal of Jolson with his highly animated and expressive mannerisms and gestures.The film's tone is relentlessly positive and upbeat. The impression is thus conveyed that all one needs for Hollywood success is ambition lucky breaks and lots of talent. And maybe that's true. But nearly all great public figures must endure at least minimal hard times somewhere in their lives. I could have wished for some indication of that in this film to make the story more realistic and the man more human.For all that The Jolson Story is still entertaining in an oldfashioned sort of way. There are some great old songs like April Showers RockABye Your Baby and my personal favorite California Here I Come. Color cinematography is quite good and includes some clever camera dissolves. In support roles both William Demarest and Evelyn Keyes are fine. I did not care for the film's ending with one character's motivational reversal.This is a big budget talky film with lavish production design and a large cast. If one approaches The Jolson Story with the idea that it is fun entertainment only and not to be taken too literally it can be enjoyable. But it would be a mistake to use the film as a basis for taking an allimportant pop quiz. For that one would need a more accurate biographical guide.".

There are some great old songs like April Showers RockABye Your Baby and my personal favorite California Here I Come. Color cinematography is quite good and includes some clever camera dissolves. In support roles both William Demarest and Evelyn Keyes are fine. I did not care for the film's ending with one character's motivational reversal.This is a big budget talky film with lavish production design and a large cast. If one approaches The Jolson Story with the idea that it is fun entertainment only and not to be taken too literally it can be enjoyable. But it would be a mistake to use the film as a basis for taking an allimportant pop quiz. For that one would need a more accurate biographical guide.";

The Romanianborn greasy ballad singer with a certain pseudorock and macho image who is a big music star in Germany for 35 years now tried a step into the movies with this German crime movie from 1987.Maffay plays Jan Bogdan a police detective in Hamburg who becomes seriously hurt during a bomb attack in a restaurant by a brutal killer gang. His good friend has been killed and Bogdan is bound to the wheelchair now. Filled with anger and thirst for revenge he quits the police and kills his opponents one by one until he finds the heads of the gang... of course there's a good buddy involved too and a welllooking darkhaired seduction that both guys are falling in love with some corrupt policemen conspiracies brutal henchmen with black gloves assassinations killings showdowns etc.The direction of crime movie veteran Peter Patzak is well done but shows some boring lengths in the middle of the plot. The script combines elements of seventies crime action with hardboiled detective stories revenge dramas Italian giallos and mafia movies and of course a lot of bad 80's hard rock ballads... the cast is fine with Tahnee Welch as the sexy girlfriend and first class actors like Armin MuellerStahl Michael York and Elliot Gould all of them playing bad guys here.Only the choice of Peter Maffay was a big misstep as his range of acting is limited to the face expressions of a goldfish. Bearing his never changing forced macho style all the time and especially listening to his bad way of stumbling his dialogues together is a pure pain in the ass! Fortunately for moviegoes Maffay returned only once again on the screens  except for some cameos  in the clicheladden adventure drama Verschollen im Jemen Missing in Yemen in 1999 directed by Patzak too.Some more details for movie buffs  the bad soundtrack consisting of greasy digital keyboard tunes and bad 80's Scorpions style hard rock ballads was composed by Maffay and former Rainbow keyboard player Tony Carey who had a short musical career in Germany 20 years ago. Production assistant Otto Retzer later became the director of the cheesy soap opera Ein Schloss am Woerthersee and several bmovie adventures such as the strange Der schwarze Fluch. A nice movie for Maffay worshippers but not the big jewel to discover for crime genre and film retro fans.".

For me it is really difficult to decide what was the worst about this film Maffay's performance or the screenplay. Both aspects are majorly disappointing. The funniest thing is probably how they keep trying to show us Maffay's wheelchair bound main character as the ultimate crimesolving badass who kicks every criminal's ass despite his disability. It's really really cringeworthy combined with Maffay's complete lack of range. Admittedly his supporting cast here was almost as bad and the soundtrack is an embarrassment too. Not even fans of Maffay's music career 8and there are really many can say seriously that he or this film he is in here have any quality whatsoever. Next year it will have its 30th anniversary and this movie is a glorious example of what happens when a lone wolf badass crime movie goes wrong. I highly recommend you to stay far far away. It is so generic also with the female characters who have absolutely no impact at all and are 100 stereotypical. Not recommended. Disastruous film.".

Of course this soon makes him a target and Bogdan loses both his ability to walk and his police license in a bombattack. Sitting in a wheelchair Bogdan is still toughasnails and seeks revenge on his own  seemingly aided by the mysterious assassin Dr. Proper Michael York whereby the word seemingly plays a huge role in the world of crime.I'd go as far as to call Der Joker a paradox of its own making First let's talk about the good things the supporting cast is altogether great. Albeit all just having minor roles actors like Armin MllerStahl Michael York a highlight in this film Elliot Gould Monika Bleibtreu or Karl Merkatz beloved by Austrian viewers as Mundl all rattle their stuff down as professionally as is required. The soundtrack yes it is cheesier than a Swiss fondue produced by exRainbow keyboardplayer Tony Carey and Maffay himself but at the same time catches the 'vibe' of the 80's stuck solidly in SoftRockballads and tons of hairspray.Maffay is of course the centerfigure of the whole film. The Romanian born musician is best known for composing schmaltzy Popsongs and his socialengagement regarding children during the 80s and 90s. Maffay may be many things but an actor he is not. The opposite is true. It's almost painful to see him try to mimic and pose through the film almost like watching a toddler trying to crawl across a busy highway. If you want to sum up Maffays facial expression in one word the first word that comes to mind is congested and seeing him try to press out his dialog raises no other sentiment than that of Schadenfreude. Yet Maffay stoically struts through his stuff as if trying to emulate Sylvester Stallone in his early roles which naturally fails as well presumably while his more professional costars were trying to suppress hysterical gigging. Raquel Welchdaughter Tahnee doesn't fare much better she may have inherited the looks of her mother but literally none of her actingskills.Patzak a veteran of AustroGerman TV is doing a job as competent as you'd expect from the director. He'll forever be known as director of the Austrian cultseries Kottan ermittelt an anarchistic parody of German TVcrimeseries. However Patzak himself never seems quite sure whether he wanted to produce an actionfilled USflick a la Stallone's Nighthawks an equally actionfilled variation of the Schimanski Tatort TVfilms or a tribute to the Italian Poliziotteschigenre. There are strong elements of all three genres which may not be the most imaginative but makes Der Joker great fun nevertheless  if you're into those movies that is. Needless to say that Der Joker despite all his flaws or perhaps because of them? has his cultfollowing and is on his own ground rather recommendable.

With its multiple world wars mutants and robot assassins A Boy And His Dog is superficially science fiction but only in the service of aspiring to a level of satire a la A Clockwork Orange or Slaughterhouse Five.Phoenix Arizona 2024 AD nomadic huntergatherers roam the radioactive wastelands ravaged by World War Four. Libidinous Vic has managed to survive his eighteen years as a Solo thanks largely to the aide of his far more intelligent  not to mention telepathic  companion Blood a Rover who searches out supplies women and enemies and provides the requisite witty repartee. A postnuke buddy pic? Well of sortsyou see while most viewers will recognize recentlybankrupt Nash Bridges star Don Johnson as the very young solo fewer will realize that Blood is portrayed by the same veteran who managed to avoid being stereotyped as Tiger on The Brady Bunch. That's right Rovers are intelligent telepathic dogs bred for warfare. If you're thinking of tuning outdon't because this film has a lot to offer beyond an outrageous premise. When Blood sniffs out a disguised Quilla June Susanne Benton at a desert camp Vic is surprised that he won't have to force her to be his evening's bedmate. Fleeing scavengers and the dangerous Screamers nocturnal mutants who roam the deserts Quilla June convinces Vic to join her in her subterranean home Topeka leaving Blood behind. Quilla June's father and leader of The Committee Lou Craddock Jason Robards sent her above ground to lure Vic into impregnating Topeka's women and offers the boy all of the perks of this bizarre Our Town meets Body Snatchers hamlet. But Vic finds out that his stud service will be extremely brief if he doesn't play by the rules and after escaping The Committee's robotic enforcer he finds loyal Blood on the brink of death awaiting his return. Luckily Quilla June has tagged along and will provide a restorative service that reinforces Vic's worldview that the only true love is the one between a boy and his dog...Produced in the days when indie typically meant exploitation A Boy And His Dog was a guerilla project for several Hollywood veterans who craved to do something different outside of The System. Ellison had turned down big studio offers from Warners and Universal and instead handed over screen rights to L.Q. Jones who had best been known as a stuntman and still appears to this day in such fare as The Edge and Walker Texas Ranger to write and direct. The late Alvy Moore of television's Green Acres produced the film and appeared as Robard's accomplice Dr. Moore. Tim McIntyre provided the voice of Blood and composed the music. Ellison wasn't happy with the Topeka sequences and blamed his own story for their shortcomings and was even less pleased with the film's final spoken line a morbid pun penned by Jones. He offered to reloop the dialogue out of his own pocket but audiences loved the line. Despite Ellison's protests the film impressed his peers enough for them to award it the 1976 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Fourthtime director Jones displays such a gifted eye for widescreen compositions and maximizing limited resources and propels the story forward so breezily with witty voiceovers and bouncy acoustic score that it's amazing that he's never directed another film. The assured depiction of difficult character Blood is a true revelation as voiced by McIntyre reading dialogue more or less verbatim from Ellison's prose the shaggy Rover ranks as one of the most believable and threedimensional nonhuman screen charactersever. I never cried when Old Yeller got shot but I still get moisteyed when Blood and Vic part ways at the entrance to Topeka.A Boy And His Dog regularly shows up on most lists of the Top 10 Science Fiction Films Of All Time and I certainly rank it alongside another independent S.F. marvels like Dark Star and THX 1138. So do give the dog a chance after all Tiger won the 1975 Patsy Award for his performance g The Region 1 DVD contains audio commentary from L.Q. Jones and two trailers the promised liner notes are nowhere in evidence in my version. But be warned purists worse than the shoddy packaging and frequent misspellings Harlen Ellison? is the print itself marred by emulsion scratches dirt and missing frames throughout. Still the cheap price and the sad fact that this is the only version fans have to choose from until someone like Blue Underground comes to the rescue makes this disc a Must Have.".

	schema:reviewBody "Damned if I know what gravitated LQ Jones to Harlan Ellison's novella of the title let alone to adapt it into a film. A veteran character actor he's the one for better or worse for me the better responsible for A Boy and His Dog a story that takes place after World War 4 nevermind 3 where a young guy and his dog whom he can understand ala Dr Doolittle roams the desert fighting off wild savage men and looking for food and women. But there's more than just this premise there's also the other side to this barren wasteland which by the way served as inspiration for the Mad Max series. There's also the down under where a society that's a cross between puritanical Kansas dubbed Topeka and a Fellini movie is sterilized and needs fresh seed to repopulate its people. Where the ones living up above are brutal beings who can't give a damn about anything aside from what's next to eat or who's next to have their 'way' with and the occasional projected porn movie the ones below have created a fed up enclave where a robot bodyguard chokes anything in his path. Sounds um... peachy keen don't it? A Boy and His Dog is as surprising an effort that has ever come into the genre where imagination is pushed to its most cynical rotten roots where a wealth of pitch black comedy awaits those who have no problem with the repore between a slightly dim dude and a dog who seems to be part comic relief part 'getyourheadoutofyourass' voice of reason. Indeed there could be something else read into all of this wackiness if taking Freud into account there's almost a superego aspect to the dog where Vic Don Johnson only hears and talks with Blood yes a dog named Blood who Vic trusts beyond all reason while the boy himself is like a version of the Id out for survival but also out for his carnal needs no matter what the price. It's also very smart that Jones doesn't explain anything about the dog's abilities if it is meant to be that he and the dog can really talk to another. Damned if I would take a convoluted explanation anyway all the funnier. In fact Blood as voiced with a perfect sardonic yet also rather touching style by Tim McIntire is probably the character the audience can identify with like the NevilleSam bond in I Am Legend given a twist out of a Robert Crumb comic.And all the while Jones makes this a future that looks lived in a wasteland with leftover parts and clothes and production design full of boiler rooms and dark halls and places left untreated for years AND in the 'down under' scenes a kind of plastic smalltown look that is probably even more eerie than the one up above. For what should be just an outrageous Bmovie is a lot smarter than one would ever think looking at the premise. The dialog is invigorating in how it stays truthful while also aiming for the bizarre and as with the most cringeworthy of satire i.e. the scenes with Jason Robards and the 'committee' things said with a straight face and deadly serious always garner up huge laughs. Yet there's also an intelligence to the filmmaking as well. This could have looked cheaply made and shot poorly like many a Bmovie but Jones's DP John Arthur Morill gets some great strange compositions out of this 'after'world sometimes spotting better than average Johnson give facial expressions like he knows what's going on but doesn't all the same.It should be way too ridiculous to be taken seriously as a piece of legitimate cinema as some gonzo experiment that's dug up by cultists for tongueincheek purposes. But Jones's film is in its way a weird landmark a moment where the basic fronts of a 70s 'exploitation' flick action comedy randomness of the 70s nudity are put through the perspective of a filmmaker with brains and talent to make it stick in your mind as it presents its story through the prism of a society gone amock through two prisms both hells in one way or another though one not too arguably is a lot more fun than the other. Is it a Clockwork Orange or Blade Runner? Not quite. But I'd never kick it out of my collection if only for one of the truly classic end lines of any movie a bad pun that gives one more hysterical smack across the face.".

But Jones's film is in its way a weird landmark a moment where the basic fronts of a 70s 'exploitation' flick action comedy randomness of the 70s nudity are put through the perspective of a filmmaker with brains and talent to make it stick in your mind as it presents its story through the prism of a society gone amock through two prisms both hells in one way or another though one not too arguably is a lot more fun than the other. Is it a Clockwork Orange or Blade Runner? Not quite. But I'd never kick it out of my collection if only for one of the truly classic end lines of any movie a bad pun that gives one more hysterical smack across the face.";

It was reissued in the early 80s that's when I saw it with a totally different ad campaign. I understand why people are upset with the rape theme but this is a sciencefiction fantasydon't take this too seriously.The acting is good. Johnson was surprisingly dead perfect as Vic.

It's a unique product of the 70s as it's ambitious daring and warped in its mindset that makes this considerably lowbudget effort a hypnotic cult item that nothing else would even come close to it. Based upon a novel by Harlan Ellison the premise follows that of a young loner Vic splendidly performed by Don Johnson and his telepathic pooch Blood exceptionally voiced by Tim McIntire travelling the desert landscapes caused by the aftereffects of WWIV in the search of food shelter and women.What goes on to make this film is the biting conversations and budding rapport and dependable friendship between Vic and Blood. It ranged from hysterical to moving and surprisingly done in a believable manner. The satirical edge to the script is innovatively penned and to the point with its drama frictions and kinky fixations. Sometimes quite unpleasant in the details where a quirky side is etched and the humour is engraved with a morbid sense of curiosity. While slowgrinding the pace breezes by and the impulsively random nature helps a lot with a shock ending twisted but still quite touching though that comes from nowhere. Director LQ Jones' economical touch makes the most of it limited resources and manages to get plenty out of it despite the minor feel. His use of the camera provocatively achieved and the humming electronic score and playful acoustic cues cement an atmosphere and grow upon the imagination. Mainly consisting in the underground scenes than on the openly isolated and dusty desert backdrop.The support cast are pictureperfect in their roles. Susanne Benton shines and likes of Jason Robards Charles McGraw and Alvy Moore were good fun.I liked it even more the second time around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Surely those who were looking for nothing more than what Hollywood usually delivers when they invoke the words science fiction were disappointed because this movie resembles the usual horror or action film masquerading as scifi very little. Its source material is a novella by Harlan Ellison a writer who's recognized by many in the scifi community as a master on the same playing field of psychological scifi as Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick. From Ellison we get a very dark tale about a strangely human dog and his boy. They live in a postapocalyptic wasteland where Phoenix Arizona used to be and hunt women and food with the same predatory zeal. But when Vic or as the dog calls him Albert is lured into a surreal society living in a large bomb shelter their friendship is threatened and Vic is almost forced to become a sort of sexual machine for the good of the State.Just to run through some of the aspects of the film that I enjoyed I really liked Tim McIntire's voice work as the dog perfectly crisp like a cranky old man. How exactly the dog knows so much or is able to speak to Vic is never really explained but I think there's a clue in that Lou Jason Robards Jr. believes that Vic has spoken to a dog he encounters in the shelter. That along with the Committee's seeming obsession with recounting facts and figures almanacstyle makes me believe that the dog actually came from the shelter. Perhaps he was sent there to observe Vic as Lou tells him they have been doing for some time and he rebelled against their control. Like all good scifi the idea is vaguely proposed but never explained.Don Johnson did pretty good work here I mean it doesn't strike you as all that impressive at first but when you think about the fact that he had to do so many scenes with just this dog as his costar it's a pretty tough act to pull off as well as he did. Susanne Benton was decent in her role as well. I loved when she tried to sweettalk the dog basically the same way that she treated Vic. Vic seems confused about her intentions all the way up to the end which is excellent  if he had figured her out completely then the ending would just feel meanspirited instead of humorous. As it is it's as if Vic believes he's making a sacrifice but the dog knows better and turns it into a joke. By the way my girlfriend thought the last line was too tacky but I thought it was perfect it gave narrative closure to the film as well as filling in those who might not have understood the scene with the campfire.Honestly the only performance I wasn't crazy about was Jason Robards'. There's these great scenes he gets to play with Alvy Moore Green Acres and Helene Winston great laugh she's got... she didn't make a lot of movies but strangely enough just this week I saw her in Curtis Harrington's The Killing Kind. He just has no energy I guess that's the way he wanted to do it but it's annoying how he kind of mumbles through the dialog and I just didn't feel that the dialog was supposed to be quite that casual. Basically I just did not like the way he decided to play the character I didn't think it was scary at all. His android assistant like a twisted American Gothic is pretty strange though. Plus I never understood why everyone down there was wearing clown makeup. Was it the idea of the forced smile? Anyway I salute the film because I think it was a brave decision to make it as it is and not to try to turn it into a more conventional thing with romance or too much action. I think I can see some influence from this movie on George Miller's Road Warrior though I was told that he claims he hadn't seen it and definitely on Slip Stream with Mark Hamill from the 80s. But this isn't really the kind of movie that was made to fall into place inside the pantheon of scifi anyway. It's a closer relative to ElectraGlide in Blue and other films of the early 70s that explored the bitter end of hippie idealism the same trend that Hampton Fancher was trying to catch onto when he wrote his first drafts of the film that eventually became Blade Runner. Frankly I can't remember seeing another scifi film that is so close to the feel and ethos of the most transgressive and antiestablishment scifi of the 1960s.".

Sadly as of the year 2014 almost 40 years later the only copies you can find even the laughable Bluray HD release are in serious need of some restoration before audiences will give this film the respect it deserves. But considering its low profile appeal I highly doubt that'll happen in our lifetimes so grab it wherever you can.In the tradition of the great 70s dystopianpostapocalyptic scifis like Clockwork Orange 1971 Rollerball 1975 THX1138 1971 Soylent Green 1973 The Omega Man 1971 and I'll even throw in The Stepford Wives 1975 this movie has its appeal in a sort of minimalist presentation that presents a chillingly emotionless and sterile future. Where A Boy and His Dog excels is in its thick satirical tongueincheek presentation particularly in the 2nd half when our hero encounters the true future of human society or is it the present? You be the judge.The first half is something like Mr. Ed meets Mad Max with its equal portions of chatty humor and dusty violence. But right in the first scene we realize that despite the cute banter between boy  dog there aren't going to be many warm fuzzies. In the opening scene we learn that the boy Don Johnson is looking for female survivors so he can rape them.If you can swallow that highly disturbing premise which the director makes no bones in presenting at the outset then the rest should be an unsettlingly fun joyride all the way to the film's very memorable punchline. Things get really trippy in the 2nd half and even though there's minimal nudity certain things happen which would make D.H. Lawrence blush particularly involving a certain mechanical device attached to the male anatomy.Definitely NOT a date movie nor any sort of movie you'd watch with your parents or kids A Boy and His Dog is really like a lost cousin of A Clockwork Orange or Dr. Strangelove. Who ever would've thought that this sarcastic gem would come to light through the directing talents of L.Q. Jones the ubiquitous guest star on many a 70s TV show like Charlie's Angels Columbo Gunsmoke and Vega but whose only other directing credit is an episode of The Incredible Hulk one which I'm going to rewatch immediately.Unfortunately with the somewhat bland  grainy video quality of the existing print we don't get the full eyeboggling power of this film the way one could imagine it. But all the same it's an unusual vision which should proudly take its place amongst the other 70s masterpieces I mentioned. You can buy the Bluray for literally pennies on ebay so you have no excuse for not checking this out.".

	schema:headline " Silly pointles movie that suffers from poor direction";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is practically unwatchable. Save yourself some time and read the short story by Harlan Ellison of the same name. The short story is better. The movie suffers from terrible direction starting with the annoying Technicolor bomb blasts flashed on the screen at the introduction. Mostly the movie is about bands of rapists who fight with each other. A young Don Johnson plays a solo a rapist who wanders around by himself and he competes for victims with the rovers bands of nasty boys. The movie takes place in 2024 seventeen years after World War Four broke out in 2007. For some reason everyone in the movie still has canned food and ammo and tobacco to smoke. Go figure. I guess the bombs didn't hit all the WalMarts or something. Oh and did I mention that dogs can talk in the future? The movie is very poor at explaining this point there are telepathic dogs who can communicate intelligently with human beings. This is the main premise of the movie and the motivation for the final scene which the director totally fails to set up properly. The short story by Ellison explains it all better Ellison mentions that government researchers were able to genetically engineer attack dogs to fight alongside future soldiers. The dogs have a sixth sense and can detect other living things both human and animal. The dogs communicate this information telepathically to the human beings they work with and in many cases they have a higher IQ! This explains why Vic is always having psychic chats with his shaggy dog Blood who corrects his grammar. Blood is a direct descendant of the military research dogs and is the best of his breed.The beginning scene is a gratuitous rape scene derogatory towards women and completely pointless. Perhaps the director just wants to show how nobody in the postapocalyptic future has any morals. The protagonist Vic is upset that he doesn't get to rape anybody so he goes to a porn movie with his dog. His telepathic dog senses that one of the Solos in the audience is a woman dressed up as a man.Vic and Blood pursue the girl and have a big fight scene in an abandoned YMCA with a local team of Rovers who also want to rape the girl. Vic protects her from the rape gang and then gets it on with her in the boiler room of the YMCA basement.The girl is from a Downunder town. This is a small city built in an underground bomb shelter. She lures Vic to the downunder where Vic is captured by weird people wearing whiteface makeup. This wasn't in the short story it was purely an invention of the wacky director.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is practically unwatchable. Save yourself some time and read the short story by Harlan Ellison of the same name. The short story is better. The movie suffers from terrible direction starting with the annoying Technicolor bomb blasts flashed on the screen at the introduction. Mostly the movie is about bands of rapists who fight with each other. A young Don Johnson plays a solo a rapist who wanders around by himself and he competes for victims with the rovers bands of nasty boys. The movie takes place in 2024 seventeen years after World War Four broke out in 2007. For some reason everyone in the movie still has canned food and ammo and tobacco to smoke. Go figure. I guess the bombs didn't hit all the WalMarts or something. Oh and did I mention that dogs can talk in the future? The movie is very poor at explaining this point there are telepathic dogs who can communicate intelligently with human beings. This is the main premise of the movie and the motivation for the final scene which the director totally fails to set up properly. The short story by Ellison explains it all better Ellison mentions that government researchers were able to genetically engineer attack dogs to fight alongside future soldiers. The dogs have a sixth sense and can detect other living things both human and animal. The dogs communicate this information telepathically to the human beings they work with and in many cases they have a higher IQ! This explains why Vic is always having psychic chats with his shaggy dog Blood who corrects his grammar. Blood is a direct descendant of the military research dogs and is the best of his breed.The beginning scene is a gratuitous rape scene derogatory towards women and completely pointless. Perhaps the director just wants to show how nobody in the postapocalyptic future has any morals. The protagonist Vic is upset that he doesn't get to rape anybody so he goes to a porn movie with his dog. His telepathic dog senses that one of the Solos in the audience is a woman dressed up as a man.Vic and Blood pursue the girl and have a big fight scene in an abandoned YMCA with a local team of Rovers who also want to rape the girl. Vic protects her from the rape gang and then gets it on with her in the boiler room of the YMCA basement.The girl is from a Downunder town. This is a small city built in an underground bomb shelter. She lures Vic to the downunder where Vic is captured by weird people wearing whiteface makeup. This wasn't in the short story it was purely an invention of the wacky director. Jason Robards plays the mayor of the insane underground society where the town council sentences people to death by robot strangulation if they have a bad attitude. The town mayor explains to Vic that for some reason reproduction doesn't work underground and all the babies born are girls. They are trying a little breedingexperiment and they need someone from above ground Vic to be a stud for the town's ladyfolk.Vic decides that the whole town is just too crazy for him and escapes with the girl.

Don Johnson isn't horrible but he is definitely not at his best but the rest of the actors are very disappointing. The only thing this film really has to offer is the last scene and that only works for it's shock value.

Based on a short story by novelist Harlan Ellison the film belongs in the SciFi sub category of postapocalyptic movies but there's far more than meets the eye. The apocalyptic theme and the nuclear wasteland setting may perhaps come across as familiar but the character drawings and particularly the comical approach are something entirely unique and simply delicious! The year is 2024 World War IV  which only lasted five days  tore every form of civilization to pieces and whatever's left of the earth's population is licking its wounds. We follow the remarkable survivor Vic and his dog Blood with whom he has an unexplained telepathic connection. The duo spends the days prowling for food and pursuing female survivors in order to still Vic's sexual hunger. What makes the formula truly exceptional however is how Blood provides deeply cynical commentaries on everything they encounter and especially on Vic's sexual frustration. They do eventually spot a lonely female at a ramshackle adult theater but she turns out to be a mission to recruit fertile young man and lure them back to Down Under. This doesn't refer to Australia but to a middleearth lair where a strange and creepy collection of freaks with whitepainted clown faces managed to preserve some sort of community. Now they're dying out however and need sleazy Vic to impregnate their girls. A Boy and his Dog is bluntly divided into two main chapters one above ground and one underground. The odyssey through postapocalyptic landscapes isn't exactly original remember all those Last Man on Earth flicks including The Omega Man? but the wisecrack and darkly humorist interactions between Vic and Blood give a whole new ambiance to the concept. The second half taking place underground in the society called Topeka lacks the wittiness of Blood's dog persona but this gets more or less compensated by the sheer weirdness of the new characters and the genuinely unsettling atmosphere hanging over the underground society. The clown makeup is ghoulish and their leader  stupendous role of Jason Robards  is a menacing kind of dictator who sends all violators of the law to a place called The Farm whatever the hell that may be. A Boy and his Dog is a terrific film that I would recommend to every openminded fan of cult cinema. The only minor defaults are occasionally abrupt editing and a shortage of settings but you could easily blame the poor production values for this. The picture and sound quality look perhaps a bit dated but the ideas and the courageous elaboration is still extremely progressive and remains shocking even to this day. If you don't believe me just wait until you witness the outandout amazing end twist! Seriously if I wasn't sure already the ending would definitely convince me to interpret A Boy and his Dog as one of the biggest sleepermasterpieces of the 1970's.".

On the other hand it comes from a particular brand of eternal manboydom that resides so strongly in pretty much most male sentiments.... so like a postapocalyptic semiFreudian Judd Apatow movie from the 70s. For that reason I'd actually quite recommend it.The plot is slight but entertaining and escapist enough. A postWWIV world is covered in desert where men survive by basically digging up food from buried houses and bartering it. Of course as the system they live under is basically true anarchy most survival depends on one's handiness with a gun and women are truly rare goods measured by how many goes they have left. The boy and dog of the title are the titular characters of this apocalyptic drama two best friends that keep each other company and share talents for finding food and the next lay. Then a saucy young blonde comes along and threatens their friendship their freedom and even their lives by luring the boy down into the belowground a somewhat Brave New World totalitarian society where rules are made of pleasure happiness and gluttonyso that failure to smile itself can actually be a capital punishment crime. It's up to our intrepid hero to escape back to the kindly above world where one can get into a real fight over a can of beans and roll over in the dirt to get clean. In other words the backyard of the parents house the allboys club where girls are yucky and not allowed and faithful Blood to sniff out the next adventure.This is one of those cult classics that takes its concept and its small budget and runs with it creating in its grainy simplicity some of the best apocalyptic burntout imagery in science fiction. It's easy to see why it's such a cult classic and it's definitely worth catching at the local grindhouse theatre provided your town still has one and they happen to show this film. But as for what it ultimately stands for this probably isn't the greatest date movie unless you're one of those lucky bastards with a girlfriend with a wicked sense of humor because at the best that's what this movie has and in spades.PolarisDiB".

The plot itself is suitably dry often focusing more on character than any real form of storyline which admittedly hinders the film in some respect but makes it a very memorable one on the other hand. It's this decision which actually gives A Boy and his Dog an almost sentimental warmth even with its anarchic themes and dangerously misogynist tone.If you're looking for an original and completely honest look at a postapocalyptic civilization with realistically written characters this is the film for you.

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a treatment of the story of the Maccabees which Protestants and Jews don't even consider to be part of the Old Testament. But the movie is called the Old Testament probably for the same reason that one of the Italian actors has been dubbed John Heston and one of the actresses Susan Paget borrowing the surnames of actors familiar from the 1956 Ten Commandments movie. Nobody seems to have thought nor indeed does anyone to this day it seems that the Maccabees have wide commercial appeal. I don't think it's the Maccabees' story that dooms this movie though. It's the failure to imagine that story in terms of anything but playedout stereotypes from the supercilious villain and his fat greedy obsequious henchman to the Jew and pagan who like Ben Hur and Messala must discard their youthful friendship. Stereotyped female parts are also added to the story out of nowhere but the distortions don't add up to any serious misrepresentation of history. They just add up to a waste of time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Here's a treatment of the story of the Maccabees which Protestants and Jews don't even consider to be part of the Old Testament. But the movie is called the Old Testament probably for the same reason that one of the Italian actors has been dubbed John Heston and one of the actresses Susan Paget borrowing the surnames of actors familiar from the 1956 Ten Commandments movie. Nobody seems to have thought nor indeed does anyone to this day it seems that the Maccabees have wide commercial appeal. I don't think it's the Maccabees' story that dooms this movie though. It's the failure to imagine that story in terms of anything but playedout stereotypes from the supercilious villain and his fat greedy obsequious henchman to the Jew and pagan who like Ben Hur and Messala must discard their youthful friendship. Stereotyped female parts are also added to the story out of nowhere but the distortions don't add up to any serious misrepresentation of history. They just add up to a waste of time.";

The film is elegantly shot and under the cover of a war drama Hondo leaves traces of his caustic take on colonization as well. In an entertaining involving and medieval setting the film provides us great insights into the diversity of Africa the culture of its people and the bitter bloody truth hidden behind westernization. The army commander leads his army on destroying villages on the way using a black army from Sudan finally halting before the unity and resilience of Sarraounia's people. Eventually the soldiers declare mutiny refuse to further kill their own brothers and strike back in a vengeful way to teach the power drunk and insane commander a lesson. The music again is beautiful it was soothing to the ears. In layers this is a black comedy too a take on the superstitions of Africa a take on the power and glory addiction of the Frenchmen but not as well done or striking as Oh Sun.

	schema:reviewBody "The Best Man in a sense was dated before it ended its Broadway run of 520 performances in the 19601961 season. John F. Kennedy with his string of primary victories had the nomination almost decided before the Democrats met in Los Angeles that year to nominate him. After that money raised and spent wisely in primaries decided nominations in both parties long before the conventions met. The last convention where there was a semblance of a contest was the 1976 Republican convention where it was not certain until the balloting that Gerald R. Ford would be the GOP candidate. This film takes us back to the era of the smoke filled room although candidate Cliff Robertson pointedly tells former president Lee Tracy that he does not smoke. We've got two candidates at this fictional Democratic convention circa the sixties. One is Henry Fonda former Secretary of State an intellectual in politics modeled on Adlai E. Stevenson and Cliff Robertson a no nonsense street fighter of a U.S. Senator that Joe McCarthy was the prototype.By the way back in those days Joe McCarthy could easily have been a Democrat. Note that Robertson has the support of the lily white south in the era before the civil rights revolution. Minor candidate John Henry Faulk a southern governor is most concerned about mandated integration of his state's public schools. Back then the Dixie part of this country had a big influence in the Democratic party the Republicans were almost moribund in many southern states. But they were a growing force.Neither Fonda or Robertson really understands the motivations of the other. They're both courting the support of Lee Tracy a former Truman like president. In actual fact Truman counted for very little once he was out of the White House. He anointed no successor in 1952 and in 1956 and 1960 his candidates were W. Averill Harriman and Stuart Symington respectively and both came up very short.Fonda and Robertson both have dirt of varying degrees on the other. Fonda's dirt is supplied by former army buddy of Robertson's Shelley Berman who says that Robertson was gay. As it turns out Robertson ratted out a bunch of gay men in the service and got smeared in retaliation with the label. That sad to say has not changed even with don't ask don't tell in the Defense Department.Fonda and Robertson's roles on Broadway were played by Melvyn Douglas and Frank Lovejoy. Lee Tracy who was the only carry over from Broadway won a Tony Award and was nominated for an Oscar but lost to Peter Ustinov for Topkapi. Tracy's is a finely etched portrayal of a bitter old man now out of real power and seeing his power to control events slipping by. Made even more bitter by the fact that he reads the characters of Fonda and Robertson very well but can't influence either.Gore Vidal aided in the transition of his play to the screen and it survived the journey from Broadway none the worse for wear. It's a fascinating look at a bygone era of politics when the national conventions meant something as opposed to being the media shows they are today. In which we hope then as now that The Best Man will win out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gore Vidal was a TV fixture during the Vietnam War era using his wild wit to lay low conservatives such as William F. Buckley Jr. Vidal was also one of the most gifted and talented political playwrights of the period. The Best Man is one of his best works. Obviously Henry Fonda as Presidential hopeful William Russell represents the egghead Adlai Stevenson. Fonda even physically resembles Stevenson. Cliff Robertson as Presidential hopeful Joe Cantwell is a dead ringer for Richard Milhous Nixon. Ironically Robertson would use Hollywood politics to snatch the Oscar a few years later for Charly. There are several outstanding performances in this film. Fonda and Robertson have already been mentioned. Lee Tracy was deservedly nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance as former President Art Hockstader who controls the nomination process at the party's national convention until cancer brings him down. This picture represented somewhat of a comeback for Tracy. While filming Viva Villa! in Mexico a drunk Tracy urinated from a balcony onto the heads of Mexican soldiers parading below leading to an international incident. It gave a whole new meaning to raining on someone's parade. Tracy a truly distinguished actor himself died of cancer a few years after The Best Man was released. A few of the cast members noted for their comic talents give splendid dramatic readings. Shelley Berman plays a confused exsoldier who accuses Joe Cantwell of having done a degenerate act while serving with him in the Aleutian Islands. Ann Sothern has the role of a busy body who thinks she's a king maker. Sexy Edie Adams Ernie Kovac's widow appears as Joe's wife hoping to be the future First Lady. And the great John Henry Faulk who was blacklisted in the 50's because of persons like Joe fought and won plays a corn pone Southern politician.Don't miss the heavenly Mahalia Jackson perhaps the best gospel singer of the 20th century belting out an old spiritual at the opening of the convention. Her time on the screen is much too brief. Howard K. Smith doesn't have an acting problem since he plays himself but his appearance makes the convention seem more realistic. The entire cast makes a good showing. However Kevin McCarthy is virtually wasted in the thankless role of Russell's campaign manager.Gore Vidal writes with much wit and wisdom. There are subtle hints of humor from time to time that require the viewer's devout concentration. This is definitely not escapist type fare. The film analyzes American politics not just from the standpoint of 196064 but from the Republic's 200 plus year history. The revelations presented in The Best Man are just as true in the year 2006 and will be rerun to some extent during the Presidential conventions in the summer of 2008.The exPresident Art Hockstader refers to the results of the convention as putting a king in the castle a far cry from George Washington's views that being President was a civic duty. When asked if he should be called King Washington replied No Mr. President will do. We haven't had a Washington in the President's house since.".

Franklin Schaffner directs energetically and the film has an air of urgency to it that make it seem like it's saying something of great importance. It does have something to say and while I wouldn't call it trivial the movie and its writing is nowhere near as good as it's been cracked up to be. A good deal of one's appreciation of this film will depend on one's opinion of Gore Vidal's literary status. If one rates him as great the movie a splendid interpretation of his work and his ideas. But if one doesn't and I don't then it's a different kettle of fish. First to the movie.The story revolves around a power struggle that is going on behind the scenes at a national political party's convention it isn't made clear what the party is but one can safely assume it's the Democrats. Leading candidate for the presidential nomination William Russell is a former secretary of state intellectual writer of books deep thinker and liberal conscience. To anyone familiar with the period the character is obviously based on Adlai Stevenson. His chief opponent for the nomination Joe Cantwell is a somewhat younger man a ruthless opportunistic conservative more or less in the Nixon mould. What Nixon or someone like Nixon is doing seeking the Democratic nomination is never made clear but no matter. That bachelor Cantwell has a skeleton or two in his closet is indicated by rumors of his homosexuality. But Russell has his problems too womanizing an apparent nervous breakdown and worst of all for a politician indecisiveness. Both men seek the support of ailing former President Art Hockstader a pragmatic diamond in the rough politician of the old school and clearly based on Harry Truman who though he leans toward and agrees with liberal Russell has his doubts about him personally. He'd like to stop Cantwell from getting his party's nomination and isn't sure that Russell is the man to do it. A former officer in Cantwell's unit from the war is willing to squeal on him regarding the homosexual issue. Russell hears the man out and takes an instant dislike to him. He wants to stop Cantwell but not that badly. There is a confrontation between Russell and Cantwell. Russell equivocates. Expresident Hockstader is disgusted with him for not using the dirt on Cantwell and chaos ensues at the convention.This is a perfectly respectable play and movie and I have no problem with it except that its insight into people is skindeep. The actors are not to be blamed. Henry Fonda is appropriately dignified as Russell Lee Tracy in his last screen role is salty as Hockstader and Cliff Robertson is correctly onedimensional as the venal Cantwell. The outstanding supporting cast which includes Ann Sothern Kevin McCarthy and Gene Raymond is flawless. What Vidal has to say which is that politics is an often ugly business has been said before. He has nothing new to add but the sexual angle which is mildly interesting. There's little imagination in The Best Man. It's never inspired. The dialogue is adequate yet never brilliant and the characters credible without being dynamic. During the course of the film I felt like I was watching a reasonably wellthought out essay. It was never boring and often skillfully done and yet I was never drawn into it emotionally or cared for the people it was about. There's something lacking in Vidal here and in all his work. Maybe it's a contempt for humanity or maybe just a lack of caring. I find it hard to take anyone seriously who opines as often as Vidal does on a variety of issues who cares so little for the people those issues ultimately concern.".

	schema:headline " A Little Closer Look at an Important Thread";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie's a cynical look behindthescenes at American presidential politics. Conflicted idealist candidate Russell Fonda needs just a few more delegate votes to go over the top. But can he play the kind of political hardball necessary to get them. At the same time ruthless candidate Cantwell Robertson won't hesitate to throw dirt from the past to discredit him. Trouble is that Russell will have to lower himself to Cantwell's level to stave off the attack something that would injure his strong sense of character.Writer Vidal does a good job of dramatizing the conflict between ideals and practical politics. We all respect strong ideals so Russell comes off as the good guy conflicted but basically what we think presidents are supposed to be. What I like is Vidal's questioning of whether ideals are enough qualification for the highest office. That comes about through Cantwell's questioning of whether his opponent is decisive enough to be a commanderinchief. Of course Cantwell is nothing if not decisive he knows what he wants. On the other hand Russell wavers when confronted with a difficult choice. After all he's got many more norms than his rival to consider. However Cantwell points out that such wavering could be fatal for a chief executive in a dire situation. Of course this important point tends to get lost in the good guy  bad guy colorations between the two chief candidates. But the point is a telling one as it gets reflected in the movie's outcome when Russell disqualifies himself from candidacy.

	onyx:emotionText "The movie's a cynical look behindthescenes at American presidential politics. Conflicted idealist candidate Russell Fonda needs just a few more delegate votes to go over the top. But can he play the kind of political hardball necessary to get them. At the same time ruthless candidate Cantwell Robertson won't hesitate to throw dirt from the past to discredit him. Trouble is that Russell will have to lower himself to Cantwell's level to stave off the attack something that would injure his strong sense of character.Writer Vidal does a good job of dramatizing the conflict between ideals and practical politics. We all respect strong ideals so Russell comes off as the good guy conflicted but basically what we think presidents are supposed to be. What I like is Vidal's questioning of whether ideals are enough qualification for the highest office. That comes about through Cantwell's questioning of whether his opponent is decisive enough to be a commanderinchief. Of course Cantwell is nothing if not decisive he knows what he wants. On the other hand Russell wavers when confronted with a difficult choice. After all he's got many more norms than his rival to consider. However Cantwell points out that such wavering could be fatal for a chief executive in a dire situation. Of course this important point tends to get lost in the good guy  bad guy colorations between the two chief candidates. But the point is a telling one as it gets reflected in the movie's outcome when Russell disqualifies himself from candidacy. Note too that Cantwell is finally undone by the sheer drive that causes him to fatally misjudge Russell's character. After that the movie leaves off on a rather ambiguous note despite the symbolism of an upward bound escalator. As a result we're left wondering whether the best man has really won especially since Merwin the remaining candidate remains a cypher.Director Schaffner does an excellent job of capturing the hurlyburly of a nominating convention.

It is an important statement on what the public really deserves from its leaders and also what the public frequently ends up getting.The date of the events would be roughly 1968 or possibly 1972 as Joe Cantwell Clift Robertson's character served in World War II. The World War II Presidents lasted from General Eisenhower to George H. W. Bush but the youth of Cantwell limits his having a run after 1972. Cantwell as was pointed out in another review is based on Joe McCarthy although the candidates seem to be Democrats not Republicans. To be fair he is an amalgam of several figures Huey Long with Gene Raymond as a brother Earl  although Earl is made the older brother and Estes Kefauver the Tennessee Democratic Senator who fought the Mafia and ended up Stevenson's rival in 1956 and then his Vice Presidential runningmate. Cantwell has made a hardhitting reputation against communists and mobsters. But he does not care what methods he uses to achieve his goals. At one point one sees him strongarming delegates through blackmail.As was pointed out his rival William Russell is based on two time candidate and loser Adlai Stevenson. Russell actually has an even earlier lineage. His name is the same as Lord William Russell a 17th Century Whig liberal nobleman and political writer who was executed for treason in a questionable trial in 1683 in what was called the Rye House Plot supposedly against the life of King Charles II and his brother the Duke of York. Gore Vidal obviously chose the name to suggest a hopelessness in the man's ambitions from the start.Russell also turns out to have had a nervous breakdown of a quasiviolent nature that was covered up by the then President Art Hochstedter Lee Tracy. This is based on the tragedy in the Truman Administration of our first Secretary of Defence the brilliant James Forresthal who killed killed himself threw himself out of a window from a hospital he was being treated at in 1949. Russell in Vidal's fiction was Hochstedter's Secretary of State at the time of his breakdown.Cantwell has massive appeal to the group that Nixon would label the silent majority. He is one of them and he knows that they think the way he does. To achieve what they want they will do anything. He has a contempt for effete liberals like Russell. Russell who has written a book on his views of the world similar to Democrat  turned Republican  Wendell Wilkie loathes Cantwell and his strong arm methods. Russell is married his wife is played by Margaret Leighton. She resents his womanizing but like Eleanor Roosevelt admires the man  and will support him if he will refrain from humiliating her in the White House. Cantwell is a family man with children his wife is played by Edie Adams. He does compartmentalize homelife and political being but Adams also understands this.Cantwell is ready to spring the report his brother acquired of the nervous breakdown of Russell. But Russell's assistant Kevin McCarthy has found evidence of a nasty rumor about Cantwell in the army. A fellow soldier stationed with Cantwell Shelley Berman is ready to expose that Cantwell had a homosexual episode while in the service.Both candidates hope to get exPresident Hochstedter's blessing for the nomination. But though he likes Russell Hochstedter doubts Russell's fighting ability and decisiveness. Hochstedter hates Cantwell who openly despises him as well but he knows Cantwell can fight. But he is aware that Cantwell to win his point can overkill ridiculously. He also is aware that for himself time may be running out.Other figures are on the sidelines A southern governor who wants to put a stop to this nonsense about integration played by blacklist hero John Henry Faulk an outspoken Pearl Mesta type of Washington hostess giving social tips to the potential first ladies Ann Southern. And other favorite son candidates including Richard Arlen.Gore Vidal's family has been involved in American politics for many decades his grandfather being Senator Thomas Gore of Oklahoma.

Starring Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson the film takes its inspiration from a screenplay written by political writing giant Gore Vidal. Two men vying for the endorsement of the former president one will stop at nothing while the other is determined to retain his dignity The Best Man illustrates the journey of both. The Best Man is an engaging political drama revealing a behindthescenes look at the depths some will take to attain the highest power in the land.Two men of the same party William Russell Henry Fonda and Joe Cantwell Cliff Robertson have engaged in a political infight to gain the endorsement of their party's former president. Both men are not without their faults William Russell has a reputation for being a philanderer Joe Cantwell is a ruthless politician who is determined to not let anyone impede his way to the top. Nearing their party's convention it is crucial for one of the two the top contenders to gain the endorsement of the aging president. The president however hasn't made any indication of who he will support even at a dinner in which he would have typically announced his endorsement he remains neutral.

I have an interesting relationship with Henry Fonda I always adore him when I happen to see him in something yet have never sought out any films because he was in them. I have a mind that tends towards the obsessive in that when I see someone I enjoy watching I seek out everything they've ever done. Anyway Henry Fonda was as wonderful in this film as he is in every other role I've enjoyed of his. Also a welcome surprise was seeing Kevin McCarthy in this film so soon after seeing him and enjoying his role in Invasion of the Body Snatchers mental note must check out more of his work. Having done all my undergraduate work in Political Science and being aware of copious amounts of polling data I found it interesting that the names they chose for the film CANTwell and MerWIN. On a surface level when only thinking about the film it becomes clear that the subtext establishes that Cantwell will not win and Merwin will in fact emerge the victor. Many cues clearly indicate that this film was written by a political insider. First of all It is rare for a political film to address infighting between members of the same party. Typically the main crux of political films deals with the ultimate battle between the members of the opposite party. Likewise it is interesting to see a film where the action of the film is centered around a party convention rather than an election. The Best Man is a wonderful film dealing with a political theme it has aged incredibly well with communism being the only outdated concept which is easily substituted for the woeful group of the time. The Best Man is a wonderful puzzle all the way to the end with the President's ultimate goal being realized in the end. A film that keeps the audience engaged all the way through the increasingly suspenseful and exciting final act The Best Man is a film to see for political enthusiasts and novices alike.".

Starring Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson the film takes its inspiration from a screenplay written by political writing giant Gore Vidal. Two men vying for the endorsement of the former president one will stop at nothing while the other is determined to retain his dignity The Best Man illustrates the journey of both. The Best Man is an engaging political drama revealing a behindthescenes look at the depths some will take to attain the highest power in the land.Two men of the same party William Russell Henry Fonda and Joe Cantwell Cliff Robertson have engaged in a political infight to gain the endorsement of their party's former president. Both men are not without their faults William Russell has a reputation for being a philanderer Joe Cantwell is a ruthless politician who is determined to not let anyone impede his way to the top.

Lee Tracy giving his final feature film performance who received his only Academy recognition with a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his role plays the hick President of the United States who's secretly dying from cancer but still wields a lot of power in the process.Surprisingly still relevant for today the film delivers an insightful biting look at the behind the scenes wrangling wheeling and dealing that must go on at a wide open political convention where no clear candidate is the right choice or has sewn up the position in advance dirty politics questions of character decisions as to whether to use damning evidence against one's opponent which may jeopardize the party's chances of winning the overall election etc..Fonda plays Secretary of State William 'Bill' Russell whose marriage to his British wife Alice Margaret Leighton has been over for a long time due to his multiple affairs over the years. However on the eve of the convention and for the purposes of his Presidential and her First Lady aspirations the two agree to a treaty  to pretend to be as one so that he might win the nomination and almost by default then the presidency. She must then deal with Sue Ellen Gamadge Ann Sothern a powerful lobbyist who represents women's issues for the party. Russell is thought to be an intellectual who thinks about every issue perhaps too thoroughly which causes some like President Art Hockstader Tracy to question his decisiveness. Kevin McCarthy plays Russell's campaign manager Dick Jensen.Robertson plays working man hero and Senator Joe Cantwell who'd made a name for himself linking the Mafia with communism and writing a book titled the Enemy Around Us Edie Adams plays his loving wife Mabel the mother of their three children. Gene Raymond plays Joe's brother Don a former Senator? who'd lost to Hockstader in a Presidential campaign of his own years earlier and now acts as Joe's campaign manager. Shelley Berman plays Sheldon Bascomb a man who surfaces out of Joe's military past with a secret that might destroy his chances of earning his party's nomination  especially since Joe is supported by the conservative wing of the party.Cantwell has a bombshell of his own to drop a psychiatric evaluation of Russell that calls into question the Secretary of State's mental health labeling him a manic depressive that might crack under stress. Though Cantwell thinks of bringing this information to the light of day as a public service his telling this to Hockstader so enrages the President that he withdraws his planned endorsement of ruthless Joe calling him stupid for using a cannon to crush a bug. Hockstader then works behind the scenes for Russell though later lectures him about his indecisiveness to use Bascomb's dirt about Cantwell.Mahalia Jackson appears as herself singing at the preconvention banquet Howard K. Smith also appears as himself the news anchor correspondent during the convention. John Henry Faulk plays a southern state Sons of the Confederacy Governor T.T. Claypoole who Hockstader kids is a progressive liberal T.T. is instead a candidate who's not shy about voicing his racial prejudices and is slippery with his loyalties to either of the frontrunners holding out for whomever will promise him a spot on the ticket as the vice presidential candidate. William Ebersol plays a relatively unknown candidate western state Governor John Merwin and Richard Arlen plays the other candidate the former Attorney General now Senator Oscar Anderson. George Furth plays the President's secretary aide.".

There is great irony in how Fonda and Robertson spend more time working out whether or not to take down one another than they do on debating issues and policies at hand. There is also much to consider with Tracy equating Fonda making a decision on whether to take down Robertson at the same level of making a political decision in the best interest of the nation.

Robertson the ambitious and selfabsorbed character with his hit list is given some human dimensions. He loves his wife in an offhand way. He's genuinely honest about himself as far as he can be.

It's not one of Ann's great performances she's got too little screen time but she shows that talent of hers for adding a comic touch to a dramatic character without destroying the drama as she did most famously in The Whales of August.

	schema:reviewBody "Der Kapitn or The Captain is a West German 90minute film from 1971 which means it had its 45th anniversary last year. The three men who worked on this one essentially were really successful back in the day and this applies to director Kurt Hoffmann writer Franz Seitz and of course lead actor Heinz Rhmann. However for the trio this film is far from their most known achievements but their involvement I guess kept this film from becoming totally forgotten. Especially Rhmann is still a household name here in Germany and he was in his late 60s when he starred in here already but still far from the end of his career. There also exists an Englishlanguage version of this movie based on Richard Gordon's novel and at that point in Rhmann's career it was nothing uncommon at all really for him as he appeared in more German adaptations of English films back then.The story here is as the title already suggests about a ship captain. However he gets transferred right at the very beginning and this initial scene at his boss' office already makes clear that Rhmann initially is a good character a good human being pretty much as he does not accept causing harm to humans emotionalphysical for financial reasons. But there is also a bit wrong with his character in terms of lifestyle and happiness and especially the 100 seriousness he shows in his profession. So the film is a journey for his character a journey to himself and his own happiness in his ways of becoming a lighter not always stonecold person that is perhaps respected by his peers and colleagues and crew but not liked. Shame they did not come up with a better explanation really than turning the central character into a drunkard. But this is just one of many weaknesses this film has. Ultimately the script as well as the performances including Rhmann sadly too were not exactly inspiring or memorable. I have not read the book this is based on so I am not sure if the literary work is the problem or the adaptation here but this film ultimately falls into the category of many many German 1970s movies that end up forgettable and I dont recommend seeing it. Thumbs down.".

	schema:headline " About as good as a movie called Paul Blart Mall Cop could be";
	schema:reviewBody "If Paul Blart Mall Cop had been made 20 years ago it would have starred John Candy. That's a complement by the way. Candy had a knack for playing bungling yet goodhearted people who mainly wanted to please. He certainly specialized in playing people who tried too hard to be nice to cover up past pain. There's a lot of this in Kevin James' performance as the title character here. He's more than just a comic goofball. James turns him into a likable and surprisingly sympathetic hero that we find ourselves cheering for by the end.Kevin James rose to fame on television starring on the sitcom The King of Queens and has been trying to break into movies for a while now. He's acted along side stars like Will Smith and Adam Sandler but this is his first shot at a standalone starring role. Sandler is still there behind the scenes His Happy Madison production company produced the film. but this is James' film all the way and he doesn't waste the opportunity. His Paul Blart is admirable in a way. He's overweight and he suffers from hypoglycemia but he always tries to do the right thing. He's passionate about his job as a mall cop but he'd really like to be a police officer on the street. He's taken the physical entrance exam many times but his health problems have prevented him from finishing. He makes up for his shortcomings by being the best mall cop he can be and by also being a good single father to his teen daughter Raini Rodriguez who respects him and wishes he could fall in love again. Paul has his eyes on a young woman named Amy Jayma Mays who also works at the mall. The first half hour or so of the film is devoted to Paul's life and it certainly helps us get into his corner when the actual plot kicks in.It's Black Friday the busiest shopping day of the year and some high tech criminals stage a lock down and a hostage situation at the mall as they pull off their theft plan. They place motion sensors and small bombs at the entrances so no one can get in or out. They think they've removed everyone from the building but didn't notice Paul was in the back of the arcade playing Guitar Hero. When he emerges from the arcade he quickly learns about the hostage situation and discovers that both Amy and his daughter are amongst them. This kicks off the main action where Paul must use his resources around him to out think and outrun the criminals while keeping everyone alive. I liked this aspect of the story and how Paul Blart actually has to be clever in order to outsmart the captors. The movie is rated PG so it's never too violent or scary for kids which is the perfect target audience for the film. They'll like the film's gentle and goofy humor and accompanying adults may find themselves charmed by Blart himself.I never laughed out loud while watching this movie but I did smile a lot and I found myself caring more about the main character than I imagined. Let me tell you that's more than I expected walking into a movie called Paul Blart Mall Cop. There's plenty of sweetness during the early moments establishing Paul's shy relationship with Amy and the caring one he shares with his daughter. When the time comes for him to be a hero we can cheer for him because the movie makes him into a true underdog. He's constantly battling with his own shortcomings and health issues and it's clever the way he keeps on finding ways to keep himself going driven by saving the ones he loves. If I'm making the movie sound too serious it's not. There's plenty of slapstick gags surprisingly no bodily fluid or toilet humor to be found and some pretty good physical comedy on display. If there's any major shortcoming to be found it's that the movie is pretty inconsequential and will probably be forgotten by me a few months from now.Still considering the kind of junk that usually clogs theaters in early January Paul Blart certainly is not bad. I imagine the movie will make a good rental since its somewhat small scale will make it perfect for watching on TV rather than the big screen. If anything it's one step closer to making James the crossover star he obviously wants to be. I wouldn't mind seeing the same kind of likability he gives here in a less juvenile script. He's on to something here he's just gotta find the project where he really knocks one out of the park.".

He makes up for his shortcomings by being the best mall cop he can be and by also being a good single father to his teen daughter Raini Rodriguez who respects him and wishes he could fall in love again. Paul has his eyes on a young woman named Amy Jayma Mays who also works at the mall. The first half hour or so of the film is devoted to Paul's life and it certainly helps us get into his corner when the actual plot kicks in.It's Black Friday the busiest shopping day of the year and some high tech criminals stage a lock down and a hostage situation at the mall as they pull off their theft plan. They place motion sensors and small bombs at the entrances so no one can get in or out. They think they've removed everyone from the building but didn't notice Paul was in the back of the arcade playing Guitar Hero. When he emerges from the arcade he quickly learns about the hostage situation and discovers that both Amy and his daughter are amongst them. This kicks off the main action where Paul must use his resources around him to out think and outrun the criminals while keeping everyone alive. I liked this aspect of the story and how Paul Blart actually has to be clever in order to outsmart the captors. The movie is rated PG so it's never too violent or scary for kids which is the perfect target audience for the film. They'll like the film's gentle and goofy humor and accompanying adults may find themselves charmed by Blart himself.I never laughed out loud while watching this movie but I did smile a lot and I found myself caring more about the main character than I imagined. Let me tell you that's more than I expected walking into a movie called Paul Blart Mall Cop. There's plenty of sweetness during the early moments establishing Paul's shy relationship with Amy and the caring one he shares with his daughter. When the time comes for him to be a hero we can cheer for him because the movie makes him into a true underdog. He's constantly battling with his own shortcomings and health issues and it's clever the way he keeps on finding ways to keep himself going driven by saving the ones he loves. If I'm making the movie sound too serious it's not. There's plenty of slapstick gags surprisingly no bodily fluid or toilet humor to be found and some pretty good physical comedy on display. If there's any major shortcoming to be found it's that the movie is pretty inconsequential and will probably be forgotten by me a few months from now.Still considering the kind of junk that usually clogs theaters in early January Paul Blart certainly is not bad. I imagine the movie will make a good rental since its somewhat small scale will make it perfect for watching on TV rather than the big screen. If anything it's one step closer to making James the crossover star he obviously wants to be. I wouldn't mind seeing the same kind of likability he gives here in a less juvenile script. He's on to something here he's just gotta find the project where he really knocks one out of the park.";

There is very little in the way of violence even less in the way of sex and even the grossout jokes are kept way below what is usually the minimum level for comedies lately. The bad guys get around the mall with mountain bikes skate boards and by utilizing some impressive parkour moves. Clearly this movie was meant for the PG crowd and in that it succeeds. It's a nice clean family comedy that everyone can attend and enjoy. There were lots of families in the theater when I saw this movie and they all seemed to have a pretty good time. They laughed and giggled and there was very little of the bored chatter you hear sometimes at kidsfamily movies.I was thinking a little about the John Candy movie Summer Rental after I saw this. Candy played a few different roles in films before he did Summer Rental but that movie is where you see the classic John Candy affable lug character that kind of served as a template for most of his following roles. His characters were usually some variation of that he did it well and people loved it. Kevin James has a similar likable quality and I'm hoping that maybe he picks up the Easy Going mantle where John Candy left it.To paraphrase Paul Blart himself Don't write this movie off. Like I said there were plenty of scenes that had both kids and adults laughing together. Isn't it worth at least the price of a matine ticket to laugh for a while with your kids?".

	schema:reviewBody "Never watched King of Queens never have been a Kevin James fan but always liked him better than his pal Ray Romano. I was coerced into seeing this Mall Cop movie. I give it a 6 out of 10. Now some may say that is a low rating some may say better than mediocre.....for me who normally does not like this guys type of humor this is a great rating!!! It was mildly entertaining...for me it gets the extra star to put it at 6 because it's refreshing to see some humor that's not overly sarcastic deeply degrading to someone else except the title character or just downright cruel. This relied on what I call Bill Cosby sense of humor. Funny but overall clean. A bit cheesy but I think that's what Kevin and the screenwriters were going for. Normally I don't get why people think he's funny but in this case I did get it....and you can't help but like the guy. Without giving any detail the bar scene for me was one of the most Laugh Out Loud moments in the movie. The way KJ zips around on the Segway is pretty hilarious although because of it's consistency throughout the movie it wears off a bit. I agree with previous reviews of how the villains kind of downgraded the movie a bit. If that was smarter or those parts were rewritten it could have been a lot funnier. Another surprising aspect is Kevin's agility and athleticism. In this particular movie he is very physical or at least stunt doubles allow him to appear that way Overall my 6 out of 10 rating should be perceived as a great rating for this movie. I previously never liked this actor I thought the title was dumb as dirt and although I always keep an open mind I would be lying if I didn't say that my expectations were very very low for this. Certainly not as bad as I thought it would be and not as great as I thought it could have been. Kevin and cast made this a little better than average...and it changed my mind about my hesitation with this guy....I hope someone puts him in a good movie with a great script in the future better than Chuck and Larry Hitch. I believe it will do well on cable. One last thing that I must mention was great at 82 mins...it was just long enough to not overdue what should be viewed as a kinda silly concept.".

The real disappointment lies in the lack of humor in it.Paul Blart Kevin James is a mall cop that seems to have no direction in his life. They go to good lengths to show how truly depressing his life is. Paul sees a woman in his mall Amy Jayma Mays running a stand for hair extensions. He realizes that he needs to be with her and tries to woo her even though he has no selfesteem. Just as the story is falling apart the mall where they both work is robbed in a supposedly sophisticated scheme. Suddenly our slovenly friend is thrust into a role where he can try to impress the love of his life and excel at his job at the same time. Easy to guess where this story is going no? The acting was okay the direction was tolerable. The problem is the script. As I said the story itself had potential. It just felt as if the writers could decide where this was a character they loved or hated. It really could have used another rewrite or two to develop the script a little more. The movie is tolerable but realize that not only are you not seeing an Oscarworthy movie but you'll be a little disappointed in the laughs as well. 310".

Yes we all know it's not meant for critical acclaim but for pure comical entertainment and it delivers. I'm sure after anyone sees it they're going to want one of the little vespa vehicles he drives.Anyway Kevin James is Paul Blart an overweight suburban dad wanting to be a cop but instead he's a security guard at a mall. He has a daughter who's mother left him once she got citizenship. Paul has a crush on the new girl at the wig kiosk but of course he's conscience about his weight. Then one day some organized crooks take over the mall and Blart is unaware. Once the crooks have hostages including Blart's crush and his daughter then he decides to take things into his own hands and save the mall.At first I was terribly disappointed to see this was PG13 because I thought it was then going to be a little contrived pottystupid humor film for kids. Yes some stupid humor was there but in the best way. I think this would be the perfect family or date movie as it was for me so take a trip to comical fun.".

I knew I would be in store for clichs a lot of Kevin James falling down predictability from minute one and just an overall silly Adam Sandler production. And I was right on all accounts. However being a huge sorry but even he makes those jokes especially this film fan of James and in the mood for a lighthearted innocent film I was absolutely able to look past the flaws and just enjoy the ride  for the most part. Some of the slapstick and scenes namely the drunken dance sequence either go on too long or just simply too silly or even painful to watch speaking more on the lame attempts at humor and not just another James fall down. Every prop is used in this movie so if you pay any attention every object word spoken or set is going to be used later. I kinda liked that how they desperately tried to link the first half the sweet hearted Paul who fails at marriage at the police academy and at romance with the second an absolute DisneyDoesDiehard. I did like the efforts at making a more kidfriendly John McClane using the always hilarious James over Bruce Willis. I also loved his character always so positive and attempts at doing the right thing and the fact even though it was produced by Sandler  Co. it's not just another raunchy hardR comedy. Though I'm not opposed to raunchiness loved 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and 'Superbad' a lot it was really refreshing to see a completely familyfriendly slapstick. I am curious though it took place onaround Black Friday. Why when it would've been a perfect holiday film release it in January?".

It was so cool Mike Vallely had a cameo and of course I recognized his skateboarding skills and then who he was. Jayma Mays was so fantastic and hysterical.

I didn't get an autograph but I was able to go to the preview screening of the movie and although we got into it a couple minutes late I was still able to see the bulk of the movie. It definitely isn't bad but I wouldn't put it up there as a top comedy either. It's decent at best. There are actually a few genuinely funny moments but there aren't many. The rest of the jokes throughout the movie aren't bad in the sense that you cringe at them but they aren't really what I'd call funny either. Really though the movie is highly tolerable and doesn't overstay it's welcome ending at a good time. I didn't have to pay for it so maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much but as long as you aren't looking for the next great comedy at the very least you won't be disappointed. The main weakness of the movie is the main villains in the movie the XTREME T33M! turn what is a pretty good movie into a pretty mediocre movie. You just can't take them seriously as usually bad guys in movies don't jump around as if they believe they are the evil twins of Spider man and to make it worse they also equip themselves with skateboards and BMX bikes because apparently free running around the wall wasn't XTREEEEEEEM enough for them. They really make the movie seem more like a kid's movie than it already did which I guess it is more of a kid's movie but still. Kevin James himself isn't bad and he has most of the best jokes of the movie come from him but he isn't really at the top of his game either. Really no complaints the only thing holding him back is the somewhat sloppy script. If you liked him in King of Queens you'll probably like him in this yet he is a little underwhelming to be honest. The plot is very simplistic Hollywood routine stuff here no surprises except one last minute twist that is actually unexpected mostly because it was so unnecessary to move the plot forward. It was just so unneeded that it really made no sense and was almost shocking. It's like someone who says they are going to count to 100 and then they count to 105. What was the point of that? They already accomplished their goal when they got to 100. Kind of a bad analogy but you get the idea. Overall it's nothing to write home about but it definitely isn't bad. If you are a huge Kevin James fan then go ahead and see it and if you have kids then they will most likely like it. I was going to give it a 610 but seeing as how it is more of a kid's movie I decided to give it a 7 also because it is very tolerable and there are some actually pretty funny parts so it is an enjoyable movie although again I could be a little more accepting because I got to see it for free. You might enjoy it you might not. Really just watch the trailer. It pretty much captures the spirit of the movie.".

	schema:headline " Superior Italian sex comedy with droolinducing performances by Agostina Belli and Eleanora Giorgi";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen WAY too many bad Italian sex comedies so it's always nice to see one that is relatively clever satirical and entertaining without skimping on the naked Eurolovelies that make even some of the bad ones worthwhile. During a worldwide energy shortage a scientist Gigi Proietti is trying to harvest the power of sexual passion as an energy source. He is ably um assisted by his two gorgeous nurses Eleanora Giorgi and Adriana Asti but he seems to get his best results from a couple Agostina Belli and Christian De Sica who end up in a hospital room together after they are both injured and whisked away by the scientist's fake ambulance. Both are married to other people however so their relationship does not go very smoothly. The movie takes the usual satirical swipes at Catholicismthe slender Belli has a laughably ridiculous number of kids and the whole project becomes embroiled in the typical Vatican intrigue.The director Pasquale Campanile Festa directed quite a few superior sex comedies like The Libertine with Catherine Spaak and Body of a Girl with Lili Carati as well the superb gialloterror film HitchHike with Franco Nero Corrine Clery and David Hess and the interesting melodrama The Girl from Trieste with Ben Gazarra and Ornella Muti. This is another superior effort. The two male actors are good especially Proietti as the scientist who is so obsessed with his sex experiments that he neglects his own beautiful busty wife who has to seek the attention of male prostitutes. DeSica basically has the same role he had in Giovaninosex scene after sex scene with beautiful women must have been tough.What really makes Italian sex comedies thoughboth the good ones and the notsogood onesare the actresses. Agostina Belli and Eleanora Giorgi perhaps due to this movie are often confused in the IMDb pages but they are definitely two different people. It was Belli who came closer to international stardom with a role in Bluebeard the lead in the original Italian Scent of a Woman and an appearance with Kirk Douglas in Holocaust 2000. Giorgi was less wellknown but she had an important part in Dario Argento's Inferno and she managed to almost overshadow Ornella Muti when the two of them appeared together in the littleseen Apassionata. Needless to say both actresses spend a lot of their screen time here in the alltogether. And if there really WERE a sex machine like the one in this movies these two could no doubt light up a good size metropolis all by themselves! Good movie. Recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen WAY too many bad Italian sex comedies so it's always nice to see one that is relatively clever satirical and entertaining without skimping on the naked Eurolovelies that make even some of the bad ones worthwhile. During a worldwide energy shortage a scientist Gigi Proietti is trying to harvest the power of sexual passion as an energy source. He is ably um assisted by his two gorgeous nurses Eleanora Giorgi and Adriana Asti but he seems to get his best results from a couple Agostina Belli and Christian De Sica who end up in a hospital room together after they are both injured and whisked away by the scientist's fake ambulance. Both are married to other people however so their relationship does not go very smoothly. The movie takes the usual satirical swipes at Catholicismthe slender Belli has a laughably ridiculous number of kids and the whole project becomes embroiled in the typical Vatican intrigue.The director Pasquale Campanile Festa directed quite a few superior sex comedies like The Libertine with Catherine Spaak and Body of a Girl with Lili Carati as well the superb gialloterror film HitchHike with Franco Nero Corrine Clery and David Hess and the interesting melodrama The Girl from Trieste with Ben Gazarra and Ornella Muti. This is another superior effort. The two male actors are good especially Proietti as the scientist who is so obsessed with his sex experiments that he neglects his own beautiful busty wife who has to seek the attention of male prostitutes. DeSica basically has the same role he had in Giovaninosex scene after sex scene with beautiful women must have been tough.What really makes Italian sex comedies thoughboth the good ones and the notsogood onesare the actresses. Agostina Belli and Eleanora Giorgi perhaps due to this movie are often confused in the IMDb pages but they are definitely two different people. It was Belli who came closer to international stardom with a role in Bluebeard the lead in the original Italian Scent of a Woman and an appearance with Kirk Douglas in Holocaust 2000. Giorgi was less wellknown but she had an important part in Dario Argento's Inferno and she managed to almost overshadow Ornella Muti when the two of them appeared together in the littleseen Apassionata. Needless to say both actresses spend a lot of their screen time here in the alltogether. And if there really WERE a sex machine like the one in this movies these two could no doubt light up a good size metropolis all by themselves! Good movie. Recommended.";

I was immediately drawn into the movie by  Victor's deadpan expression  and uptight  manner and watched his  composure melt  away into plain irritability  at  his foiled  assassination  attempt  on the art thief Renee as she is seen shop lifting. It then crumbles to exasperation as more things do  not  run  according to plan as he is so obviously used to. The Corsican gangsters are threatening enough and the introduction of Guillaume Depardieu as the all thumbs Antoine tops off the chemistry and cast adding to the total chaos inflicted upon Victor's usually well ordered life. There is a lovely scene too where Victor has afternoon tea with his aged but elegant Mother and it hilariously transpires here that she is an authority on poisons and pistols.

	onyx:emotionText "Rochefort plays professional killer Victor Meynard in this  beautifully shot French black comedy. I rented this  movie  not knowing anything about it and barely reading the cover. I was immediately drawn into the movie by  Victor's deadpan expression  and uptight  manner and watched his  composure melt  away into plain irritability  at  his foiled  assassination  attempt  on the art thief Renee as she is seen shop lifting. It then crumbles to exasperation as more things do  not  run  according to plan as he is so obviously used to. The Corsican gangsters are threatening enough and the introduction of Guillaume Depardieu as the all thumbs Antoine tops off the chemistry and cast adding to the total chaos inflicted upon Victor's usually well ordered life. There is a lovely scene too where Victor has afternoon tea with his aged but elegant Mother and it hilariously transpires here that she is an authority on poisons and pistols. A sideeffect of this scene is a mysteriously dead Parrot. It is all underplayed beautifully and the dark humor characterization  and pace contribute to a refreshing alternative to Hollywood.";

The four lead performances are all good but Jean Rochefort in particular does a brilliant deadpan in the lead role. There are plenty of good lines but the funniest jokes are visual the synchronising of the pushchair gently bumping the car with the noise of the crash behind or the reappearance of the parrot behind Madame Maynard. And Patachou's cameo in that role the mother not the parrot makes the movie worth seeing alone. Highly recommended and worth seeing twice for the subtle jokes you miss the first time.

Cible Emouvante has enough valuable assets to justify its screening. First Salvadori's first effort eschews in the major part of the film an ultramapped master plan and is straddling several genres. Thus the onset of the film might let the viewer think that the film will be based on the formation of Antoine to the job by Victor. But later the director changes way and follows the three main characters trying to escape the Casa Bianca gang who runs after Rene. The two gangs will rub shoulders in a chic hotel. And finally Salvadori steers his work on another way when Victor Antoine and Rene wind up in Victor's house. Investigations from the Casa Bianca gang chases and suspense take a back seat and perhaps the chief key of the film is Victor's personality.

	schema:reviewBody "It's curious that Buster Keaton whose training was in a knockabout vaudeville act and slapstick comedy shorts was so good at playing pampered effete young millionaires. He just happened to be one of nature's aristocrats. Buster appreciated the comic possibilities of this characterstarting out so helpless allowed plenty of room for dramatic developmentand the role also suited his innate gentleness and quiet dignity. Buster played wealthy idlers in several of his movies including The Navigator but he was never more placidly twitty than in Battling Butler. For the first half of the movie he looks like a 1920s fashion plate exquisitely groomed demonstrating What the WellDressed Man Will Wear for hunting fishing etc. He is Alfred Butler whose tycoon father annoyed by his son's languid existence sends him an a camping expedition to toughen him up. In the mountains he sleeps in a vast tent complete with bed wardrobe and tiger rug his faithful valet lays out his clothes draws his bath and serves his meals on silver dishes. This is my idea of roughing it! While attempting to hunt obliviously missing every animal in the forest and fish capsizing his boat in pursuit of a bobbing duck Alfred encounters a pretty mountain girl Sally O'Neil. They fall in love but her family won't accept this sissy as an inlaw until Alfred's valet tells them that his employer is actually Alfred Battling Butler a boxer contending for the lightweight title.Alfred goes along with the ruse for the sake of the girl. Then he encounters the real Battling Butler and after a misunderstanding involving the boxer's wife Battling tells Alfred that HE can fight the title bout with the Alabama Murdereror he'll blow his cover. The rest of the film follows Alfred's difficulties as the trainers try to turn the playboy into a fighter. Along with the athletic sequences in his later movie College these scenes offer the most sustained focus on Buster's extraordinary physique and what he could do with it.With his small stature Buster could convincingly portray a milquetoast as long as he kept his clothes on but once he strips down to boxing shorts it's all too obvious how exceptionally fit he was. In the opening shot of the training sequence he's obviously supposed to look puny and defenseless instead he looks like he could easily be a boxer. Despite his sculpted body Buster plays these scenes with a realism that renders them almost painful to watch. He reacts the way any normal softbellied human being would to being mercilessly pummeled. He shows hurt and exhaustion and displays his own nearly limitless endurance of both. Buster had it must be said an unhealthy capacity to take punishment. It wasn't masochism just that his pride in his physical abilities and the authenticity of his stuntwork outweighed any concern for his own wellbeing. He must have been used to pain as the star of an act renowned as the roughest in vaudeville he'd been taking it like a man ever since he was a toddler.At the end of the movie Battling attacks Alfred viciously and finally Alfred retaliates and beats the boxer unconscious. Many people dislike this fight feeling it's uncharacteristic for Buster to triumph through brute force sheer slugging rather than ingenuity or pluck. The fight was Keaton's own addition to the play that was the source for the movie. The original ending simply let Alfred off the hook without having to fight which Buster felt was dramatically unsatisfying. Pushed too far humiliated too deeply his meek character finally responds with fury and violence. It is uncharacteristic but maybe he liked it for just that reason. Offscreen Buster had a troubling passivity especially in his unhappy married life and he must have enjoyed playing a character who effectively fights back.Still I prefer the first half of the movie with its gentle pace lowkey jokes and elegant touches. Alfred's valet is played by Snitz Edwards a tiny actor he makes Buster look imposing with a goblin face and a delicate performing style. Cute as a button Sally O'Neil makes one of Buster's most effective leading ladies. In a sweet image typical of Keaton's sophisticated filmmaking style when Alfred parts from his wife as he drives away her face remains framed like a cameo in the oval window at the back of the car.Battling Butler was one of Keaton's most successful movies when it was released. Like Seven Chances and College it lacks the otherworldly originality of his best work but I've always liked it better than the other two and considered it a handsome mature and underrated work. Lacking any largescale setpieces this film rests almost entirely on Buster's performance. Do you think you could learn to love me? he asks Sally O'Neil. She replies as I would I have.".

Pushed too far humiliated too deeply his meek character finally responds with fury and violence. It is uncharacteristic but maybe he liked it for just that reason. Offscreen Buster had a troubling passivity especially in his unhappy married life and he must have enjoyed playing a character who effectively fights back.Still I prefer the first half of the movie with its gentle pace lowkey jokes and elegant touches. Alfred's valet is played by Snitz Edwards a tiny actor he makes Buster look imposing with a goblin face and a delicate performing style. Cute as a button Sally O'Neil makes one of Buster's most effective leading ladies. In a sweet image typical of Keaton's sophisticated filmmaking style when Alfred parts from his wife as he drives away her face remains framed like a cameo in the oval window at the back of the car.Battling Butler was one of Keaton's most successful movies when it was released. Like Seven Chances and College it lacks the otherworldly originality of his best work but I've always liked it better than the other two and considered it a handsome mature and underrated work. Lacking any largescale setpieces this film rests almost entirely on Buster's performance. Do you think you could learn to love me? he asks Sally O'Neil. She replies as I would I have.";

I'd instantly give this a 9 if only I could justify it relative to the early scenes despite the pitch of enthusiasm I'd reached by the end of the film I'm still not quite sure in all fairness that I can.It definitely takes a while to get up to speed at the start I took the father to be a doctor giving his sickly son only three months to live! and for the initial reel or so it depends largely on a single extended gag  the elegant fop's complete unsuitability for an outdoor environment. Alfred's elaborate alfresco living arrangements echo Keaton's trademark fascination with complicated contrivances and there's one very typical bit of misdirection where we wait for the shotgun's recoil to knock Alfred backwards into the water only for a somewhat different turn of events to prove his downfall but this film doesn't come properly to life until its hero engages our sympathy as well as being a walking joke. In The General we engage with Johnnie Gray almost immediately  in Battling Butler Alfred remained a cipher for me until the moment when he nervously rehearses Beatrice Faircatch's newspaper advice on making a proposal with such an earnest air it's funny but it's also touching and it's no coincidence that it is with his subsequent first steps towards standing on his own two feet  tearing up and throwing aside the useless newspaper column  that Alfred Butler may finally be said to have progressed beyond a simple onedimensional character and the film can really begin.From here on the picture becomes a Keaton classic sweeping the hapless hero further and further from the cushioned normality of his life with a series of escalating and plausible coincidences. Ultimately the worm will turn of course  but not in the time and manner that we are expecting. And Keaton acts here not just with that famous face but with every line of his whole body triumph exhaustion despair apprehension indignation timidity pugnacity... and finally in the last scene sublime confidence in his own skin modelling a costume so incongruous that only Buster Keaton could carry it off with such genuine elegance! The scenes of Alfred's ordeal are hilarious and moving by degrees  it's almost impossible to analyse Keaton's appeal. 'Sweet' is quite definitely the wrong word as is 'lovable' Buster is no Little Tramp. 'Bittersweet' might be closer to the mark... or 'poignant' the metaphor of the man who gets knocked down but keeps on trying has never been more apt. There is a brief vivid moment when Alfred bewildered and worn out turns his face aside into the arms of his second with such a hopeless little air that instead of a laugh it raised a murmur of pity from the auditorium. But Keaton never allows himself to milk the audience for sympathy  the best of his films may mingle laughter through tears but he never falls into the trap of sentimentality.I'm not sure if this is among the best of Keaton's films... but it's certainly one of those I've ultimately enjoyed the most so far. I've changed my mind I'll give it a 9 after all and say I'm dropping a mark down instead from a 10! ".

Most of the specific stunts though are relatively routine compared to those in his best work.In lesser hands the fragile premise would run out of steam quickly but here things keep moving along steadily and there are some very good moments.  It doesn't ever really hit high gear though and it's missing the kind of topnotch climactic sequence that distinguishes Keaton's best films.

Snitz Edwards here plays Buster's faithful valet a gnomish gentle character whose eagerness to arrange whatever his master wants lands him in trouble.Buster is Alfred Butler rich and so passive he lets Snitz tap the ash off his cigarette. While on a camping trip he meets a girl Sally O'Neil who strikes his fancy. Her father and brother disapprove of her going off with a jellyfish. Snitz to the rescue He tells them this is the same Battling Butler who just won the lightweight boxing crown. Alas the ruse works too well.You can argue that Snitz plays the title character here as much as Buster or Francis McDonald who plays the boxer Butler. Whether laying out a ridiculously ornate table at Buster's camp site or laboring to keep up with his boss during an arduous run through the mud there's no giveup in the guy.I'd like to marry that pretty little mountain girl Buster says.Shall I arrange it? Snitz answers. Buster nods setting the plot in motion.Like a lot of silent comedies this is a film of pieces. The first half of Buster and Snitz roughing it in the outdoors could be a clever short all by itself. Buster's idea of duckhunting is to row up to one wading in the water and then lean out of the boat to point a shotgun at it at pointblank range. You expect him to fire and roll off from the gun's kickback so naturally that's the one thing that doesn't happen.The transition to the boxing comedy is well done helped along by Snitz McDonald and O'Neil really a cutie with her Zooey Deschanel eyes. It's O'Neil's desperate desire to see her man in the ring duking it out that forces Buster and Snitz to scramble in the last halfhour or so coming up with all sorts of ruses. The comedy wears a bit thin at times with some protracted workout scenes in the boxing ring yet Buster goes a long way to selling them with his amazingly elastic physicality.Buster doesn't wear a porkpie in this film and his pampered lifestyle distances you a bit more than his inexpressiveness usually did but he has that dogged quality of classic Keaton heroes. He may not be the champion boxer his girl thinks he is but he'll not give her up without a fight. I'm going back and tell her the truth he tells Snitz. I'd rather lose her that way.It's funny how Battling Butler doesn't really engage a lot of Keaton fans. Perhaps there's some resentment there because it was a hit for Buster right before The General flopped. Taken on its own merits Battling Butler is a clever and engaging comedy with a likeably different lead role for Buster and a surprising doubletwist ending in which Buster and the audience have the wool lifted from their eyes one minute only for Buster to do the same with us the next.Maybe Battling Butler isn't as inventive as Keaton fans are used to but it has its share of arresting visuals and a solid mix of varied comedic moments that still connect. Plus it works as a story all the way through. Finally there's the winning chemistry of Buster and Snitz The Great Stoneface and The Great Cragface.".

It also goes in a couple surprising directions which are noteworthy.I notice through the evolution of Keaton's movies that he did more and more acting and less and less physical comedy with the exception of course of The Saphead which was his first featurelength that was mostly dramabased not slapstickbased. By now 1926 Keaton knows what he's doing and knows where he's going and thus this is a pretty clean and wellput together movie.Still the stuff he does in the trainingring scene is amazingly original and marvelous. When watching this movie one expects something more along the lines of Chaplin's moment in City Lights where he dodges around limberly and almost succeeds. Not the case this was more real and brutal. Marvelous stuff really and surprising in its own right.PolarisDiB".

He is wonderful and it's to Keaton's credit both as a fellow comic and as the director that he allows Snitz to steal many of his scenes. In fact Keaton and Edwards make a great comedy team. Except for one or two sequences they don't play against each other they play with each othera feat that is more difficult to bring off successfully.Following the construction of the stage musical the film splits neatly into two halves. Tom Wilson's harassed trainer who expertly pits himself against the seemingly hopeless Keaton supplies much of the comedy in the second half until the star unexpectedly turns the tables in a grand climax especially written for the film. In the play the McDonald character simply drops out and doesn't return at all. It could be said that the stage musical actually ends on rather a limp note plotwise but this problem has now been neatly licked.Doubtless due to the fact that comic fight scenes have been done to death by just about every comedian you could name in sound films Battling Butler is not wholly prized among Keaton addicts but I regard it as one of his best outings.".

The life in the forest isn't much different for Alfred as the tent is luxurious like a mansion and his valet still preparing his clothing and meals. After meeting a girl Alfred falls in love with her but the girl's father and brother are against the marriage because they think Alfred is a weakling. Alfred's valet lies him to be a prize fighter who happens to bear the same name Alfred Butler. One little lie leads to another until Alfred is forced to take up the part of the boxer he pretended to be for real.'Battling Butler' is more situation comedy than Keaton's usual physical action packed movies. Besides Keaton's time spent in the ring the film contains very little stunt work. But one shouldn't worry about that thing as Buster Keaton's subtle performance is enough to compensate that. The high point of the whole movie is definitely the climatic fight between two Butlers Buster Keaton and Francis McDonald. Not comparable with 'The General' or 'Sherlock Jr.' but sweet movie nonetheless. Like Martin Scorsese himself said  Keaton is the only person who had the right attitude about boxing in the movies.

I don't blame him this is the film world where even since this period  around 1920  marriage is always trivialized and people are always lying. Why was that so frequent in classic movies in particular? It's disgusting. Here Alfred Battling Butler a spoiled rich young man  in order to keep his girl  lies about being the lightweight boxing champion of the world because that guy who has the same name as him is a hero and he wants to impress her and her big brother and big father. He wants to marry her right away because she's pretty and she consents as soon as she hears he's a big shot. Boy those are great reasons for marriage!After the quickie marriage Buster heads off for training camp for his supposed title defense against the Alabama Murderer. Later the real Battling Butler to do the impostor a favor and save his marriage lets him be the real thing and fight while he retires.The training  and the first real laugh of the film  isn't until 47minute mark when Buster begins training and can't get over the ropes. He is helpless outside and inside the ring as it turns out.The training escalates as Buster begins roadwork the next day.....but he isn't up to training or fighting or any of this. Fortunately a big twist occurs late in the movie which saves Buster from going into the ring although the little man does save his honor after he fights the real Battling Butler.I would agree with the critics on this one it's far from Buster's best work.".

The fight day arrives and.....................................................This was not Buster Keaton's best feature. In the first place gone is his famous pork pie hat. He dresses except for the training and fight sequences in rich man's clothes throughout. He just doesn't look comfortable in that attire. Maybe that was intended I don't know. Up to the point that he goes into training I didn't think the film was all that funny. The laughs are just too few and far between during the first part of the film. The climatic fight at the film's climax was a little hard to believe in my opinion.Buster would hit a home run however with his next film The General.As an aside Francis McDonald had a career that spanned well over 50 years from the early silents to the 1960s. He was a regular in westerns playing mostly despicable characters is parts of varying size. He did have a small but effective part in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments 1956.".

You know where this is going to lead.Thinking Buster has won the world championship and with her family's blessing the two marry. Buster and Snitz decide that the deception must continue as Battling Butler is to begin training the very next day for the defense of his title. And the fun begins.Buster tries to work out with the champion but is found out. The champ walks out and his manager Eddie Borden and trainer Tom Wilsonare told to get Buster in shape for the fight. The fight day arrives and.....................................................This was not Buster Keaton's best feature. In the first place gone is his famous pork pie hat. He dresses except for the training and fight sequences in rich man's clothes throughout. He just doesn't look comfortable in that attire. Maybe that was intended I don't know. Up to the point that he goes into training I didn't think the film was all that funny. The laughs are just too few and far between during the first part of the film. The climatic fight at the film's climax was a little hard to believe in my opinion.Buster would hit a home run however with his next film The General.As an aside Francis McDonald had a career that spanned well over 50 years from the early silents to the 1960s. He was a regular in westerns playing mostly despicable characters is parts of varying size. He did have a small but effective part in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments 1956.";

While there he meets a beautiful woman he wishes to marry but her hard edged father and brother won't approve of such a city slicker who appears unable to look after himself without an assistant so Buster is forced to assume the identity of a champion boxer with the same name in order to win them over. This leads him to a training camp in the mountains where the real champion boxer mistakenly believes Buster is flirting with his wife and a nasty grudge ensues.The tightly woven plot is one of Keaton's best full of twists that while improbable are not outside the realm of possibility enough to turn you away and we humorously get a story about the power of attraction and the lengths one will go to in order to win the one they love. As usual with Keaton films it is often the small details along the way that charm the best. A scene where the two young lovers are so involved in their conversation they don't notice the table and chairs sinking into the soft ground until their faces are only inches apart. It is moments like these that show why Keaton was one of if not the greatest silent filmmaker for without dialogue he is expertly able to show the progression of the relationship from far apart strangers to infatuated friends with a wonderful visual and a laugh to boot. Elsewhere he gets good laughs out of the difficulty climbing in and out of a boxing ring the dangerous driving of country roads and the unreliability of newspaper columns  the love advice therein proving of no help. It also happens to feature excellent cinematography some of the finest cinematography I've seen in a Keaton film.If there is one let down to this film however unusually for Keaton it is the climax. While not without it's charms it fails to deliver the otherworldly uniqueness of his more regarded films which is probably the reason it doesn't tend to be raved about as much. Still just as it doesn't reach his highest of highs it doesn't fall to any lows either and is a joy to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every hardcore film buff worth his weight in celluloid has a certain special favorite film which struck a peculiarly responsive chord in him when it was first seen at a young tender impressionable age. The fan's deepseated affection for this picture defies a logical rational explanation but holds strong throughout the years nonetheless. Parasite an admittedly cheesy handy dandy low budget scifihorror ripoff of ALIEN They Came from Within and Mad Max which tells the bleak futuristic story of a man with a dangerous scientifically created killer slug growing in his belly is that type of movie for me.Sure there are numerous concrete bits and pieces of Parasite which can be singled out as key attractive attributes. Neither Charles Band's inert direction nor the murky uninspired script amount to anything other than merely blah although both do considerably add to the film's overall bizarrely beguiling mediocre quality. Scrawny swarthy longfaced and bugeyed longtime unsung favorite Robert Glaudini portrays the sweaty frazzlenerved protagonist with his customary enthralling humorless solemnity. The adorable Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith looking like a scraggly haggard totally strungout heroin junkie all dingy frizzy hair indecipherable feral grumbling and sneering facial expressions does a welcome albeit fleeting topless cameo as a deranged sickie. Al Fann contributes a wonderfully warm and engaging performance as a nice guy diner proprietor. Luca Bercovici as a brutish punk gang leader makes for a perfectly hateful villain. Cherie Currie the former lead singer of the seminal allgirl punkrock group the Runaways isn't given much to do but still catches the eye with her sweetly pretty tall drink of dirty blonde water looks all the same. Mac Ahlberg's grainy washedout cinematography somehow manages to be oddly apropos. Richard Band's redundantly rattling score likewise weirdly works.The lead pipe firmly embedded in a guy's abdomen profusely leaking blood gag is a genuine pip. The scene where the parasite attacks and kills Vivian Blaine by dropping from the ceiling is a corker the moment when foul thing reduces Blaine to a dessicated prunefaced husk before gorily bursting out of her shriveled head really hits the splattery spot. The sporadic use of strained drawnout and overamplified slow motion provides a few solid belly laughs. The lethargic pace slogs along at a hypnotically gradual clip. Watching the eternally obnoxious Demi Moore in her first starring role have her lip split open will forever remain a sadistically satisfying sight to behold. Stan Winston's black slimy and truly revolting monster design is deliciously disgusting. While all these cited specifics are credible reasons for liking  no scratch that seriously loving  Parasite the film ultimately gets to me and bowls me over in a way that I simply can't describe but inevitably feel quite profoundly whenever I rewatch it. I guess you can say that for me Parasite has that inexplicable yet undeniable and unmistakable mondo schlock flick zing.".

	schema:headline " Parasites of the Wasteland";
	schema:reviewBody "Calling PARASITE a good movie is as arguable as whether or not Paris Hilton has had a breast enlargement. It's no secret that I've always had a soft spot for Charles Band's preFull Moon stuff. And even though I've liked PARASITE ever since I saw it in my midteens I think I'm not being biased if I say that watching this movie is a worthwhile effort and it's worthy of an honourable mention as an entry in Bmovie horror history set in a postapocalyptic future. Well future is somewhat of a debatable topic here since the movie is set in the year 1992 while having been produced in 1982.PARASITE is noticeable for quite some aspects. One of them being that it was originally shot and released in theaters as a 3D feature. While 3Dimensional Photography was a popular phenomena in cinematic history during the 50's CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON anyone? its popularity soon fizzled out by the decade's end. Fast forward to the early 80's and we encounter directorproducer Charles Band as one of the people in collaboration with 3D specialist Randall Larsen who revived 3D for a shortlived period and brought it back to theaters. PARASITE was his contribution to the sudden but short wave of 3D features to emerge around that time FRIDAY THE 13th PART 3 AMITYVILLE 3D and JAWS 3D being the most famous ones. One year later Charles would make another 3D feature the scifiadventure flick METALSTORM THE DESTRUCTION OF JAREDSYN another worthwhile watch if you ask me. The use of the 3D gimmick is integrated nicely with the rest of the movie e.g. during a fistfight you can see a snake lashing out at the camera the titular parasite creature falling from the ceiling towards the camera positioned on the ground. The two most memorable scenes involving 3D cinematography involve one killing a guy gets impaled by an iron pipe when the camera slowly closes in on the hollow pipe blood starts dripping out of it and the parasitecreature bursting out of the head of actress Viviane Blaine well not her real head of course.The story itself is rather simplistic and sometimes moves at a slow pace but there are a lot of enjoyable scenes to make up for that. A scientist played by tormentedlooking Robert Glaudini flees from an oppressive paramilitary government for which he created the flesheating parasite. He takes with him two specimens. One he keeps in a canister the other creature is growing inside his stomach. We don't get to see much of the futuristic paramilitary government though.

	onyx:emotionText "Calling PARASITE a good movie is as arguable as whether or not Paris Hilton has had a breast enlargement. It's no secret that I've always had a soft spot for Charles Band's preFull Moon stuff. And even though I've liked PARASITE ever since I saw it in my midteens I think I'm not being biased if I say that watching this movie is a worthwhile effort and it's worthy of an honourable mention as an entry in Bmovie horror history set in a postapocalyptic future. Well future is somewhat of a debatable topic here since the movie is set in the year 1992 while having been produced in 1982.PARASITE is noticeable for quite some aspects. One of them being that it was originally shot and released in theaters as a 3D feature. While 3Dimensional Photography was a popular phenomena in cinematic history during the 50's CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON anyone? its popularity soon fizzled out by the decade's end. Fast forward to the early 80's and we encounter directorproducer Charles Band as one of the people in collaboration with 3D specialist Randall Larsen who revived 3D for a shortlived period and brought it back to theaters. PARASITE was his contribution to the sudden but short wave of 3D features to emerge around that time FRIDAY THE 13th PART 3 AMITYVILLE 3D and JAWS 3D being the most famous ones. One year later Charles would make another 3D feature the scifiadventure flick METALSTORM THE DESTRUCTION OF JAREDSYN another worthwhile watch if you ask me. The use of the 3D gimmick is integrated nicely with the rest of the movie e.g. during a fistfight you can see a snake lashing out at the camera the titular parasite creature falling from the ceiling towards the camera positioned on the ground. The two most memorable scenes involving 3D cinematography involve one killing a guy gets impaled by an iron pipe when the camera slowly closes in on the hollow pipe blood starts dripping out of it and the parasitecreature bursting out of the head of actress Viviane Blaine well not her real head of course.The story itself is rather simplistic and sometimes moves at a slow pace but there are a lot of enjoyable scenes to make up for that. A scientist played by tormentedlooking Robert Glaudini flees from an oppressive paramilitary government for which he created the flesheating parasite. He takes with him two specimens. One he keeps in a canister the other creature is growing inside his stomach. We don't get to see much of the futuristic paramilitary government though. The only information we learn about it is coming from the various characters our scientist meets when he's stranded in an isolated desert town amongst them being a group of postapocalyptic punks and a scarredbyradiation black bartender.

I've had my chances to grab it but the notsoflattering comments left me to pass it up but after hearing it wasn't that bad and I seem to share the same thoughts about particular horror films with this friend. I dived right in to it. As it stands it wasn't great but nonetheless it was entertainingly simple bgrade fun in a postapocalyptic backdrop. Charles Brand in only his third feature paves the way for outrageously hamfisted splatter effects and makeup artist Stan Winston formulates a nasty icky looking sluglike parasite with a mean looking grin. The criticism against his design is unfair sure it isn't firstrate but with budget associated as this is truly lowrent feature produced by Embassy Pictures it's an acceptable effort. Trying to be different around that time was adding a new gimmick that it would be in 3D for moviegoing audiences. Sadly the DVD doesn't come with the 3D version. Anyhow it didn't destroy the mood in any way. What can really hurt it though was that the script is slipshod and it never truly gets in any sort of groove and comes up being a little too sparse and repetitive in its actions. The atmosphere remains nonexistent and tension doesn't come by easily but Brand unintentional or not engraves a grimy edge to it all with Mac Ahlberg's wellexecuted panning of the camera and throws about some graphic diversions. It's hard to forget Broadway siren Vivian Blaine's encounter with a parasite and some slowmotion passages are rather funny. Richard Band's shivering score feels like it's on a loop but seems to suit it.There are earnest performances from the likes of Robert Glaudini Luca Bercovici Al Fann James Davidson Cherrie Currie and a quick showin by Cheryl Smith. Demi Moore in her first onscreen role doesn't make much of a dent but it's far from awful.In the end it's immensely forgettable but lately watching these modern and sometimes leaden Scifi original TV features is making me appreciate this schlock far more.".

The sole scientist Paul Dean with a parasite monster developing in his stomach flees to a godforsaken desert town to work on a cure. There's a cruel government agent following him and even the local imbeciles don't leave him in peace as they steal his equipment and infect themselves with flesheating parasites. Those idiots!

Problem really is that this movie takes itself far too serious and tries to be more of a realistic movie though the story has absolutely nothing clever or original in it to justify this approach. The movie really doesn't work out too well because of this. It instead makes this movie work out as a boring one also since it doesn't have any redeeming characters or some fun or good tense horrorlike moments in it.It's actually quite amazing how bland and totally uninteresting the movie its story is while its concept itself doesn't sound that bad at all. Seriously this is all they could come up with? I'm surprised that a person greenlighted this project at the first place.The characters absolutely don't work out at all also due to its poorly and unimaginative written story. The actors also come across as bad ones because of this since the movie features some real poor dialog as well. Doubtful that this is a movie Demi Moore is still very proud off. This movie was one of the very first ones she ever appeared in and to be honest she was absolutely horrible in this which is as I said more due to the writing and perhaps directing as well than her actual acting skills. But to name a good thing about this movie it has some quite confusing looking effects and special effects makeup.

	schema:reviewBody "While I'm a creature feature aficionado I can safely say I will not be adding this to my collection unless I find it really cheap or part of a larger collection as this is one of the most ineptly made movies I've ever seen! It does have some historical value though being Demi Moore's second movie and more importantly for me Stan Winston's third. It is particularly interesting to note how familiar some forms of the Winstoncreated creature in Leviathan 1989 are to the Parasite.Unfortunately Charles Band seems an incompetent director especially considering this was his third feature. It makes me doubly angry that a promising director like Fred Dekker got his career crushed after a solid start by the single mistake that was Robocop 3 which likely would've been a disaster regardless of director thanks to idiotic studio demands yet Band has went on to direct Cgrade schlock one after the other! He should've stuck to producing since at least there he has managed to do some good like Stuart Gordon's From Beyond. Getting back to Parasite this movie also wasn't helped by the utterly atrocious editing meandering writing unbelievable characters or poor acting. It isn't even campy it's just inept and rather boring.If there's a single good thing about the movie in addition to the interesting if somewhat static creature effects it is Richard Band's musical score which hits just the right notes for an 80's horror. I recommend steering clear of this unless you're a lover of monster movies and want to calibrate the lower end of your rating spectrum.".

	schema:reviewBody "Veteran B level filmmaker Charles Band surely must have thought that one way that he could outdo Alien was to have a similar chest burster type creature come right at the camera. And so he did with this derivative but fairly amusing low budget monster movie made during the 3D boom of the early 1980s. The whole raison d'etre of this thing is to thrust gore and monsters into the viewers' face and on that level this is entertaining trash. The script by Alan J. Adler Michael Shoob and Frank Levering isn't so hot but with this kind of diversion that isn't too important a consideration. With limited means Band creates a somewhat desolate feel with a limited number of cast members and use of various isolated rural California locations.Robert Glaudini stars as Paul Dean a scientist creating parasites for a nefarious organization known as The Merchants. Karma intercedes when he ends up with one inside him and he flees into the desert taking assorted items and the other surviving parasite with him. But he can't do any research  experiments in peace because local troublemaking punks led by Ricus Luca Bercovici are always being a nuisance. Fortunately Paul makes the acquaintance of Patricia Welles ever lovely Demi Moore in her first starring role a young farmer living on her own.The cast is mostly good value. Also present and accounted for are Al Fann as Collins a diner owner James Davidson as the villainous Wolf Tom Villard Runaways singer Cherie Currie and Joanelle Romero as members of Ricus' gang and Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith in a cameo. Some viewers may wince at seeing Broadway legend Miss Vivian Blaine as she is billed slumming her way through this one. Glaudini is appropriately intense and fidgety while Moore gets by mostly on looks and likability.Charles' brother Richard Band does the terrific score while Mac Ahlberg a very busy man during this decade does fine work as the D.P. There are some fun 3D moments. The highlight or low point as the case might be for some people is seeing a monster burst through Miss Blaines' face. Stan Winston is one of the creature effects creators the work here might not be among his best but just think what he could have done with a bigger budget. The coolest thing in the whole movie however has to be the amazing looking car that the villain drives.If you enjoy this sort of thing to begin with you'll probably like this one too.Six out of 10.".

This is one of his movies before 1999 and I have to say it had a brilliant hook at the start of the movie. However after that it did introduce us that the movie was set in the future however it kinda dragged a little on about the gangsters and other surroundings in the future. Myself I think they could be able to shorten that bit five minutes shorter but then again slow movies do seem to express how the character's personalities well and I'm usually quite forgiving. After some 30 minutes of dragging on they finally get back to the story. Yay finally. And ever since that the movie actually started to become really good. So it is recommended you go see this movie even if it is a little slow in parts. I rate it 7.410.".

Granted his film PARASITE won't be held up as a groundbreaking accomplishment during his hitormiss career..most would argue more miss than hit but heck at least he got to make movies and a few good ones at that but it does represent the kinds of movies he would continue to make..genre flicks that are influenced from popular movies of the time. You'll hear comparisons to ALIEN I guess due to a stomach bursting sequence and how the parasitic creature attaches itself to victims. And the parasite favors the infant chestbursting xenomorph from the ALIEN franchise due to it's sharp teeth and large mouth but that's where the similarities end. Band wisely sets his film in a postapocalyptic desert on the outskirts of a fallen Los Angeles due to the disastrous effects of atomic fallout. It saves on budget to inform us through dialogue..and the radiation scar on the side of the face of a diner owner played by All Fannwhat has happened...how the government desires to attain parasites for corrupt purposes.Robert Glaudini portrays a very stoic scientist researching parasitical lifeforms responsible for their growth who maintains a stuck look of loss on his face throughout the film. As Paul Dean Glaudini relates to us that the future is a really dark place. Well Band goes further than Dean in showing the audience that his future is an unfit place to live. Demi Moore in one of her first roles doesn't really impress as Dean's only ally Patricia a young woman growing lemons  often fending off a hood named RicusLuca Bercoviciand his band of rejects who love to pillage raising ruckus because there's nothing better to do in the wasteland they live. Through the character of Ricus we come to understand that the government has drafted the youth in bigger cities for slave labor and those who escaped such an awful existence fend for themselves in areas like Joshua the setting of PARASITE. The villain provided for the film is Wolf the Merchant pursuing the whereabouts of Dean because the government demands for the parasite. It's established just the violent lengths Wolf will go to find Dean blasting innocents with lasers who stand in his way or smacking around Patricia to get information. Driving one of those Lamborghini cars with doors that open themselves and sporting a suit Wolf seems to clash quite a bit with the surroundings of Joshua. Oh the paper money doesn't have value in the future precious metals..specifically silverare what go for popular currency.Stan Winston and those he worked with create some okaytodecent practical effects..the parasite in a smaller form resembles a slimy leachsuch as one scene where the creature bursts from the face of a recently acquired victim. In the film the parasitical creature moves from one human victim to the next draining the nutrients it needs feeding from them until they are dead. Demi Moore is often the subject of conversation regarding early performances but PARASITE also features a young Tom Villard as well in a very atypical role as Zeke a member of Ricus' brood. Very minor effort from Band and company as both a creature feature and postapoc thriller.".

This is one Demi Moore's first films. Die hards might want to watch her in this although I hope they possess better judgement.2. Fans of gore might find it interesting since the payoffs are frequent  albeit extremely well telegraphed  and gruesome.3. 3D made a return to theatres briefly in the eighties and fans of the subgenre might want to check it out.Unfortunately my three reasons can be quickly countered. Moore isn't bad but she's still working on her craft here. I also suspect that this is one of those films where a fresh young actor concedes that yes the film is total garbage but hey I'm in the pictures ma! Top of the World! Demi was just working on her reel and building some footage to use as audition material for superior projects.3D is an interesting subgenre but a movie that employs the technique suffers damage at the same time. Very rarely has it been done well Hitchcock's 'Dial M for Murder and very often it has been done poorly. The main weakness is that it tends to telegraph when a 3D scene is about to happen. If things are starting to go slomo break out the glasses. In the 50's it was quaint in the 80's just corny and bad. 'Parasite' is one of those films in a distinct class. It managed to rekindle and destroy the 3D gimmick in the painful stretch of 84 minutes.Which brings me to the part of my review I like to call 'product endorsement' I was able to last through this movie by using a DVD player that has a countdown clock feature. There was comfort to be had in knowing that I only had to tough it through another shudder fortythree minutes.The acting in 'Parasite' is about what you would expect from ZGrade garbage like this. Actually that's not entirely fair and I should give credit where it is due. The cast is mostly game for the film and put up a brave performance in spite of ludicrous script and story elements. Unfortunately for us this film is a horrendous and cheesy 'Alien' ripoff. Or 'Alien' meets 'Mad Max' ripoff since they throw in the postapocalyptic wasteland thing. and the biker gang. And the goofy costumes.Many movies are so bad they are funny. This is not. It's just plain bad.".

A roaming gang led by Ricus Luca Bercovici and other members Zeke Tom Villard Chris Scott Thomson Dana Cherie Currie Buddy James Cavan Bo Joannelle Nadine Romero and Arn Freddie Moore doesn't approve of his friendship with them and steal the main subject of his experiments a container with a vicious parasitic organism inside. A corporate agent The Merchant James Davidson seek Dean out to return it to his lab and when the parasite escapes and begins to chew through the gang they race to stop it while trying to avoid being killed by the agent.The Good News This one is a really underwhelming film and has only a couple things to like about it. The effects here are among it's best features which the highlight is an incredibly messy and grotesque face exploding sequence when the parasite goes burrowing into the face as the amount of blood shorn and the impressiveness of what it's showing make for some really good moments. There's also an effective finger flexing hand cut off with a laser that keeps flopping around and there's some other notable kills as well. There's a really great pole through the body a couple chomped bodies a chewed through throat and some victim set on fire. The parasite itself is suitably nasty and messy especially as it drips sticky goo fangfilled mouth. The ending which features a lot of action and some really great setpieces is the film's greatest part really ending the film in a highnote. Beyond these features however there isn't much of anything else worthwhile for the film.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot to like and this wasn't all that terrific. The film's biggest problem is that it's just far too slow. The main town used for most of the film isn't arrived at until the twenty minute mark leaving tons of time for the introduction of everything else to come slowly afterward and the setups for the gang take too long as well. We're slowly introduced to them one at a time and this takes a while since the gang is pretty big and it just chews up time to have to get to know such a big group as slowly as it does here. The absolute lack of anything resembling action is another big hindrance since the parasite is loosened pretty early on but only slowly goes through the group and most of the time is spent with the two groups mostly yelling at each other or wandering around the town trying to avoid the creature or the agent. It gets old after a while and you just wish for the creature to come faster and attack the characters more often. The pace only kicks up near the end leaving plenty of time to wander if something will happen. The other thing that really doesn't work is the 3D effects. Naturally since most of the time there's no action onscreen the effects have to handle the majority of the rest of the screentime and utterly fail. There's a lot of really weak ones in here mostly just the obvious ones that don't have any reason to be plunged at the audience such as steel pipes after being impaled through a victim teeth from the creature during an attack and other such items. They're all pretty gratuitous and don't really do anything other than just be there because of the gimmick. There's other problems with this one but they're not as bad as these ones are and can be avoided or ignored.The Final Verdict With only a few mildly interesting parts about it this really wasn't as good as it really could've been and it's really only got a few appealing values. It falls right in line with the cheesy features at the time so it you're a fan then give it a shot but otherwise steer clear as there's far better ones out there of that time.Rated R Graphic Violence Nudity some Language and a mild sex scene".

His friend and companion is the sexually charged Spaniard Johnny Ears Franco Nero seemingly on a constant mission to obtain another notch on his bed post or should I say someone elses!. In fact unlike your usual Spaghetti Western hero he is probably more likely to be found in bed than in a bar brawl or gunfight.The two have been sent by the president to halt the uprising down south where a rebel by the name of Morton is rallying a rebellion to create independence and domination with the help of German backing.The whole emphasis of the story is the great bond between Nero and Quinn which is quite enjoyable throughout. Comically Johnny Ears is constantly throwing stones at the laid back Smith in order to get his attention. Ears' relationship with the luscious local whore Susie Pamela Tiffin is also a fine display of character play as their interplay changes from flirtation to sexual tension and from lust to love. Hell by the end Ears seems willing to quit his womanising ways and settle down with the blonde beauty.There are entertaining oneliners throughout all obviously left to Nero who is in fine comic form. As for Quinn the whole idea that a deaf gunhand can survive and be held in such esteem is entertaining in itself as he walks away completely unaware of the explosions metres behind him and sneaks up on opponents oblivious to the fact that the bells on a whores garter  given to him whilst he awaited the return of the promiscuous Ears from the local brothel  are jangling together.Aside from these highlights the film is fairly average fare. At times Smith's inability to communicate can be as frustrating to the viewer as it must be to Smith himself. The Director does however highlight this disability to some effect with silence at any time when the story is shown from Smith's eyes. Too much weight is also placed on the final actionpacked climax which goes on for an age with a maximum explosion count although it does contain a priceless moment when Ears is unable to operate the enemies' machine gun  a skill mastered to great effect by Nero's Django.In summary this is an entertaining little film high on cheese but low on substance. And there are days when that is exactly the sort of popcorn movie that you want to watch. If you are in that mood I was you will probably enjoy it I did!. But it is definitely more watchable than recommended.".

The movie of course is pure fiction with no historical basis.Anthony Quinn has always been one of my favorites and it pleases me that a Mexican actor has found such worldwide success. His AMC interview is well worth a watch.".

But the rebels and the general Martin Franco Graziosi have intercepted a message that a deafmute spy is in their midst . At the beginning there takes a place a massacre executed by rebel henchmen Romano Puppo  Luciano Martino against McDonald family and things go wrong .Pasta Western picture is set post AmericanMexican war but ignores the wealth of the authentic history and becomes yet another actionadventurehumor Western and this decent production delivers what it should .

And based on facts  as Deaf Smith was a soldier in Houston's army distinguished for destroying a bridge and there's actually a Deaf Smith County in Texas . Although it has some anachronisms as an out of time machine gun and hokey historical events . It is a decent Western with comedy  tongueincheek  action and plenty of shoot'em up  gunplay  explosion  and some moments results to be quite entertaining . Including a spectacular ending when our protagonists using a machine gun and a lot of dynamite execute a slaughter in which they take down themselves the enemy army . Anthony Quinn gives overacting as the deafmute Erastus Deaf Smith  to infiltrate and put down one of the growing rebel factions and sympathetic acting by Franco Nero as his companion Johnny Ears who must not only do Smith's hearing for him but must also conceal Smith's handicap . Acceptable support cast full of ordinary Spaghetti secondaries as Luciano Rossi  Goffredo Unger  Tom Felleghi  Renato Romano and Romano Puppo .

	schema:reviewBody "Whenever you have a lively Franco Nero or his clone Terence Hill in a western you've got one thing in your favor already. But that's the only thing in this film's favor. Otherwise you have the flat dubbing tinny and wretched music scoring and predictably imbecilic action scenes typical of these spaghetti westerns. First of all Anthony Quinn plays a deaf mute a casting decision on the far side of stupidity although obvious that his name would lend box office value. An actor of such ebullience and renown for his growlingshouting presence is reduced to pantomime. It takes you right out of the film in every scene because you keep expecting that famous voice to come bursting out any moment. And then there is costar Tiffin who plays a likable character but her voice is mostly shrill. Better if SHE had been the mute. And the rest of the cast is the usual standard issue Italiansontherange from central casting in Rome. The script is also standard issue with the exception of the deafmute angle so we get parts of 'Duck You SuckerA Fistful of Dynamite' and a Gatling gun finale ala 'The Wild Bunch.' The finale is especially bad since a platoon of gunslingers blast away at Gatling gunwielding Quinn with no discernible effect as if the act of using such a gun makes you impervious to all lead fired in your direction. Then there is the hideous music score that features two absurdly dated songs one during the opening credits that sounds like a TV commercial jingle for hair spray and a second one in the middle so derivative of Burt Bacharach that it's lawsuitworthy. Needless to say it's a tortured viewing experience to watch a western set in Texas in 1836 that is almost completely cast with Italians and features soft pop tunes from 1972. And how can you think of this film at all without scratching your head at the incredibly bizarre freezeframe at the very end? What in blazes were the directorwriterpowersthatbe thinking with that shot of Nero screaming in what should have been a sweettobittersweet final moment? All it needed was horror music. Yeesh!".

The films English title Deaf Smith and Johhny Ears attracted my curiosity but a film about a deaf commando gunfighter! set in a historic Texas where more people end up in Boot Hill than seem to live in the township was certainly difficult to believe. What could they have been thinking?...a 'deaf' 60ish protector of the countries president......I ask you! I see from other posts a few have enjoyed it but I'm with those who looked deeper and found very little. After a string of films just like this it's little wonder the Western genre was well and truly killed off. Leone's Cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli may have had an eye for detail but he obviously did not get the budget or the time to create any magic here. Any promise in the idea is quickly killed off with shoddy Italian and Spanish writing and film technique or lack off it A halfway interesting Music score attempts to give more than the script can deliver the song lyrics promise a strong idealistic storyline but it's not forthcoming In fact the music score not only seems to belong to another film it sounds somewhat familiar. The film wastes beautiful Pamela Tiffen and reduces the Franko Nero role to little more than a clone of the 'Trinity' films character and Quinn well he just appeared to be enjoying getting paid in his old ageItalians could not make intelligent films about the 'American' west even Sergio Leone's epic 'Once Upon a time in the West' while it looked good at the time in retrospect is filled with the type of foolishness that drags this work down to 'C' grade level The near ridiculous body count and callous way people are killed puts 'Deaf Smith' in the 'Dollar' film category. The undiscerning viewer could be impressed anyone else may want to leave town. Maybe with better handling....but I doubt it. TCM in Australia screened this as with most of their movies with the 'Automatic Sound Leveler' on... creating what sounds like a constant hailstorm in the background when noone is speaking. In this age of technical excellence when will they ever get it right? KenR".

Leone's Cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli may have had an eye for detail but he obviously did not get the budget or the time to create any magic here. Any promise in the idea is quickly killed off with shoddy Italian and Spanish writing and film technique or lack off it A halfway interesting Music score attempts to give more than the script can deliver the song lyrics promise a strong idealistic storyline but it's not forthcoming In fact the music score not only seems to belong to another film it sounds somewhat familiar. The film wastes beautiful Pamela Tiffen and reduces the Franko Nero role to little more than a clone of the 'Trinity' films character and Quinn well he just appeared to be enjoying getting paid in his old ageItalians could not make intelligent films about the 'American' west even Sergio Leone's epic 'Once Upon a time in the West' while it looked good at the time in retrospect is filled with the type of foolishness that drags this work down to 'C' grade level The near ridiculous body count and callous way people are killed puts 'Deaf Smith' in the 'Dollar' film category. The undiscerning viewer could be impressed anyone else may want to leave town. Maybe with better handling....but I doubt it. TCM in Australia screened this as with most of their movies with the 'Automatic Sound Leveler' on... creating what sounds like a constant hailstorm in the background when noone is speaking. In this age of technical excellence when will they ever get it right? KenR";

	schema:headline " Funny People not great but fascinating and complex";
	schema:reviewBody "I need to get my biggest criticism for Funny People out of the way here at the beginning it is not the movie the marketing campaign would lead you to believe it is. While it is true of the ads that this film is more than just a comedy and that it contains some heavy themes involving a neardeath experience it would be more accurately described as a dark drama punctuated by some very funny lines. But I suppose that doesn't get people in to see the movie.After all the film stars Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen who have wonderful rapport among many other uh funny people and is written and directed by Judd Apatow the director of The 40YearOld Virgin and Knocked Up. Of course the trailers have been playing up this angle but as my wife commented that's like marketing Schindler's List as From the director of 'E.T.' and 'Jaws'. It doesn't tell you much about the movie you are about to see.This beef aside what you will see is a very mature drama yes I said mature despite the rampant penis jokes reminiscent of the best work of Hal Ashby and Cameron Crowe. Sandler proves once again that he is a fine actor and his performance as successful movie starcomedian George Simmons is tonally similar to his fantastic work in PunchDrunk Love and Reign Over Me. A very isolated man made rich by a number of films that look like rejected Wayans Brothers ideas George lives in a castle of a house complete with an indoor and an outdoor pool. His only obvious human contact consists of photo ops with his fans and the servants at home that he keeps at arm's length. Early on he is diagnosed with a rare blood disorder for which no clear treatment exists. Death on his doorstep he begins to examine his life. He hates himself but that he let so many important relationships go to waste is something he hates even more. It's time for a change.Enter Ira Wright played tenderly by a slimmeddown Rogen a struggling standup who works at a deli counter and lives on a pullout couch and in the shadow of his successful roommates comic Leo Jonah Hill and sitcom star Mark Jason Schwartzman who also co wrote the simple acoustic score with Michael Andrews. Ira and George cross paths at a comedy club where George performs a selfloathing monologue that generates almost no laughs. Ira follows his act trashing George's apparent depression. In spite of this George hires Ira to be his right hand man as a joke writer when he decides to return to standup and as a general errand boy. The dynamic of this new relationship is unclear to Ira but it seems like a foot in the doorand it sure beats serving macaroni salad to soccer moms.What follows is a long road to recovery physically and emotionally. I say long because the movie runs almost 2  hoursa daunting running time for a comedy or a drama. Anyone who has enjoyed Apatow's work as a director knows that his films have become incrementally longer. At times I wished he would take the advice from the character Alan Tudyk played in Knocked Up as Katherine Heigl's boss who instructs her to not necessarily lose weight but to make everything tighter. I wouldn't know what to tighten exactly because there are many excellent scenes. No matter. I would rather sit through 2  hours of this than the same length of loud racist pummeling robots. I hope there are other moviegoers out there that share my sentiment.In addition to the great work by Sandler and Rogen we have Mrs. Apatow Leslie Mann. She plays Laura with great vulnerability the love of George's life left behind years ago when he cheated on her. She has since married the Australian version of George Clarke a hilarious if underused Eric Bana. They have a big house and two beautiful and funny daughters played by Apatow's and Mann's reallife daughters Maude and Iris who also played Mann's and Paul Rudd's daughters in Knocked Up. George and Laura reenter each other's lives and try to pick up the pieces much to the dismay of the reserved more morallycentered Ira.There is an awful lot of movie to cover so I will stop there. The screenplay while thoughtful emotional and at times hilarious follows a nonstructure that would infuriate Robert McKee. There is no threeact structure. There is no classic antagonist. The unusual pacing allows the story to unfold more like life in that way. I'm curious to see how this movie will be received by audiences expecting a typical Apatow film. The thing I appreciated most about Funny People is that Apatow takes huge risks with the ambitious goal of making a very serious movie with twice as many jokes as his previous films. That he more often than not achieves his goals is a remarkable feat and while Funny People isn't a great movie it shows you a fascinating side of show business and more importantly it makes one believe that we can look forward to a wonderful and varied body of work from an original and maybe someday great filmmaker.Funny PeopleStarring Adam Sandler Seth Rogen Leslie Mann Eric Bana Jonah Hill Jason Schwartzman many comedians as themselves. Director Judd Apatow. Running Time 140 Minutes. Rated R for tons of crude language and for sex and brief nudity.Consensus Expect a fascinating drama with fine acting and a few hearty laughs if you can handle crude humor. Just don't expect the movie they show you parts of in the previews.".

The little girls while enjoyable to watch are cloying and don't advance the story. And when a lot of screen time is devoted to the people playing games and generally goofing around you're no longer watching the charactersyou're watching the actors simply having a good time which further slows down and confuses the story. Seth Rogen's character seems to know what's right but his voice gets lost amid all the confusion until the end when we get an alltooconvenient moral finish that doesn't address any of the important issues raised in the film.I think this could have been a much better film with a lot of the meandering in the second half either tightened up or removed.".

	schema:headline " More Than Just Another Apatow Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll start by saying that I am a Judd Apatow fan. I've loved most of his movies including the two previous movies he's directed The 40YearOld Virgin and Knocked Up. I've seen each many times and they are two of my favorite comedies. This however didn't prepare me for his newest Funny People. Apatow has become well known for his sweet adult comedies but this movie is very different from his others. I would almost call it a funny drama. This has it's pros and cons. I don't think I laughed out loud as much as in either of the other two films but what I got in return is an actual good movie that's actually ABOUT something.I liked Adam Sandler before I knew what a good movie was as I grew up watching his lighter movies like Waterboy Happy Gilmore etc. I've seen him so much that he ceased becoming an actor to me and actually reached a point of selfparody. His role as comedian George Simmons is perfect for him because he's basically playing himself to a point. He gives the performance of his life even better than PunchDrunk Love. His portrayal is cold and confused angry and hurt. It's what a comedian might truly be like when he's not on stage. He plays it perfectly providing a likable character while at the same time showing us there might not be so much to like. He's the best part of this movie and that's saying somethingThe supporting cast is great as usual. Seth Rogan actually plays a different character than his other movies as Ira who acts as a great foil to George Simmons. Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill provide some great comedic backup including their hilarious fictional sitcom Yo Teach. In fact a lot of the laugh out loud comedy from the film stems from the many supporting performances and cameos My favorites being Marshall Mathers and James Taylor. Eric Bana is very funny and Leslie Mann gives an impressive performance as well.Funny People's only real problem is it's ambition and that's definitely the best problem to have. It's nearly two and a half hours and while I didn't have a problem with the length it obviously had to end when it did as there aren't many people who would want to sit through a three hour comedy. I wish it could have ran even longer as some subplots weren't fleshed out nearly enough. I really liked the romance between Ira and Daisy Played by Aubrey Plaza who is sweet and funny in every scene she's in but it was rushed and in the end cut short which is a shame because it's one of the best parts of the movie.Above all this is a real movie. It's success doesn't just depend on the amount of laughs it receives. Thanks to Sandler and a thought provoking story this is more than just another raunchysweet comedy. The movie will definitely divide people more than the others and I'm not sure it will find as big of an audience. Judd Apatow has improved tremendously with each movie he's directed and despite his detractors he's going to be the king of the comedy movie for a long long time.".

I really liked the romance between Ira and Daisy Played by Aubrey Plaza who is sweet and funny in every scene she's in but it was rushed and in the end cut short which is a shame because it's one of the best parts of the movie.Above all this is a real movie. It's success doesn't just depend on the amount of laughs it receives. Thanks to Sandler and a thought provoking story this is more than just another raunchysweet comedy. The movie will definitely divide people more than the others and I'm not sure it will find as big of an audience. Judd Apatow has improved tremendously with each movie he's directed and despite his detractors he's going to be the king of the comedy movie for a long long time.";

So when you see a movie with a title like Funny People you will probably expect a very funny movie This wouldn't be necessarily incorrect but misleading There are funny people in this movie it is just not a movie that is truly as funny as the title would lead you to believe.Adam Sandler as George is surely the highlight of this movie We think we will see Adam playing a serious role and for the most part he does. His character dying from a rare blood disease is brought up almost immediately so the movie moves right away.George decides to go back to the stage after making a handful of truly bad movies An obvious look back at Adam's acting career and bombs on stage but Ira played by Seth Rogen in a different kind of role gets some big laughs. George hires Ira to help him write jokes and a different kind of friendship but a friendship nonetheless develops.George soon gets into touch with an old girlfriend played by Leslie Mann Director Apatow's Wife and the two begin to realize how much they have both changed. She has a husband Eric Bana in a truly funny role and two kids Iris and Maude Mann and Apatow's real life children while George lives a life less fulfilling.The movie takes a real backseat to conventional rules of movies There is maybe at a maximum of two real clichs in this movie one mentioned in this review already and the other for good measure.The movie feels a little long winded running at nearly 2 and half hours and the characters are sad but interesting. Seeing Adam playing a shadow of himself is certainly a depressing site and Rogen doing all he can for the man that he admires since he was a kid no less is even better proving that Rogen isn't a one trick pony hopefully making this a bit more noticeable for his performance in The Green Hornet next year.The movie also has some great performances from Jason Schwartzman as an actor starring in a horrible television sitcom and Jonah Hill as a competing comedy performer.But there has to be a reason why this movie is ranked so low and it could almost be said of the running time but its coming right back to my first paragraph about ironic titles in movies. I suspected a laugh riot and got mere chuckles. The stand up is hard to enjoy being very oriented in genitalia humor and sex jokes doesn't make it really funny just repetitive.And I will be honest I didn't pay attention to the title business and felt rather disappointed. This is a movie not sitting at the dinner table with all the Apatow produced movies of the last three or four years like George he's sitting at his own table not quite like everyone else.Perhaps now that I've seen the movie for what it truly is a drama with some funny parts in it I can now go back and see if maybe I can look at it any differently.Here is an Apatow film different from anything he's directed written or produced lately and deserves to be seen at least once and while people will see this and perhaps not laugh as hard here is hoping Apatow doesn't lose face and give up on this kind of writing. Apatow can make characters more like real people and he needs to consider maybe doing a drama a little more than once or twice now that he has done it. If he doesn't he might end up like most writerdirectors who just get tired after awhile instead of trying out different genres of film regardless of what his Fans might say anyway.7 out of 10.".

So he hires an aspiring standup comedian to do his writing for him.It was as if they were trying very very hard to show just how unfunny starting comedians were. In the scenes where some standup was seen this would have been the opportune time to inject some comedy into this otherwise depressing and pointless movie. Instead you get bad jokes vulgar jokes and groaners.So the main character George Simmons begins talking to his now married with two children exgirlfriend who was the love of his life that left him because he cheated on her. Later discovering that he has miraculously beaten the odds and is in fact getting better the love of his life decides she will leave her husband keeping the two children and live with George. Ultimately having already cheated on her husband and slept with George she decides that he hasn't really changed all that much and no lessons are learned by either party. She goes back to her husband attempting to lie about having slept with him. Yes... Really... This is the 2.5 hour plot.The closest thing to funny in this movie was a very short fight scene between her husband and George that happens at about 2 hours and 15 minutes into the movie. There was also a ton of cameos of various comedians and on all parts they either failed to even have dialog or their dialog was utterly pointless and nonhumorous. In fact the funniest cameo in the whole movie came from a 10 second bit with Eminem. That should tell you something.This movie would have deserved a 5 if they had cut out some of the completely undeveloped subplots some of the inane and incredibly long dialog and made it a decent 1 hour to 1.5 hour movie. However after sitting through 2.5 hours of this move in the hopes that SOMETHING would climax and make me feel like it wasn't a complete waste by the end I was left feeling that this was yet another 2.5 hours of my life I would never get back.To reiterate there was just no comedy in the movie. Even the humor you see in the trailers when actually put into context with the actual movie still ends up being depressing.The 40 Year Old Virgin was brilliant and I loved it. Don't let the fact that the same director was involved in this crapstorm fool you into buying it. If you must see it rent it or better still con a friend into renting it so you at least won't be out the money.Javin".

Terrible.It was almost like Apatow took two completely different editors gave one the first half's footage and the other the second half and had them edit without seeing each other's work. The second half was painfully awful to sit through. Some people left the theater. Plot development was slower than ever everything was predictable.None of the characters were likable expect for maybe Seth Rogan's and the children. It didn't move me in any way possible plot was fairly pointless and dry satire was nearly absent and it relied on penis fart and sex jokes that were nowhere even close to Superbad. Sandler was OK. It was nice having lots of cameos James Taylor Eminem Tom from Facebook Ray Romano and Sarah Silverman just to name a few. But it didn't make up for subpar acting from the others.I thought maybe the ending would make up for the second half it could have been a decent comedy but it was formulaic and awkward. I've seen much funnier people in much more funny movies. Rent it and hope the directors cut literally cuts about 60 minutes off the film.".

The jokes are tasteless rather than funny and the sapometer is off the charts  making Pretty Woman seem like Die Hard in comparison. Seth Rogen and Sandler have proved to be fine comedic actors you wince at watching them sell their souls to Jud Apatow. If there were any justice this narcissistic and brutally maudlin film would ensure Apatow never works in Hollywood ever again. He casts his kids and his wife and shows them off adoringly. With every frame you can practically hear him screaming I have made it! I can make my own Heaven's Gate! I honestly felt sick to my stomach walking out of this cringeworthy film and was unable to sleep or develop an appetite for food 24 hours after. No movie has ever had that affect on me. I am ashamed to admit seeing this film but I feel obligated to warn people to stay away. Do not even rent for a buck when it comes on DVD. This is a total waste of time and is offensive in every way imaginable. I was one of many to walk out of the film before it ended at the screening I attended. So unfortunately I cannot give a full review although I am sure I missed out on it's overly sentimental conclusion and I don't regret missing it.

The duo that Sandler and Rogen portrayed so wonderfully from before fell apart and the film just ceased to be funny.If the film would've ended after Sandler gets cured I'd easily say Best Film of the Year but because they had to goon and on for almost another hour and a half about something that had almost nothing to do with the story really killed Funny People for me.

	schema:reviewBody "Judd Apatow's third directorial feature Funny People starring Adam Sandler Seth Rogen and Leslie Mann is not really about the titled Funny People but more about how their lives have shaped them and how they cope and try to change things.Yes the writerdirector of The 40YearOld Virgin and Knocked Up has turned in a decidedly more dramatic direction than his previous features but if you are willing to go in with an open mind the film does not disappoint. It is a touching at times even heartwrenchingly painful film mainly because the realistic portrayal of its characters and how corruptible they show the human condition as being.The film begins with George Simmons Sandler a wildly popular comedian who has done everything from standup to cruddy movies including MerMan and the babybodyswapping epic ReDo and has become quite shallow and empty from fame and fortune. When he learns he is suffering from a rare form of Leukemia and is told he may die he begins to break down. Eventually during a rather morbid standup routine he encounters struggling comedian Ira Wright Rogen whom was his following act on stage that night.Although insulted at first by Wright's act which mimicked his depressing routine Simmons eventually hires him as an assistant and cowriter for his material even giving him the opportunity to open for him.Their relationship as coworkers soon blooms into a pseudofriendship as Ira worships George and George confides his secret with him. Here is where the movie gets interesting.Up until this point Ira has been stuck with his friends Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman two other comedians but unlike them his career isn't really going anywhere. Now he has been presented with the opportunity of a lifetime but because he is so starstruck by George he doesn't necessarily recognize that the friendship is only oneway.The rest of the movie is a heartfelt struggle as George tries to rebuild his life despite his lifethreatening illness including coming back into contact with the one who got away Leslie Mann in a fantastic performance while Ira must come to terms with the fact that his new friend still has a lot of growing up to do.The film is quite exquisitely written and directed and the characters come off as perfectly real. It's very interesting to see a movie in the comedy genre that has the guts to say No sometimes people don't change immediately as Apatow does. The second half of the movie has some amazing scenes where we see how Ira and George's lives might turn out as we ponder whether or not George will learn from his predicament or not.The performances all around are amazing. Sandler once again delivers a jawdropping dramatic role as he had previously done in films such as the new classics Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me. Rogen also shows he has some chops delivering quite a stirring performance and proving he isn't just another funny guy. Mann has some amazing scenes herself and in a way reminded me of people from my own past. Other supporting characters including Hill Shwartzman Eric Bana as Mann's husband Apatow's children Maude and Iris Aubrey Plaza as Rogen's potential love interest and even the RZA as Chuck Rogen's coworker all deliver strong performances.The movie also has numerous comedian cameos as people who know and love George including Sarah Silverman Norm MacDonald Charles Fleisher Ray Romano and Andy Dick all portraying themselves which gives the movie another breath of realism.Apatow's growth as a filmmaker is also shown as this is certainly his most cinematic movie to date. The composure of the shots is expert and the stirring musical taste really adds a lot to the film.And while the movies does border on a twoandahalfhour running length like Apatow's previous film I didn't mind at all... it was certainly the quickest twoandahalfhours I've experiences in a long time.Overall the film is going to turn a lot of people off with it's main focus being on drama and not comedy but if you are willing to open your mind you will find an amazing tale to learn from and laugh with.For me a perfect 10 out of 10 one of the best movies of the year so far.".

I hate him but he's damn good in this. Still didn't save it from being this crushing overlong drunken rambling P.o.S. Seth Rogen is useless but I blame a lot of that on the script. His character is very hard to sympathise with throughout as he is jealous sycophantic traitorous and opportunistic.Superbad was great and his character I felt was the true tragedy in the movie. The movie clicks along fine as it deals with it's plot for the first hour and 15 and just when you thought the movie was about to wind down in a bar full of celebrity faces the movie literally loses the plot and introduces another entire romantic comedy's worth of plot  farce which mismatches pace with the rest of the movie  1 whole hour taking place over the space of one 24 hour period  while the rest of the movie took place over jumps of weeks months. Disorienting boring loud and lazy. A poor poor effort from Judd Apatow who I thought would know better. He should take a note out of Todd Phillip's book and take some time between projects to ensure they end up tighter more developed and funnier. His attempt to deal with complex themes such as the desire to succeed in a cutthroat industry terminal illness and unrequited love are better left to those sincerely capable of handling them. His handling is pretentious insincere and at best clumsy. Know your place Apatow! Everyone knows a comedy should never be longer than 1 hr 40 mins except in very special cases. This is not one of them.Appalling. Do not watch this.".

Seth Rogen is a dlist sitcom star who has unfathomably been given parts in Hollywood films. Adam Sandler is truly terrible and simply isn't a funny man which is unfortunate considering he does comedy. Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy had a certain charm but Sandler has lost that charm a long time ago and should really stop inflicting himself on the world. There is no story to this film just whiny thoroughly unlikeable characters whinging their way through 2 and a half hours of nothingness. It's like watching some really annoying people go through therapy. If you've seen the trailer it looks quite good. However by then you have already heard the best jokes and seen as much of the film as you need to. Avoid this movie at all costs.".

I think this film is an explanation about many comedians not all but many. It shows how comedy is often drawn from depression inadequacies a persons internal pains expressed through comedy. This film is fantastic in my mind it contains the humor along with the drama and while it may not top 40 year old.. or Knocked Up' it was wonderful. Expect some great cameos. great acting enjoyable storyline and the same Apatow crew that we now know and love. I give this film a 910 because it kept me interested kept me laughing and is a welcomed addition to Judd's resume.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone loves an epic. Check that bigtime directors love crafting that epic movie that spans over two and a half hours and will be remembered for that specific work of art for decades to come. At one point or another every director that hits the peak of popularity will attempt to make that major perfect film. With Baz Luhrmann it was Australia. With Sergio Leone it was The Good the Bad and the Ugly. With Charlie Chaplain it was The Great Dictator. With James Cameron it was Titanic. With Ridley Scott it was Gladiator. With D.W. Griffith it was Intolerance. And of course with Spielberg he had more than one attempt with Saving Private Ryan and A.I. as examples. All the films mentioned above took time took plenty of money and of course maintain a long running time. There is one final similarity none of these films were their best work.Enter Judd Apatow. Establishing himself as a big success story he sets off with a deep and engaging comedydrama about comedians. It would clock in at over 150 minutes it would involve multiple themes would have extensive long shots of characters going through emotions and whatnot and would pretty much be the defining film of his career. Only one problem it's rather bland. Funny People isn't that funny isn't that deep isn't that engaging and as a matter of fact ultimately collapses in the third act that refuses to end. Nobody in the movie was likable except for Seth Rogan's character and the addition of Apatow's family in the flick turns it into a heavy production version of a home video.Funny People follows a famous and extremely successful comedian George Simmons Adam Sandler learning that he is dying from a rare disease and his only hope for survival relies on a series of experimental medicines that has a track record of not working. With a grim outlook on life George takes a comedian under his wing sort of and starts making amends with all of the major people in his life. Ira Seth Rogan is the comedian under Simmons' wing as he tries to build a success being a standup comedian. But little by little Ira realizes that George's life isn't cleancut pretty and that George isn't the best human being even if he is the best comedian.The biggest problem with Funny People is that the film is supposed to be a mix of comedy and drama. Unfortunately the mix is like oil and water with comedy attempting to engulf the first two acts and drama taking over in the final act. Then the comedy gets a bit tiring with the same brand of humor being repeated over and over again by multiple characters. There are at least four comedians doing the same exact brand of crude humor with the lone female comedienne Aubrey Plaza not delivering a single laugh from me. A bit of variety would be nice. If one comedian can combine multiple ways of making an audience laugh George Carlin Dave Chapelle why can't five of them in one movie? Outside the comedy acts Apatow didn't add much humor to the storyline especially when compared to his other works.Adam Sandler is a superb actor when he needs to be. But this is an example of the writing undermining the acting. Sandler does a grand job as George Simmons but the role doesn't give him much of a chance to grow. Simmons is a prick pretty much throughout the entire movie making it the second time Sandler portrays a character that's way too jerkish to sympathize for Click being the second. Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman are two other examples of fine actors with little material and much room to be borderlinelikable. The multitude of cameos despite it being merely Apatow giving thanks to most that has helped and influenced him helped the dramedy a little. The best cameos are that of Sarah Silverman and Eminem.The infamous third act is where it all goes downhill. The third act is so pointless you could have stretched the second act a little bit longer and ended it right there. Sadly though this is where the epic fatigue is thrown in. Judd Apatow is a fine director but whenever you work with family it suffers just a bit. The shots and scenes concerning Apatow's family are longer made with more attention and made with more care. Leslie Mann's shots are at least five seconds longer than anyone else in the movie and there is an extensive twominute sequence involving one of the daughters singing in Cats. The kids and the husband could have been totally written off and the movie would not have been such a boreand would not have to be 150 minutes.Bottom Line What happens with epic films is that they run too long take too long to tell the story develop a snobbish attitude tests my patience and undermines and forgets all the skills and qualities that made the director famous in the first place. With the exception of Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg all the movies listed in the first paragraph were whether disappointing or were far from being their best work. Funny People can be jumbled in it was an epic massive dramedy that is much weaker in terms of writing quality and execution than 40YearOld Virgin Knocked Up and nearly every movie with Apatow's name.One can only wonder how much better and more focused Funny People would be if family wasn't involved in the filming. One can only wonder how much better Funny People would have been if they had chopped 45 minutes of footage and limited the extensive and sometimespointless cameos. That's all we can do. Wonder.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the current climate of contemporary comedy Judd Apatow is king. And while he makes a killing producing his real talent is displayed through his writing and directing abilities. While Knocked Up does not hold up cohesively on repeat viewings The 40YearOld Virgin remains one of the funniest comedies of the decade. While both films dabbled with the hybrid mixture of comedy and drama both were comedies first and foremost. Enter his latest foray of writingdirecting and a film I clamoured for advance tickets for Funny People.George Simmons Adam Sandler is an aging comedian hating the cards God has dealt him. He has no friends his career is washed up and almost immediately after the film starts is diagnosed with a terminal inoperable disease. Shortly after he begins taking experimental medication he meets Ira Wright Seth Rogen a struggling young comedian trying to live up to his roommates fellow comedian Leo Jonah Hill and sitcom star Mark Jason Schwartzman. With his life slowly fading George hires Ira on as his assistant to write jokes for him and begins to try and make something of his life before it ends.While it sounds more like a drama than a comedy Funny People does pack in the laughoutloud moments Apatow comedies are known for. While a lot of it looks like it continues the grand tradition of being improvised with whole scenes dedicated to standup comedy routines there is a great deal that appears to have been written by Apatow himself. Almost every joke kills because of how genuinely funny and outrageous there are. While the gross out humour appears at a minimum here the graphic content discussed within the dialogue continues to be as uniquely entertaining as it always has been. I found myself gasping for air at more than a handful of comments these characters make to each other they are just that funny.But a lot of the laughs come few and far between what is actually going on within this overly ambitious drama. And unfortunately it is one of the few things holding the film together.It is clear from the start of the film featuring old footage of Sandler as an aspiring comedian that this tale is very special to Apatow. But his desire to tell this story on his terms while aspiring to pay homage to his past and present as a comedian and filmmaker seems to come in the way of the film itself. Scenes tend to go on and on for no purpose at all and whole scenes seem to have been added to give greater depth for some characters but end up being entirely superfluous and useless. Apatow is well known for having movies that tend to be 20minutes too long. But with Funny People he seems to break his own rule and drag the film out 4060 minutes longer than it needs to be. The entire final act of the film is downright agonizing for how dragged out it comes off and how illpaced it becomes as it stretches on. I found myself checking my watch just hoping it would end sooner rather than later. At 145 minutes this just seems like overkill. There is no reason this movie ever should have been released as being less than ten minutes shorter than films like The Dark Knight or Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince.But the key detractor from the film is its tone and consistency. It never seems to be able to balance itself out as a comedydrama like Virgin and Knocked Up did. Apatow does not let the film gradually let one tone win out over the other he just crams scenes filled with both elements almost absentmindedly. In one single scene the film can go from hilarious to sad to hysterically funny to downright depressing in less than five minutes. After years of being part of film crews in some capacity either as writer director or producer you would imagine something as amateur as this would be totally out of the question for Apatow. Surely this sloppy brand of filmmaking is better suited for an earlier project as opposed to what should be a crowning achievement in a continually blossoming career? While the story and pacing is all over the place the acting fares a little better. Sandler playing a popular comedian much like himself delivers a devastatingly excellent performance as Simmons. It seems that playing a character that is so closely similar to his actual career was just what Sandler needed to prove he has not completely squandered away that promising talent he once had. The visual expressions on his face through pain and sorrow are almost enough to forgive him for travesties like You Don't Mess with the Zohan and Click. This is a very adult Sandler playing a role more mature than he has ever had before and he gives some of his best work to date within it. Rogen delivers a fairly well done performance as well but seems almost deflated in some scenes. He gave his all in films like Knocked Up and Observe and Report but here he just seems dialed down. Almost like he wants Sandler to overshadow him completely.The supporting cast from Schwartzman and Hill to Leslie Mann newcomer Aubrey Plaza and a surprisingly hilarious Eric Bana all give great performances but nothing extraordinary. It was interesting to see Mann in a dramatic role and while she is imperfect she does well anyway. The film packs plenty of hilarious cameos too some of which are just too good to spoil.Funny People is just fabulous when it wants to be. But for the most part it truly is a disappointing effort on Apatow's part. It is far too ambitious a project and just muddled with tonal issues that it just never accomplishes what it sets out for. Which is a shame.6.510.".

To us it seems like a rather familiar story.What Amanda Bynes is so good at is delivering clean and funny teen and family comedies. She is a very funny actress and continues to be respectable by not screwing up her life like most actresses her age. She's cute as Sydney though her tan was not. It was quite overdone in fact. Besides her the ones who steal the show are of course the dorks aka dwarfs. They are certainly adorable and we can't help but think that Sydney has found the best possible friends on campus. The downfall in the cast was Sara Paxton as the archnemesis Rachel WITCHburn. She just didn't seem quite evil enough for me. Crystal Hunt was also not that great as Sydney southern friend Dinky.There are some laughoutloud moments and oneliners. The most fun part of the movie is catching the fairy tale parts as they come. That and watching the dorks. Sydney White is a fine family film and will even work well for teens and it has a very nice message. However it never reaches any kind of high point and kind of just seems to go on at a continuous rate. Still it's worth a watch as a diversion from reality and back into fairy tale world. 610 stars!

	schema:headline " All right I get it...it's not going to make movie classic history...I loved it...going outside the box I suppose";
	schema:reviewBody "The cold hard truth is I knew walking into this film that I was going to come out smiling having seen a movie that I really liked that most people will not and will continually make fun of it. So I'll do something I rarely do and right this from just my own personal experience and how I felt about it. I'm a smack in the face sucker for teen flicks especially remakes of classics redone with the modern High SchoolCollege Twist...ie Ten Things I Hate About You Get Over it and now this one. Sydney White was just cute...it had some real tongue in cheek humor and didn't try to be anything but what it was...a genre inducing demographically aimed film that hits the nail on the head. Granted you have to let go of reality and accept the nearly insulting barrage of stereotypical clumping that the film provides but aren't all teeny flicks like that? I admit that while watching the seven 'dorks' I got a tinge of offensiveness creeping up because it is kind of harsh towards certain attributes even if they were made out to be the antiheroes of the film. The attention to adding in little references to the Original Snow White Story was pretty well done including a hilarious I thought it was hilarious HiHoe line delivered by a couple of the 'dorks.' Some of it might have been a little forced...the Poison Apple should have happened earlier on and the names Witchburn and Prince were almost a little much but even still the film is cute and funny and fluffy in all the right places.Every time I see an Amanda Bynes film I tend to rave about her. Yes I have a small crush...but besides that I generally feel that Bynes is a terrific young comedian who is terrific at dead pan humor physical comedy and has this real down to earth quality about her and she can still look terrific and movie star like. She's just damn likable which is why movies like this work for her. Sure I'd like to see her give some time to something maybe more serious but stick to what you're good at and this is good for her!! She's terrific as Sydney White a down home girl that is rough around the edges more than frilly but is still a gal at heart and you really just like her and want to see her kick some witch butt. Now I had some nasty things to say about the movie reviewers who commented on her appearance in this film saying she looked awful and fake tanned and Orange because what a stupid and shallow thing to go on about but I admit...there was definitely some issues with her appearance. She does look orange throughout nearly the whole film and it looks like a bad spray tan. Sara Paxton is a terrific villain for Bynes' Sydney White. She's pretty stereotypical as far as teen flick villains go but she does it well. I know she can do a spectrum of characters because this is a far cry from her performance as the naive and cute mermaid in Aquamarine but similar to her bad girl in Sleepover. Honestly I would have liked to have seen her got more of an appropriate ending in Sydney White. Keep your eyes on young actor Matt Long who made an impression on short lived TV Series Jack and Bobby and I think could have made a better Ghost Rider than Nicholas Cage. He's mostly a show piece as Tyler Prince and the object of Bynes' and Paxton's affections. Bynes' and him have good chemistry and he does a great job in the role for what he's given. I honestly wish I had the space to run down ALL the supporting actors including the 7 dorks because they did a truly terrific job in their respective dorky roles and they all had a certain chemistry with Bynes that was important. There were also supporting characters like Crystal Hunt who did a great job and the amazing John Schneider as Bynes' Dad.Truth be told no one is walking away from filming Sydney White a better or worse actor for having been on set and they won't ever see any awards quite likely. The thing was they were picked to put forth a certain appearance and performance and they all did it spot on and there is nothing wrong with that I don't think. Sydney White is just an example of know what you're good at and go with it. Bynes knows she's adorable and likable and can play this role same with Sara Paxton and even director Joe Nussbaum. This is his third movie of this type and they've all been exactly what you would expect from the genre and there is nothing wrong with that. I actually REALLY enjoyed Sleepover see my review because it shows what it is and it doesn't try to be anything else. And I like cute little teeny films...is that wrong?? I don't slap a 910 on this because it's a must see movie that will live forever and teach you something about life. I'm just going with my gut and how much I enjoyed it. If you like this type of movie and want something cute and fluffy...you'll love it!!! 910".

	onyx:emotionText "The cold hard truth is I knew walking into this film that I was going to come out smiling having seen a movie that I really liked that most people will not and will continually make fun of it. So I'll do something I rarely do and right this from just my own personal experience and how I felt about it. I'm a smack in the face sucker for teen flicks especially remakes of classics redone with the modern High SchoolCollege Twist...ie Ten Things I Hate About You Get Over it and now this one. Sydney White was just cute...it had some real tongue in cheek humor and didn't try to be anything but what it was...a genre inducing demographically aimed film that hits the nail on the head. Granted you have to let go of reality and accept the nearly insulting barrage of stereotypical clumping that the film provides but aren't all teeny flicks like that? I admit that while watching the seven 'dorks' I got a tinge of offensiveness creeping up because it is kind of harsh towards certain attributes even if they were made out to be the antiheroes of the film. The attention to adding in little references to the Original Snow White Story was pretty well done including a hilarious I thought it was hilarious HiHoe line delivered by a couple of the 'dorks.' Some of it might have been a little forced...the Poison Apple should have happened earlier on and the names Witchburn and Prince were almost a little much but even still the film is cute and funny and fluffy in all the right places.Every time I see an Amanda Bynes film I tend to rave about her. Yes I have a small crush...but besides that I generally feel that Bynes is a terrific young comedian who is terrific at dead pan humor physical comedy and has this real down to earth quality about her and she can still look terrific and movie star like. She's just damn likable which is why movies like this work for her. Sure I'd like to see her give some time to something maybe more serious but stick to what you're good at and this is good for her!! She's terrific as Sydney White a down home girl that is rough around the edges more than frilly but is still a gal at heart and you really just like her and want to see her kick some witch butt. Now I had some nasty things to say about the movie reviewers who commented on her appearance in this film saying she looked awful and fake tanned and Orange because what a stupid and shallow thing to go on about but I admit...there was definitely some issues with her appearance. She does look orange throughout nearly the whole film and it looks like a bad spray tan. Sara Paxton is a terrific villain for Bynes' Sydney White. She's pretty stereotypical as far as teen flick villains go but she does it well. I know she can do a spectrum of characters because this is a far cry from her performance as the naive and cute mermaid in Aquamarine but similar to her bad girl in Sleepover. Honestly I would have liked to have seen her got more of an appropriate ending in Sydney White. Keep your eyes on young actor Matt Long who made an impression on short lived TV Series Jack and Bobby and I think could have made a better Ghost Rider than Nicholas Cage. He's mostly a show piece as Tyler Prince and the object of Bynes' and Paxton's affections. Bynes' and him have good chemistry and he does a great job in the role for what he's given. I honestly wish I had the space to run down ALL the supporting actors including the 7 dorks because they did a truly terrific job in their respective dorky roles and they all had a certain chemistry with Bynes that was important. There were also supporting characters like Crystal Hunt who did a great job and the amazing John Schneider as Bynes' Dad.Truth be told no one is walking away from filming Sydney White a better or worse actor for having been on set and they won't ever see any awards quite likely. The thing was they were picked to put forth a certain appearance and performance and they all did it spot on and there is nothing wrong with that I don't think. Sydney White is just an example of know what you're good at and go with it. Bynes knows she's adorable and likable and can play this role same with Sara Paxton and even director Joe Nussbaum. This is his third movie of this type and they've all been exactly what you would expect from the genre and there is nothing wrong with that. I actually REALLY enjoyed Sleepover see my review because it shows what it is and it doesn't try to be anything else. And I like cute little teeny films...is that wrong?? I don't slap a 910 on this because it's a must see movie that will live forever and teach you something about life. I'm just going with my gut and how much I enjoyed it. If you like this type of movie and want something cute and fluffy...you'll love it!!! 910";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a rarity genuine humor is displayed throughout the film without using sex jokesraunchiness references. That's is what comedy films need to strive for which is clean wholesome humor unlike movies such as SuperBad Borat Wedding Crashers and Knocked Up. I know it's difficult with today's society to come up with clean jokes with what is shown on television now days which is why Sydney White deserves several rounds of applause. I can't even think of a college movie which does not have at least one dirty joke or being as wholesome as this film. According to an article Amanda is the one who told the writers to tone down the script and not make it raunchy. Amanda Bynes as the leading performer in this movie is phenomenal. She is hysterically funny as well as being cute as a button. Amanda is destined to have a long career in the comedy field since there isn't many actresses out there who can even do comedy. What Amanda have and not many other actorsactresses is her facial expressions. Her facial expressions makes the movie 10 times better. It's as if Amanda is two actresses wrapped in one.I really like Amanda's interaction with the dorks the scenes when they are all together...it's the best. Matt Long is charming as the prince. His type of character is rare in movies and in real life. He's handsome funny and do charity work. Amanda Bynes and Matt Long have great chemistry makes me wish they will date each other in real life.Cyrstal Hunt is funny as the airhead southern buddy of Sydney. The weakest link of the movie would be Sara Paxon but she improves throughout the movie. There is some clichs in the movie but what movie doesn't? Every movie borrows somethings from other resources. Another rare thing that this movie have would be that it actually teaches a great lesson which is to be yourself and not to conform.".

If you loved She's the Man then you know what kind of actress Amanda Bynes is and you know that she can make a great movie. Sydney's love interest Tyler Prince is the perfect guy. He's sweet caring gorgeous lovable charming and is not at all like a typical frat guy. He's crazy about Sydney because she stands out from all the sorority lookalikes. Sydney also meets 7 adorable and hysterical dorknerds who live in the Vortex a home for those who do not fit in. Sydney thinks that it's best if they run the Student Council sounds a little like Revenge of the Nerds so that their outsider voices as well as other nonsororityfraternity students can be heard. This is the kind of movie all teenage girls and maybe some guys will love. The actors are great the script is great and the movie is just fantastic. I'd recommend this movie to anyone for any occasion. GO SEE SYDNEY WHITE!!!!".

For that reason alone Sydney White was a huge disappointment for me. The real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters. In a good fun teen comedy its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly realitybased teen characters. In Sydney White this idea is thrown out the window.Amanda Bynes makes a fine Sydney but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress. I blame this on the script which makes her character too bland and restrained and on the hairmakeup department which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style. The seven dorks that Sydney eventually befriends are far worse. They are so dorky that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. They're essentially repulsive gag fodder. As is the story's Prince Charming who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be.Perhaps the film's biggest startobe with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes is Sara Paxton who's actually very good as the conniving Rachel Witchburn. It's just a shame that the scriptwriters didn't make her a bit more gray than black.The plot is basically that of Snow White. What kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a reimagining. The connections to Snow White are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown. Prince Charming is unrealistically charming the witch is far too despicably witchy the seven dorks are too dorky and Sydney is just too pure of heart. Now this is not to say that the movie is all bad. Though Bynes is forced down by the script she still has her moments. As does Sara Paxton who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes. Sydney's roommate named Dinky is also great fun as a character. It's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clichd to recommend.".

I drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute especially Amanda Bynes.Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick. The title should have simply been Revenge of The Dorks. Perhaps the sequel will be Revenge of the Dorks 2.".

As someone who saw Revenge of The Nerds in a movie theater I found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake of it. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute especially Amanda Bynes.Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick. The title should have simply been Revenge of The Dorks. Perhaps the sequel will be Revenge of the Dorks 2.";

If you are in the mood for a good comedy that will leave you smiling see this movie! The dorks were great and very funnyAmanda Bynes was hilarious as well the prince was very charming and Sara Paxton did a fair job also. Sure this movie will never win an Oscar but it a warmhearted teen comedy that most people will love. This is an excellent modern retelling of Snow White.".

She is eventually cast out and forced to take refuge in the Vortex a house for seven guys who are dorks. The dorks get fed up and decide to take control of the Student Council so the funds will be more evenly distributed.Dissing Amanda Byrnes'acting is like kicking a puppy.

I never quite understood the movie the first time i watched it. There were a few scenes that kind of made it a little confusing. Like I did not still don't understand the first scene how Sydney is working on an car when her dad is a plumber. OR Where Tyler goes into the library and asks Sydney on a date. That one song he sang I didn't quite understand. But now I do 'cause it is the first song that they dance to. But I still don't get how that goes with the plot.Any way. The other things I thought should have been fixed was the casting. I just did not think that Sara Paxton seemed evil enough to play Rachel Witchburn. Or Cyrstal Hunt just did not seem southern enough to play Dinky Hotchkiss to me. But the two scenes that I thought were are the best was the kissing scene and when Rachel gets Dekappaliaised. Those were hilarious!In conclusion I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars because it had a couple mishaps.".

	schema:reviewBody "D'Amato comes over all Tinto Brass in this tale of fascism and twisted passion set in 1930s Italy. A faded aristocrat military officer returns from the Abyssinian war with a dusky slave girl as a prize at first his bisexual wife and his secretary who is also the wife's lover dislike the girl intensely making racist comments about her skin colour and smell. But soon the girl charms her way into the mistress' affection supplanting both secretary and husband. This causes jealousies to fester.The aristocrat has other problems. He tries to make a career as a writer but this doesn't bring in enough cash to pay off his debts so he buys a movie camera and decides to make stag films as a means of income. Of course wife secretary and slave are supposed to star in the film. The two strands of the story come together in a film within the film as the secretary is sexually humiliated on camera by the two other women and a grimy old gardener. At this point in the film the slave girl seems to be gaining ascendance but the secretary brings in her ally the master's cadet son and they put the Other to death in flames holding hands as she burns in a perfect picture of that alliance between the middle classes and militarism which was political fascism.The film has many intriguing features. The slave's rise from household toy to manipulative mistress is a Steerpikelike climb which ultimately does her no good  suggesting that colonised people who play the white man's game will ultimately be undone in their European ambitions as the priggish rightwing white middle classes wreak their revenge. The aristocratic man's trajectory is also compelling from great white god as the secretary describes him through failed literary gent to pornographer  almost the trajectory of European society since the war which makes the film possibly a prophecy of the future as much as a vision of the past.The film is measured and plays out like a classy piece of eroticism but the drama continually brews away with shifting alignments and eruptions of desire always around every corner to keep the narrative moving. The film offers no succour to either liberationists nor liberals as it predicts the failure of individual identity politics alongside a portrait of permissiveness as terminal decadence. D'Amato's own gradual slide into pornography was in process as the film was made and with his muse Laura Gemser as the Abyssinian slave one could also take the film as a kind of mordant and resigned comment on his own career a cultured and privileged European male dragged down into a mess of pornographic pottage by his own financial needs and his putting before his own society a beautiful black Emanuelle.".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason in the early to mid 80's Italian director Joe D'Amato stopped making his swinging 70's Black Emanuelle films andor his gutmunching cannibalzombie films and started trying to make the kind of classy softcore erotica more commonly associated with his fellow countryman Tinto Brass. None of these films was entirely successful but this one might have been the least unsuccessful. A military veteran Al Cliver returns from a WWII military campaign to his rural villa in Italy bringing with him an Abyssinian slave Laura Gemser who had been sold to him by her father. Although she starts out as timid and demure Arab woman in a burka it isn't long before she is quite unbelievably sunbathing in the nude and seducing the bisexual lady of the house the military man's second wife Lili Karati. Soon she is running the entire household and it is up to a female servantspurned lesbian lover of the wife Annie Belle and the military man's grown son to try to stop her.The cast is a little weak since they are all softcore porn stars. Al Cliver was never much of an actor and since he is all of about thirty here is none too convincing as a middleaged veteran with an adult son. Laura Gemser was also not a great actress but she was somewhat underrated and gives one of her more game performances here. Unfortunately an Indonesian actress really has her work cut playing a North African character and one goes who through some absolutely unbelievable changes in such a short movie. The real surprises here though are Lili Karati and Annie Bell. Karati started out as a Miss Italy runnerup and ended up in hardcore porn but she was a modestly talented actress who gave a few decent performances perhaps the most famous perhaps in Fernando DiLeo's Being Twenty. She acquits herself pretty well here. Annie Belle was simply not an actress. In her 70's roles like End of Innocence and Laure she allegedly played herselfa hardly legal Lolita with a bleachblonde pixie cut who couldn't keep her clothes on for five minutes and would jump on anything with genitalia. She was Al Cliver's reallife lover and the notparticularlyreliable David Hess claims to have had real sex with her during their scene in House by the Edge of the Park. Anyway in this movie her pixie haircut and adolescent body are gone and she seems to be genuinely ACTING for once.D'Amato gets asgoodascanbeexpected performances from his porn star cast and as always his cinematography is above par cinematography was D'Amatos first specialty and one he perhaps should have stuck with. He was also well known for his generally fastmoving sex scenes and his incredible lack of political correctness and good taste. Unfortunately the sex scenes here are very LONG and the kind of standard mostly tame lesbian stuff that manages to make even the impressive bodies of Gemser Karati and Belle seem pretty boring after awhile. There is SOME tasteless politically incorrect violence thrown into the mix but not until the very end unfortunately when the typical audience member would have long since shot his wad and fallen asleep. Of coursesome do consider this one of D'Amato's better films. If you like his Tinto Brasstype stuff you might like this but for me it could have really used some gutmunching cannibals or something.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Alcove pairs Joe D'Amato with Laura Gemser and sees both of these cult icons at their sordid and sleazy best! Joe D'Amato made a hell of a lot of sleaze films and while I do consider myself a fan of his it has to be said that a large proportion of his output is rather rubbish...but not so with this film. The Alcove is as good a porn flick as it is a character study and that's what puts this film at the very top of the director's filmography  by not focusing on the sex when we do get to see it  it means so much more. The plot line is actually really good too. We focus on a country house where the house Mistress Alessandra is sharing a sordid affair with the secretary Wilma while her husband is away fighting Zulus. He returns from the war bearing gifts for the women and he also brings home a slave girl named Zerbal whom he was given for saving the life of her father. The slave soon starts to get used to life in the house and decides that she doesn't want to be the slave anymore. After noticing the two women having sex Zerbal decides to worm her way into the Mistress' affections...This film absolutely could not have been made today and the reason for that is the inherent racism running throughout it. Laura Gemser's character gets all manner of vicious insults thrown at her throughout though it doesn't really make for uncomfortable viewing given Gemser's obvious beauty. Her role here is somewhat different from the strong Emanuelle character we're more used to seeing her as although the role does become more like what we're used to as the film progresses. The film becomes an expose of sexual desires between five different people all pulling different ways and it makes for fascinating viewing the fact that sixty percent of the main cast is made up of beautiful women doesn't do it any harm either! The jewel in the crown is Gemser of course but her costars Lilli Carati and Annie Belle are very easy on the eyes too! Being a D'Amato film you can expect plenty of sex and he doesn't disappoint. There's not quite as much quantity compared to some of his other opus' but this is more than made up for in quality as the sex scenes are very well filmed particularly those between Lilli Carati and Laura Gemser. Overall this really is an excellent film that I would class as a must see for anyone who enjoys sleazy Europorn. It's a rare one but finding it is very much worth the effort!".

After noticing the two women having sex Zerbal decides to worm her way into the Mistress' affections...This film absolutely could not have been made today and the reason for that is the inherent racism running throughout it. Laura Gemser's character gets all manner of vicious insults thrown at her throughout though it doesn't really make for uncomfortable viewing given Gemser's obvious beauty. Her role here is somewhat different from the strong Emanuelle character we're more used to seeing her as although the role does become more like what we're used to as the film progresses. The film becomes an expose of sexual desires between five different people all pulling different ways and it makes for fascinating viewing the fact that sixty percent of the main cast is made up of beautiful women doesn't do it any harm either! The jewel in the crown is Gemser of course but her costars Lilli Carati and Annie Belle are very easy on the eyes too! Being a D'Amato film you can expect plenty of sex and he doesn't disappoint. There's not quite as much quantity compared to some of his other opus' but this is more than made up for in quality as the sex scenes are very well filmed particularly those between Lilli Carati and Laura Gemser. Overall this really is an excellent film that I would class as a must see for anyone who enjoys sleazy Europorn. It's a rare one but finding it is very much worth the effort!";

	schema:reviewBody "Alcove The 1984  out of 4 Interesting tale from D'Amato about a Captain Al Cliver returning from a battle in Africa where he was given a slave Zerbal Laura Gemser as a gift for saving a tribal leader. Back at home his wife Lilli Carati is having an affair with her secretary Annie Belle but soon Zerbal begins to come between them but it might be more than just your typical lesbian affair. I was really surprised with this film because it's actually very wellmade and features a pretty good story. One is probably going to walk into this thing expecting nothing but a sex romp and while there is a lot of sex it really never takes center stage over the story being told. D'Amato made a very long career out of sex movies so this one here is certainly a lot different than many of the items he was releasing around this period. What really stands out is the actual production. The film takes place during the 1940s so we've got the older cars costumes and set design all of which is extremely good looking. Another plus is the cinematography from D'Amato which to me is his greatest aspect a lot better than his directing. All of this makes for a pretty interesting atmosphere and most of the sex scenes are quite erotic though some enter a camp level. The film also benefits from an fun Eurocult cast with Gemser leading the way as the obvious sex object to everyone. If you've seen any of her films with D'Amato then you should know what to expect. Belle really stands out and delivers a fine performance as does Carati. Cliver God bless him is his usual fun self. What keeps the movie from being even better is its rather slow pacing and it also goes on a tad bit too long at 93minutes. I think a good ten minutes could have been cut out and we really wouldn't have lost anything storywise. The film is pretty straightforward and is wellmade but at the end of the day this here is still going to be for D'Amato completest only.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE BIG SLEEP has a reputation for being a film that gets lost in its own complexity and which fails to clearly identify all the perpetrators of all the murders that litter its scenes. There is a certain truth to this like the Raymond Chandler novel on which it is based the plot is extremely complicated and it requires the viewer to mentally track an unexpected number of charactersincluding two characters that never appear on screen a pivotal character who doesn't actually have any lines and a character who is frequently mentioned but doesn't appear until near the film's conclusion. There is not however as much truth to the accusation that the film never exposes all the killers only one killer is not specifically identified but even so his identity is very clearly implied.All this having been said THE BIG SLEEP is one helluva movie. In general the story concerns the wealthy Sternwood family which consists of an aging father and two pretty and pretty wild daughtersone of whom Carmen is being victimized by a blackmailer. P.I. Philip Marlowe is hired to get rid of the blackmailer but an unexpected murder complicates matters... and touches off a series of killings by a number of parties who have covert interests in the Sternwood family.Perhaps the most amazing thing about the film is that you don't actually have to pick apart the complicated story in order to enjoy it. The script is famous for its witty lines and sleek sexual innuendomuch of it lifted directly from Chandler's noveland the cast is a dream come true. Philip Marlowe would be played by a great many actors but none of them ever bested Humphrey Bogart who splendidly captures the feel of Chandler's original creation with the role of Vivien Sternwood Lauren Bacall gives what might be the finest performance of her screen career and the chemistry between the two is everything you've ever heard. The supporting cast is superlative all the way from Martha Vickers' neurotic turn as Carmen Sternwood to Bob Steele's purring hitman Canino. There's simply not a false note to be found any where. Although the film really predates the film noir movement the entire look of THE BIG SLEEP anticipates noir to a remarkable degreeit would be tremendously influentialand director Hawks gives everything a sharp edge from start to finish.Two versions of THE BIG SLEEP are included on the DVD the film as it was originally shot and the film as it was released to theatres in 1946. The actual differences between the two are fairly slight but they prove significant. Although the original version is somewhat easier to follow in terms of story it lacks the flash that makes the theatrical version such a memorable experience it is easy to see why Hawks elected to rescript and reshoot several key scenes as well as add new ones and both newcomers and old fans will have fun comparing the two. The DVD also includes an enjoyable documentary on the differences between the films and the motivations behind them.I don't usually comment on picture quality unless there is a glaring issue but several reviewers have noted portions of this print have a flicker or seem a bit washed out. I noticed these problems but I can't say that they in any way distracted from my enjoyment of the film and they certainly don't prevent me from recommending itbe it on the big screen television video or this DVD. And I recommend it very very strongly indeed.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Philip Marlowe is hired to get rid of the blackmailer but an unexpected murder complicates matters... and touches off a series of killings by a number of parties who have covert interests in the Sternwood family.Perhaps the most amazing thing about the film is that you don't actually have to pick apart the complicated story in order to enjoy it. The script is famous for its witty lines and sleek sexual innuendomuch of it lifted directly from Chandler's noveland the cast is a dream come true. Philip Marlowe would be played by a great many actors but none of them ever bested Humphrey Bogart who splendidly captures the feel of Chandler's original creation with the role of Vivien Sternwood Lauren Bacall gives what might be the finest performance of her screen career and the chemistry between the two is everything you've ever heard. The supporting cast is superlative all the way from Martha Vickers' neurotic turn as Carmen Sternwood to Bob Steele's purring hitman Canino. There's simply not a false note to be found any where. Although the film really predates the film noir movement the entire look of THE BIG SLEEP anticipates noir to a remarkable degreeit would be tremendously influentialand director Hawks gives everything a sharp edge from start to finish.Two versions of THE BIG SLEEP are included on the DVD the film as it was originally shot and the film as it was released to theatres in 1946. The actual differences between the two are fairly slight but they prove significant. Although the original version is somewhat easier to follow in terms of story it lacks the flash that makes the theatrical version such a memorable experience it is easy to see why Hawks elected to rescript and reshoot several key scenes as well as add new ones and both newcomers and old fans will have fun comparing the two. The DVD also includes an enjoyable documentary on the differences between the films and the motivations behind them.I don't usually comment on picture quality unless there is a glaring issue but several reviewers have noted portions of this print have a flicker or seem a bit washed out. I noticed these problems but I can't say that they in any way distracted from my enjoyment of the film and they certainly don't prevent me from recommending itbe it on the big screen television video or this DVD. And I recommend it very very strongly indeed.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer";

	schema:reviewBody "THE BIG SLEEP is one of the more entertaining private eye movies I have seen.  A dying old man has two beautiful uncontrollable daughters Vivien Lauren Bacall and Carmen Martha Vickers.  Carmen is being blackmailed and her father hires P.I. Christopher Marlowe the beloved Humphrey Bogart to get the blackmailer off her back.  But Marlowe finds that somebody else has done this job for him the blackmailer is murdered almost under his nose.  And as he puts it That didn't stop things. That just starts 'em.I have not read Raymond Chandler's novel on which this movie was based but those who have say the title refers to death.  That is never explained in the movie.  Howard Hawks packs so much plot into 114 minutes of footage that the movie feels like it's bursting at the seams.  The story is not incomprehensible as some would have it while there are many improbable coincidences there is no element I can point to and say That couldn't have happened.  Although I'm still not quite sure how Carmen got into Marlowe's apartment.  True the plot really is very hard to follow and Marlowe's periodic explanations of events without which the movie would indeed be nonsensical smack more of inspired guesswork than logical deduction.  But the furious pace at which the plot unfolds lends more excitement to the movie than nine out of ten of today's lazily plotted wouldbe thrillers.THE BIG SLEEP's greatest strength is its delightfully droll dialogue.  When Chandler writes the novel and then Faulkner helps adapt it you expect some verbal fireworks and you sure do get them.  How do you like your brandy? In a glass.  You're not very tall are you? I try to be.  I'm getting cuter every minute.  Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains.  Is it any of your business? I could make it my business. I could make your business mine.  You wouldn't like it. The pay's too small.  She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up.  Bogie and Bacall get two of the best exchanges they have a horseracing discussion where racy doubleentendres are dripping like savory sauce off of every word and they also get a truly hilarious telephone conversation where Marlowe convinces Vivien not to call the police.But THE BIG SLEEP has a harder side that is also effective.  It is shockingly violent for a movie produced under the stern eyes of the Hayes code censors.  The movie is too unpredictable to generate much suspense you can't dread something you don't know is going to happen but the ending is one of the most intense nailbiting scenes you'll ever see.The 1940s were not a great era for film music which makes Max Steiner's brooding score all the more impressive.  The print I saw was very lowquality so I can't judge the cinematography.The acting is wonderful.  Bogart gets to show his chops at one point by switching off the hardboiled personality he developed for THE MALTESE FALCON and impersonating an antiquarian bookworm.  Bacall radiates class whether she's at ease smoking in a cafe or outwitting a man holding her at gunpoint.  Martha Vickers' Carmen strikes the perfect balance of appealing seductiveness and outright nastiness.One final note this movie is almost Bondlike in terms of the number of appallingly beautiful women Marlowe accidentally encounters all of whom seem to have a burning desire for him.  Even his taxi driver wants him. Dorothy Malone whose character name we never learn plays the sexiest book seller you will ever meet and yes she wears glasses eat your heart out Dorothy Parker!. Minus fifty points for credibility plus a hundred points for entertainment.  Regrettably I cannot promise similar thrills for the female audience it just kind of depends on how you like Men In Suits.Rating 12 out of .".

	schema:headline " Classic private eye tale with Bogart and Bacall in fine form";
	schema:reviewBody "This classic of American cinema actually made during the war and released in 1946 got a whole nation of young men affecting Bogey mannerisms raising their eyebrows or showing their teeth while grimacing and especially pulling on their earlobes while deep in thought a smoking cigarette dangling between their lips. It was the genius of Howard Hawks who directed to do everything possible to make Humphrey Bogart a matine idol including having Lauren Bacall slump down in the car seat so as not to tower over him. With this movie a new kind of cinematic hero was created the existential PI a seemingly ordinary looking guy gifted with street smarts and easy courage admired by men and adored by women.Hawks fashioned this part of the Bogart legend with a noire script penned by William Faulkner et al. adapted from Raymond Chandler's first novel that sparkled with spiffy lines intriguing characters danger and a not entirely serious attention to plot detail. Hawks surrounded Bogey with admiring dames beginning with the sexy Martha Vickers who tries to jump into his lap while he's still standing as Marlowe tells General Sternwood and ending with the incomparable Lauren Bacall looking beguiling beautiful and mysteriously seductive. In fact every female in the cast wants to get her hands on Bogey including a quick and easy Dorothy Malone bored in her specs while clerking at a book store. Hawks also employed some very fine character actors most notably Elisa Cook Jr. and Bob Steele the former as always the little guy crook Harry Jones and the latter as often seen in westerns the mindless heavy with a gun Canino. Charles Waldron played the worldweary general and Charles D. Brown was the butler.I was reminded somehow of the old Charlie Chan movies with the dark mysterious ornatelydecorated interiors heavily carpeted and studded with ethnic statuettes especially the house on Laverne Terrace that Bogey keeps coming back to and the glasspaned doors and glassseparated cubicals of his office and others. The atmospheric L.A. created here has been much admired and imitated cf. Chinatown 1974 and L.A. Confidential 1997 two very superior movies that continued the tradition.In comparing this to the book I have to say it's a little on the whitewashed side and not as clearly drawn'confused' some have said. Of course liberties were taken with Chandler's novel to make it romantic. Chandler's novel emphasizes cynicism and romance takes a back seat to manliness and loyalty to the client. An especially striking difference is in the character of General Sternwood's younger daughter Carmen. She is vividly drawn in the book as something of monster a degenerate sex kitten who would try and do just about anything. She is twice encountered butt naked by Marlowe once in his bed. Being the sterling guy he is he turns her away. Right. I could do that. Another difference is in all the sleazy details about the lowlife underworld of Los Angeles that are omitted or glossed over in the film including Geiger's homosexuality and his gay house guest Carol Lundgren. Of course there was a code in those days. Bacall's character in the movie is actually a fusion of Vivian and Mona Mars from the book made nice for movie fans. In the book Marlowe kisses Vivian but turns down her invitation for more intimate contact. In the movie of course there is no way Bogart is going to say 'no' to Bacall. In the book Marlowe seems to prefer whiskey to women.Most of the sharp dialogue comes right from Chandler's novel including Bogart's grinning line 'Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains.' Interesting is the little joke on Bogart in the opening scene. In the novel Chandler's hero is greeted by the purring Carmen with the words 'Tall aren't you?' Well the one thing Bogey ain't is tall and so in the movie Carmen says 'You're not very tall are you?' Bogart comes back with 'I try to be.' In the novel Marlowe says 'I didn't mean to be.'By the way the film features Bacall singing a forties tune and looking mighty good doing it.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:reviewBody "Many fans of this classic film are drawn to it because of Bogie and Bacall who do indeed make a deft acting duo. Here Bogie plays Philip Marlowe the tough talking street savvy PI who has his roots in the crime novels of writer Raymond Chandler. Bacall plays Vivian Sternwood the adult daughter of a wealthy man. Vivian is just as tough and cagey as Marlowe. And she has a younger sister named Carmen who seems to have fallen in with a bad crowd. It's up to Marlowe to investigate and to save the Sternwood family from financial ruin. The Big Sleep is a story of blackmail murder multiple motives lies and all manner of general mayhem.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall are certainly persuasive in their roles. I also like the script's snappy dialogue. For example in a conversation with General Sternwood Marlowe responds Hmm. Sternwood follows up What does that mean? To which Marlowe fires back It means hmm. Marvelous.But the film's plot is an incoherent mess. It is hard to follow disjointed and has obvious lapses. Further secondary characters Geiger Brody Mars et.al. and their interrelationships are poorly defined. To some extent that vagueness and lack of precision are fairly common in 1940's pulp detective stories.The best approach to The Big Sleep is to engulf the relationship between Marlowe and Vivian marvel at the acting of Bogie and Bacall enjoy the witty dialogue and ignore the discombobulated plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Philip Marlowe is a private detective who is hired by General Sternwood to investigate a case of blackmail involving his youngest daughters' gambling debts.  The General has lost his right hand man Shaun Regan and needs a man able to do the job.  Marlowe investigates the blackmailer Geiger and tails him to a house. When he hears shots he rushes in to find Geiger dead and Carmen strung out of her head.  With Geiger dead Marlowe follows the trail to Joe Brody who also gets rubbed out and then to Eddie Mars who's wife is rumoured to have run off with Regan.  As he digs deeper Marlowe finds only corruption and deceit but also starts to fall for the General's eldest daughter Vivian Rutledge.Despite the fact that this film is overly complicated at times it still stands out as a classic bit of noir even if aspects other than the plot are what really makes it as good as it is.  The plot starts simply but quickly becomes a much more complex beast that moves beyond the issue of blackmail and into murder and lies.  For many viewers this will be a challenge  so many characters come and go in a short period that it is hard to keep track of how they all relate to each other and the fact that we're not always supposed to know the connections just makes it more difficult at times. However if you manage to make it past the midpoint of the film without having totally lost track of people then it becomes clearer towards the end. It may sound silly but this time I watched the film with a pen and paper to help me keep track of who's who  it really helped but it is worth noting that even with help bits of the plot will make little sense at times.The focus of the film is not the plot  the focus of the film I think is the relationship dynamic between Marlowe and Vivian.  In this regard the film really works well.  The relationship between is tough but trusting no matter what at times it is a little hard to see the affection between the two being real or realistic but it is the dialogue between the two that makes it work despite this.  The writing is fantastic the scenes between them do fizzle but the dialogue across the whole film is perfect it is tough memorable and basically it is the way I'm sure we all wish we could talk at some point in our lives!  The material is also quite daring for the period  murder and tough talk was not unusual but the issues of drugs and nymphomania are hardly common subjects for such a mainstream film at the time.The performances are fantastic and perfectly fit the material.  Although this is not my favourite Bogart performance I love him in Maltese Falcon he is still brilliant here he is cool tough and intelligent  at times his power over women threatens to be unrealistic but his presence makes it work. His character is not as complex as in Maltese Falcon but Bogart does harried and worldweary better than anyone else.  Bacall is great even if I don't personally find her that attractive she has a great chemistry with Bogart and delivers the goods.  Vickers is also good but in a less subtle role.  The support cast includes tough turns from Cook Heydt and Ridgely all of whom convince as tough guys but not to the point where they threaten to eclipse the shining star of Bogart.Overall this is a classic film despite the fact that the plot is too difficult at times and doesn't always hang together.  The flaws here are covered by a tough script that delivers the goods in terms of both dialogue and characters.  The plot is a complex web but the basic energy and relationship dynamics keep the film moving really well through scenes that continue to show their influence in films today.  Not a perfect film but a great bit of noir that is likely to be loved by the vast majority of viewers  just keep that pen and paper to hand though!".

	schema:reviewBody "Starting out I must advise that my review here is for the 1945 prerelease version of The Big Sleep which had quite a few scenes redone prior to it's release to general audiences in October 1946. With filming already completed by Spring of 1945 there were two main reasons for the year and a half delay first with World War II underway Warner Brothers felt compelled to get it's war related films into theaters while they were still timely. Secondly ProducerDirector Howard Hawks was convinced he had to reshoot some scenes involving Lauren Bacall who was critically panned in her latest film Confidential Agent with Charles Boyer. In the original print Bacall is presented in a few scenes wearing a distracting veil and it's her more glamorous side that the studio needed to capitalize on.Much has been made of the complexity of the The Big Sleep and deservedly so. On my latest viewing I took pen in hand to keep track of the characters and situations. That only helped so much. For example Humprey Bogart's character private detective Philip Marlowe is tailing rare book dealer Arthur Gwynne Geiger for his client General Sternwood Geiger allegedly holds gambling debts involving a few thousand dollars on Sternwood's daughter Carmen Martha Vickers. Following Geiger's auto to his residence Marlowe studies his surroundings and then hears a woman's scream and gunshots followed immediately by two cars careening out of the driveway. Entering the house he discovers the lifeless body of Geiger and a spaced out Carmen Sternwood. Out of this scenario are offered two maybe three possibilities. First General Sternwood's chauffeur Owen Taylor is implicated as he had fallen in love with Carmen and wanted to defend her from blackmail. Secondly a shady Geiger accomplice Joe Brody may have done it OR may have chased the guilty Taylor from the crime scene either to retrieve some incriminating blackmail film or to remove him as a potential witness. OR the spaced out Carmen could have killed Geiger herself and although this wasn't offered as a possibility in the film she WAS present and may have been entirely coherent when the murder was committed.And this is how the story proceeds. Even more characters are introduced to spin off the original plot and Marlowe is off investigating the proprietor of a gambling house named Eddie Mars Brody's accomplice Agnes Lozier the salesgirl at the rare bookstore and Harry Jones Elisha Cook Jr. a tail on Marlowe who gets rubbed out after setting up a meeting with Agnes that might provide more information to go on.All of the intrigue aside it's the chemistry once again between Bogey and by now Mrs. Bogey Lauren Bacall that propels this movie forward. Whether just sizing each other up at the beginning of the film or as unwilling accomplices and possible lovers by film's end it's the snappy banter and smoldering tension between the two that put the sizzle into this edgy noir thriller. As if to prove how great an actor Bogart was this film offers us a glimpse at his incredible range. Of course I'm referring to the bookstore scene in which Bogey portrays a nerdy client seeking information on a non existent rare book. With a mere upturn of his hat's brim and a cleverly positioned pair of glasses Bogart completely transforms into an almost unrecognizable comic character who befuddles and infuriates the store's proprietress. He follows that up with a walk across the street and a double entendre filled conversation with a disarmingly seductive Dorothy Malone in a scene that could have lingered into Xrated territory if not for the task at hand.One could go on and on about The Big Sleep and others have but to appreciate the film's mystery darkness and noir complexity you'll have to view it. But don't try to solve the case you won't want to hurt yourself.".

It contains no skewed camera angles and though it is darkly lit it is not overcome with murky obscuring shadows. The hero is not downandout poor or desperate. There is no retrospective narration or flashbacks. Yet the Big Sleep is widely considered to be one of the very best of this genre. It is a cynical perverse murderous world filled with loads of confusing action and unknown motives. It is in fact one of the great films of one of the screens greatest actors for my personal top 10 actors list click here and most talented directors.It was directed by Howard Hawks fresh off of the successful pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Becall in To Have and Have Not. The two star here again and it is easy to see why they made another two films together. Based on a Raymond Chandler novel of the same name many people complain that this film is incomprehensible. Somewhat famously it is reported that Bogart and Hawks after arguing over who killed one of the characters called up Chandler to get the correct answer. Chandler didn't have the slightest idea for the novel is rather vague on this point. It's true that both the novel and film leave many plot points as to who did what to whom more than unclear but there is so much style in both that it's hard to make a convincing argument against them.A good deal of the confusion within the film comes from the production codes in effect at the time it was produced. Chandler's novel deals with murder homosexuality heterosexuality and pornography. At the time these things were deemed unfit to show on a movie screen and so Hawks had to hint at them using various subtle methods. For instance when Carmen Sternwood Martha Vickers is found by detective Phillip Marlow Bogart in the novel she is completely nude and sitting posed for a hidden camera. Since pornography is explicitly against code in the movie she is dressed in a silky Japanese gown. There is still a hidden camera and its missing film becomes a catalyst for much of the action in the film. We must infer from the exotic nature of the gown that there was more than just pictures of a woman in a gown going on. There are many similar instances in the film like this. For an audience member who has not read the book they must pay close attention to the subtext or the film will seem baffling.Personally I am very much a fan of the book and all of Chandler's work. While I appreciate that some of the finer plot points are a bit vague in this film I also understand that the film succeeds not in the details of the story but in a sinister sense of style. The film oozes with a dark disquieting atmosphere. Nearly everyone Marlowe meets is hiding something and is of less than upstanding moral character. Hawks does a great job of keeping nearly every scene in the dark or in the rain or both. There are so many characters coming in and out of the shadows and with their own shady character that it is difficult to keep up.Bogart of course does a marvelous job as Marlowe. He seems to understand a lot more information than the audience is ever given. Chandler wrote Marlowe as a detective who sticks by his own set up morals remaining somewhat of a noble creature trying to stay afloat amongst the muck and sewers of the city. Lauren Bacall does a very good job portraying Vivian Sternwood Rutledge in a role that is much different than the one in the book. Like many films from this era they create a romance that wasn't really in the source material. I don't mind though because Bogart and Bacall really sizzle.What can I say that hasn't been said before? This is really classic noir at its best. It's got Bogart and Bacall. It was directed by Howard Hawks written by William Faulkner from a novel by Raymond Chandler.

It's a great film and if it's flawed by its excessive velocity it's defined by it too. Enjoy Bogart as such and Lauren Bacall for her sporadic appearances and for Elisha Cook Jr. for a brief wonderful splash. All the side characters even the ones who are clearly only characters are dripping with criminal drama. The photography is dark but never obscure the action is fast but never unreasonable and the lines are classic noir.In fact the dialog if you are paying attention is one of the gems of 1940s moviesreally witty and cutting and cunning. The movie is brilliant top to bottom if only you could keep track of what was going on. Suggestions Read the plot in the Wikipedia entry before you watch the movie a second time. The first time just dive and and get lost. It's too much fun to care if you can let go. Watch Bogart's delivery his physical presence his wherewithal. Listen to Bacall sing pretty darned good. Watch the amazing light and camera work Sydney Hickox with it's constantly moving perspective and layers of action. Follow the score Max Steiner which is appropriately restrained turning just slightly when Bogart and Bacall are in scenes together. Howard Hawks pulls of a quirky masterpiece here. You get to the end and frankly don't care too much perhaps about the outcome about who survives and what their futures might hold. But that's fine too. It might just make you want to watch it again.

	schema:reviewBody "In Los Angeles the private investigator Philip Marlowe Humphrey Bogart is invited by the wealthy General Sternwood Charles Waldron to a meeting at his house. General Sternwood who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge Lauren Bacall and Carmen Sternwood Martha Vickers explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody Louis Jean Heydt but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation. Then Sean decided to leave L. A. with Mona Mars Peggy Knudsen the wife of casino owner Eddie Mars John Ridgely but now Sean has gone missing. Vivian meets Marlowe when he is leaving the house and tells that she had borrowed money from Eddie Mars to pay for photos of Carmen.Marlowe follows Geiger from his bookstore home and when he hears Carmen screaming he discovers that Geiger is dead Carmen is doped and also a hidden camera missing the film with photos of Carmen. Marlowe brings Carmen home and when he returns Geiger's body is vanished. Then Chief Inspector Bernie Ohls Regis Toomey invites his friend Marlowe to go with him to see a body of the general's driver in a Packard that has been withdrawn from the pier.

General Sternwood who lives with his pretty and wild daughters Vivian Rutledge Lauren Bacall and Carmen Sternwood Martha Vickers explains that he has been blackmailed by the bookseller Arthur Geiger on Carmen debts in gambling. The general also tells that he had been blackmailed in the past by the scum Joe Brody Louis Jean Heydt but his Irish friend and shamus Sean Reagan resolved the situation.

	schema:reviewBody "If someone asked me to summarize the plot of say The Treasure of the Sierra Madre I could probably do it easily enough. Three men go gold prospecting and one of them goes nuts. But Raymond Chandler's plots of which this is one defy facile description let alone analysis.I understand that William Faulkner is given lead credit for the writing but I can't imagine he had very much to do with it. Faulkner wasn't sober all that often  Old corndrinking mellifluous Hemingway called him  and description not dialog was Faulkner's forte anyway.Anyhow I'm not going to bother much with the plot. Halfway through Humphrey Bogart as Chandler's private detective Philip Marlowe appears to have satisfactorily wrapped up the case assigned to him by General Sternwood. The misbehaviors legal and otherwise seem to have been explained to the General and Bogart has been paid off. But Bogart decides to poke around further on his own largely because he's fallen in love with Sternwood's daughter Lauren Bacall and she with him. If someone can provide a logical link between Bogart's love for Bacall and Bogart's decision to kibbitz in events of no consequence to either of the two I'd be grateful.Here's what Bogart tells Bacall in his office. You're trying to find out what your father hired me to find out and I'm trying to find out why you're trying to find out. Amen.And  let me ramble for a moment  what in the name of all creatures is Geiger the crooked book dealer up to? Blackmail somehow involving photographs of Sternwood's naughtier daughter Carmen the one who tries to sit in Bogart's lap while he's standing up. In Chandler's novel at least Marlowe manages to get hold of one of Geiger's books. It was filth says Marlowe  meaning pornography. Okay. That at least tells us what kind of illegal enterprise Geiger was involved in. Simply OWNING a copy of Lady Chatterly's Lover could wind you up in jail never mind SELLING it. The blackmailing business is a poor substitute because it raises additional questions the movie doesn't answer. Who was being blackmailed for what? There are too many other discrepancies between the novel and the film to bother with. And Raymond Chandler and William Faulkner are no more than popular pegs for the real author  Howard Hawks  to hang the story on. Bogart is nearly perfect as Philip Marlowe just as he was nearly perfect as Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade in the earlier The Maltese Falcon. Bogart and Hawks had made one previous film together but this was their last. Hawks didn't like Bogart's horning in on his supernally beautiful new find Lauren Bacall and sneaking off for midafternoon umm assignations.What one remembers from The Big Sleep is not the story but the characters and the exchanges between them. The Maltese Falcon at least had the search for the black bird to hold it together. This movie has nothing of the sort. Instead we remember Bogart imitating an androgynous book collector a scene that was improvised on the spot as many of Hawks' memorable moments were. The movie has a kind of slapdash quality to it that keeps it from becoming more than an entertainment. Yet  entertaining it is. It's filled with little quirky gestures mannerisms and apothegms. Hawks has Bogart pulling his ear while he's thinking. And it's a wonder that some of the banter between Bogart and Bacall sneaked past the censors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considered as a classic example of the film noir style Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep is famous not only for the complexity of its convoluted plot but for the high quality of its dialogs as well as the legendary coupling of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Oddly enough the movie's most famous traits were not in the film's original version and became the result of a series of changes and additions Hawks did to the film from the day when the shooting ended until the day it was released. The original version had less romance and a better explained plot it was only after the success of the two stars as a couple that it was decided to add more scenes between them and The Big Sleep as we know it was born. Time proved that the changes were worthy as now that both versions are available it is easy to pick a favorite. This review of The Big Sleep is based on the 1946 final version as personally I find it superior to the less convoluted original but definitely less fun cut.In The Big Sleep private detective Philip Marlowe Bogart makes a visit to Gen. Sternwood Charles Waldron an old handicapped man who has a mission for him. Sternwood tells Marlowe that he wants him to take care of the gambling debts of her younger daughter Carmen Martha Vickers as she is being blackmailed by a bookseller named Geiger an uncredited Theodore Von Eltz. Marlowe takes the job but before leaving he is confronted by Sternwood's other daughter Vivian Lauren Bacall who wants Marlowe to find out what happened to their former employee Sean Regan who simply disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Marlow finds Geiger and follows him home but the plot thickens when he finds Geiger dead in his home killed by a mysterious man and with Carmen in the crime scene while high on drugs. But this death will only be the beginning.Based on Raymond Chandler's novel of the same name The Big Sleep is definitely one wild ride to a dark world filled with gangsters femme fatals pornographers and drug addicts in simple words the epitome of Film Noir stories with the character of Philip Marlow as one of the genre's biggest icon. The script by the excellent team of William Faulkner Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman follows closely the novel's story but of course with many interesting changes and additions most of them being the exchanges of dialogs between Bogart and Bacall in an attempt to cash in in the couple's popularity. It is in this series of dialogs where the magic of The Big Sleep is as the focus on the relationship between the couple drives the movie and makes the complex ambiguity of the plot feel more accessible and enjoyable.As usual Howard Hawks' direction is direct and straightforward letting the dialogs to drive the movie but at the same keeping true to the Noir style of its hard boiled source novel. It is easy to notice that Hawks considered the characters to be more important than his story as the film focuses entirely on their actions instead of the results of those actions. It is this style what makes the film work as he makes sure that the many supporting characters of the film receive a moment to shine in scenes of great emotion and juicy lines of dialog. Visually the film is a textbook of how to make a movie in the Noir style with the excellent cinematography by Sidney Hickox being a highlight of the movie and the subtle yet appropriate score by Max Steiner creating the proper atmosphere of decadence that runs through the film as Marlowe gets deeper and deeper inside this dark world.Being that the screenplay makes the characters the main focus the performances by the cast are essential for the film. Bogart's portrayal of Raymond Chandler's bestknown character Phillip Marlowe easily ranks as one of the icons of the Film Noir genre in a legendary performance only equaled by Lauren Bacall's Vivan Sternwood. Their chemistry on screen was explosive and Hawks knew exactly how to use it for his benefit. The Big Sleep is certainly one of the best if not THE best film with the legendary couple. As many have pointed out Martha Vickers is a highlight of the film stealing every scene she is in with her delightful portrayal of the wild spoiled brat Carmen Sternwood. A remarkable group of actors make the supporting roles of the film to come alive each one of them adding their talents to the movie with excellent results. Dorothy Malone and Elisha Cook Jr. stand out among the rest by stealing the small scenes they appear.The overtly complex plot may be considered by many as a flaw of the movie specially as it is hard to follow at first and it gives the feeling of constant plot holes. However this ambiguous way of telling the story is just another device Hawks uses to keep the story character driven. It may seem at first that Hawks doesn't care too much for the plot and on a second thought maybe he really didn't but in the end this overtly complex puzzle reflects what Marlowe himself is experiencing and in many ways makes the audience to identify with the detective and his work trying to solve the mystery of who is blackmailing who. True it is certainly difficult to follow the plot at first but the way Faulkner and company have written the script certainly makes up for this difficulty.Probably The Big Sleep may not be everybody's cup of tea but personally I think that anyone interested in the history of cinema should give it a try. It showcases some of the best performances ever and shows Howard Hawks that famous Jack of all trades proving his talent and versatility in the Film Noir genre. A real classic. 910".

It seems to me that noir  what I call noir  is bigger than what it is normally tagged as. Its deep a new notion of how the world works and how we narrate it. I think like jazz its peculiarly American in origin. The backbone of noir I believe comes from a stew of experiments in the thirties with legs in the detective story and the movieaboutmovies or shows. It became more distinctly cinematic and tied to formal narrative devices with Citizen Kane. That's my story and I intend sticking to it. After that you can see how the young thing was shaped not entirely with deliberation. I think this was a milestone of noir and much of it was by accident.The books are based on one simple notion I believe that Marlowe was the only soul we see that isn't trying to force the universe trying to be someone. He just is. He just accepts the world and what it serves up perhaps noticing that the world seems to be designing coincidental impediments. These are created by us watching but that's another story.Plus he is primarily motivated to see what things are all about. Halfway through this he apparently solves the problem but still has to keep looking detecting. Now for the accidental amplification of the genre. Books nearly always are reduced in translating to film. There's just more space for more events in books. But with this type of mystery you just cannot take bits out. So Faulkner and partner kept it all in all wedged together. Its too much and confuses the ordinary viewer at least the kind who really wants to understand. But the whole point of noir as it has grown up is that fate is capricious and that the world presents some dark logic that we can't quite reach. We can sort out the shreds that fall from the sky but beyond is some machine that we can never see.So the fact that this movie makes less sense than we expect matters. I think it is an accident of talent that it wasn't intended. But its effective as all getout to be encountered with confusion just as Marlowe is though he gets to pull his ear. And we just get to pull our eyes.There's a strange overlay between the zen acceptance that Marlowe has for the inexplicable world and the fact that overtly horny women flock to him. I think the attraction is less the usual wisdom and strength but a similar sort of calmness that comes from simple recognition that the world isn't logical. Ted's evaluation Worth watching.".

The period detail the sharp banter and the suspenseful music the shady characters the lurking nighttime shadows...I could go on.Howard Hawks did make some great films and this must rate as one of his very best. It's become famous for helping to cement Lauren Bacall's lifelong relationship with Humph probably the most loved and respected and no doubt envied courtship in Hollywood history. The black  white photography is remarkably efficient and deceptively simple yet has all the detail and complexities it needs. There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally.ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs filmlovers or really anybody who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment  Permalink".

There's a real art in making a movie flow so easily and naturally.ALL those who even think of themselves as movie buffs filmlovers or really anybody who appreciates a fine film must see The Big Sleep at least once. It does come up on TCM occasionally and it's well worth the effort in tracking down the DVD. Comment Comment  Permalink";

	schema:reviewBody "I take exception to something that previous commentator David R. Baker of Missouri makes in reference to film music. He states The 1940s was not a great era for film music which makes Max Steiner's brooding score even more impressive. HE'S GOT TO BE KIDDING! Did he ever hear of Erich Wolfgang Korngold Bernard Herrmann Alfred Newman Miklos Rozsa and Aaron Copland all of whom did their best work in the 1940s? And Max Steiner himself was responsible for such outstanding scores as those for 'Casablanca' 'Now Voyager' 'Johnny Belinda' and 'The Letter'. The others had a hand in 'The Song of Bernadette' 'The Sea Hawk' 'Citizen Kane' 'The Heiress' 'The Lost Weekend' and 'Spellbound' among many others. In fact the 1940s is often referred to as The Golden Age of Film Composers. And another mistake Bogey is Philip Marlowenot Christopher Marlowe. As for 'The Big Sleep' I agree Max Steiner's score was an important ingredient. So are the quirky characters including actresses Dorothy Malone as an oversexed bookstore owner who seduces Bogey on a rainy day afternoon and Martha Vickers as the thumbsucking sister of Bacall a nymphomaniac whom Marlowe refers to as having tried to sit on his lap while he was standing upjust one of the punchy lines in the witty script. Confusion abounds everywhere in the plot that's as full of holes as swiss cheesebut who cares? It's all done in mockserious style with the usual Warner Bros. finesse in black and white cinematography. Only jarring note is the script's insistence that every female in the cast sees Bogey as a sex symbolsomething even Bogart would have found amusing since he never considered himself that much of a looker. He makes Philip Marlowe a believable enough character and the part fits him like a glove. After the preview the studio added additional BogartBacall scenes of hanky panky to give the film an added zing. It works!".

Once was enough I'd never waste my time seeing the film again.Now for starters don't make the mistake of assuming we have a problem with blackandwhite I've got dozens of noncolor films in my library. But how can you follow who all of the characters are what their motivations are why certain people who fall into the big sleep do that? Why did the little man have to be poisoned and what sort of poison is so powerful it puts you into the big sleep in less than a minute? Why does Bogart keep pulling on his ear all of them time? Why is it that nearly every woman in the film flirts with Bogart the way they do? Sadly when I began writing this I had said all I wanted to say and found I could not submit for lack of enough lines. Making enough was a challenge as there isn't much more to say to me than that I just can't see how anyone follows the film and understands a story in it.".

There were so many subplots and characters intricately connected it was difficult to follow. Such as the scene where the Sternwood's chauffeur died I still cannot pinpoint who killed him. Bogart encapsulates Marlowe perfectly and Bacall who plays Vivian Reagan is able to bring out a convincing performance. The rapid scenes and sudden actions by each character do not really leave any time to process what just happened. The movie does have an incredible score and sound effects such as the gun shots. But I was really not able to understand what was happening. Although the cast gives an incredible performance I really could not understand all the points of the story. Overall the music works perfectly with each scene and the cast does an admirable job the confusing plot cannot be ignored.

I have been interested in the genre for a while after seeing many attempts at noir and quite a few neonoir film that impressed and entertained me. Still nothing beats or even matches the real thing. I had also been wanting to see a film with the famous Humphrey Bogart so when I found this film at the local library and discovered that it perfectly fit the criteria I naturally borrowed it immediately. I was surprised by how interesting and entertaining this film was and the incredibly sharpnot to mention equally welldelivered dialog impressed me greatly. You just don't get that with modern Hollywood cinema. The plot is exceptionally wellwritten although quite complex which will surely discourage some potential viewers. There are a lot of characters to keep track of something that seems to just be a problem with some of these as well as neonoir filmsparticularly L.A. Confidential. The pace is kind of slow but not overly so... not like many other films of this period. Also it seemed more laidback than slow kind of like American Piebut of course there's nothing else that this film has in common with that... at all. The acting is topnotch. Bogart and Bacall are wonderful and they compliment each other perfectly. They have great onscreen chemistry. The rest of the cast all give convincing performances... I was impressed with Martha Vickers who was only about 20 years old at the time and this was apparently her first role that was bigger than a smaller supporting one. The characters are wellwritten and interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I believe that just about any fan of classical cinema will too. I recommend this film to anyone who can watch a good movie even if it is almost 60 years old. It's especially recommended to fans of noir Humphrey Bogart andor Lauren Bacall. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "The Ceremony or perhaps more accurately Ceremonies is often considered to be one of the finest works by Japanese director Nagisa Oshima produced for the 10th anniversary of the Art Theatre Guild studio. The film is mainly told in flashbacks recounting the familial tale of the rigid Sakurada clan and the lengths they go to in order to preserve their traditions going as far as over the bodies of the clan's own members.Like always Oshima doesn't stray back from pushing his political messages in the most unsubtle ways possible. The Ceremony satirically criticizes Japanese xenophobia and inbreeding to preserve the purity of the family line the decay of large families who use their traditions as a facade and the ceremonies themselves losing all merit even if they represent the only thing keeping the families together. The interesting thing is how restrained the film starts out with the same long takes polite characters camera stillness and reservedness similar to the movies of Yasujiro Ozu who was often criticized for romanticizing the Japanese society. Here through using the same cinematic techniques as Ozu Oshima subverts the common ideals and slowly unravels the web of incest and murder running through the clan through excessive ceremonies. The sight of characters sitting attached to the floors often turned towards the center of the frame occupied by the strict grandfather has never looked so sinister.The Ceremony has some truly fascinating moments like the pillow sex scene the brideless wedding ceremony or the ending itself all of which are a real punch to the gut. Unfortunately even though the movie is very emotionally powerful also thanks to the marvelous Toru Takemitsu score the plot itself is very hard to follow and the tangled web of family relations can be confusing. It's like you're suddenly thrown into episode 754 of a random soap opera and have to quickly adjust to what's going on. Thankfully while you're never really guaranteed to catch everything that's going on the movie does become a whole lot clearer as it progresses.One more thing  the opening credits last forever! I also find it interesting how they dedicate several screens to list the companies who provided the sake kimonos the tallest wedding cake ever and other items from the film. I've never seen a movie this old that has credits like these displayed so prominently.".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably less of a political allegory than it's made out to be in several reviews I've read although Oshima's jaundiced view of Japanese society does come through loud and clear. To me it was more of a human story seen through the eyes of the childlike innocent Masuo about the strange and fascinating relationships that develop within a powerful patriarchal and literally incestuous family. The movie starts out with a brief conversation about what it means to be a relative just someone you see at weddings and funerals which reveals itself to be deeply ironic. The narrative largely unfolds around a series of family ceremonies in which the lives of central character Masuo and his cousins Ritsuko and Teramichi intertwine thickly and darkly. Much has been said about the famous scene in which Masuo is made to go through with a wedding to an absent bride featuring the tallest wedding cake ever seen on film but for me the most memorable scene was when Grandfather gives Aunt Satsuko to grandson Teramichi to initiate him as Masuo who is obsessed with her looks on. Akiko Koyama as Satsuko becomes an otherworldly being before our eyes as she gently directs the process. One of the most perfect and beautiful sex scenes I've seen. In the end it is masterfully echoed in a scene between Masuo and Ritsuko but with a disturbingly different connotation  actually referring back to young Masuo's belief that he can hear the cries of the baby brother he says was buried alive when he and his mother fled Manchuria. Like most or all Oshima films The Ceremony goes off on tangents backwards and forwards in time from realism to hyperreality and drama to comedy particularly with a certain nicelyoddly placed spurtingblood effect and maybe doesn't hold together as well as some of his other work but it's definitely ambitious brilliantly acted brimming over with ideas wise bleak and despairing but also playful and darkly comedic.".

Reeves was best known for his title role in Adventures of Superman 1952 a role which he always despised in part since it typecast him as a cartoon despite it bringing him a certain fame. His June 16 1959 death by a single gunshot wound while in his bedroom in his Los Angeles home was ruled a suicide by the police the death which occurred when the house was filled with people. Reeves' story is told in part in flashback as Simo who is trying to make a name for himself with this case talks to or tries to talk to some of the players involved most specifically the wife of MGM General Manager E.J.

	schema:reviewBody "As someone who has spent a number of years preparing the definitive biography of actor George Reeves I approached this film with great trepidation. I had previously turned down several offers for the film rights to my own book because I felt it unlikely that those projects would result in a film truthful to the essence of the man I had come to know so well. All I can say is that the makers of Hollywoodland came as close as is humanly possible in the real world of moviemaking to achieving exactly what I would have hoped for  an examination of George Reeves's life and death that is true to the times he lived in true to the kind of man I found him to be and as true as possible to the most likely scenarios that have been projected to explain his death. While this is not a biography nor a documentary and while adhering to each and every fact of Reeves's life would have resulted in a film exactly as long as his life the artists here have done a powerful and affecting job of telling Reeves's story and have framed it in a fictional setting that illuminates rather than obscures the truth. In any event in any life there is what happened and then there is the truth and the two may not always equally serve our understanding of the event or life in question. It is true that Hollywoodland takes occasional liberties with specific facts in no less way than Shakespeare took liberties with the real life facts of Hamlet or Julius Caesar. But as Alfred Hitchcock said drama is life with the dull bits left out. What matters is not whether a costume is the right shade of blue or whether there's really a gas station at the intersection of Sunset and Benedict Canyon. What matters is whether the essence of a true story has been faithfully told. And Hollywoodland does a superb job of portraying that essence who George Reeves was what his world was like and what impact he had on those who knew him and those who only knew of him. Allen Coulter the director has done a splendid job capturing the era and has paid enormous attention both to period detail and to the details of the lives of the reallife characters. Only Reeves's fans and not even many of them will notice the pinkie ring on Ben Affleck's finger or the widow's peak in his hairline or the exotic Alvis auto he owns yet these are all completely authentic to the actual Reeves. More importantly Coulter has done an exemplary job of making Reeves into a human being one whose dreams we ache for almost as much as he does in the story.Adrien Brody as the fictional detective whose story provides the audience a window into Reeves's life is solid and manages to bring a little charisma to the comparative lowlife he plays. Diane Lane is superb as Reeves's lover the sexually hungry but aging Toni Mannix. And Ben Affleck does certainly his best dramatic work ever as George Reeves. In makeup and with his own matching cleft chin Affleck sometimes looks astonishing like the real Reeves. But more importantly he captures the haunted quality of the actor on a treadmill to oblivion as well as the immense charm for which the real Reeves is widely remembered in Hollywood. Although the script does not give any of the actors the kind of deeply meaty scenes that win Oscars some of the hardest work to do is for an actor to excel in scenes that don't require fireworks. Affleck in particular does so in this film and I think it does him credit. He is reported to have researched the role intensely and it shows. The performances of Larry Cedar Bob Hoskins and Lois Smith also stand out especially distinctively.The cinematography is stunning with the frequent flashbacks clearly distinguishable from the present day scenes without the distinction being glaring or even obvious. And the musical score is elegant and very evocative of the time.It is perhaps inevitable that diehard Superman fans for whom George Reeves is not so much a human being as he is a sort of superhero himself will find things to carp and cavil about in this film. As a researcher with over thirty years of indepth study of Reeves's life I can split hairs over details pretty easily myself. And I suspect too that some of the complaints will be about the depiction of things that are actually true but which don't show Reeves in a worshipful light. All I can say is that I have spent my adult life studying admiring and trying to understand the man whose story this film tells and I think George Reeves would be touched and proud of the care these filmmakers have taken. I highly recommend Hollywoodland.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was ten years old when I learned the shocking news of the death of George Reeves the television actor whom I idolized as Superman. I appreciated how Hollywoodland made this moment impressionable on the youngster Evan Scout Simo the son of the investigator Louis Simo pursuing leads in the Reeves case. For both me and little Scout the death of Reeves was an early realization that appearances are not always the same as reality in the world of illusion and Hollywood celebrity.Under the skillful direction of Allen Coulter Hollywoodland captures that moment in film history when the studio system was in decline and about to give way to a new and more independent period of filmmaking. Perhaps from his previous credits in directing episodes for HBO's Six Feet Under series Coulter was able to draw upon great location environments for a quintessential sense of Los Angeles. Much credit should go as well to designer Julie Weiss for her colorful costumes especially men's shortsleeved shirts that evoked the era of the 1950s in L.A.The performances were uniformly outstanding. Ben Affleck brings out both the charm and the raw vulnerability of George Reeves an actor of limited ability struggling and eventually succumbing to the pressures of fame. Affleck was the spitting image of Reeves especially in the Clark Kentstyle blackframed owl glasses. But the real strength of his performance was in his sensitivity as his character made choices that took him into deeper and deeper emotional waters culminating in tragedy. In the film's parallel story Adrien Body was a standout as Louis Simo the private eye seeking his own fame in trying to uncover the mysterious circumstances and motivation of Reeves' tragic death. The luminous Diane Lane was superb in the role of Toni Mannix the wife of a powerful studio boss and the lover of Reeves. I found Lane's performance in Hollywoodland even better than her Academyaward nominated role in Unfaithful.The film conveyed a moody atmosphere that begs comparison with Chinatown another film that recreates the essence of old Los Angeles. While not as brilliant stylistically as Roman Polanski's masterpiece Hollywoodland nonetheless was a compelling and indeed riveting drama. Although the mystery of the tragic death of George Reeves was not resolved in this film it nonetheless provided depth and complexity to the characters as well as a lurid illustration of the pressures and the accompanying risks involved in struggling to succeed in the film industry.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently was lucky enough to get to go to a screening of this film followed by a QA with director Allen Coulter stars Diane Lane and Adrien Brody each one of which did a fantastic job in their most recent performances. Coulter's first foray into film is a very successful one. His abilities with the camera from his experience like The Sopranos is clear throughout and is very strong from the opening shot of LA as it swoops into the house as police enter the crime scene that is George Reeves home. The cinematography by Jonathan Freeman Rescue Me Taken is very strong with a great contrast in shadows and a subtle yet noticeable difference between the two times shown in the film. Coulter also uses music and sound differences to establish the Louis Simo Adrien Brody and George Reeves Ben Affleck time lines as separated. The acting is all around amazing Affleck and Brody take their characters and live them both amazing. Affleck has a few moments where the Reeves voice seems to lapse slightly but it's nearly unnoticeable. Both near perfect performances and as for the rest of the cast there is not a poor performance to be found in this film. Expect a SAG ensemble nomination here. The overall style of the film is very interesting. Coulter describes the film as a film noir in the daytime and a film about a modern man. The story is beautifully told with a nicely flowing back and forth between George Reeves life up until his death and 'independent investigator' Simo's search for the truth about that fateful night. Overall the film gets a 910 from me because it was simply nearly flawless I left the theater very happy for having seen it because I'm willing to predict that this film will get some mentions come award time.".

	schema:headline " An ambitious actor in '50s Hollywood and his untimely death";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywoodland has probably brought George Reeves more fame and celebrity than even he ever dreamed of  imagine being the subject of a feature film when you were most famous for being the TV Superman. Had he lived into his seventies he might have been around for the renaissance of the old shows and stars due to the nostalgia of the maturing baby boomers. But he'd probably rather have it this way.Reeves started out in small roles such as one of the Tarlton twins in Gone with the Wind and before going into the service himself nabbed some good parts while the big stars were fighting the war. Like many young actors back then after the war his career had lost momentum. He ultimately landed the role of Superman and during that time appeared in From Here to Eternity. The film shows people recognizing him as Superman during the Hollywood premiere of From Here to Eternity and as a result of the audience laughter his role was severely cut. However many people state that Reeves' role in the final product was no smaller than it was originally. Unfortunately in the '50s once you were associated with a television role it was a death knell. When Jack Larson Jimmy Olson in Superman went into an audition after the series the director said to the others in the room Please don't embarrass this man. He knows I can't cast him or words to that effect. The actors today are more fortunate as the business has changed. It would be a steep upward climb if Reeves was to shake that Superman image. At the time of his death he was forming his own production company and planned to go to New York. He also wanted to direct.Hollywoodland stars Ben Affleck Diane Lane Adrien Brody Robin Tunney Bob Hoskins and Lois Smith. It's the story of slimy detective Louis Simo Brody  a man who sells info to Confidential magazine and takes lowrent clients  and his investigation of George Reeves' death considered a suicide. During a small gathering in his home Reeves went upstairs to his bedroom and allegedly shot himself. But many people believe he was murdered. Simo plays out different scenarios in his head with different suspects as he searches for evidence and motives. There were several people in Reeves' life who had motives Reeves' longtime girlfriend Toni Mannix wife of studio exec Eddie Mannix a man with an unsavory past known by MGM as The Fixer Mannix himself who was suspected of being involved in the death of Jean Harlow's husband Paul Bern and later on of faking a car accident in which Toni was killed and Leonore Lemmon George's young girlfriend toward the end of his life who expected to marry George. In the midst of his investigation Simo has problems with a seedy client as well as difficulties relating with his young son.This is a beautifully produced film with some marvelous performances particularly from Diane Lane Bob Hoskins and Ben Affleck. Affleck's resemblance to Reeves in some scenes is scary  particularly as Clark Kent! Affleck even had Reeves' vocal rhythm. An excellent performance and hopefully one that will lead to some better films and roles for him. As Toni Lane is superb  sexy tough and completely possessive of George Bob Hoskins is great as the bombastic thuglike Eddie Mannix. Robin Tunney makes a gorgeous Leonore a cheap lowlife. Adrien Brody's Louis Simo is probably more cerebral than most detectives of this type but he's still good. The problem is not so much in his performance as it is that his storyline is intrusive.The scenes filming The Adventures of Superman are fantastic and I for one wanted to see more. Hollywoodland captures the reality of making a television show back then and evokes the atmosphere of Hollywood in the '50s beautifully. However it moved slowly and there was too much of Brody's problems and too little of George's relationships. While it was an interesting film and very worthwhile it just didn't hang together as one would have hoped.Reeves' friend Jack Larson portrayed in the film by Joseph Adam who was an adviser on the film read several versions of the script and met with the actors. His biggest concern was that the film not put Toni Mannix with whom he was very close in a bad light. Larson was very very impressed by Ben Affleck's intelligence and personality and thought all of the acting was topnotch. One thing he was sure of  Reeves never had any intention of marrying Leonore Lemmon. George lived big Larson said but it was Toni's money. He adds No one wants to listen to me...He committed suicide.".

When Reeves body is found Simo looks into the apparent suicide and starts to uncover very disturbing things including the torrid affair Reeves was having with Toni Mannix Diane Lane.The film is superbly acted. Everyone here is at the top of their game. Affleck and Brody have never been better and Bob Hoskins is very intimidating as Ed Mannix Diane Lane's husband. But it is Diane Lane who gives the standout performance here as a woman who starts off as a confident seducer and ends as a volatile and distraught shell. It is an amazing performance that is both sexy and heartwrenching. Affleck is also touching and sympathetic as Reeves.The cinematography is amazing and the story is intelligently written and told. It manages to be both fascinating interesting and entertaining. The films 126 minutes fly by and the film is very engrossing. Top that with some great performances including an Oscar worthy turn by Diane Lane and you have one of the best films of 2006 so far. 1010.".

Ben Affleck does a phenomenal job in portraying Reeves. He creates a thoroughly likable funny rather intelligent bloke who while he doesn't take himself or life too seriously would like to make something of himself in his profession. His story of a bittersweet success that traps him is very compelling. Diane Lane is also excellent as his somewhat desperate and sometimes calculating married mistress. All the people in the Reeves part of the movie are excellent and the film looks really good.Now for the bad news. Adrien Brody alas is not remotely convincing as a detective in any time place era or circumstance. The only point in the movie where I felt he was not out of place is when he gets beaten by thugs. Brody unfortunately for him looks like a natural victim. I like to say he has a face like a question mark. He can play a scholar a musician a poet a writer a scientist  but NOT a man of action King Kong was also dreadful or a detective. He's simply not believable in this type of role. No reflection on his acting ability  to some extent you have to LOOK the part. Try putting Orlando Bloom into one of Russell Crowe's roles and vice versa. Doesn't work.The whole BrodySimo part of the movie is trite and hackneyed. We don't need to know about his domestic situation and I for one don't give a damn Scarlett. The whole separateddivorced father trying to connect with his alienated son and being thwarted by his bitchy wife is just so old and formulaic and unnecessary especially when placed against the freshness and vitality of the Reeves plot. No we don't learn anything more than we need to know about this character through his pathetic domestic situation and I don't care what kind of lessons he supposedly learns at the end. It's like Movie Psychobabble Script for Dummies 101. I'd love to get my hands on this film and just gut the whole Adrien Brody story line and fill out the Reeves story line.Alas Hollywood will never stop reaching for sentimentality and manipulating us. Just tell the story  that's enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "You would wonder why a movie looking at the 1959 suicide or possible murder of a moderately well known actor would take over two hours running time to tell the story. It's because the movie is really two stories run side by side. There are flashback sequences of George Reeves Ben Affleck in the last few years of his life inter cut with scenes of a private eye trying to uncover facts about the actor's death.The story line about the sleazy detective Adrien Brody with some hot shot self important attitude adds nothing and just bogs down the pacing of the film. In truth he's nothing but a twobit nobody that sticks big wads of gum in his ugly mouth and tries to accuse and exploit everybody in sight even the mother of George Reeves who hired him in the first place. As if that isn't enough you're subjected to the longsince overused clich of a divorced dad's problems with his ex and son. Nobody cares. I kept hoping somebody would beat the daylights out of this idiot and reduce his ego a few hundred notches. These scenes rarely address or reveal anything about the mystery. Apparently this whole scenario illustrates a parallel between this character and Reeves himself but so what?On the other hand the Reeves biography is well executed. The latterday version of film noor is utilized deep brownishorange hues employed to indicate period and mood rather than the original blackandwhite technique. It works although the retro classic BW would probably have been better for a murder mystery like this. Affleck rises from the ashes of Gigli and Pearl Harbor and other duds to give a great performance. Any fan of the original Superman TV series would immediately see he did his homework in researching Reeves. Subtleties such as the sly grin and the speed of his speech matched the real Reeves well. When he had the Clark Kent glasses on especially the effect was almost eerie. Diane Lane is spectacular with her aging starlet style character. Other actors in the cast shine as well.Superior acting an intriguing famous mystery retro film noor styling these were great and should have been enough. The excess baggage detective scenes detract from the movie but it's still good enough to watch. It might be better to wait for the DVD releaseyou could fast forward though all the superfluous scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "As if it was almost specifically planned out we now have Hollywoodland another Superman related film only a few months after Superman Returns. And fortunately enough that is where the comparisons end unlike the upcoming Infamous and last year's coincidentally familiar Capote. While being heavily flawed Hollywoodland succeeds in more than a few respects and is rightfully worth a watch at some point.The film book ends with the death of George Reeves Ben Affleck the actor who portrayed Superman in the 1950s television show. His death was ruled a suicide but the film stands tall as a question to this. Told in parallel story format the film follows both fictional private detective Louis Simo Adrien Brody as he tries to uncover more of the hidden pieces of Reeves' death and Reeves himself as he rises from actor for hire to a superstar thanks to the wife Diane Lane of a studio head Bob Hoskins.The death of Reeves and the subsequent Superman Curse has built up quite the controversy and publicity over the years so it should be no surprise that someone finally took the liberty to make a film about it. But what screenwriter Paul Bernbaum has done here is unsuccessfully blend fiction with fact. While all of the sequences involving Reeves actually happened everything with Simo did not. This has been done fairly well in the past but here it just is a mixed bag. While the film throws multiple theories and multiple facts at you through Simo and the colourful cast of characters he meets there is just a foreboding sense that something just feels off. You just know you are not getting an accurate picture of what was going on and thus the film just does not work on the level that it should. It also stretches the length of the film way past where it should have ended.The scenes involving Reeves rise and eventual downfall however are quite spectacular. While you just cannot feel for anything happening on the fictional end of the story you actually really get a deep sense of what was going on with Reeves. It is absolutely fascinating to watch the events unfold and these are literally the best scenes in the film. Unfortunately however they come short and sweet between the scenes involving SImo and thus end abruptly. Some scenes even involve some pretty fairly important plot points and if they are not addressed during the scenes with Simo they just are never gone back to again. It just seems like they had a basic outline and frame for the film and they did not want to go anywhere outside of it.The sets and look of the film are feel invested within the 1940s and 1950s and make the film look authentic. Cars buildings and costumes all look plucked right out from that time period and all are well converted to look good enough in a film made in 2006. The cinematography portraying an earlier age of Hollywood is superb in its execution and helps allow the film to feel even more authentic. The Superman suits all look especially great as does the aged looking footage involving Affleck playing Reeves in From Here to Eternity and The Adventures of Superman.Brody has seen much better days than he does here. His character goes through more than a few changes during the film and he just cannot show the same range that he did when he won Best Actor for The Pianist only four years ago. His expression and demeanour basically stay the same throughout the movie and because of how sloppy the scenes involving Simo are his performance really takes a beating. The movie falters totally while in his care and if there was no real sequences involving Reeves the film would just not work at all. Thankfully that is not the case. The supporting cast are fairly solid in their almost minuscule roles but sadly Lane and Hoskins feel totally underused. While Lane does an adequate job as always in her limited screen time Hoskins practically breathes excellence with what he does. In a few instances he looks sounds and feels downright evil. I would have enjoyed a lot more of him had there been more for him to do.But easily the best thing about the entire film is Affleck as George Reeves. We will never see Affleck dawn the cape of the Man of Steel but we get a great look at what he would look like if he ever had the chance and then some. He is electrifying in the role and allows his character to grow and evolve properly throughout the entire film unlike Brody. He may not be on the screen the whole time but he makes the fascinating Reeves story even greater with his performance. This is definitely the one acting spot that critics have been waiting for from Affleck for years. His delivery of the dialogue is pitch perfect and when the film gets particularly emotional he only gets better.He is the Man of Steel and more importantly he is George Reeves.And I am unsure if this is with all prints of the film but the one I saw had the boom mike blatantly visible for a good chunk of the film. It was jarringly distracting too.As an allaround film Hollywoodland is not all that great and I really wish that they fought harder for the much better title Truth Justice and the American Way. The key fictional story is totally off and the fascinating true story of Reeves just does not feel like it is anywhere near as important as the fictional one. It does feel authentic however and we will probably never see a better performance out of Affleck. So at least it has that to say for itself.6.510.".

His low rent life and the second case he was investigating with the crazy man who ultimately murders his wife were unnecessary and distracting. And why would a cute blonde actress hang out with a poor unattractive rude detective? Diane Lane did do a fantastic job and Ben Affleck came across well in showing Reeves as a frustrated shouldabeen major star. In fact Reeves is as well known if not better known today than many of the major stars of his time. I saw this at the Big Newport a huge theater and only about 15 other people were in the giant auditorium to watch it with us. Several left before the ending. I think Lane should get a nomination for her part and that's the best I can say about this film.".

I've seen two recently that know what they are doing Brick and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. The notion of noir is so well developed now it is hard to play with. There's a parallel in Jazz I think the other uniquely American invention in popular art. It seems innovation has stopped in Jazz  some say it is impossible  and matters of style now rule together with degrees of deviation from the form.This tries something different and fails tremendously. I would appreciate it if what they attempted were bold and engaging. But it isn't and the most I can say is that it is an uninteresting failure.What's attempted here is a sort of layered noir. In genuine noir you have two worlds the world of the hapless folk we see and the world of fate that jerks them around. The viewers are assumed into that second world.In this project the two worlds are both put on screen. One world is the world of chumps occupied by Reeve and our mannered noir detective. He's strictly noir with the required boozing womanizing injuryattracting money chasing qualities.The other world is the world of movies their producers and watchers together. Its a vast conspiracy protected by the police and all of the government presumably.This isn't the same as Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd which puts the world of movies in that first world subject to the same capricious twists as the aging actress and her new monkeyboy.No this is different but it isn't well worked out. Halfway through we realize that we should have gotten it by now or at least been given a thread to follow to later loose. Instead there isn't anything developed. Yes we see a man get sad. Yes we see a mystery played Rashomonlike with multiple truths. Yess we see loyalties formed and broken and a bunch of other narrative fragments thrown in.But we get nothing we can follow. There are four or five ways to give us an unfollowable narrative that we can follow. Not here. This movie committed suicide before it came to us.The only nice things I can say are that Diane Lane does her character well but then she really does worry about looking pretty in Hollywoodland. And there is a nice visual touch in the Sacred Heart cards that in real life were placed by Ms Mannix after the death.Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

Good enough question I suppose and the movie makes a point of asking it more than once. Problem is that when the film ends no one has bothered to explain the bruises! Why do filmmakers insist on making points about things they're unwilling to explain? Because they have no respect for the audience that's why.Number two. It insists on telling us two stories the quest for answers about the death of George Reeves along with the relationship of Adrien Brody's character with his son. Now that wouldn't be too bad except that the movie is two hours long and this fatherson thing just goes on and on and on. Yeah the papers say Superman shot himself. Yeah he's no longer with us. Yeah life is tough sometimes. Make the point and go on don't keep dragging it out.By the way I am 56 and watched Superman religiously as a child. Yes I was shocked when the news came out but I sure didn't go into a deep depression. And I didn't know anyone who did. Back in those days kids didn't have only one adult hero to look up to they had a plethora of them. There were Roy Rogers Gene Autry The Lone Ranger The Cisco Kid Wild Bill Hickock Flash Gordon Robin Hood Hopalong Cassidy Sky King Sgt. Preston of the Yukon Annie Oakley Jungle Jim Ramar of the Jungle and many others. So losing a hero was bad but not so devastating that a person could barely continue to function. Not to say that couldn't happen. I suppose it could but I never heard of or saw it.The second problem with this movie is that it lacks action. You know in most good film noirs the hero gets beaten up at least once. The hero in this movie gets whooped too but you have to wait over an hour before anything happens. The movie is just repetitions of flashbacks on George Reeves dealing with my son flashbacks dealing etc. etc. etc.The third problem is that Ben Afflack does not play Superman very well. Now I will admit that he does a good acting job as George Reeveshe actually seems to be playing someone other than himself. But as Clark Kent or Superman his performance is lacking. In fact he looks to me to be too selfconscious that he is wearing the Superman costume. He looks as though he's thinking What in the world am I doing dressed up like this? Also I don't know who dressed him as Clark Kent but they did a horrific job. The suit looks too big the hat looks too big and that makes him look physically small.And then when he is doing his running leap as Superman his facial features are those of grimacing pain. Why didn't someone have Mr. Affleck study how Mr. Reeves performed that stunt and then try to duplicate it? Who knows.Anyway did you know that Superman was the first TV showed filmed in color? The producers had the foresight to predict that color TV would one day be the viewing standard and so thought and acted ahead of the crowd.Your better bet Superman DVD Sets Volume one and two.".

What makes this movie ultimately so frustrating is that it wastes time and energy trying to give you a parallel storyline with Adrien Brody as the selfimportant amoral private eye who is trying to fix his life this was an unnecessary and at times tedious plot line and as good as Brody is the better storyline and performance belong to Affleck.

	schema:headline " Hooray For HOLLYWOODLAND!";
	schema:reviewBody "HOLLYWOODLAND works superbly as a biopic mystery and poignant musing on appreciating what you have not just spending all your time grasping for more.After George Reeves Ben Affleck is found shot to death in his home the police say it's suicide but his grieving mom Lois Smith thinks he's been murdered hiring downonhisluck private eye Louis Simo Adrien Brody to investigate further. Tired of lowrent cases Louis sees the gig as a potential big break that might get his name in the papers and attract more clients with bigger bucks.The case becomes dangerous the suspects multiply and Louis wonders if Reeves' mother is right. If so whodunit? Was it his fiance Leonore Lemmon Robin Tunney the maverick socialite who hitched her wagon to a star only to find that star falling? Was it glamorous Toni Mannix Diane Lane George's sugar mama and wife of MGM studio boss and fixer Eddie Mannix Bob Hoskins? Eddie's a suspect himself he's OK with George having an open affair with Toni but if George makes her cry he's in trouble!Paul Bernbaum's thoughtful screenplay draws parallels between victim and investigator. Louis realizes George felt just as trapped in deadendsville as he does. Each man always seems to be on the outskirts never quite on the inside at least not for long  and never at the particular stratum where they want to be.

	onyx:emotionText "HOLLYWOODLAND works superbly as a biopic mystery and poignant musing on appreciating what you have not just spending all your time grasping for more.After George Reeves Ben Affleck is found shot to death in his home the police say it's suicide but his grieving mom Lois Smith thinks he's been murdered hiring downonhisluck private eye Louis Simo Adrien Brody to investigate further. Tired of lowrent cases Louis sees the gig as a potential big break that might get his name in the papers and attract more clients with bigger bucks.The case becomes dangerous the suspects multiply and Louis wonders if Reeves' mother is right. If so whodunit? Was it his fiance Leonore Lemmon Robin Tunney the maverick socialite who hitched her wagon to a star only to find that star falling? Was it glamorous Toni Mannix Diane Lane George's sugar mama and wife of MGM studio boss and fixer Eddie Mannix Bob Hoskins? Eddie's a suspect himself he's OK with George having an open affair with Toni but if George makes her cry he's in trouble!Paul Bernbaum's thoughtful screenplay draws parallels between victim and investigator. Louis realizes George felt just as trapped in deadendsville as he does. Each man always seems to be on the outskirts never quite on the inside at least not for long  and never at the particular stratum where they want to be. That's when Louis' cocksure finagling gives way to a new sensitivity and sense of responsibility as he confronts the effects of Superman's death on his estranged family particularly his son Evan who's not only depressed about the death itself but the fact that Reeves was shot with a Luger ...a Nazi gun..

It doesn't here.Most importantly the film is great because of the cast. Diane Lane Adrien Brody Bob Hoskins and even Ben Affleck give excellent performances. For once Affleck doesn't try to overact and just tries to play a human being and it works. There's definite compassion there from the man he is trying to play. Brody's smartass private investigator is so smooth. He's such a versatile actor. Diane Lane is such a strong performer as well. Hoskins is also surprisingly good considering he's not on the screen for that long but I thought very well done.In the end I was pleasantly surprised by this film because of its fine actors. The film is good because it starts out one way and ends up being something else. It's not a clear cut murder mystery but more of an examination of the life of man who's Hollywood star was fading.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actually after seeing the rating on Halloween 6 I have to admit that I was a bit scared to see this movie not because it's a horror story but because it just had a low rating. But still I wanted to complete the Halloween series and when I rented this movie I was really surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I think the rating is a bit harsh this story brought us back into the story with Jamie even though a warning in advance she does get killed off with this sequel I liked how they continued the story with one of the original characters Tommy Doyle. It was cool to see him grown up and how the events of 1978 effected him. Honestly I don't know why this movie has a lower rating than Halloween 5 but I guess to each his own but I really do think this story carries itself a lot better.Michael Myers his niece Jamie Lloyd and the mysterious Man in Black have all been in hiding for six years. It is revealed that the Man in Black is the leader of a Druidlike cult and the Man in Black kidnapped Jamie and had her impregnated. The baby is born on Halloween Eve and is carried away by the Man in Black. Later that night a nurse helps Jamie and her baby escape. Michael Myers in pursuit of Jamie and her newborn kills the nurse. Jamie meanwhile steals the truck and flees to a dark and empty bus station where she calls in to a radio show that happens to be doing a broadcast about the Haddonfield murders. Jamie gets on the air begging for help and warning of Michael's imminent return. Beaten and exhausted she makes her way inside of an old barn where Michael is waiting for her. He kills Jamie only to find that Jamie does not have the baby. Meanwhile Tommy Doyle has his eye on a family who's moved into the old Myers house across the street from the boarding house where he lives. The boarding house is run by a mysterious old woman named Minnie. Tommy has been obsessed with finding the truth behind the murderous motives of Michael Myers. After hearing Jamie begging for help on a local radio show Tommy finds her baby at the bus station and takes him into hiding. The people living in the Myers house are relatives of the Strode family and among the current residents are Kara Strode and her son Danny. The plot takes a turn when the Man in Black finally reveals himself as Dr. Wynn from the original Halloween. Wynn has been experimenting with pure evil does he think this is a good idea? Happy Halloween.Granted Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers is very different than the other Halloween stories but I think this was a good pick up. Plus you have to admit that Jamie's death is very effective and scary. The whole cult thing was a bit much but still I think it was a good scare factor to add into the story. The acting is better I think and the writing was a little more accurate. Plus unlike Halloween 5 Michael actually scared me again thank God I was getting a little frightened that he was loosing his touch and his butcher knife. So I do recommend this movie if you're looking to complete the series or if you're just looking for a good scare.610".

Its like he was just trying to bring down the film but I still liked it.  There were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the Producers Cut which features over 40 min. of never before scenes. With those scenes it turns into a whole new movie.

It doesn't deserve its reputation as a bad film because it isn't bad nor is it great.On the plus side it has some scary moments Michael's character is well used. The acting in general is rather good it's quite slick in a nineties way. On the debit side the story is a little far fetched and I didn't particularly like the cult element it's like they tried to rewrite the show's past. It's a bit silly I guess but....At least it has Paul Rudd and the wonderful Donald Pleasance.Not that bad. 610".

	schema:headline " Underrated Sequel.";
	schema:reviewBody "For some reason I always enjoy movies that people hate when I really don't think they're that bad  and this is one of those films. In the case of this movie I think it is way too overcriticized I really isn't that bad of a film at all. In fact I think this is one of the better sequels. Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers begins on the night before Halloween where Michael brutally murders Jamie Lloyd who was taken captive by the Man In Black in part 5 after she gives birth to his baby. We are then introduced to the Strode family who is now coincidentally living in the old Myers house which seems to change in each film. Kara and her son Danny are the main characters along with Tommy Doyle the now adult boy who survived the original killings. They must fight together to save Jamie's baby from an evil cult that takes care of Michael while Michael himself is driven to kill by an old Celtic ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in Haddonfield.This is surely one of the best sequels in the series in my opinion anyway and I can't understand all of the hate it has gotten. It had some nice suspense an interesting plot but sometimes confusing I'll admit some scary moments here and there and plenty of gore and knife slashings to appease all of you gorehounds. Not all of the acting wasn't particularly great but it was convincing enough for me. Marianne Hagan is the leading lady and she is very likable. Paul Rudd plays a grownup Tommy Doyle and is also very talented and plays his part nicely. The rest of the supporting cast besides the brilliant Donald Pleasance isn't much to praise but it wasn't too bad either all things considered. I'm still not sure if giving an explanation for why Michael kills was completely necessary but it turned out to be okay in the end and I wasn't upset with the way they tied everything together. The openended conclusion was also kind of eerie but could have been something more. I have also seen the infamous Producer's Cut of this film the original cut of it and I think that in some respects it is better. It further explains the Thorn curse that drives Michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion. It felt more natural than the conclusion that we're given in the studio cut of the film. I wish that Dimension would release this alternate version of the film because I personally think it is better. The chances of that are very slim though.Overall Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series. This movie isn't the best of all horror movies but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see Michael do his thing. Just don't expect brilliance and you'll enjoy it. 710.".

My only complaint is that why wasn't Danielle Harris in this film as Jamie? She wanted to return but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great but I love Danielle Harris. Still I love Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this film and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly creepy and suspenseful Halloween 6 rules! I adore this very violent but immensely enjoyable film. The Halloween horror series  by far the best in the Genre.10 out of 10.".

It will never happen. I have a message for all of you Halloween fans. Do what I'm doing. Give up the ghost. Don't expect a good Halloween sequel to come. After this terrible movie I gave up hope for a good sequel. Comparing this movie to the very first Halloween would be a joke. First there was a great horror film made called Halloween. It had John Carpenter and he did a great job. Then after seeing how well Halloween was received they decided to make more money and make Halloween 2. No Carpenter just Rick Rosenthal. By the way years later they were so desperate that they brought him back for Halloween Resurrection. AKA Halloween Homecoming. Halloween 2 was definitely the last you were supposed to see of Michael Meyers. It's obvious at the end of 2 that he's dead and it's not even left open for a sequel. A third Halloween was made. There was supposed to be a whole bunch of Halloween movies with different stories. The idea fell through and they brought back our chalk faced murderer again. I guess after 2 he survived after being burned alive. I guess he also got a new pair of eyes because last time you saw him he was shot in the eyes and swinging his knife around. After that they just couldn't leave him dead. With Halloween 4 you got a not so bad but disappointing sequel to the Halloween series. Still yet another movie was made that couldn't hold a candle to the very first. I was disgusted after 5 but after seeing this movie with bad writing directing and acting that's when I knew they finally lost it. This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After this I didn't bother anymore. I heard from people that the best part about a recent sequel H2O is that it ignores 4 5 and this garbage. That's sounds okay to me. I'll check it out but I'm not expecting anything fantastic. The people who are making the Halloween sequels are making suckers out of us. I think we should let the next one fail at the boxoffice. They're not movies they're magnets that attract Halloween fans with high hopes for a good sequel. Don't waste your time or money. Give up on the Halloween series. Just see Michael Myers as I do.

After 7 years of waiting for the next one to come out I was forced to watch this piece of crap. Which did nothing to further the Michael Myers legacy. The story was so ridiculous and off the writers should be banned from ever writing again. The whole thing with the cult was so not the right way to go in continuing the franchise. The thing that made the previous movies so great was the keeping us in the dark about his motivations for wanting to kill his family. It just made it scarier and more mysterious. I have seen the producers cut after hearing this version was so much better. And to me it still sucked. Yeah it had a lot of different things going on in it but it still basically had the same story and had even more to do with Michael's crew THE CULT Michael always worked alone and now he has a crew of loyal cultists and what appears to be a bodyguard THE MAN In BLACK. Even Michael Myers himself wasn't the same he didn't really look like he did before or walk the way he walked. I myself wasn't impressed with this movie. And do not recommend it to no one. Not unless you want to laugh at a movie that shouldn't be funny.".

This Halloween is known for having two versions the original cut known as The Producers Cut and the theatrical version. The Producers Cut is more coherent has better music and features more of Dr. Loomis. The theatrical version is incoherent has a pumped up Halloween theme and more gore. This being a Halloween film I'll take more Donald Pleasence as opposed to more gore.This Halloween installment is dark weird well shot uses different camera angles and an improvement over the troubled Halloween 5. Where they went wrong however is they listened to 14 year old boys after a test screening and butchered the entire film. Reshoots took place in late July 1995 after much footage had already surfaced in trailers and on tv horror specials making it confusing to whomever saw the film in the theater expecting to see those scenes as I did. Luckily after years of dark blurry bootleg copies of The Producers Cut Dimension Films finally released it in high definition Blu Ray discs. My favorite Halloween films include John Carpenter's original the underrated Halloween III Season of the Witch and this one.".

Joe Chappelle the film's director has had to suffer downright disgrace over this picture very very wrongly so and even though I'm not crazy enough to think he's just going to somehow stumble on this random userreview of mine I'm going to pretend that he will for the sake of things and so I'll say Joe listen you've been badly wronged my good man by the 'world of film' and you deserve vindication as much as anybody and this slasher of yours is genuinely frightening and badass part 6 is definitely the best of the sequels besides maybe part two which I do love and is most definitely better than parts four five seven and eight. First of all not even Carpenter managed to shoot his original 1978 classic in the actual autumn and frankly it shows for much of HALLOWEEN 1978 is green THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS however was actually shot in the autumn and it really does help create a creepy colorful atmosphere that all the other films of the original series lack  basically the cinematography here by Billy Dickson and Chappelle is fantastic and really does seem to take full advantage of the fact they actually shot this the right time of the year the look of the picture is just lush and looks totally right and it lends itself to the horror so well and the overall miseenscene as well ... also Paul Rudd really does seem to go for broke here as if he was fully aware of this being his first film and it makes for some of the best acting in any of these films aside from the performances of the legendary Donald Pleasance of course ... the pacing is literally perfect leading to a nice crisp and cohesive runtime of just over 85 mins ... the editing is sharp and really does like everything lend itself well and nicely to the big picture. Now I actually really dig the 'Producer's Cut' a lot .. but I swear I think that this theatrical cut is the better tighter version between the two .. and actually keeps Michael Myers more existential and demonic .. in fact just like when it comes to the two brilliant Rob Zombie pictures both critics and horror fans alike complain about too much backstory messing up the 'pure evil' of Michael .. but people have to remember the backstory to Michael goes all the way back to part 2 and then part 5 of course is the installment that truly tries to show andor at least imply all the backstory Chappelle and co. actually ironically place a lid on the Illuminaticult stuff here and actually keep it all contained I mean this theatrical cut basically just shows Michael vaguely being influenced and manipulated by an evil cult of high society that basically sacrifices babies to old gods  like why is this some sort of big problem in the context of the sixth installment of a slasher franchise? Carpenter himself only really a t t e m p t e d to like capture some sort of dark evil existential supernatural killingmachine with the original portrayal of Michael Myers and I just think it's a flawed film anyway the '78 film .. I basically just don't see how the evil cult subplot here really ruins anything at all especially in the context of the sequels .. Michael here is downright badass even if it does show that there's two different guys playing him .. it is a damn scary slasherflick and let's not forget that that's what counts here.".

First of all not even Carpenter managed to shoot his original 1978 classic in the actual autumn and frankly it shows for much of HALLOWEEN 1978 is green THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS however was actually shot in the autumn and it really does help create a creepy colorful atmosphere that all the other films of the original series lack  basically the cinematography here by Billy Dickson and Chappelle is fantastic and really does seem to take full advantage of the fact they actually shot this the right time of the year the look of the picture is just lush and looks totally right and it lends itself to the horror so well and the overall miseenscene as well ... also Paul Rudd really does seem to go for broke here as if he was fully aware of this being his first film and it makes for some of the best acting in any of these films aside from the performances of the legendary Donald Pleasance of course ... the pacing is literally perfect leading to a nice crisp and cohesive runtime of just over 85 mins ... the editing is sharp and really does like everything lend itself well and nicely to the big picture. Now I actually really dig the 'Producer's Cut' a lot .. but I swear I think that this theatrical cut is the better tighter version between the two .. and actually keeps Michael Myers more existential and demonic .. in fact just like when it comes to the two brilliant Rob Zombie pictures both critics and horror fans alike complain about too much backstory messing up the 'pure evil' of Michael .. but people have to remember the backstory to Michael goes all the way back to part 2 and then part 5 of course is the installment that truly tries to show andor at least imply all the backstory Chappelle and co. actually ironically place a lid on the Illuminaticult stuff here and actually keep it all contained I mean this theatrical cut basically just shows Michael vaguely being influenced and manipulated by an evil cult of high society that basically sacrifices babies to old gods  like why is this some sort of big problem in the context of the sixth installment of a slasher franchise? Carpenter himself only really a t t e m p t e d to like capture some sort of dark evil existential supernatural killingmachine with the original portrayal of Michael Myers and I just think it's a flawed film anyway the '78 film .. I basically just don't see how the evil cult subplot here really ruins anything at all especially in the context of the sequels .. Michael here is downright badass even if it does show that there's two different guys playing him .. it is a damn scary slasherflick and let's not forget that that's what counts here.";

	schema:reviewBody "I must confess i am rather upset that so many gave this movie such a poor star rating. In terms of violence it is the goriest Halloween of them all and on the basis of sheer thrills it should already get at least 610. Having said this i didn't enjoy Jamie Llyod getting knacked like that. But then again that sets the tone for this film  it is a very dark and unsettling one. Halloween 6 did do one great thingconfuse the heck out of everyone. It certainly is far better than the rubbish Halloween 5. I was little puzzled at how Jamie had her baby what i mean is who was the father? And did the infamous Man in Black set up her death. Oh and where was she for the last six years. I mean surely if she disappeared along with Michael at the end of the last film he would have killed her then wouldn't he.Anyway there are far greater aspects in the film to cover up for this little plot hole such as the amount of scares and clever deaths. Michael's mask is by far the best in the series so far and the cinematography in terms of lighting helps provide that dark atmosphere of this film. the performances are very good they convey a lot of emotion and fear. The film ends nicely with a respectful dedication to Donald Pleasance and leaves room open for another sequel. I am thoroughly upset however that H2O simply went on by ignoring all the events that took place in episodes 46. I mean Michael still has another living relative. His niece Jamie Lloyd's baby. I mean really that seems like a pretty decent aspect to center another sequel around. Instead they go on and mess up the series completely. However Halloween Resurrection wasn't a bad film despite Busta Rhymes terrible performance.I just hope they finish off things with the 9th installment and that they tie up loose ends such as what happens with the baby. Afterall Michaels entire inspiration for killing is to murder all the members of his family and those that stand in his way. If anyone has anything to say about my comment please write back. Id like to know what you think".

	schema:reviewBody "Vertov eulogizes Lenin with an idealized view of Soviet progress. There are indeed three songs or three musical movements. The first presents a woman's view of Lenin's legacy beginning with the movement away from various forms of repression the joy of women working the new equality in field and factory. The second records the Soviet mourning for their leader. The third showcases progress with the refrain if only Lenin could see his country now. With the exception of three or four spoken passages this is built like a silent film to which a programmatic soundtrack has been added. There are actual songs with titles furnishing the words and sections of great music by Russian classical composers and some music probably written for the film. The continuity comes through the songs and through several thematic sequences of imagesthere is no plot. The images are fascinating showing the best side of Soviet culture the variety of ethnicities the joy of having enough to eat the sense of sharing in a wonderful experiment the determination to succeed the unselfishness of many individuals the idealism of the collective. There are thousands of shots of people agriculture industry public works parades happy people hardworking people landscapes and every sort of window into a vanished world. Of course it's propaganda. Of course there are essential elements of Soviet history omitted. Of course the very first sequences present the unveiling of Muslim women as a great stride toward liberty. Let the political scientists and historians investigate the significance of what is left out and what is presented in this partial view of life in the 1930s. But remember it was only sixteen years after the October revolution and the progress the movie highlights did occur. Still we don't have to accept the propagandistic aspect of the film. Neither do we have to reject the film out of hand because we think Communism is stupid nor does it benefit anybody to heap ridicule upon it. Three Songs is a partly great movie because it shows irreplaceable real images of real people and of vanished technology and vanished historical places. Some of the photography is amazing and the editing timed rhythmically to match the music is unusually good. Even the way the propagandistic themes are built is worth examiningwe're all pretty much safe from its baleful influence these days.".

	schema:headline " Good Imagery  Photography Otherwise Rather Disappointing";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the good imagery and photography this Dziga Vertov feature though often interesting is in general rather a disappointment.There are many fine features from the Soviet cinema of the 1920s and 1930s in which the skill of filmmakers like Eisenstein Dovzhenko Vertov himself and others far outweighs any small doses of politicallymandated content. It is unfortunate that some very elegant films of that era are often described as propaganda pieces when they actually have far too much depth for that label to be appropriate. All this is simply to say how unfortunate it is to have to point out that indeed Three Songs of Lenin might have been much much better without the heavyhanded propaganda statements with which it is laced.There's no reason in itself why a film praising Lenin could not still work as cinema and indeed at least two of the three songs contain some worthwhile ideas. But the title cards and some of the dialogue simply go way too far in trying to build up Lenin's legacy and it is not long before it gets to be too much. The lavish praises that the movie heaps upon him would be ridiculous even if they were being applied to Washington Churchill de Gaulle or any other world leader. No one leader deserves anything approaching that much credit for his country's successes and no human leader or ruler deserves such unstinting and unqualified praise.Vertov was a skilled and creative filmmaker as he proved in pictures such as Man With a Movie Camera. And even here there is plenty of good photography and other material to work with. A more restrained approach would have resulted in a much better film. It's still of interest to those interested in the era and it does have some definite strengths it's just not nearly as good as you could have hoped for it to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let us start with a review about the film itself. The first time I saw Three songs about Lenin it was in a small picturetheater together with perhaps ten other paying visitors. I was emotionally moved by the images which is alway a rare experience for me. Later I bought the DVD and I still consider it as an asset. The primary cause is probably the enormous feeling of optimism that is beamed forth by the scenes. On the one hand the optimism is substantiated by the shots of emerging industries and education and development. On the other hand the optimism is impersonated by closeups of the common people by their hopeful gazes pondering over a better near future. The film invites the viewer to empathize and identify what are their hopes and prospects? We want to be a part of this achievement and mix with the crowd. This technique is an excellent find of Vertov. Joris Ivens may have had this example in mind when he made the film Power and the land 1940 for the US Ministry of Agriculture advocating the New Deal of president Roosevelt. The thread in Vertovs film is the development policy for Russia which was started by V.I. Lenin. Its symbol is the garden seat where Lenin used to rest during his final days suffering from a fatal illness. A striking detail is the missing lath in the seat reminding us of earthly perishableness. Vertovs first song titled My face was in a dark prison pictures the backward Islamic states in Russia probably in MiddleAsia. We see women veiled in burkas and crippled men. But there is hope some young women throw off their veils and start to study the works of Lenin. The first tractors appear on the fields the first automated looms are installed. At times our joy is somewhat tempered for instance when a text exclaims We would gladly die if only Lenin could have lived on. The second song We loved him is essentially about Lenins burial and the feelings of mourning that were engulfing the people. It also contains flashbacks of Lenins public appearances. We get a taste of his enthusiasm and passion. The third song In a big city of stone shows the economic accomplishments from Lenins death 1924 until the making of the film 1934. They are indeed impressive the steel mills the electrification the oil fields the education the airplanes the new blocks of flats etc. All realized without foreign capital even while starting in 1917 with an extremely primitive society. If Lenin could just have seen this progress the film ponders. So my cinematic part of the review can only praise the quality of the film. Nevertheless we are also interested in the credibility of the suggested state of affairs. The production took place in 1934 when the Stalinist oppression had already unfolded. Was Lenin really a kind of Ghandi a father to the people? Let me first comment on the glorification which seems contradictory to the nature of a popular movement in the eastern part of Berlin there used to be a statue of Lenin with a height of 17 meters!. This is because the people were supposed to elevate and to exceed their production plans and therefore an example of the utmost dedication was needed. Undoubtedly Lenin was excessively devoted to the wellbeing of the people and he has probably worked himself to death. But how sound were his ideas? Just some background information for your convenience Lenin was formed as a socialdemocrat politician during the cruel and primitive reign of the last Russian Tsar forgetting Stalin. The Russian society was still largely agrarian and religious and uneducated except for a small bourgeois elite. In this Russian elite Lenin became one of the outstanding socialdemocrat leaders while the vehement tsarist oppression forced him to advocate a radical oppositional resistance. He also became a journalist and writer. He published many groundbreaking books in my opinion like the philosophical Materialism and empiriocriticism the practical What to do? the economic study Imperialism as the final stage of capitalism and the political study State and revolution. However the First World War in Russia was especially gruesome which accelerated the radicalization of Lenin. When in 1917 the Tsar was overthrown by a civil revolution Lenin decided contrary to his former beliefs to follow up with a communist revolution which unfortunately succeeded. It started a civil war which caused the utmost misery and famine and ruined the already collapsing economy. Of course the new regime could only survive as a dictatorship and it soon developed the most brutal and abject traits. During this episode Lenin officially declared the communist terror as the instrument to combat any opposition. For example in his final years he declared that the revolutionary courts must execute the Mensheviks EB they were leftwing reformers and former party comrades of Lenin! when they continue to voice their opinions. Of course his orders were duly executed by his primitive followers. It is sad to see a brilliant mind lose contact with reality. So Lenin was actually the INVENTOR of the Stalinist terror and all those clones like Mao and the Red Khmer. So NO! the film is a fake but nevertheless the young Lenin deserves our appreciation.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was recommended to me when I mentioned going to a film festival in London so I read a little about it and it gathered that it was a four hour plus Japanese movie with themes surrounding Catholic guilt love upskirt fetishism and transvestism. How could I fail to be entertained? Well I wasn't. A false dichotomy containing however a large helping of truth is that with cinema when you go down either the arthouse or mainstream routes you are opting for either the morbid or the stupid occasionally both. If that's so then Love Exposure is an example of the troisieme voie that modern exuberant Japanese cinema can be. This film is literally bursting with life and fully sustains the four hour running time. I felt like asking the winds why all cinema wasn't like this when I came out. Despite numerous sashays forward and back in time and a pretty complex plot what we've got here is basically a love story between starcross'd lovers a young man Yu and a young woman Yoko. The comedy aspect comes with the obstacles that Yu is continuously having to overcome to achieve love with Yoko a girl who hates all men except for Kurt Cobain incidentally Cobain crossdressed. Spunky Yu is going to be dragged through bushes over hot coals through friendships in and out of a cult and drug before he even gets close to Yoko.The soundtrack is pretty crazy and disarmingly obvious main uses are made of Ravel's Bolero and the Allegretto from Beethoven's Symphony 7 if you don't recognise the name you probably will recognise the sound. There's also some Jrock chucked in for added good measure and that was not bad to be fair I don't generally care for modern vocal music  chock full of loose allusions. The vast majority of films wouldn't get away with the classical choices made here however the film has the level of pathos and interest to match the music.There's quite a lot of points scored along the way about different modes of living. Tosatsu is shown as being as revelatory as the Christian experience. Tosatsu by the way if you can believe it is the Japanese martial art of taking upskirt photos of unwary young women. The movie dwells a lot on the fetishism involved with Christianity as much as it does upskirt fetishism. We quite often see ornate gold and mother of pearl rosaries being held by female characters and the ritual of confession becomes incredibly fetishised literally causing Yu to commit far more sin than he would otherwise have done.It occurs to you occasionally that the film is low budget as some of the cinematography is reminiscent more of a documentary than a high production values movie. But the movie is a pure unbroken copper strand conducting electricity throughout. The great device of Sono during the first half of the movie is to have a countdown to a miracle that is going to occur so you're always in anticipation.I've simplified the movie a bit there are several important characters that I haven't mention whose stories play out alongside Yu's and the level of character development is very high. This is the movie experience of the year. You'll see the hospital run at the end and it will stay with you for the rest of your life.Congratulations to Shion Sono who has displayed a sensitivity to marginalised folks and a joie de vivre that hardly anyone else is even trying to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Summing up Sono's Love Exposure is a task I still do not think I am ready for even after two days of soaking it in after my viewing at NYAFF. Some of the many ideas the film dealt with in the 4 hour runtime included commentary on religion cultism perversion growing up and coming of age love and life. The film tackles many of these heavy hitting themes and ideas with a sense of humor found very little in much of the mainstream fluff produced today. The balance of subtle often crude humor and darker heavier more dramatic aspects of the story really works well. Sono creates a product that can appeal to a wider base of people. There is something in this film for everyone from the people who enjoy the latest Will Ferrel production to the admirers of Bergman. With a rowdy packed house at the NY premiere at the festival the first two and a half hours are a riot and breeze by. There are points in the latter portion which start to drag a bit but never could I say I was bored with the film. The movie was well made with good cinematography decent acting and a great script with fully fleshed out characters. The director is able to create an effective commentary on religion loneliness Japanese society all the while mixing in a lot of body humor upskirt shots and a few lesbian kissing scenes for good measure. Overall highly recommended ignore the 4 hour runtime because it is the fastest 4 hour movie you will see. Ultimately a funny sad uplifting and depressing movie all at the same time.".

	schema:headline " Love Exposure";
	schema:reviewBody "A freewheeling fourhour epic saga of teenage crushes Christianity upskirt photos double identities shady cults and perversion. Director Sion Sono gives himself free rein to shift gears at the drop of a hat and amazingly it doesn't end up an incoherent mess. In fact somehow the more ridiculous it gets the more you start to take it seriously. There's an awful lot of thematic ground covered here but for me it felt particularly successful as a story of adolescent selfdiscovery. Yu and Yoko cycle through various roles that their social structures institutions and backgrounds have set up for them before they find themselves in a finale that in itself may be yet another false construct. The film's Christian angles are a little tougher to get a hold on but ultimately I feel Sono's stance is satirical rightfully so regarding the hypocrisy of organized religion while not completely writing off the possibility of a fulfilling spiritual life. The sexual content has an unusual complexity to it as well. I am a little concerned about the casual treatment of Yoko's lesbianism which I can't get into without spoiling but I suppose that's usually going to be an issue when you have a male writerdirector tackling the subject.Despite the hefty length the movie is never dull mixing up styles and tones in a way that keeps you wondering what will happen next. Comedy and action and melodrama bleed together effortlessly it's something the Japanese tend to do rather well and no matter how wacky the proceedings become there's a sincerity and heartfeltness to it. I liked the use of music especially the Bolero in the first chapter building up to the miracle that smashes our heroes together. The performances are all fine... I don't know if I was particularly impressed with any of them but they seemed to fit.Overall I thought it was fantastic complex and very entertaining. A bit like Jodorowsky but more enjoyable.".

Director Sion Sono gives himself free rein to shift gears at the drop of a hat and amazingly it doesn't end up an incoherent mess. In fact somehow the more ridiculous it gets the more you start to take it seriously. There's an awful lot of thematic ground covered here but for me it felt particularly successful as a story of adolescent selfdiscovery. Yu and Yoko cycle through various roles that their social structures institutions and backgrounds have set up for them before they find themselves in a finale that in itself may be yet another false construct. The film's Christian angles are a little tougher to get a hold on but ultimately I feel Sono's stance is satirical rightfully so regarding the hypocrisy of organized religion while not completely writing off the possibility of a fulfilling spiritual life. The sexual content has an unusual complexity to it as well. I am a little concerned about the casual treatment of Yoko's lesbianism which I can't get into without spoiling but I suppose that's usually going to be an issue when you have a male writerdirector tackling the subject.Despite the hefty length the movie is never dull mixing up styles and tones in a way that keeps you wondering what will happen next. Comedy and action and melodrama bleed together effortlessly it's something the Japanese tend to do rather well and no matter how wacky the proceedings become there's a sincerity and heartfeltness to it. I liked the use of music especially the Bolero in the first chapter building up to the miracle that smashes our heroes together. The performances are all fine... I don't know if I was particularly impressed with any of them but they seemed to fit.Overall I thought it was fantastic complex and very entertaining. A bit like Jodorowsky but more enjoyable.";

	schema:reviewBody "With Love Exposure you need to know up front that it's four hours. If you're accepting of that fact and willing to hunker down with it in theory you're already most of the way there because this is one of those rare epics where it definitely does not feel like a four hour slog. Instead Sion Sono takes us through the story of Yu Honda and his love of his young teenage life Yoko as if it's in homage to City of God things move forward fast by way of the characters' narration taking us along telling us the backstories and then how they meet in an outrageous fateful moment.It's too hard to simply condense all of what Love Exposure is about. This should not be a mark against Sion Sono on the contrary it's a mark of a film so rich in a creative story of characters wholly developed in their various tragic and twisted and sometimes very funny ways that it almost does a disservice to have to break everything down into simple summaries. It's a film that takes many chances as outrageous satire and sordid melodrama with its ideas and details and succeeds on nearly all of them.It all starts with the protagonist Yu Honda Takahiro Nishijima telling us in narration how he was raised his mother died when she was very young instilling in him and Honda's father a sense of religious purpose the Mother Mary comes into play very early at this point and Sono comes back to it later as a device of infatuation for Yu. After she dies Yu's father Tetsu Atsuro Watabe becomes a priest but a snafu comes with Saori Makiko Watanabe a very insistent and hysterical woman who practically forces Tetsu to start a relationship with her. He does briefly but then she leaves him for someone else which turns Tetsu into something else a cranky priest.He drags now teenage Yu to confession to confess things that are very petty since he's an average kid with little in the way of troubles. But the Father is insistent and so Yu takes up more sins such as petty theft with a gang and this soon leads into one of the real highlights of the film which is Yu's training and mastering of the art of taking lightingquick pictures up teenage girl's skirts for their panties all for the ironic approval of having sinned enough for the confession with hilariously disastrous results He loses a bet with his friends and has to dress up in drag. On this exact day he has a run in with a gang of thugs looking to beat up a girl Yoko Hikari Mitsushima even though as she insists she can take care of herself. It's after this crazy kungfu battle that the two lock eyes Yu on Yoko Yoko on what appears to be a mysterious female martial arts master who in a moment of odd inspiration is dubbed Miss Scorpion. It's from here at the one hour mark we move from Yu to Yoko's backstory even more harrowing and melodramatic than Yu's THEN this leads into another backstory for the pivotal character Koike Sakura Ando who has ascended by her rather evil tendencies she castrated her father as a young girl for abuse but this isn't even what makes her evil as we find out in a church called ZERO which is a cultish church looking to drag families in and brainwash them with their caste system of dehumanization.What happens when Koike starts to infiltrate Yu and his family circle and in particular with her known connection between Yu and Yoko shouldn't be spoiled. If it sounds like a lot of story then it is but never not once did it get boring. Oh sure it is the story of teenagers in love and so we get a lot of what makes teens teens sexual frustration angstytendencies Yoko has a I HATE MEN policy leading to her thinking she may be a lesbian and being perverted in the eyes of the church. But it's directed by Sono with plenty of energy and humor  some of this is so funny in some gross and ridiculous ways not least of which involving a running gag with Yu's continual and hardtodeflate arousal  moving along from point to point breathlessly.While the humor of the church could remind one of Bunuel's cunning jabs at Catholicism there's too much to pinpoint simply because it's got something for any real movie fan there's overthetop Yakuzastyle violence a climactic bloodbath is reminiscent of a Miike splatterfest there's harsh melodrama there's satire stretching across the spectrum from pornography to cultworshipers to kungfu. And if you want some actual hardcore drama out of theater there's a showstopping scene on a beach where Yoko breathlessly and tearfully delivers the entire excerpt from Corinthians 13 to a baffled Yu. The music selections are also phenomenal ranging from catchy Japanese poprock to Beethoven's 7th symphony 2nd movement surely one of the most dramatic pieces of music for use in a movie let alone this.Love Exposure is crazy inspired filmmaking shot on digital video with care and acted with so much gusto to match with the breakneck speed of the misenscene. You'll check your watch from time to time but only to wonder how fast its all gone by. If you're into intelligent Japanese cinema done on a HUGE canvas this is the place to go  that is if and when it gets a US distributor.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love Exposure is Sion Sono's first truly great film. As much as I was truly creeped out and disturbed by his previous modern horror classic Suicide Circle I was equally bored and repulsed by his Strange Circus so much so I had written Sonno off as a hack who got lucky. Love Exposure continues Sono's themes of alienated youth on the fringes of cults and the extremes of pop culture but here he gives himself the freedom to be funny sweet frail absurd and exciting. The story begins with a catholic boy named Yu whose mother dies but not before asking to him to swear that he will find a woman like the Virgin Mary to make his wife. His father out of grief dedicates himself to the priesthood and all is well until a romantic detour in his life leaves him a sin obsessed and emotionally vacant shell whose Jeremiah's and interrogations of his son become his only solace.He insists Yu make daily confessions and though Yu wants to oblige he cant think of any wrongs he might possibly have committed that is until he begins committing some sins of his own. His small sins are quickly not enough for his father who thinks he's just making it up and not really concerned with sin and thus his immortal soul.It is only when he meets a group of street kids and begins learning the secret art of up skirt panty photography peekapanty that his father reacts and beats him finally not acting like an impartial priest but an enraged father.This backfires a bit for Yu when his father moves out of the house completely to live in the church and be closer to God. This is all played out in black comedy fashion the peekapanty training sequence which uses elements of kungfu and acrobatics to capture the naughty pics being some of the most especially funny.Yu's incorruptibility while he performs these increasingly corrupt acts is another thing that keeps this movie from wallowing in its transgressions. Yu only wants his father to love him and really does believe his sins will please him and bring them closer together. In fact none of the characters even the film's villain the young leader and criminal mastermind of the Zero Church a ScientologyAum inspired cult the Aum carried out the deadly Serin gas attacks in a Tokyo subway in 1995 an event which seems central to much of Sono's work named Koike who strokes a small green parrot like a James Bond villain is motivated throughout the havoc she wreaks not by a desire for world domination by her love for Yu.Yu out one day in drag after losing a bet encounters a group of inexplicable street toughs harassing a girl who comes to resemble his Maria the girl he has been searching for all this time and who he insists he will know because she will be the first to give him an erection. What ensues is a kung fu fight in town square that ends with a sweet if confusing kiss exchanged by the star crossed lovers.Confusing because Yoko his Maria believes her first kiss was with a woman Ms. Scorpion and that she may now be a lesbian which coincides nicely with her understandable hatred of men stemming from her abusive father. To make a four hour story short Yu and Yoko become step brother and sister and Yu is put in a TootsieSpiderman like position of having created an alterego the love of his life is more interested in than the real him.Then things heat up dramatically and under the collar when Koike whose been observing impassively for the first hour or so enters the picture claiming to be Ms. Scorpion Yu's alter ego the spitting image of Blank Blank in Lady Prisoner and seducing Yoko in many a lesbian school girl makeout session in order to get closer to Yu.I'll stop there with plot because there are still two and half more hours I would have to describe. Goodness and perversion are the two twin themes throughout the film just as I've said each character is motivated in some ways by love but they all different definitions of what love is.

	onyx:emotionText "Love Exposure is Sion Sono's first truly great film. As much as I was truly creeped out and disturbed by his previous modern horror classic Suicide Circle I was equally bored and repulsed by his Strange Circus so much so I had written Sonno off as a hack who got lucky. Love Exposure continues Sono's themes of alienated youth on the fringes of cults and the extremes of pop culture but here he gives himself the freedom to be funny sweet frail absurd and exciting. The story begins with a catholic boy named Yu whose mother dies but not before asking to him to swear that he will find a woman like the Virgin Mary to make his wife. His father out of grief dedicates himself to the priesthood and all is well until a romantic detour in his life leaves him a sin obsessed and emotionally vacant shell whose Jeremiah's and interrogations of his son become his only solace.He insists Yu make daily confessions and though Yu wants to oblige he cant think of any wrongs he might possibly have committed that is until he begins committing some sins of his own. His small sins are quickly not enough for his father who thinks he's just making it up and not really concerned with sin and thus his immortal soul.It is only when he meets a group of street kids and begins learning the secret art of up skirt panty photography peekapanty that his father reacts and beats him finally not acting like an impartial priest but an enraged father.This backfires a bit for Yu when his father moves out of the house completely to live in the church and be closer to God. This is all played out in black comedy fashion the peekapanty training sequence which uses elements of kungfu and acrobatics to capture the naughty pics being some of the most especially funny.Yu's incorruptibility while he performs these increasingly corrupt acts is another thing that keeps this movie from wallowing in its transgressions. Yu only wants his father to love him and really does believe his sins will please him and bring them closer together. In fact none of the characters even the film's villain the young leader and criminal mastermind of the Zero Church a ScientologyAum inspired cult the Aum carried out the deadly Serin gas attacks in a Tokyo subway in 1995 an event which seems central to much of Sono's work named Koike who strokes a small green parrot like a James Bond villain is motivated throughout the havoc she wreaks not by a desire for world domination by her love for Yu.Yu out one day in drag after losing a bet encounters a group of inexplicable street toughs harassing a girl who comes to resemble his Maria the girl he has been searching for all this time and who he insists he will know because she will be the first to give him an erection. What ensues is a kung fu fight in town square that ends with a sweet if confusing kiss exchanged by the star crossed lovers.Confusing because Yoko his Maria believes her first kiss was with a woman Ms. Scorpion and that she may now be a lesbian which coincides nicely with her understandable hatred of men stemming from her abusive father. To make a four hour story short Yu and Yoko become step brother and sister and Yu is put in a TootsieSpiderman like position of having created an alterego the love of his life is more interested in than the real him.Then things heat up dramatically and under the collar when Koike whose been observing impassively for the first hour or so enters the picture claiming to be Ms. Scorpion Yu's alter ego the spitting image of Blank Blank in Lady Prisoner and seducing Yoko in many a lesbian school girl makeout session in order to get closer to Yu.I'll stop there with plot because there are still two and half more hours I would have to describe. Goodness and perversion are the two twin themes throughout the film just as I've said each character is motivated in some ways by love but they all different definitions of what love is. These definitions are more often than not imposed by some social barrier or psychological scar from childhood.Some may be bothered by the weirdness perversity or sacrilege in the film but everything is in its right place in its right measure and nothing is exploitative. The immersion in perversion and the obscene recalls another great modern spiritual film Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant where bodies are used and abused with drugs and degraded sex in order to make the contrast between the spiritual and non physical more clear.Ken Russell's The Devils and Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc both focus on the material hostile and outrageous to show the pure spirit God struggling in the world as the spiritmind struggles with the body.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a four hour film from Sion Sono who has directed Suicide Club and Exte amongst other films. He certainly is a maverick and this film continues to cement his reputation. The film is about the young Yu played excellently by Takahiro Nishijima whose father became a Catholic priest after his mom dies. The story more or less tells his life for one year starting with age 17. He falls in with a ragtag group of petty thieves thus discovering sin. What we then find out is he is a master of the upskirt camera shot. You watch as he does martial arts moves to get the pictures. This garnered the loudest laughs from the sell out crowd at the Japan Society in New York where I saw the premiere. He then meets the rough around the edges but very pretty Yoko Hikari Mitsushima and also the somewhat creepy Sakura Ando whose character tries to lure Yu and his family which soon includes Yoko whose guardian is dating Yu's priest dad to a religious cult. Yoko means everything to Yu so he tries to stop this. This film can be vulgar at times you see copious amounts of upskirt shots and it also to a point bashes Catholicism but its also pretty powerful. The movie is not boring despite its length. Its best watched in a theater since the reaction from the audience at the premiere I went to enhanced the enjoyment. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because of its sometime vulgarity but I highly recommend this film. Sion Sono is very impressive and this is a worthy addition to his controversial but always intriguing career.".

	schema:reviewBody "WriterDirector Sion Sono is my favourite filmmaker of this century. Though some of his early stuff from the 90s is a little shaky everything he's made since Utsushimi 2000 has been phenomenal. He is bold and visionary and his films are always memorable confident and flawless in their direction.Sono's dialogue is not realistic but hyperreal. Emotions are cranked up to eleven in a Sono film. But it does not feel so much like a melodrama as it does somehow a complete externalization of the internal like the characters are literally turned insideout and there's a lot of blood and it's kind of horrific and kind of funny but through all the gore and craziness their inner feelings their souls are put on full display and ours are reflected in them.There's a lot of screaming in Sono films. My favourite example is in Hazard 2005 where the main character Shin fed up with his dull life runs screaming across his high school recreation ground. I could not scream in front of people like that but I'd love to and somehow this sequence in amongst a montage of freneticallyconveyed backstory expressed his character more clearly to me connected me with the character more quickly and deeply than any more subtle approach could have.These characters wear their emotions on their sleeves their feelings are conveyed intensely and immediately through the acting dialogue scenario. Take for example Himizu 2011 When the parents of both main characters Yuichi and Keiko feel they'd be better off without their children they have no qualms about telling them so Yuichi's father drunkenly tells him again and again about the insurance he would have collected if Yuichi'd drowned in the tsunami... Keiko's mom even builds her a snazzy little construct with a noose for her to hang herself and decorates it for Christmas! And when Yuichi gets fed up he sets out into the city carrying a knife in a shopping bag to punish all the terrible people out there.Sono's films are the opposite of subtle they are overthetop ridiculous. Consider his breakout hit Suicide Club 2001 in which the schoolgirls impulsively and joyfully commit suicide after hearing it's become trendy to do so. Or consider the absolutely stunning depths of insanity reached by the end of Strange Circus 2005 and Guilty of Romance 2011 films I can only categorize as darklycomic psychosexual horror films. Yet beneath the surface there is an underlying ecstatic truth to these films these characters and situations.Before Sono was a filmmaker he was a poet. It's not enough for Sono for a poem to be written it must be yelled in public repeated made to sink in. Consider the repetition of poems in Guilty of Romance or Himizu. In another one of his films it may be a bible verse. Poetry is intrinsic to Sono's films. His entire scripts his films are effectively a form of poetry he is sharing with us. All of his films are written himself they are his art and they are never compromised.I will not in this review explain what Love Exposure is about except to say that it is the ultimate Sion Sono film. It's the summation of everything that came before. It's gory it's insane it's frenetic it's wildly entertaining and extremely funny it's completely ridiculous and intimately relatable. There's truth and poetry underlying every outrageous scene. I feel simply that it is the greatest film of my generation.".

	schema:reviewBody "LOVE EXPOSURE is a film unlike anything else you've ever seen before or since although Sion Sono's followup movies made as part of his unconnected trilogy COLD FISH and GUILTY OF ROMANCE come close at times. It's an incredibly quirky romance story that concerns a love triangle between three messedup characters. One of them is a sinister cultist another a loveless girl who hates men the third a pervert with a fine line in upskirt photography.All of these elements come together in one epic story that's very well shot and somehow beautiful despite the often crude themes and very graphic elements of the storyline. It's a film that mixes together a critique of Catholicism with religious cults voyeurism pornography mental health terrorism family relationships and even some karate into one hectic mix. At four hours this is a real test of the viewer's ability to take this incessantly crazy storytelling and I confess that I watched it in two settings as I think one would have been just too much for me to take.The film boasts fullyrounded characters and psychological depth that you don't often get in the world of Japanese cult cinema. It's a throwback to 1970sera Japanese exploitation with the character of 'Miss Scorpion' straight out of that decade. It's very funny and completely outrageous delving down some dark and explicit avenues that most filmmakers wouldn't dare to go. The whole thing builds to a real crescendo with a great and uplifting climax. Most of all it's very entertaining surprisingly poignant at times and Sono sustains the interest from beginning to end. A graphic unashamed high art story that keeps on delivering.".

Yuu is a catholic boy whose longs for his father's affection and in order to confess to his priest his to get his attention ends up taking and mastering erotic pictures of girls in public. He falls in love with Yoko who hates her father and ends up living with her father's ex girlfriend. Koike who killed her own father who is an original sinner hatches up a plan to convert Yuu's family to her cult.Yuu tries to get his love Yoko and counters the plan of Koike but it all ends up in a huge chaos. Like other Japanese films its a bit quaint but again very well made. This film is not for everybody for sure. There's erections in pants not real and upskirt scenes throughout the film. But they are important and the story demands them.The movie films a bit ridiculous and unreal sometimes but never boring though. That's the cool thing about the Japanese films the are a but different but still very good. It's a mind blowing love story a love story that's explosive which pretty much justifies its name. The climax seems it should have come a bit earlier but thats all right. Cinematography is pretty good overall a top notch film. Worth watching if you want to view a different type of love story.".

And I must say i'm a huge fan of his work now.I'm going to try and keep spoilers out of this review for obvious reasons go and watch this movie.The film for me centres around three young individuals Yu Yoko and Koike. Whom which are great characters and are very memorable. Yu is a boy trying to gain his father's acceptance in what he does Yoko is a girl who despises men after a traumatic and Koike is a smart deceiving woman. All these aspects work amazingly and somehow bring all these characters together in some bizarre ways.The film is 4 hours long yes that is a long time for a the average film goer also it does have some violent and bloody moments so if you're squeamish you have been warned but if you give this movie a chance i'm sure the time will fly by. The film has so much going for it that you wont be bored.The soundtrack for this movie is euphoric and in my opinion has it own character in this movie. I must have listened to this soundtrack on loop a dozen time today the blend of classical music as well as Japanese poprock is perfect for this movie.The ending of this movie had me literally giving a standing ovation in my living room. I instantly wanted to give it another watch.Overall Love Exposure is a phenomenal movie and I would highly recommend anyone who has been interested reading my review to go and watch it. I can't wait to watch more of Sion Sono's work.".

But since its like my all time favorite movie I can't hold myself back.I disagree with people who say this is a love movie. If you watch it expecting something like that you might find it extremely unrealistic and unsatisfying. Of course its also a love movie but its much much more than that! Hence 4 hours of duration.Its a movie which focuses on love lust faith etc in an extremely surreal and unique way. I think its a movie about life itself. Many things seem crazy in this movie but I think the real life is no different we're just used to it. This movie made me rethink life my life myself and question many many things. I think its also a philosophical movie in a way! Lastly I have to say that the movie is really top notch from almost every aspect like filming acting character development etc. I think there is a lot of philosophy going on behind every little detail that I'm yet to understand this movie fully.Anyway I recommend reading other reviews too but be cautious of spoilers!".

	schema:reviewBody "I caught an hour or so of this 4 hour Englishsubtitled Japanese movie on TV and was so intrigued that I got the DVD. It is one of the oddest films I have ever seen so I will do my best to summarise. It will be a long summary because it is a long film and it rambles all over the place.Yu is a good Christian boy. His mother dies when he is small. When he reaches his teens his father Tetsu takes up with Keiko a women of some raunchiness but there is a falling out she leaves and Tetsu's heart becomes somewhat hardened to the extent that he gets religion in a big way and requires Yu to confess his sins regularly. The trouble is that Yu is so anodyne that he doesn't actually have any sins and the ones he invents to tell his father aren't very convincing. So he joins a gang of delinquents and takes to taking secret photographs of knickers up girls' skirts and he turns out to have an aptitude for it. On losing a bet with the gang he is required to go round town dressed as a woman in a black trouser suit long wig and floppy hat. While in this disguise he goes to the rescue of Yoko who is menaced by a gang and she kisses him. He falls in love with her but she falls for the Miss Scorpion persona he has adopted. Tetsu and Keiko resume their relationship and it turns out that Yoko who has now joined Yu's class at school is Keiko's adoptive daughter. The four of them move in together but Yoko has no time for Yu. This skeleton synopsis takes us up to the end of the two hours on the first of the two DVDs! At this point the mysterious Koike enters the proceedings. She belongs to the Zero Church religious cult she says she has a thing for Yu but she begins to manipulate relationships between the others. In particular she pretends to be Miss Scorpion and lures Yoko into a quasiromantic relationship she also spies taps telephone conversations and steals Yu's photographs and reveals his secret life as a knicker photographer. Once he has been ostracised she lures Yoko Tetso and Keiko into the Zero Church where their programming starts. When Yu finds out he abducts Yoko to try to deprogramme her and ends up in the Church himself following which if you can believe it things get unpredictable.This hugely bizarre and very long movie is an astonishing but always stylish and engaging mishmash of elements. There is satire martial arts soap tragedy sex nothing explicit violence and at the heart of it emotion specifically love. Much of the first half is very funny much of the second half is deadly serious but it holds the attention throughout. I enjoyed it all especially the Final Chapter where I genuinely didn't know how it was going to end but cared deeply.All three of the young principals give excellent performances. Takahiro Nishijima as the eternal victim Yu gives a performance which is far richer than the nature of his part would appear to demand. Hikari Mitsushima as Yoko delivers something which is far beyond the eye candy which she would initially appear to be. She is also eyebogglingly cute. And Sakura Ando while not being as eyecatchingly attractive as Mitsushima gives us a Koike of depraved reptilian gleeful malice in an astonishing performance.I cannot emphasise enough how weird this film is or how thoroughly I enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I purchased the DVD of Love Exposure a couple of years ago after reading a number of positive reviews but never got around to watching it due to the sole reason that it is 237 minutes long. I held it off with the intention of waiting for the right moment where I would find both the time and the motivation to sit through it.When the motivation came my initial thought was that it would be one of those films where I would need to grind it out albeit willingly as I did with for example La Maman et La Putain by Jean Eustache which is nearly as long. While I thoroughly enjoyed La Maman et La Putain it was a draining experience for me. I admit that I shouldn't be comparing two films made at completely different times with different intentions and from different cinematic cultures. However if you are looking to watch a film without needing to will yourself into a particular frame of mind and if we're discussing solely the length of a film just don't let that put you off watching Love Exposure. Putting the violence and perversion aside Love Exposure is purely and simply an exploration of love in the context of humanity. There are a number of characters in the film with distinct histories who are at different stages of their lives but their objective to find love is always the same as the one thing that they share is their membership of humanity. The film is complex in that it consists of several layers with a time progression of around 3 to 4 years but it is by no means difficult to follow nor is it ever dull or exhausting. If anything there was not one point throughout where I wanted to take my eyes off of the screen as I was completely engrossed in the character developments into which the director Shion Sono had put so much effort. The beauty of the film lies in the discussion of love which caters for the romantics as well as the cynics or better still the believers and the nonbelievers.My intention is neither to add a spoiler nor to analyse the film to an extent where I might kill its enjoyment but to convince those who read this to give the film a chance if you happen to be someone who may be wary of its length or even in a different language if you are not a Japanese speaker. I would be more than happy to watch this film again without hesitation whereas I would not be able to say the same about the majority other films which exceed three hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shion Sono's Ai No Mukidashi AKA Love Exposure may not be for everyone but for those who are willing to look beyond its controversial views on faith love and belief the film is a reflective sometimes absurd but enjoyable and memorable film experience from an unconventional director.The film revolves around the tragic character of Honda Yu portrayed by likable singer turned actor Nishijima Takahiro leader of the Jpop dance group AAA an earnest yet emotionally stunted high school student who lives a humble life of prayer and reflection with his father Tetsu the wonderful character actor Watabe Atsuro who is a Catholic pastor in a little Japanese hamlet by the sea. Yu's mother died a number of years earlier of illness but assured Yu that one day his madonna will come to him. Their peaceful and idyllic life is soon turned upside down by the unwelcome appearance of thirtysomething party girl Kaori former model turned actress Watanabe Makiko who despite her party girl ways has come to Tetsu's church for personal redemption. Much to Yu's chagrin his lonely father soon becomes infatuated with the carefree stranger and their bad romance soon effects Tetsu's personality in an adverse way. After Makiko leaves Testu for a younger man Testu takes his frustrations out on Yu and forces him to confess his sins everyday. This causes Yu to develop a psychological obsession with sins and thus he begins a quest to expose himself to all forms of sinful acts outside of killing so that he can confess his sins and earn his father's forgiveness. Along the way he meets up with Sempai and his gang of juveniles who teach him how to become a teenage delinquent how to fight shoplift etc.. They even go under the tutelage of a sex mania guru who shows them how to covertly take upskirt photos of girl's panties. Yu becomes such an expert at this skill that he becomes known as a Hentai King pervert king and earns the admiration among Sempai's gang. During one of their outings for girls Yu dresses up as Kaji Meiko's SasoriScorpion character from Toei's Jyoshu 701 Go Sasori film and gets into a gang fight involving a new high school transfer student the beautiful sukeban Yoko portrayed by the alluring Mitsushima Hikari. Yu immediately realizes that she is the madonna that his mother foresaw and becomes infatuated with her. Yoko on the other hand mistakenly believes that the androgynous Yu is a girl and falls in love with Yu's Sasori persona. To add insult to injury Yu soon finds out that Yoko is also the adopted daughter of Kaori who returns to Tetsu's church asking for forgiveness and his love.Amidst this bizarre love triangle appears the enigmatic Koike played with sadistic glee by Ando Sakura whose father was a high ranking priest in the Scientologylike church called Zero Church and who beat her using Flagellation as a means of repentance in flashback we see Koike killing her father in a grisly fashion reminiscent of the film Ai No Corrida AKA Realm of the Senses. Using the Church's influence and power Koike manipulates and sabotages Yu and Yoko's budding romance and even destroys Yu's reputation by exposing him to his classmates as a hentai. Yoko Yu's father and Kaori are also abducted by Koike's underlings and forced to join the Zero Church. Can Yu save his family and his madonna before they are lost to him forever?Love Exposure is definitely a departure from Sono's previous JHorror films Jisatsu Circle and Exte and is a much more reflective film which uses stylized and controlled visuals to tell its unconventional story. From its cast of bizarre characters to the edgy cinematography and music 90s punk band Fura Fura Teikoku it seems more like a psychedelic 70s experimentalexploitation film. Even the poster art for the film was unique cute faced Mitsushima giving everyone the finger. It certainly set the tone for the film.While Sono's story clearly was his cynical commentary on Japanese society and structured religion particularly blind obedience to God as professed by crazed cults like Aum and its ilk I also sense that he wanted to explore the idea of obsession in the media obsessions with sex etc. The story does stray off focus at times and brings in too many zany side stories and other offbeat elements. Sono definitely tries to emulate the much en vogue Tarantino Pulp Fiction style of movie Sono splits the movie up in Chapters a la Kill Bill and includes a lot of pop culture references but it does seem a bit much at times and too gratuitous while I loved the tribute to 70s Sukeban Pinky Violence cinema it seemed like pandering to fan boy service. Nishijima is geeky cool as the troubled Yu. While a little rough around the edges in some parts his film acting debut here makes a good impression and I hope he makes more films. Mitsushima is also very cool in this movie. She brings both a fresh look to her part as well as intoxicating charm. Her athleticism is also very impressive and I wouldn't be surprised to see her in more action roles in the future. Ando is however the clear standout as the bitch to hate character of Koike. Like Lost's Benjamin Linus character Koike is a grand manipulator and agent of chaos who loves nothing more than twisting and destroying the lives of those around her for the higher cause. With her narrowed eyed evil smirk Ando's holy terror Koike seems to relish in the mayhem she instigates and is truly one of the most spiteful villains in recent Japanese cinema.At a buttnumbing four hours Sono's film is like a grand crazy opus of perversion and absurdity. Its controversial views on Catholicism belief obsession and love will surely infuriate some but will also make a lasting impression on all.".

Sono definitely tries to emulate the much en vogue Tarantino Pulp Fiction style of movie Sono splits the movie up in Chapters a la Kill Bill and includes a lot of pop culture references but it does seem a bit much at times and too gratuitous while I loved the tribute to 70s Sukeban Pinky Violence cinema it seemed like pandering to fan boy service. Nishijima is geeky cool as the troubled Yu. While a little rough around the edges in some parts his film acting debut here makes a good impression and I hope he makes more films. Mitsushima is also very cool in this movie. She brings both a fresh look to her part as well as intoxicating charm. Her athleticism is also very impressive and I wouldn't be surprised to see her in more action roles in the future. Ando is however the clear standout as the bitch to hate character of Koike. Like Lost's Benjamin Linus character Koike is a grand manipulator and agent of chaos who loves nothing more than twisting and destroying the lives of those around her for the higher cause. With her narrowed eyed evil smirk Ando's holy terror Koike seems to relish in the mayhem she instigates and is truly one of the most spiteful villains in recent Japanese cinema.At a buttnumbing four hours Sono's film is like a grand crazy opus of perversion and absurdity. Its controversial views on Catholicism belief obsession and love will surely infuriate some but will also make a lasting impression on all.";

The cast is more than capable with Dennis O'Keefe William Bendix and Barbara Britton giving nice performances. I'm not all that familiar with Britton but it's easy to see why she was a Revlon Girl for more than a decade. The cast also features Doro Merande who steals every scene in which she appears.I picked up the DVD on the budget Geneon label. If you don't mind a lack of extras and that includes the absence of a menu it's not a bad deal for the money. The cover art is misleading.

So far we're not talking about any numbers that have meaning for anyone in 2014 but this was a bundle in 1949 when the average annual salary was 3900.Everyone insists the man committed suicide but there is no gun to be found and a delay in getting the coroner's report not to mention the laissez faire attitude of the sheriff Bendix.

Sam has met Weatherby's daughter Britton and fallen for her. But supposing her father committed the murder? Decent film where nothing really stands out except possibly the fresh young beauty of Barbara Britton. O'Keefe was a solid leading man and played this type of role often.

	schema:headline " Small town America in a state of tension";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite the title and Dennis O'Keefe as the star this B film is not a film noir. It is about a small town in Middle America where everyone in the town seems to be trying to conspire to cover up a murder. Dennis O'Keefe arrives in town as an insurance investigator. He is there as a matter of routine because the company for which he works has provided life insurance for the deceased. The sum insured is mentioned as 20000 and everyone speaks of it breathlessly and it is hard to realize that in those days 20000 really was a substantial amount of money. That says a lot about inflation over time. The man is said to have committed suicide. However O'Keefe is very smart and he soon realizes that the man was murdered. His efforts to bring this to the attention of the local sheriff played by William Bendix meet with a stone wall. There is a double indemnity clause in the insurance policy which says that if the person is murdered the payout will be double. But when O'Keefe offers to pay the extra 20000 to the niece of the murdered man she refuses it insisting that her uncle committed suicide. O'Keefe is baffled by this refusal of so much extra money. The murdered man turns out to have been 'a poison in his community' who was hated by everyone in town. In fact everyone in town had a motive to murder him. It is a very good yarn in theory but mystery and tension are sacrificed to other aims namely to concentrate on the dilemma of O'Keefe's budding romance with a girl called Anita played by Barbara Britton. The murdered man was killed with a 9 mm German Lugar. Both the sheriff and Anita's father have such Lugars. Things are looking very bad indeed as one of them seems to be the killer. The other main aim of the film is to concentrate on the cozy though currently unsettled life of the small town. It is snowing and it is nearly Christmas. People are lighting up their trees and getting the turkeys ready for roasting tying up their presents and O'Keefe who has no family of his own gets involved in the festivities while he is at the same time carrying out an investigation which threatens many of those with whom he is associating. If the intention had been to make a film noir a great deal more mystery and suspicion and conflict would have been created and the film would be dark and moody. Instead the film attempts to retain a cheerful air which belies the tensions underneath. Barbara Britton smiles charmingly O'Keefe is falling for her like a schoolboy her father is genteel and reassuring and only the sheriff appears truly suspicious though even he has a twinkle in his eye and casts mischievous little smiles aside from time to time which suggest that he is not a bad guy after all. No attempt is made by the director to suggest any real sense of threat or menace. Everybody is simply too goodygoody and there are no obvious villains. Well the ending has something to do with the season of the year and it is by no means obvious but I won't spoil things by discussing that. The catchline for the film is 'a small town with big secrets'. That is certainly true but don't expect a nailbiter. The suspense is so diluted in this film that it should rather be described as diverting than absorbing. As a result Dennis O'Keefe is not as effective as usual because he was best in films where things get really tough and here he has to be Mr. Nice Guy who in between wooing his gal dabbles in proving and explaining a murder and worrying whether his gal and her father are involved in it. In other words the focus is on the romantic conflict rather than on whodunit. You could call this a 'soft noir' or perhaps a 'black marshmallow' since it aims to be tasty chewy and sweet with a dusting of crime sprinkled over it for appearance's sake.".

And second the ending is pretty farfetched and made me lower my rating from 7 to 6.Until then Coverup was rolling along pretty well. The story is good  it's a good mystery story. Not a noir although the DVD case makes it appear like one but still a taut and engrossing mystery movie. I always liked Dennis O'Keefe an underappreciated 'B' actor who never made it to A's. Barbara Britton is lovely and William Bendix adds stature to most pictures he's in. Hard to find a bad acting job in the whole cast. Even the background music is good.Then comes that ending. Everyone was covering up for a beloved Doctor who thought he was doing everybody a favor? And the beneficiary wanted to pass on the double indemnity to preserve the illusion? And there was a volunteer fall guy for a murder rap? It's enough to make me lower my rating.Oh I did that.".

However a suicide turns the bet into a sure thing for anyone who INTENDS to die for whatever reason be it terminal illness or one's conflicted desire to provide financial reward to a loved one. So virtually no insurance policy will pay off on a suicide unless there's a provision that says otherwise.So right off the bat the film started off on shaky ground because that whole idea kept distracting me throughout the story. As for the double indemnity business I think Donovan's boss stated that it was a good idea to pursue the murder angle because it was good public relations for the company a way to increase business based on the publicity of a doubled payout. I don't know it doesn't sound like a sound business practice to me.But casting all that aside the picture did a fairly good job of keeping the viewer on one's toes with the suspicious nature of the principal characters especially Sheriff Best William Bendix who if this was a Western would have all the characteristics of being in the pocket of the town boss. Other characters were quite intriguing too I got a kick out of the Weatherby housekeeper Hilda Doro Merande surreptitiously offering investigator Sam Donovan Dennis O'Keefe mysterious hints and then burning a piece of evidence 'by accident'. Young Cathie Weatherby Ann E. Todd was a hoot too can you imagine a teenager fascinated by insurance and mathematics? Oh boy.Though the resolution of the murder angle is offered in a way that almost sounds plausible I couldn't help thinking that this town of Cleberg was one dysfunctional little community. With one of the best kept secrets in movie history the entire citizenry at least the ones Donovan came in contact with managed to stay silent about the Phillips case while strongly suggesting the investigation be dropped. I was pretty surprised actually that Donovan went along with the recommendation to spare the community's feelings by not revealing the murderer. By so doing everyone else along with the sheriff could go back to pursuing their own life of Riley.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first came across Cover Up way back in 1949 when it appeared at a Saturday afternoon matine yet on first release! This 13yearold was most impressed. I found the characters intriguing and the murder mystery plot both thrilling and ingenious. All elements in fact were handled with considerable finesse by director Alfred E. Green and his cast of seasoned players. The ingrown smalltown setting seemed ideal for both its noirish atmosphere and its ability to provide a conflict between the local citizens anxious to keep smalltown affairs within the community and outside insurance investigator Dennis O'Keefe equally anxious to bring the true facts to light. Scriptwise the investigator's zeal seemed a little unconvincing but I let it pass otherwise we would have no story. O'Keefe's opposite number in the plot is William Bendix who plays the local sheriff with just the right blend of suppressed antagonism and official nonhelpfulness. And then caught in the middle we have the lovely heroine Barbara Britton. All told a satisfying thriller with only one discordant note in the chainsmoking O'Keefe who no longer seems such an admirable hero in our present society. The Geneon DVD release rates at least 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shortly before Christmas the most hated citizen in a small town dies by gunshot wound declared by the law to be a suicide. Into town comes insurance investigator Sam Donovan Dennis O'Keefe to investigate the death and see if all loose ends are tied up since the deceased has a 20K life insurance policy  about 200K in today's money. Nothing could be less conclusive than this investigation. When Sam goes to talk to the town sheriff and ask about the weapon the sheriff William Bendix says it is missing. When Sam asks about the bullets that killed him the sheriff says the coroner left them in the deceased since it was obvious what killed him and how he died. Only when Sam threatens to get a court order does the sheriff produce the bullets.In other words if the sheriff was trying to deflect suspicion of this being anything but a suicide his obvious lies and stonewalling has had the expected opposite effect. In fact everybody in town is stonewalling Sam. Thinking this could be murder Sam continues to dig and continues to get furtive glances and obvious lies from everybody in the town. It also turns out that the deceased was just plain mean and everybody from the sheriff on down had a motive to kill him. Meanwhile Sam is having a serious romance with the daughter of the town banker who also had a motive to kill the insured.What are the odd devices in this film? The hated deceasedinsured guy is never seen. He is dead before the film begins and we never see him in flashback. There is another character who turns out to be important to the plot who is never seen  the town doctor who was out of town but has a heart attack shortly after returning who is talked about in the most glowing of terms by everybody. Again  never seen in live action or flashback.So we have a death that may be murder against the backdrop of a small town Christmas postwar the descriptions by the townspeople of two dead people who seem to have had opposite personalities but whom we never see for ourselves and all of the townspeople acting like pod people when it comes to stonewalling the investigation including the sheriff who is so obvious that he creates doubt rather than eliminates it. And why does the insurance company let their guy even try to prove it is murder when they will have to pay out double if it is? A reason is given but I don't buy it not even from corporations sixty years ago.Watch this one if you can. It certainly will keep you interested and guessing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Baby Face director Alfred E. Green's provocative mystery CoverUp lives up to its title. This deceptively bland movie concerns a homicide in a rural town and everybody in the town hated the individual who was gunned down in his own home. An outsider who represents a large insurance company arrives but he doesn't accept the questionable the story that everybody else buys. They believe the victim committed suicide. Nevertheless the sheriff does his best to shield the real murderer from exposure for the crime. Initially the hero sticks around to prove his theory about murder rather than the contrived charge of suicide. Eventually however the insurance man changes his point of view and adopts the perspective of the sheriff. Meantime he encounters the girl of his dreams and they fall in love. Cover Up received several negative reviews but I think that these spectators have misjudged this modest but effective movie. Interestingly enough one of the two scenarists Jonathan Rix was actually leading man Dennis O'Keefe. Highway Dragnet scribe Jerome Odlum penned this offbeat melodrama that benefits from Hitler Gang lenser Ernest Lazlo's atmospheric cinematography.Chainsmoking Insurance Detective Sam Donaldson Dennis O'Keefe of Raw Deal is dispatched by his company to investigate the apparent suicide of a policy holder Roger Phillips in a closelyknit small Midwestern town. Sam discovers many provocative things about this suicide that don't add up and leads him to suspect Phillips didn't commit suicide. Instead Sam concludes that the suicide was really murder. When the movie opens we see a train pull into a railway depot and a fashionably attired woman Anita Weatherby Barbara Britton of So Proudly We Hail gets off it with Christmas packages piled high to her chin. Naturally Anita cannot hold the load and drops some presents. Gallantly Sam volunteers to help Anita and the seeds of romance are sown. Sam is baffled when he learns that Phillips has already been buried no coroner's report has been filed and the bullet that killed him is missing. Furthermore according to the undertaker the body contained no powder burns from a gun having been discharged at close range. Eventually cantankerous Marlowe County Sheriff Larry Best William Bendix of Detective Story not only provides Sam with the bullet that he found at the scene of Phillips' death but also that he states that a Luger was the kind of automatic pistol used to kill Phillips. Meanwhile Sam's superior at the Insurance agency tells him to get to the bottom of the case. Before long Sam learns that Anita's father Stuart Weatherby Art Baker of The Beginning or The End had given the local town doctor a Luger that he brought back with him from World War I. Mistakenly enough Sam suspects that Stuart committed the crime. Indeed Sam has the local newspaper publish a false story to lure Stuart into showing up at the late doctor's house to incriminate himself. Stuart's housekeeper burns the newspaper with the fake article in it and then burns Weatherby's decades old beaver coat handed down to him by his own father. When the dead man was found the murderer stood over him with a coat dripping with water. Sam believes that a forensic specialist will be able to link the water that dripped off the coat to Stuart's coat but the housekeeper burns the venerable coat. This doesn't prevent Stuart from taking the bait and falling into Sam's trap. The big resolution scene reveals that Stuart didn't kill the policy holder. Instead a doctor who died recently from a heart attack but who was held in high regard by the community was responsible for killing the man.William Bendix plays the suspicious sheriff and we suspect that he may have been responsible for the crime. Cover up is a good movie but it is far from conventional. The idea that a murderer could get away with a crime because his exposure as a murderer would ruin his reputation is an interesting concept.".

Barbara Britton plays the oldest daughter who obviously has a crush on O'Keefe yet knows what is going on behind the scenes. Anne E. Todd reminds me of the teenaged mid 1940's Shirley Temple the typical annoying younger sister. Many of the laughs come from Merande straight faced and stoic and obviously knowing how adorable she is. The denouncement does come out of left field and ultimately it all seems like it's been for nothing. Adding a Christmas setting too takes away the darkness so any attempt to disguise this as a film noir comes off as misguided.".

The denouncement does come out of left field and ultimately it all seems like it's been for nothing. Adding a Christmas setting too takes away the darkness so any attempt to disguise this as a film noir comes off as misguided.";
