Sure the only thing we can attribute this merit to is its age  as others round here have already pointed out were this movie shot in this day and age the overused and overplayed technique would have undoubtedly been employed. I also imagine that at some point during the running time they'd have Jake spit up a big slimy hairball mark his territory over some sucker's flowerbed and stick a leg in the air so he can lick at his crotch  along with any other animal bodily function they could swipe a gag out of. It's one of those reasons why for all its skimpy production values 'the Cat from Outer Space' is now such a refreshing blast from the past  in an era swamped by crude flashy animal movies made exclusively for the under12 market this is comes across as quite a pleasant piece of nostalgia harking back to the good old days when the humour was always clean and any critter who wanted to wrap their tongue around the English language did so the conveniently telepathic way. Yikes I'm starting to sound like a right old whinger here which really I'm not but that's just how jaded I am.As a standalone film TCFOS is very much a cheesy but warmhearted affair and for fans of all things sublime n' feline like myself this was a childhood classic growing up in the 1980s. Back then it always qualified as my runnerup pick for Disney's coolest live action feature second only to the original 'Incredible Journey' yeah I did watch Mary Poppins' but never really got much further than the animated sequences  it just got boring after that. I happened to come across it on my shelves recently having left it undisturbed for several years and decided it was time for a revisit.The worst thing about it is inevitably the title which just screams 'B Movie!' don't it? only just managing to pip some of the flat and quite frankly irritating human characters on display to the post who've moreorless accepted that churning out even Oscarworthy performances ain't gonna spare them from being upstaged by the fourlegged favourite. Sandy Duncan in particular portrays a bimbo so staggering it'll make your jaw drop that she even made it into the paranormal research department plus she believes all of Frank's lame excuses  yikes how dumb is she?. Then there's that spy character who insists on speaking with such loathsome smarminess not seen since 'the Shop Around the Corner' you could break your TV screen trying to sock him one in the mouth.The best things about TCFOS oddly enough owe a lot to the retrospectives we have after 26 years. Jake is definitely entitled to feel smug that he was getting himself stranded on planet Earth amongst all the typically hostile folks and making his human ally's bicycle fly four freakin' years before ET showed up on the scene is that uncanny or what?. Not to mention the casually conniving fashion in which Jake goes about trying to secure his way back home somehow managing to involve rigged sports games along the way ethics so dodgy by today's standards that really you gotta love it. And the special effects are now so crude and outdated that well they're cute! Jake is undeniably the star of this vehicle churning out all the better lines of dialogue and this is such an endearing story deep down that it's all too bad that the script never delves particularly deeply into his friendship with Frank after all ET's major trump card was always his lumpinthethroat relationship with Elliot choosing instead to skim through the character interactions at such a pace that the film never really has the chance to deliver any true emotional wallop.I did also get a kick out of reading the previous comment concerning the body language of the feline double act playing Jake and will verify it all the way  pay close attention to the climax in particular and note that the poor kitty currently on the scene looks positively bewildered!Sure it's imperfect and now that I'm older I can see where the faults lie a lot more than I used to  but still it's a likable and evocative romp and personally I'd much rather be subject to this than to recent animal conspiracy theory trash like 'Cats and Dogs' or 'Good Boy!' any day.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my all time favorite childhood movies. Another was a movie about a robotic dog named C.H.O.M.P.S. another great family movie. I am 33 now but was 6 years old at the time when this movie first aired. I remember watching The Cat From Outer Space back home on my parents big wooden Zenith console TV set. Yeah those were the thing to have back then That was a time where there weren't any VCR's or cell phones. There certainly weren't any DVD's or flat screen TV's.. In fact the only flat screen I remember was the super 8 motion picture roll up screen my dad dragged out into the living room when we wanted to play the silent 8 mm motion picture movies we took of our vacations Ahh yesteryear. For years I had this stuffed cat that kind of looked like Jake. I also had this toy plastic ring toss set. I used one of the rings from the set and it fit perfectly on the stuff cat I had. For years as a child I was able to play The Cat From Outer Space at home with my home made figure to represent Jake. This movie has stood out for me since I first saw it as a child and now today I still look back on those years with fond memories. This movie is definitely a charming lighthearted tale or should I say tail and I certainly recommend it for the young and adult alike.. It's a movie that all can watch love and enjoy. It's a movie that also has some of the actors that were big at that time.. Sandy Duncan Roddy McDowall.. To name a few were big stars at that time Their acting is timeless in this movie classic. OK So if you like family movies and have a soft spot for fun and youth in your heart Get the kids together or just pretend you're a kid again yourself and have a great time watching The Cat From Outer Space.Rob..NYC".

So forget that accept it and enjoy the story! Some of the funny stuff probably works better for kids then for adults but it still makes you smile. The cat talks but no stupid and ugly 3Dpuppet moving mouth just good old fashioned training and snacks behind camera to make him act perfectly! And he does a closeup on his face and his stare makes you BELIEVE that he is talking. There are some goofs and some mistakes sometimes you see a puppetcat for stunts!which is obviously a puppet but it's still a very enjoyable movie for all ages!

	schema:headline " The Kitty From Disney Space";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember loving this movie when I was a young lad. I mean it had a 'Cat from Outer Space'. A guy got beer spit into his face. The main character what's his name Ken Berry was your typical Disney Nerd who did all types of wacky things that a kid of around 7 would find funny. He didn't even get hit in the nuts to make kids laugh. If it was remade today that would happen I'm sure. Looking at his movie 30 years later it is still an amusing and entertaining Disney film although perhaps not as fun as when I was young as I have matured as a film viewer. But still there is some magic in this film.The scifi concept is interesting. Cats have developed their brains to the capacity that they can move and manipulate the world around them. Man in his primitive state has to use boring old tools. My roommate laughed as the little kitty walked out of the spaceship. You don't expect a cat to come from a UFO so that is funny. And there are occasional yucks throughout the picture. What could have been a 5 minute skit on Saturday Night Live was stretched to 98 minutes of wholesome family fun. This won't make the AFI 100 laughs list but its still a film to watch with a smile.The film isn't without its problems. Too many people are to willing to believe without any form of skepticism that a cat from another planet needs to fix his spaceship. The big chase scene at the end isn't great but isn't enough to get it mocked on Mystery Science Theater.But on the plus the film also shows how sometimes to help others out you must sacrifice your own dreams and desires. The sacrifice made by one of the characters in this film is quite profound for a silly little Disney comedy but raises it above your average Disney comedy. Extra added reasons the film is fun is because of Mash's Harry Morgan Sandy Duncan and Planet of the Apes actor Roddy McDowell.This would be worth having in your video library if you're a person who does that sort of thing simply because it is family friendly film that you could show your kids without being embarrassed. It's more entertaining then Disney's 'Moon Pilot' and is worth checking out for a care free night of lite comedic scifi.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really can't say why but this movie's premise just cracks me up. Seeing that cat emerge from the UFO and stroll so gracefully down the plank has the same effect on me now as it had when I saw the movie as a kid  I just start laughing really hard for a good half minute or so. It's not a bad movie actually and the humor is deliberate. I think it's even funnier because the spaceship and the alien cat's mission are treated with such seriousness from the getgo leaving all the goofy humor to the human characters.Part of what makes it so great of course is just the fact that they picked a cat. With a dog this movie would be in the words of one character Dumb. Very dumb. But cats are just that way no matter where you put then they pretty much look and act as if they own the place. So you put that cat with his magic collar on a UFO and darned if he doesn't really belong there which I think is what makes it so bizarre.It's great how without computers they were able to get that cat to react in appropriate ways in scenes with the actors what I wouldn't give to be a fly on the all or a cat on the couch! in that editing conference. The human actors even people with loads of talent like Roddy McDowell and Harry Morgan don't stand a chance of upstaging this feline extraterrestrial. I love how Jake that's the cat is more realistic and down to earth than his human scientist buddy Frank Ken Berry. Berry doesn't have much screen presence but would the movie actually be better if it was Steve McQueen? Sandy Duncan on the other hand I thought was very engaging and had a real flair for deadpan humor. She reminds me of other great 60s film comediennes like Goldie Hawn and Debbie Walley.As a side note I kind of felt Spielberg's E.T. borrowed some elements from this film. You have the friendly misunderstood alien the glowing collar instead of a glowing finger and even a flying bike! The whole framework of having an alien befriend the humans is oldhat nowadays but actually was pretty unusual before E.T. you had a few in the 50s Day the Earth Stood Still and Space People but not much in the midlate 60s or early 70s.One thing that's interesting watching the movie now in the 21st Century is how other than the cat every major character is an adult. You would never see a kids' film these days that doesn't even have children in it. Speaking as one who saw the movie as a child though not when it was released probably a decade later when I was 12 or so I never had a problem with that and it never would have occurred to me at that time. So I think modern family filmmakers are probably guilty of underestimating the imagination of children and their ability to empathize with adult characters.This film never aimed to be high art but it's still noticeable how well it does accomplish its limited goals  a tiny dose of scififantasy a good deal of action and a lot of slapstick and situational humor. The special effects by the way are actually pretty good for their time. The digital graphics on the UFO's display screens and the control panel itself are more convincing than the computers you see in stuff like the original Star Trek series or Logan's Run which just came out a few years before this film. All of this detail greatly adds to the humor of seeing this domestic animal placed in this environment.Cats have always been known for their inscrutable stares and associated with divine wisdom. This film has strong charm despite being limited by its own ambition and maybe even more so in retrospect since nowadays these things are done with effects instead of real animals. I wonder if kids really can connect to a computerized image of a cat in the same way they can relate to a real cat like the ones in their neighborhoods.".

So I think modern family filmmakers are probably guilty of underestimating the imagination of children and their ability to empathize with adult characters.This film never aimed to be high art but it's still noticeable how well it does accomplish its limited goals  a tiny dose of scififantasy a good deal of action and a lot of slapstick and situational humor. The special effects by the way are actually pretty good for their time. The digital graphics on the UFO's display screens and the control panel itself are more convincing than the computers you see in stuff like the original Star Trek series or Logan's Run which just came out a few years before this film. All of this detail greatly adds to the humor of seeing this domestic animal placed in this environment.Cats have always been known for their inscrutable stares and associated with divine wisdom. This film has strong charm despite being limited by its own ambition and maybe even more so in retrospect since nowadays these things are done with effects instead of real animals. I wonder if kids really can connect to a computerized image of a cat in the same way they can relate to a real cat like the ones in their neighborhoods.";

Sandy Duncan Roddy McDowell Planet of the Apes Ronnie Schell Gomer Pyle and McLean Stevenson MASH.The plot revolves around a catlike alien named Jake voiced by Schell who crashlands on Earth and must recover his spacecraft from the government with the help of Frank Berry and Liz Duncan scientists working at the army base holding the UFO. Along the way there's the typical loveplot between Frank and Liz a bumbling spy trying to steal a spaceship and an incident in which the scientists must win a game of pool to buy enough gold to fuel Jake's ride home.Like most liveaction Disney movies before and during this time The Cat From Outer Space is relatively benign  after all it is a Disney movie but with all fairness the idea is certainly unique the characters aren't terrible though certainly archetypal and there's plenty of moments worth the raising of at least one eyebrow.Probably the best part of the movie is Jake himself who despite just being a cat who probably had no idea what he was doing manages to be the best character in the movie not being from this planet and all he communicates with the cast with a specialized collar that grants him psychic powers telepathy which explains how he can talk to humans and whenever the powers that be demand it the ability to place people and animals in suspended animation for several minutes.Although a rather uncommon entry in the Disney canon The Cat from Outer Space shouldn't be overlooked.

It is a nice family film with just the right amount of action and humor to keep it friendly. Another reason this movie resonates with me is because of its cast at least four of whom starred or guest starred in my alltime favorite TV series MASH. The late McClean Stevenson LCol.

Sorrell Booke uncredited as the judge and Rick Hurst as Dydee One. The two would also star in later seasons of Dukes of Hazzard.

	schema:reviewBody "Aside from a considerable cast of wellknown actors this Walt Disney film has little to recommend it. The Cat from Outer Space moves at a turtle's pace and comes across quite flat. Normally the Disney studios put out good fare for adults as well as children. But this film isn't likely to entertain either group today any more than it did when it was released in 1978. I couldn't find box office figures for it but it wasn't in the list of the top 42 films for 1978. The lack of any industry hoopla about a movie after its release usually means it didn't fare too well. When movies are hits we hear or read about their box office successes etc. In science fiction anything imaginable goes. It can be outlandishly silly weird strange or unbelievable. No matter how far out it can be entertaining if it is amusing interesting or otherwise able hold one's attention. But this film just doesn't make the grade. The idea for the plot is fine and Disney assembled a tremendous cast of movie and TV personalities of the day who could make this a very funny film. But the script is terrible. Where are the clever and witty lines for McLean Stevenson Harry Morgan Roddy McDowell and the others?Then there's the cat Jake who communicates with humans by thought waves. But only when his magic collar is around his neck. Frank and the other humans hear him audibly and talk to him audibly  not by thought waves. I think that creates an anomaly that turns off the audience The people talking with a voice from nowhere while Jake sits looking like a cat is a disconnect. It struck me as something like a voice from off stage. Some reviewers don't like the fictional films in which animals seem to be talking by some movement of their mouths. But I think that's what helps hold most viewers. Look at the record of films and TV shows to date. The more recent live action animal movies that were huge successes had animals that appeared to talk. Babe of 1995 Racing Stripes of 2005 and Charlotte's Web of 2006 were all huge box office hits. And way before The Cat in 1978 movies and TV series that had animals that appeared to be talking were big hits. In 1950 the movie Francis launched a series of films about a talking mule. It was one of the top box office films for that year and the succeeding six sequels were box office successes. In 1961 a hit TV series was launched with a talking horse. Mr. Ed ran for six years on CBS. These were family comedies. The humor was written for adults as well as children and the kids loved the antics of the talking animals and their human costars. And here's the real test  many people still find those shows funny well into the 21st century. Enough said about that. This film doesn't have the adult comedy and very little comedy otherwise. The method used for the alien cat talking with people just doesn't work. So the slowness of the plot soon wears thin and one loses interest. I stayed with it just to see if it might appeal to my grandkids. Children soon lose interest as well.".

First up is the picture quality which instantly reminded me of an old 70s cop show that had been lying in a TV archive for too long . You know those old repeats of STARSKY AND HUTCH and KOJAK that turn up on cable late at night ? well thats how the picture quality looks like on this movie . Secondly I lost count  or rather I stopped counting after 300  of the number of times that the action cuts away from a location long shot to an actor standing in front of some laughably obvious back projection . I say  laughably obvious  but that gives the impression theres something amusing about it when theres not . Finally if this movie is called THE CAT FROM OUTER SPACE then why couldnt they have dubbed the cat with a voice that sounds feline ? I know the cat is called Jake but couldnt the producers have changed its name to something female and got Eartha Kitt to do the voice ?All in all very grim stuff from the studio that brought us MARY POPPINS  and 20000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA".

Still the creative team makes the most of their resources.  Look for appearances in front of the camera by various members of the creative team.The Killer Tomatoes series is almost a world in itself.  The cast and crew do not appear to have been involved in many other film or TV projects. Given the gorgeous leading ladies this is a bit of a tragedy.

	schema:reviewBody "Say what you want about the Killer Tomato flicks but this particular entry does contain one of the better and more beautiful homage sequences to classic horror milestones that I've seen in a long long time. There's a wondrous scene that spoofstributes Jaws Psycho and The Omen all at the same time. During a virulent tomato attack in the shower both the uncomfortable tune of Jaws and the satanic music of The Omen can be heard. Very pleasant regardless of how stupid it sounds and looks. I seem to be watching the Killer Tomato franchise in reversed order. The fourth and thus far final episode Killer Tomatoes Eat France was the first film I watched  and admittedly quite liked  and this second sequel the one NOT starring George Clooney in an early embarrassing role is also my second acquaintance. This time the killer tomatoes and their wacky master Dr. Gangrene are back. The crazed maniacal scientist now even hosts a TV talk show and fiendishly plots to take over the world via subliminal brainwash messages. The only people who are able to stop him are the sportaddicted detective Wilbur Finletter who denies the existence of killer tomatoes and the sexy female tomatologist Kennedi Johnson. Like with Killer Tomatoes Eat France the film relies on a handful of downright hilarious situations and genuinely clever gags but the overall wholesome of the script is plotfree and juvenile. Personally I find it very amusing to watch tomatoes wearing tiny little Jason Voorhees hockey masks or ninja outfits but obviously you can't really refer to it as being a good film. John Astin obviously enjoys himself very much as he purposely aims his overthetop evil laughs directly into the camera and combs his longish hair in such a wild and unmannered style that he looks even more deranged. I guess it's because movies like this one that some brainiac invented the term guilty pleasure.".

West is one of the underrated comic wizards of our time and the bank scene will convince you. I won't spoil it with details but it's Deliverance meets PeeWee. A second Westian moment in which he's held captive by the villains and discusses his odd proclivities is priceless. I can say no more.Overall the film lacks the outofthebox wildness of the original but hey it's a Killer Tomatoes film and therefore not without some fruitful redeeming value. John Astin is as always John Astin. The premise is strictly Saturday morning cartoon. It's neither Brecht nor Hemingway though it's both absurd and mercifully brief.

This kind of movies needs at least one joke a minute  as a minimum. The movie has a few good jokes but not nearly enough. Dr. Gangreen's hideout looks cheap the water in the piranha tank is dyed black since there no piranhas and most important it is filled with secondrate actors.

It was a far smaller conflict. They even show scenes from the first movie. They do that and still get the plot of the second one wrong.The second one while very bad at least had some interesting fourth wall jokes going on. There are much fewer here and the jokes are not funny at all. The only good thing is that we finally get to see the tomatoes with faces. That's what the movie posters were promising us for such a long time. Just when you think the series has ended Professor Gangreene is somehow shown to have survived the tomatoes with just damage to his nose. Maybe I could forgive this if it was actually entertaining. There's only so many times you can show tomatoes attacking people. It's just them showing how much they can milk this single joke for a whole movie series. 12".

	schema:headline " Peckinpah's 'curate's egg' provides interesting insights";
	schema:reviewBody "Peckinpah's 1975 thriller is infuriatingly uneven. It is also one of his most interesting films throwing the director's preoccupations into relief. It was made between the gothic thriller Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia 1974 and his last great film Cross Of Iron 1977. As the critic Pauline Kael noted it was a way of proving himself alive to the Hollywood establishment a transparent disguise for... determination to show Hollywood that he's not dead yet... that despite the tabloid views of him frail and falling down drunk he's got the will to make great movies. It's no accident that this is a film in which the director stresses his auteurism with more than the usual selfconsciousness the words 'directed by' and 'Sam Peckinpah' are separated by an emphatic crosscut in the opening credits. Neither that it is one in which the theme of rehabilitation  or more specifically recuperation  dominates the dramatic matter in hand giving the narrative a lopsidedness from which it never really recovers.Kung Fu plot notwithstanding at the centre of The Killer Elite is the relationship between Locken James Caan and Hansen Robert Duvall. The shifting balance between two men who find themselves on opposite sides of the law recall similar relationships in Ride The High Country 1962 between Steve Judd and Gil Westrum or in The Wild Bunch 1969 between Pike Bishop and Deke Thornton. I can't figure why he didn't put the third one in my head says Locken brooding in hospital. He's your buddy is the characteristic reply. Locken and Hansen may travel further apart than the other examples of broken camaraderie in Peckinpah's work but their mutual respect remains intact to the end. In the shoot out at the darkened quay despite his thirst for revenge Locken walks away from his former partner in disgust and he's not responsible for the final bullet.The relationship between the two men is what focuses Locken's life and gives his actions perspective. Once his buddy is dead his character loses all motivation and then the movie its soul. What's left is a ramshackle kung fu killer plot which any competent straighttovideo producer could have scribbled down on the back of an envelope. Peckinpah's other films frequently end when the central partnership was irrevocably dissolved. For all of its martial pyrotechnics The Killer Elite just goes on too long.The most successful part of the film is contained within the opening third. The first operation Hansen's initial betrayal which occurs in a world of surveillance that anticipates The Osterman Weekend 1983 and the mechanics of Locken's physical reconstruction are by turn engrossing. It's a time of development and learning for Locken. From the casual sex of the opening the injured agent has to adjust restrain his bitterness I'll just limp out of here and establishes a more permanent relationship with his nurse while on the mend. From embracing a broad Locken ends up clutching a bedpan then grasps at any chance to reestablish himself as whole. Peckinpah found delineating  the mending processes so engrossing that the belated introduction of Negato Toku Tak Kubota as Godfather of all the ninja assassins and then Locken's fortuitous assignment to protect Yuen Cheung Mako against death within the USA are like dramatic afterthoughts tellingly summarised in conversation over the airport fight.These airport scenes however expertly cut together by the director are perhaps amongst the most gratuitous scenes of violence in his oeuvre. The fighting is dwelt on purely as a means to patch over a glaring narrative fault line carrying along some clumsy verbal exposition. It has none of the catharsis or brutal poetry familiar from the director's other films. Locken's recuperation has proved a distraction. After his hospital a scene the belated 'catching up' scene feels at best rushed at worst intrusive. Worse we sense Peckinpah is just not as emotionally engaged with martial arts as he is with the matter of the Old West. A feeling underlined when Locken watches the final ninja swordfight with calculated disinterest calmly betting on the result. An obvious sop to those fans who wanted more of the action exemplified in Clouse's Enter The Dragon of two years previously the kung fu in Peckinpah's film is vigorous filmed with style but remains peculiarly unconvincing. Strip away the martial arts and what remains is far more interesting and consistent with Peckinpah's personal philosophy. As in his other films there is a theme running through The Killer Elite one of honour and the inexorable passing of the old ways. One thinks of the mothballed fleet the scene of the final confrontation a veritable graveyard of former pride and glory. You've just been retired Mike enjoy it says Hansen after crippling Locken. You just retired Cap echoes Locken in irony when addressing his traitorous superior at the end. In The Killer Elite a new order is recognised that of power systems none of which care about civilians or integrity  a recognition enunciated rather surprisingly by the shambling Miller a scruffy Bo Hopkins. Cap Collins Arthur Hill had earlier put these changes more succinctly Would you believe that heroism has become old fashioned? So halfbaked and ludicrous is the action plot that much of the film's other pleasure comes from incidentals. The initial friendship between Locken and Hansen for instance or Miller's girlfriend calling everyone 'Mr Davies' the editing of the explosive opening sequence or the bombunderthecar scene ending with the distant explosion pure comic 'business' rare in Peckinpah Caan's sensitive performance. Allied to this is Jerry Fielding's score an outstanding contribution from a composer who worked with the director on several occasions as well as the acting in support from Peckinpah regulars like Hopkins. In short The Killer Elite is something of curate's egg only good in parts but with all its unsatisfactory elements still essential viewing for admirers of this director.".

Allied to this is Jerry Fielding's score an outstanding contribution from a composer who worked with the director on several occasions as well as the acting in support from Peckinpah regulars like Hopkins. In short The Killer Elite is something of curate's egg only good in parts but with all its unsatisfactory elements still essential viewing for admirers of this director.";

However this is one of the few that I'm less enthusiastic about simply because it is not up to the high standard usually associated with the director perhaps the studio tampering is partly to blame for that.It's a spy flick about a notverynice unit of the CIA which tackles all the dirty gritty jobs that nobody else wants. James Caan and Robert Duvall are in the organisation and are great friends until Duvall accepts a bribe and tries to blow Caan's head off during an assignment. The rest of the movie follows Caan as he rehabilitates from the injury and sets about gaining his revenge.The theme of honesty among savages made The Wild Bunch compelling but here it is used to lesser effect. Peckinpah himself was a disgraced figure in Hollywood with his drug and drink problems at the time that this movie was made and you often feel that he made it purely to keep working during such a difficult period. There's certainly a shortage of passion and belief in the material.The best thing about the film is Duvall but he disappears early and doesn't come back into it until near the end and then only briefly. It also contains some good martial arts moments although strictly speaking it is not a martial arts film. Other than that it is definitely a low point in the Sam Peckinpah canon and can only be recommended to those who are keen to watch all the director's movies rather than just the best ones.".

Sadly it isn't. Now I know Peckinpah often suffered studio interference and rarely got to get a movie on screen with his vision uncompromised so I can only assume this is the case here. Caan who is always watchable no matter what he is in plays a CIA operative who is betrayed by his partner Duvall who only has a small supporting role to be honest. Wounded and written off by his bosses he is manipulated into guarding an Asian politician Mako best known for the 'Conan' films who Duvall is trying to assassinate. Caan and his handpicked team Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins and Burt Young of 'Rocky' fame carry out there task in good faith until it becomes increasingly obvious that they are being used. Peckinpah deals with his frequent themes of loyalty and honour and there is some characteristic bloody action sequences but frankly the script leaves a lot to be desired the plot sometimes wanders off track and some golden opportunities are missed. 'The Killer Elite' reeks of compromise and therefore fails to completely satisfy. But hey even neutered Peckinpah is still Peckinpah and just about everything he directed wipes the floor with most of Hollywood's current lame output so I still say give this one a try. For all its flaws it still stars James Caan one of the most underrated actors of his generation and even that in itself is enough to keep me watching.".

	schema:headline " Peckinpah On The CIA And Foreign Intrigue";
	schema:reviewBody "By the mid1970s the career of director Sam Peckinpah had basically hit the skids. He had seen one more film of his PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID butchered by a studio MGM in 1973 then in 1974 his most overtly personal film the admittedly ghoulishsounding BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA was roundly trashed by audiences and critics alike. And on top of that the excesses that had been plaguing him on and off for years were starting to dominate his life. Yet through all of this he somehow managed to pull off the good when he was sober. A case in point was the action thriller THE KILLER ELITE released near the end of 1975.In this film James Caan portrays an employee for a CIAsponsored offshoot group called ComTeg Communications Integrity who in protecting a German political figure Helmut Dantine is maliciously wounded by his partner Robert Duvall in the leg and arm. Though his superiors in ComTeg Arthur Hill Gig Young tell him that those injuries are so severe that he may never be able to walk fully again Caan vows to get back into the game exposing himself to strenuous rehabilitation and martial arts exercises. When Hill gives him the chance via protecting a Japanese politician Mako until he can be gotten out of the country Caan immediately grabs onto it especially with the fringe benefit of knowing Duvall has resurfaced and is gunning for Mako on his own. The whole operation turns out to be part of an internecine battle of wills inside ComTeg between their two superiors first resulting in a fatal confrontation at the Bethlehem Steel shipyard and then a highenergy showdown aboard a mothballed World War II vessel in Suisun Bay involving Japanese kungfu masters.It is easy to simply dismiss THE KILLER ELITE which however shouldn't be confused with the similarlytitled but unrelated and much more violent 2011 film of the same name as lesser Peckinpah but he should still be given credit for having taken a strictly commercial property much like his big 1972 hit THE GETAWAY and turning it into a solid action film with some bursts of sardonic humor plus points being made about the dirty business of the CIA at a time when the agency was being battered in the press for its foreign shenanigans and domestic spying plus its role in covering up Watergate. He would return to this theme in his last film 1983's THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND.Under Peckinpah's direction both Caan and Duvall who had appeared together before in THE GODFATHER do solid work as the two friends set up against one another and Hill and Gig Young the latter of whom made for a dispassionate killer in ALFREDO GARCIA are equally good in their bureaucratic roles. Burt Young and Bo Hopkins do good solid turns as Caan's two partners in the protection of Mako's ambitious Oriental political figure. As is typical with Peckinpah the action scenes are shot and edited in that characteristic Peckinpah style and the onlocation cinematography by Philip Lathrop whose credits include 1965's THE CINCINNATI KID from which Peckinpah was unceremoniously fired is also superb. And finally Jerry Fielding working with Peckinpah one final time comes up with another iconoclastic music score that combines jazz dissonance and Far Eastern music elements.The end result may not have been classic Peckinpah it is certainly less bloody than THE WILD BUNCH STRAW DOGS or ALFREDO GARCIA but THE KILLER ELITE is still far superior to most of the ultraviolent action flicks that would follow in Peckinpah's wake.".

When you think Peckinpah you think The Wild Bunch and Straw Dogs because that's all that anyone thinks is relevant about his career. A career that is fabled to have collapsed under the pressures of his excessive lifestyle and personality. It is for this reason I was surprised to find this movie in the local video store the other day.This film shows a fantastic amount of maturity about its characters as displayed through the patience with which Peckinpah walks us through the Duvall and Caan's relationship take for instance the scene with them crossing the Golden Gate bridge...its seldom that a director takes this amount of time with dialogue that is so trivial but subtext that is so important in an indexical sort of way and Caan's lengthy rehabilitation. The meatiest parts of this films emotional resonance is dealt with in the first act before a majority of the action.The real strength of the film is that it allows an insight not just into Duvall and Caan but the other mercenaries who are all in one way or another fractured people. Though I have to admit that this particular aspect of the film could have been emphasized more I think it is something that is unfortunately being overlooked by some of the other people who commented on this film.Another user drew a parallel between this film and the honor among thieves them at the heart of the Wild Bunch. There is a similarity between the two but to say that Peckinpah is making the same statement in both films is a bit myopic. James Caan's character is not William Holden's character. I can't help but feel though that either more screen time or a solid R rating would have more clearly delineated the difference.One last word about this film. I have always been a giant fan of Peckinpah's editing. Wild Bunch was an orgy of true montage editing that would have made Eisenstien blush and Straw Dogs would be less of a movie were it not for the free associative cuts into the characters mind that can only been found in the days when American Cinema was busy dry humping the New Wave i.e. Francis Ford Coppola's the Rain People. In Killer Elite Peckinpah is DW Griffith inspired crosscutting as Sergio Leone is to the ringing phone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with The Killer Elite is that just by seeking this film out and investing time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director Sam Peckinpah.The already volatile Peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film. According to at least one biographer this was where he became acquainted with cocaine. Add to that his binge drinking and it's no wonder things fell apart.It's a shame because the concept behind the film is a good one and the first ten minutes promise much. Mike Locken James Caan and George Hansen Robert Duvall are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move quick live well and seem like the best of friends  then something happens to shatter their brotherhood.An opening scene shows them blowing up a building  why exactly we aren't told par for the course in terms of this film's murky motivation. But the implication is these guys hurt people and don't really care  antiheroes much like the Wild Bunch of Peckinpah's notsolongago. An opening title tells us they work for ComTeg then adds with obvious tongue in cheek ...the thought the CIA might employ such an organization for any purpose is of course preposterous. That's a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off.Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup cast including Burt Young Gig Young and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the plum role of a madman who can't pass up an opportunity to be shot at for 500 a day and you only wish that the scriptwriters including the celebrated Sterling Silliphant tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy oneliners and bad chopsocky knockoffs. An attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in. You're so busy doing their dirty work you can't tell who the bad guys are someone tells Locken as if either he or we need it pointed out.Worse still are Peckinpah's clumsy direction and sluggish pacing. We're 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven't even met before are seen fighting at San Francisco Airport their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite.By the end of the film what's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed Victory Ships ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while Caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense. Lay me seventofive I'll take the little guy he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors  from China which we all know is the land of the Ninja. The battle takes place in San Francisco but surprisingly no Mounties arrive to break things up.Caan is much better in smaller scenes like when Locken recovering from some nasty injuries is told by one of his bosses played by a smooth Arthur Hill that he's been Humptydumped by the organization. Caan refuses to stay down and his recovery scenes though momentumkilling for the movie feature fine acting from him and Amy Heflin Van's daughter as a supportive nurse. Caan was one of the 1970s' best actors and his laconic byplay with Heflin Duvall Hopkins and both Youngs give Killer Elite real watchability.But you don't watch Killer Elite thinking about that. You watch it thinking of the film that got away.".

	onyx:emotionText "The problem with The Killer Elite is that just by seeking this film out and investing time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director Sam Peckinpah.The already volatile Peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film. According to at least one biographer this was where he became acquainted with cocaine. Add to that his binge drinking and it's no wonder things fell apart.It's a shame because the concept behind the film is a good one and the first ten minutes promise much. Mike Locken James Caan and George Hansen Robert Duvall are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move quick live well and seem like the best of friends  then something happens to shatter their brotherhood.An opening scene shows them blowing up a building  why exactly we aren't told par for the course in terms of this film's murky motivation.

	schema:reviewBody "Easygoing freelance special agent Mike Locken an excellent and engaging performance by James Caan gets severely wounded in both his knee and elbow after being doublecrossed by his tough and shifty longtime friend and partner George Hansen a typically fine Robert Duvall. After a long and painful recovery Locken gets a gig to protect noble Asian politician Yuen Chung well played by Mako and a prime opportunity to exact revenge on Hansen. Director Sam Peckinpah working from an edgy and convoluted script by Marc Norman and Stirling Silliphant astutely captures a distinctly 70's postWatergate atmosphere of dread paranoia and moral ambiguity while exploring his usual themes of ethics friendship loyalty and betrayal. Peckinpah stages several bangup action set pieces with his customary stylistic flair a failed hit at an airport a wild shootout and subsequent car chase on the streets of San Francisco and the exciting climax at an empty ships' graveyard. Cann and Duvall both do sterling work in the lead roles they receive able support from Arthur Hill as the duplicitous Cap Collins Bo Hopkins as nutty livewire gunman Jerome Miller Gig Young as the gloomy Lawrence Weyburn Burt Young as cynical cab driver Mac and the lovely Tiana as Chung's feisty daughter Tommie. Kate Heflin brings a sweet and appealing warmth to her part as Locken's helpful and sympathetic nurse girlfriend Amy. Moreover this picture pushes the PG rating as far as it can go the starling moments of ferocious violence are pretty brutal and grisly and we even get a decent smidgen of tasty gratuitous female nudity look fast for ubiquitous softcore starlet Ushi Digard in a cool uncredited bit. Philip H. Lathrop's handsome widescreen cinematography makes neat occasional use of graceful fades and dissolves. Jerry Fielding provides an effectively varied and shivery score. While not one of Peckinpah's bestever movies the film suffers from an overlong running time and the narrative meanders quite a bit it's still worth seeing for fans of Bloody Sam just the same.".

Sadly the scene isn't anywhere near as badass as it sounds on paper and to get there we have endure an awful lot of sluggish exposition that will most likely disappoint the majority of the director's fans.The film opens explosively enough with Mike Locken Caan and George Hansen Robert Duvall completing a job for ComTeg a private agency contracted by the C.I.A. to handle work of a more 'sensitive' nature. Locken and Hansen friends as well as colleagues are then tasked with protecting a defector but things take an unexpected turn when Hansen who has been bought out by a rival group executes their ward and then turns his gun on Locken shooting him in the arm and leg.Critically wounded Locken is rushed to hospital and undergoes emergency surgery followed by months of intensive physiotherapy. Against all odds Locken recuperates to the point where he is once again able to work driven by the idea of taking revenge on his old buddy Hansen.With Locken's gradual rehabilitation taking up the bulk of the movie The Killer Elite is remarkably devoid of the brutal violence and slowmotion bloodshed that one associates with Peckinpah with even a machine gun shootout in a crowded street resulting in only one dead body. Worse still the ninja showdown that had first attracted my attention comes right at the end of the film and consists of uninspired and poorly choreographed fight action featuring some of the most inept ninjas imaginable.Apparently the film was made by Peckinpah while he was experiencing the newfound pleasures of cocaine which goes a long way to explain why it is such a mess.".

This was very evident in this film and made one think. I like it when Burt Young's character says 'with all these public disturbance violations you'll get 100 years'. That is refreshing and insightful. No modern filmmaker thinks about how ridiculous it is for some characters to be destroying everything in their way to get to the bad guys. Later on Burt Young's character says 'no modern government cares about the security of it's people'. Absolutely correct on that one! This movie was very realistic and had a lot of great scenery of the San Francisco area. It also shows how so many in the espionage business get tired of being used by all sides for money and power. The only drawback was the ending. Showing the ninjas slowly moving out of the shadows of the ship's hull was silly. I did like the scene where James Caan's character shot is boss enough so he would live but be injured. He wanted to show his boss how lightly he treated human life and what it really was like being disabled by service in espionage.".

It's a story about highlevel contract killers and mercenaries hired out in secret by the CIA. The story investigates the friendship between Mike Locken James Caan and George Hansen Robert Duvall two of the highclass mercenaries working to protect VIPs and radical international diplomats.The early character development is good the dialog and accents are all pretty enjoyable on the ears the camaraderie between the mercenaries is fun to watch you don't see chemistry like this in action movies anymore! and the action scenes  as expected of Peckinpah  are intense and well thoughtout.There is a considerable amount of handtohand combat on display here. Some of the dojo scenes with KarateJudo stuff are not bad but not totally amazing either. It's cool that Peckinpah wanted to include this stuff but why would high level secret operatives train in Gendai modern sportified public organized Japanese martial arts? I thought that was pretty hokey.And then we have the real problem later in the film the bad guys are a bunch of ninjas. Ninjas huh? I understand that the movie is kinda tongueincheek and is about unrealistically tough contract killers and so forth but the cheesy ninja costumes and the poorly choreographed fight scenes with them not to mention the abstract and borderline offensive duel regarding honor instantly date this movie and make it something of a novelty.Peckinpah had serious substance abuse problems at this point and maybe that's what causes the weird pacing. Had this movie been shorter and ended at the end of the second third with a more concise message it would've been pretty solid. It also could've developed some of the supporting characters more than it did.Still there are some pretty good things to be found here. Really good action scenes some memorable characters and dialog and some decent commentary on corrupt powerplayers who run politics and business. It's just too bad everyone involved seems to be on autopilot.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is certainly watchable enough but the movie at times falls flat with its story that at times becomes quite ridicules.It was great to see Robert Duvall and James Caan together again in this movie. Their scene's together were highly enjoyable and great to watch. The scene's in which they are together are highly professionally act in but those scene's are too few present in the movie. For some reason the movie highly under uses Robert Duvall.At points the story is dragging and it never takes the right pace. On top of that there are some highly unlikely and to be frank totally uninteresting elements in the story which makes this movie an at times uneven one to watch.Still The Killer Elite is an enjoyable '70's flick. This is of course mainly due to the presence of Caan and Duvall and some other fine well known actors but also thanks to the great action direction from director Sam Peckinpah. There really are some good action sequences that are well constructed and executed.The '70's style and atmosphere and way of movie making is clearly present during the whole movie which makes this movie a great one to watch for the fans of that movie period.It's a perfectly watchable little '70's actionthriller but by no means it's a must see. When you get the chance it's worth watching though.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It may not be the greatest hour of Sam Peckinpahbut it's still one of the best films of the 70's.Of course there is films like the godfather and the taxidriverbut who caresman. The killer elite is such a different movie.It's got all the elements you need for a martial artsgunfight movie.It's all there in one package. Not to mention perfect actorsstory and the location.Every time i watch itit takes me back to the great moviemaking. The killer elite is a serious moviewhich doesn't take itself too seriously.Action with Sam Peckinpah slow motion scenes.All the characters are great.Mike Locken as a bit of a slowbut all the time thinking the next step.Jerome Miller as a gun expert. Mac as a every guy.George Hansen as cold blooded killer. There's not much womenbut they're still existing.San Francisco at it's best.Great pictures of Mike Locken getting to a better shape around the City streetsall the hills and the bay area. Sausalitos wooden homes and of coursethe suisun bay with the mothball fleet.I'll never get tired to watch those locations.As a matter of facti'll never get tired to watch this film over and over again.There is not even one bad element in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's official James Caan plays my favorite spyhero with a limp and a cane. It certainly is a unique twist to have a physicallydisabled fellow as the action guy but of course it is the betrayal and shootingin the knee and elbowof Mike Locken played wonderfully by Caan that fuels the rest of the movie. Locken who tends to joke his way through dangerous jobs and doesn't seem to believe in anything even as he serves his country albeit as freelancer wants revenge...but is physically unable to go after it.At least that's the prediction. Caan's two bosses played by Gig Young and Arthur Hill take the doctor's gloomy prognosis as writ and Caan is to be forced into retirement even as our hero insists that he will not be shelved. Soon after this an Asian politician whose life is under threat in his native country arrives in San Francisco but given what erupts before he and his entourage including feisty daughter are barely off the plane it's clear that ninja assassins have followed him on his little visit. When the intended hit goes pearshaped the man who shot up Caan is brought in as backupand suddenly Caan is the flavor of the month again. Though Revenge and Bodyguard lines blur as Caan resorts to using the targets as bait to flush out the old friend who bushwacked him.This strange film is one I have grown to like more than I ever did upon first viewing when I went enh izz okay. I think what has happened with me and repeated viewings is that I am now welldistanced from the film I thought I was going to see and am quite fond of what THE KILLER ELITE is actually doing...and doing quite well mostly. This happened to me recently with the film starring Gene Hackman called THE CONVERSATION which I was forced to reevaluate after a second perusal and it's the exact same thing expectations not met but expectations were unfair. Part of it is the obvious wanting more action a faster pace wanting a James Bond spy movie or Bourne more action the modern pacing maybe even more glitz and pyrotechnics. And even when the action scenes come in a 70s film how can they compete with what gets cooked up for these thrillrides we get today? They can't.Caan is perfect as the crippled hero his bosses use that word so I repeat it who maybe can think about walking in a year. His acting of frustrating bodypain is very convincing which you already know if you've seen him in the great film MISERY. Earlier I said Caan has many scenes showing a gradual physical rehabilitation and I deliberately didn't say and mental rehabilitation because there is no mental rehabilitation. That is not a slight on Caan's actingfar from it. The character of Mike Locken never crumbles mentally. He wants to walk again. He tries too hard to walk again. He is trapped in a body that was superbly conditioned for covert action and he can't stand lying around hearing how it won't ever get much better. Once his tender nurse Amywho devotes all her time to helping this wise cracking bear of a man get at least to crutches levelbegins to fall for him they go for dinner and Caan tries too hard too soon to prove he can move about like anyone without leg and arm braces. It's a fiasco. And by this time Peckinpah and Caan have shown expertly that the action can wait while character is shown and romance blooms.Anyway once the crutches are tossed in the river and replaced by a cane that can be wielded in combat as well as just being used to walk about on dates with a loyal woman we know that the film is slowly shifting gears and the Peckinpah action hiding for a while after the bloody start is coming back. There could be another traitorous rat. There will be swordplay gunplay a bomb under a car payoffs and death drops. The leadin to all that may seem a little ponderous but for me it gives the film soul. And thank ruddy goodness that Caan's limp doesn't just dissolve into thin air when the carnage erupts!In my review of THE NATURAL I was a bit disparaging when it comes to icon Robert Duvall but with THE KILLER ELITE I must rebound a bit and say that Duvall really delivers. As a guy with a lot on his mind at the start he really nails that brooding concentration just sort of slipping out from his wiseguy antics and dialogue and hinting what he's really about. Then when he comes back into the story the menace is palpable but not overdone. No if anyone gets on my nerves in this film it's Burt Young bless him but if I ever have to see a guy muck with his hat and finger point and wave his hand up around his head for no reason and generally fidget his way through a performance I'm going to go out of my mind. The ending has been criticized as a throwaway. Well things do get a bit weird at the finish. Serious mood gravitas gets trashed as characters joke about some violence going on around them. But...we knew these characters were jaded cynical disillusioned only halfbelieving in what they fought for the whole time. I don't love it but I don't hate it. I sort of zone out on the martial arts freeforall that erupts and zone in on the sudden death of a character and the closure for Caan when it comes to settling up with the final betrayer.Something different and refreshing.".

If you stand Killer Elite next to Junior Bonner you have two under written films whose characters experience little transformation.  Yet J.B. is a tightly crafted film.  Peckinpah wastes little time telling us his story.  His signature portrayal of his male protagonist as super stud is handled in one ridiculous scene the bar fight and we move on.  Peckinpah gets the most out McQueen Robert Preston and Mary Murphy.  In K.E. we start the film with Caan in bed and then digress again as he wins over his nurse.  Peckinpah obviously had a thing with nurses since the tryst in Cross of Iron had Coburn over coming his injuries to win the heart of his pliant healer.  The Killer Elite is too long too slow and in many moments just plain ridiculous.  James Caan and Robert Duvall do little to distinguish themselves or raise the level of this film.  Arthur Hill Bo Hopkins Mako and Burt Young deliver familiar performances as the familiar characters that kept them employed but rightfully won them no praise.

OK so I was lying about that last one. And that is one of the best twists of the film the main character is a screwup and doesn't act very heroically until very very late in the film.

Where most other movies of this type give the audience 2 answers before a single question is answered Idle Hands has no fears about leaving things unanswered where the viewer can make their own mind up for once. Devon Sawa makes for a convincing and cute Anton while Jessica Alba is all thats needed to keep the target audience of under 20's males glued to their seats. Don't get me wrong this isn't up there with the likes of Lawrence of Arabia but it never sets out to be it's hilariously funny satisfyingly gory and one hell of a lot better than you'd ever think. Go rent it you'l be pleasantly surprised. Also the soundtrack is great.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Idle Hands is like watching an Rrated rendition of Beetlejuice.  It has the same tone as the Tim Burton classic.  Though it is basically a dark comedyemphasize the word dark as much as you canthere are some moments of graphic violence that the casual moviegoer might not expect out of a comedy.  But not all comedies are meant to be like Mel Brooks movies.  Peter Berg explained it perfectly on the David Letterman show when he was talking about Very Bad Things which he wrote and directed.  He said Just like how some people like me like our food spicysome people also want their comedy spicy.  Just like Very Bad Things Idle Hands is a grotesque slightly offputting comedy that won't be taken easily but that's part of its appeal.  It gives you that dark comic rush.  And there are moments where you can't help but laugh hysterically.  Seth Green and the other boyI don't know his namehave some extremely funny moments.  Most of the jokes have to do with scatological and drugrelated elements but they work perfectly.  This is not for the prudish not tailormade for the sick and twisted though they would probably take delight but makes intelligent use of gruesome and coarse gags.  I know that doesn't sound appealing on paper but you'll see what I mean.  See for yourself.  Idle Hands is not for all tastes it's not sophisticated and I would call it a popcorn movie...but you'd probably throw up your popcorn if you were to watch this flick.  As for eye candy for the guys we have the stunningly beautiful Jessica Alba who never gets naked Dammit! but struts around in a revealing blue nightie with her beautiful cleavage on display.  She's just one of those extremely cute babes that you just want to cuddle like a teddy bear.  Idle Hands may do the Devil's work but it makes heavenly entertainment!My score  7 out of 10".

One comes to mind in particular where someone gets a knitting needle rammed straight into their ear. It's not nice stuff but it's so funny you can't help but laugh. A major question first and foremost just what the hell was Vivica A. Fox doing in this movie? I've never used the word slumming before in a sentence but I think it applies here. Devon Sawa is a cool cat. I liked him here and his brand of physical comedy is pretty impressive. Watch Final Destination after seeing this and I think you'll wonder why we haven't seen more of him. Seth Green is cool and so are Elden Henson and Jack Noseworthy. And for Jessica Alba fans she's in here in all her preDark Angel glory. I've never used the word nubile but I think it definitely applies here. She looks so good in this movie that it hurts my chest. She's one of the finer points literally of the movie. There's a chick in this movie wearing Paul Stanley's KISS makeup that should email me so I can give her my home address. There's parts of the movie that kinda fall flat but that's to be expected. Check this movie out if nonpc humor and bad mojo violence is your thing. Especially if you liked Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn I think you'll dig this picture. And if you appreciate Jessica Alba in any way. Rating  out of .".

It isn't long before Anton discovers his horribly mutilated parents and that his right hand has been possessed by Satan.  His hand soon kills his best friends Mick and Pnub.  With the help of a priestess DebiVivica A. Fox and a local headbanger Jack Noseworthy Anton comes up with a few odd ways of keeping his hand occupied from its homicidal tendencies such as listening to heavy metal and needle point. Let me just say that this movie is hilarious.  I should also say that this movie is also one of the grossest and goriest movies I've ever seen.  There are quite a few hilarious moments as well as a few shocking ones. Vivica A. Fox's name says it all and Jessica Alba isn't bad to look at either.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Idle Hands isn't priority viewing for horror fans but it's a very entertaining little gem nevertheless. Cast and crew were smart enough to put the whole horror genre into perspective a bit and therefore this feels a lot more like a lightheaded spoof than a sickening gore flick. Ever since that dreadful Scream the teenslasher flicks are going through a revival and Idle Hands picks into this in a funny way with a very exaggerated plot eccentric characters and outrageous situations. Devon Sawa Final Destination stars as an offbeat teenager whose goal in life is too sleep late and smoke dope. It takes him quite some time to realize that his right hand is possessed by evil forces that force him to kill. With the help of his stonerfriends killed as well but too lazy to reach for the light at the end of the tunnel he has got to prevent that the beautiful muse across the street gets killed by the bloodthirsty hand. The storyline is ultrathin but don't let that keep you from having a good time watching the wellelaborated gore effects and funny oneliners. Very creative but especially comic butchering in this film as it for example contains one of the potheads getting stabbed in the head with a beer bottle! That same bottle than remains embedded in his skull for the rest of the movie which is a pretty cool sight. There are terrific tributes to horror titles that featured the same idea of a murderous hand earlier like Evil Dead 2 or Oliver Stone's The Hand and an excellent soundtrack with songs from Mtley Cre Rob Zombie and The Ramones. The best acting performance is given by Seth Green who has an undeniable talent for comedy roles. And then there's Jessica Alba who portrays one of the most gorgeous horrorheroines ever! I've seen a few episodes of her Dark Angel TVshow but she definitely didn't this good there! Idle Hands is an overall okay film...not good enough to be named among the better horrorcomedies but surely a lot better than the so many other pretentious spoofs.".

	schema:headline " Decent comedy staring the Devil's Plaything";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSThere's a famous phrase used to some degree most recently in Britain's adverts for Virgin Mobile that idle hands are the devil's plaything. This sets up this novel idea of a lazy bum who does so little with his day that one day his hand is possessed. It's a clever idea which is never taken particularly seriously and the film benefits as a result of this laid back attitude.In Idle Hands this lazy waste of space who spends his entire time watching television and smoking pot is Anton Tobias Devon Sawa. Waking up one day Anton follows his regular routine of walking downstairs in the clothes he slept in getting some cereal putting cartoons on ignoring the news late quoting that I hate that show and slowly getting stoned. Added to this equation are his two stoner friends Mick Seth Green and Pnub Elden Henson. As events unfold these three team together to defeat Anton's possessed right hand and to save Anton's girlfriend Molly Jessica Alba.The beauty of Idle Hands is exactly that it doesn't take itself seriously. With a relatively intense first five minutes in which Anton's parents are killed in an almost Halloween 1978 style demise the film itself being shot on the same neighbourhood as it's predecessor the film lightens up and retreats to a position of fun the second Sawa's stoner appears on screen. From this moment on Idle Hands features some brilliant lines a LOT of extreme gore a gorgeous woman in revealing outfits and a huge ammount of marajuana.As well as such beautiful lines as My work here is done. Time for the ritualistic sex and Yeah I was a little bitter about the getting killed by my best friend thing but I've had time to get over it this film has an amazing soundtrack. Actually featuring the Punk band Offspring live on stage at one point the film also features music by Blink 182 Rob Zombie and the awesome Motley Crue. If anything Idle Hands appears to be a film dedicated to the Horror Genre rock music and the stoner lifestyle. It never gives the impression from five minutes onwards that it wants to be taken seriously and at times it feels like it actually wants to be added to that distinguished list of cult films which stoned people actually watch after a couple of spliffs.Perhaps the one final point worth mentioning about this film is the amazing variation in the casts future. Whilst nobody can really be pushed forward as an example of superb acting on this occasion perhaps Seth Green deserving the best praise the main cast have lead remarkably variable careers. Whilst Seth Green Vivica A Fox and Jessica Alba have both featured in television and film heavily Alba being signed up to play Susan Storm in 2005's Fantastic Four the contrasting disappearance of Devon Sawa Elden Henson and Jack Noseworthy is remarkable. Sawa inparticular manages to have gone from staring in this film and 2000's Final Destination to unheard of films with practically noneexistent box office potential. It's strange how Idle Hands appears to be both a leaping post for certain actors and an acting graveyard for others.To sum up Idle Hands therefore. For the first five minutes this film gives a strong indication that it will be a typical tense horror film which will have an element of originality but nothing special. The second Sawa appears on screen and begins to get stoned however the film takes off as it suddenly begins to pay tribute to different topics ranging from horror to marajuana. Idle Hands is a brilliant film with some classic lines. It might never be critically acclaimed but it never seems to have wanted to be but for a group of teenagers sitting around at a weekend with or without drugs it's a sure fire hit. Well worth a viewing.".

I use Idle Hands to break up the marathon with a bit of humor and levity when the serious and somber horror films start to take their psychological toll and depress everyone. It brings everyone back into the mood of the marathon and refreshes us with some laughter. It is to my marathon what the porter is to Macbeth you might say.In this context the film is great. I don't know if I would rate it very highly on its own however. It is worth watching and if you like campy gore mixed some black humor you will have a good time watching it.

So were Seth Green Elden Ratclif and Jessica Alba. The only complaints I have about this movie are that they didn't use the forget that man it's too far in the movie and the two songs I really liked from the movie the one playing when Anton and Molly first meet and the one playing near the end just before Anton gets crushed by the car were not on the soundtrack.Anyway go rentbuy this if you have a bizzare sense of humor like me!  910".

One can only take so many poorly written jokes one can only take so many unimaginative splatter shots and one can only take Devon Sawa for more than 2 seconds.  His raspy vocals coupled with his probably methenhanced performance is appalling.  This coming so quickly after I was sure Jimmy Tuckett's Clubland performance was the worst of the year. This is the kind of film that believes more is more.  I haven't seen a film that played at such an aggressive note in some time. It's assaultive to the senses.  Using Dolby shocks more than you would like to believe director Rodman Flender pretty much shows he has nothing up his sleeve.  Idle Hands is supposed to be funny but it's not. Idle Hands wants to scare you too but it can't.  Both are due to the laughably bad screenplay.  It would be easy to accuse it of stealing  which it does in large amounts  but the screenwriters this actually had two people's contributions can't even make the elements that have worked before work for them. It's all just a big waste of film stock. Reliable talent like Seth Green just can't make this awful film any fun.  And I love stoner humor too! Future Jennifer Love Hewitt Jessica Alba shows she nothing more than a pretty real pretty face. The rest of the actors are stuck just trying to scream above the soundtrack. While this isn't this should be the last of the Scream type postmodern horror films.  It's an idea that has run it's course and an idea that didn't produce one good film. 0".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Kirche bleibt im Dorf or The Church stays in the Village is a 2012 movie from director Ulrike Grote. Despite being more known as an actress her so far biggest achievement was probably an Academy Award nomination in the short film category. This movie here is probably only really interesting for Swabians living in some village. It's about a wealthy American Mr. Jones who comes to the central characters' village and wants to buy their church for up to 10 millions. Of course there are two feuding families in the village. One wants to sell and the other doesn't. And then there is also a Romey and Juliet like love story. And the village people are scared of a curse when somebody is bleeding randomly out of their nose.The English language humor coming when the people talk to Mr. Jones is not particularly funny either. Otto Waalkes did this much more entertaining many many years ago. It's all very stereotypical and not particularly creative or interesting. The only scene which made me smile a bit was when they locked the one guy away as he disagreed with them. However in retrospective I have to say it was quite disrespectful as well. The film's biggest weakness was possibly the ending. It's one of these where they fix everything that went wrong in the last 80 minutes in the final 5 minutes without any realistic approach just for the feelgood sake of the audience. Very disappointing. They certainly should have gone for a happy ending if they wanted to but maybe without sacrificing all credibility. I cannot recommend this.It seems most viewers disagreed with me though as this was turned into a TV series right afterward and next year there will be a second movie as well. I would be surprised if this movie is shown somewhere outside the Germanspeaking countries so my suggestion is you watch a television episode of the show decide if the dialectfocused humor is your cup of tea and if so you watch the movie. Oh yeah and on a final note the intro and outro reminded me of Catch Me If You Can.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Klasse von '99  Schule war gestern Leben ist jetzt or just 9099 is a German 90minute movie from 2003 so this one will have its 15th anniversary next year and this one is written and directed by Marco Petry. He made this three years after his trademark film Schule and officially this one here is even considered a sequel I believe. However I don't see any great connections here. Not even Axel Stein pretty much the only one appearing in both films takes up his character from the first film. So I guess the sequel connection is that the previous film shows us the final days of school while this one here shows us what happens afterward such as postschool education with the central character here trying to become a police officer. He is played by Matthias Schweighfer who is definitely a bigger star today than he was back then when this film was made. And while I am usually being pretty harsh on him he wasn't all bad in here. Then again it helped certainly that he didn't have a stupid romantic pseudodramatic story line this time and that it certainly isn't too big a challenge to shine next to the likes of Tim Sander GZSZ and Axel Stein Hausmeister Krause. I still won't say it was a good or even great performance but it is on par with the script sometimes fine at other moments forgettable. It also didn't seem as forced and tryhard as Schweighfer's recent stuff or we could even say stuff from the last decade so maybe he should try this approach again today. Storywise it's a tolerable movie. With the death of one character it seems a bit dramatic for the sake of it and honestly the part which is at the very core about an aspiring police officer smuggling drugs is so absurd that you just cannot like the main character because of his stupidity. And the explanation that his tendency to go criminal is already an indicator for the police not being the right path for him on a professional level is not satisfying in my opinion. But there were also better moments like the romance story in the second half of the film admittedly so this film as a whole is not a failure. But it also isn't on a level where I would recommend it only because it is better than Schule which is gigantic garbage from start to finish. Reading the cast list for this sequel I was expecting the worst but the outcome was definitely not as bad as I feared. Still I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

This movie has got it all  a cheesy theme sung by Alice Cooper a high school terrorized by drug dealing punks a classic sequence where a square student high on something or other decides to salute the flag... at the top of the flagpole... plus a bit with rabbits which I won't spoil. TV regular Perry King no stranger to exploitation movies see 'Mandingo' plays a new and idealistic music teacher. He is befriended by another teacher the cynical secret drinker Roddy McDowall 'Planet Of The Apes' who tries to wise him up. Future 'Sopranos' writerdirector Timothy Van Patten plays Stegman who sells drugs to his classmates and leads a ruthless gang of hoods. When King tries to break Stegman's hold on the school he enters into a world of pain. This is a silly but hugely entertaining pile of trash. Be sure to keep an eye out for Michael J. Fox in one of his earliest roles as a horn playing dweeb. Director Mark Lester eventually made a sequel in name only 'Class Of 1999' but it was disappointing and silly sci fi nonsense about robot teachers. I can't recommend that one but 'Class Of 1984' is classic beer'n'pizza material that will be enjoyed by any fans of nasty bgrade exploitation.".

Actor Van Patten who gives a believable knockout performance actually composed and played the piece himself. Michael J.

The film carried a prophetic message back in the early 80's when it was made and it's a message that is even more appropriate today in our politically correct times where teachers have no power to discipline students and students have every right at their disposal and know it. The film's climax is explosive and Lester never lets a gory opportunity pass him by. A classic in every sense.".

	schema:headline " Very very violent revenge thriller. You might want to hate this film but in a totally immoral way it's undeniably compelling.";
	schema:reviewBody "Class of 1984 is a calculatedly unpleasant revenge thriller. It's the kind of film that any viewer with a shred of moral dignity will expect to hate.... but the film is surprisingly well acted and in its ruthless and unrelenting way very compelling. The depiction of life in a roughashell high school is somewhat grim and unbelievable and the dialogue often rings rather false. However Class of 1984 exists as an exploitation revenger so in many ways it's pointless to try to judge it on a deeper level. As exploitation revengers go this one delivers.Music teacher Andrew Norris Perry King of The Choirboys and Mandingo  a bit of an exploitation veteran arrives at the Abraham Lincoln High School as a substitute memberofstaff. Pretty soon he realises that he's just taken on a position at one of the roughest toughest schools in the world. The school is in a grip of fear due to relentless bullying intimidation and drug dealing under a gang of misfits led by Peter Stegman Timothy Van Patten. However Andrew refuses to be intimidated by Stegman and his cronies. Consequently Stegman resorts to increasingly violent and threatening courses of action in his attempts to victimise the teacher until Andrew finally snaps and dishes out his own brand of discipline.I really really wanted to deplore this film. I'm a teacher myself for Christ's sake!! Films which glorify violent schools and sadistic pupils generally tend to annoy me because they send out a completely immoral message to impressionable viewers. Amazingly I actually found Class of 1984 to be an OK film. Most performances in it are good  King as the teacher trying to control unruly students is agreeable Van Patten oozes menace as a psychopathic bully and Roddy McDowall quickly overcomes what seems to be miscasting to deliver a great performance as an alcoholic biology teacher on the brink of a breakdown. But the film succeeds best in its unashamed audience manipulation  by the end even the most lenient and tolerant of viewers will cheer on Andrew Norris as he goes on his Death Wishstyle revenge spree. This film will never win any awards for subtlety but within its genre it is a significant entry.".

It's a pretty tense and wellacted melodrama starring Perry King as a high school teacher who is forced to take matters into his own hands when the toughest kid in school makes trouble for him. Roddy McDowall plays a fellow teacher who resorts to unorthodox learning techniques when they become necessary.  Michael J. Fox prestardom has a small part as one of King's students.  The movie resembles BLACKBOARD JUNGLE in many ways but I didn't mind because it worked well on its own terms. Timothy Van Patten who plays the tough kid is a memorable villain.  He certainly deserves his ultimate fate.  The movie is violent as it's supposed to be but not overly so.  It's much more entertaining than 187. It also offers a look into the early '80's punk scene and features an Alice Cooper song I am the Future during the opening and closing credits.".

	schema:headline " Fashionable Cult Classic which doesn't shy away from its main purpose.";
	schema:reviewBody "A new music teacher Andry Norris arrives at Lincoln High where most students have no respect for their fellow teachers and even to extent each other. After being given advice from a fellow teacher to turn a blind eye to a ruthless gang which seems to control the school with such ease but Mr. Norris doesn't like the idea of that. So at any opportunity he gets he tries to get Peter Stegman and his gang of thugs into trouble which they seem to getaway with endlessly. But Mr. Norris doesn't know that getting in the way of Stegman means he and his wife will get a whole lot more than they bargain for.Caching! I definitely got my moneys worth on this Bgrade exploitation cult classic. Yeah I heard good things about this flick but to be honest I wasn't expecting too much but that's probably why I dug it even more. 'Class of 1984' is an ambitious but to the point project by writerdirector Mark Lester. Plot wise it doesn't really hit home because its simple and just plain ludicrous but it's the involving acts and performances which do hold up and makes for one hypnotic viewing. Forget about thinking that this is made in the 80's so this must be your usual teen flick of that decade because it's FAR from it actually! There's no sugar coating sweetness in this flick. These devastating punks aren't the type of kids you want to bump into! And actually the shock is you'll be rooting for the teacher this time around. I wouldn't be surprise if this were one of those video nasties because this ripsnorting welcoming unapologetic trash doesn't hold back on its exploitative context. Simply its unpleasant with its frequent violence and rough black humour and wit. Blatantly that's what it's trying to do and it does remarkably well. Creating intense situations and shocks like the disturbing scene involving rabbits and rape helped out by the brutal violence but too it had wry sense of humour which you couldn't help but snicker. Don't go into it expecting a deep background character study to what makes these kids tick because here they just do! What we get is a satire on violence that leads to revenge. Also it takes a look at teacher and student relationship and how it can turn around in an instance on who is the bad guy and who isn't. Especially since the teacher tries to do the things by the book but he soon realises he can't win and has to walk the path of those brutes and turn into what despises to reach an outcome. What is scary is that the whole urban jungle nightmare in the school grounds isn't too far away from the truth nowadays. Mark Lester Tom Holland and John Saxton came up with a competent dark screenplay that stacks up some overtheedge surprises but also involving and wellrounded characters especially for this type of flick. The violence is grisly and there are some neat gory slices of blood letting which a lot seem to happen in the wayoverboard climax but I got a kick out of the ironic ending too that goes well with what all always eventuates throughout. Exhilarating camerawork and snappy pacing also work a treat. The performances were hugely sensational. Perry King as Mr. Norris generally has interesting and appealing persona about him that you'll be cheering on his character and the great Roddy McDowall turns in a professional performance especially when that of his character finally cracks under the pressure. Timothy Van Patten is the star here as the cunningly vile Peter Stegman. His performance is simply memorable and that anger of his character is incredibly uneasy to watch. The maniac group just stirs the pot. And you got a supporting role from a gawky Michael Fox yep there no J here. While some of those unsettling and offensive images stay in your also you will have to cope with the catchy tune 'I am the future' by Alice Cooper. You get a dose during the beginning and then for the closing credits I couldn't get that damn song out of my head! It's cheesy but deliciously tasty. The bulletining rock soundtrack pounds out the tracks and the rumbling score is far than weak. Competently made but otherwise still holding a raw touch to it with its hard going tactics and thrills.Riveting junk that's highly enjoyable. That's HIGHLY!".

These devastating punks aren't the type of kids you want to bump into! And actually the shock is you'll be rooting for the teacher this time around. I wouldn't be surprise if this were one of those video nasties because this ripsnorting welcoming unapologetic trash doesn't hold back on its exploitative context. Simply its unpleasant with its frequent violence and rough black humour and wit. Blatantly that's what it's trying to do and it does remarkably well. Creating intense situations and shocks like the disturbing scene involving rabbits and rape helped out by the brutal violence but too it had wry sense of humour which you couldn't help but snicker. Don't go into it expecting a deep background character study to what makes these kids tick because here they just do! What we get is a satire on violence that leads to revenge. Also it takes a look at teacher and student relationship and how it can turn around in an instance on who is the bad guy and who isn't. Especially since the teacher tries to do the things by the book but he soon realises he can't win and has to walk the path of those brutes and turn into what despises to reach an outcome. What is scary is that the whole urban jungle nightmare in the school grounds isn't too far away from the truth nowadays. Mark Lester Tom Holland and John Saxton came up with a competent dark screenplay that stacks up some overtheedge surprises but also involving and wellrounded characters especially for this type of flick. The violence is grisly and there are some neat gory slices of blood letting which a lot seem to happen in the wayoverboard climax but I got a kick out of the ironic ending too that goes well with what all always eventuates throughout. Exhilarating camerawork and snappy pacing also work a treat. The performances were hugely sensational. Perry King as Mr. Norris generally has interesting and appealing persona about him that you'll be cheering on his character and the great Roddy McDowall turns in a professional performance especially when that of his character finally cracks under the pressure. Timothy Van Patten is the star here as the cunningly vile Peter Stegman. His performance is simply memorable and that anger of his character is incredibly uneasy to watch. The maniac group just stirs the pot. And you got a supporting role from a gawky Michael Fox yep there no J here. While some of those unsettling and offensive images stay in your also you will have to cope with the catchy tune 'I am the future' by Alice Cooper. You get a dose during the beginning and then for the closing credits I couldn't get that damn song out of my head! It's cheesy but deliciously tasty. The bulletining rock soundtrack pounds out the tracks and the rumbling score is far than weak. Competently made but otherwise still holding a raw touch to it with its hard going tactics and thrills.Riveting junk that's highly enjoyable. That's HIGHLY!";

	schema:reviewBody "Holy Smokes. I will start off by saying that I just finished watching this movie today for the first time and I fell in love. I'm reviewing this film from the perspective that this is a cult classic film through and through and so I shall begin. The story is about a teacher who gets a job at a school that is known to be full of gangs and a plethora of other misfits. He then starts to have trouble with the main school gang which are basic NeoNazi punks. The story is simplistic but does the job. The acting was great for a film that was made in 1982 not that there were not a ton of phenomenal actors back then either to say. The teacher Mr.Norris played by Perry King is Outstanding and the other highlight is his enemy Peter Stegman played by Timothy Van Patten who was truly mesmerizing. The other actors and actresses did a great job as well. The action was Awesome. The choreography could be a little off at times but for the times and the budget it was working with I thought the director Mark Lester did an Incredible job. The deaths were very cool and overall they did a killer job. No pun intended. The cinematography and location were excellent. The crew did a terrific job of shadowing over what a crime ridden school would look like along with the town it was surrounded by in the film. I will close by saying that this is a MustWatch film if you're a fan of films such as A Clockwork Orange and also The Warriors and films that represent warnings on what our future's could look like if left in the hands of madmen. The film can be graphic at times but none of it phased me because I have seen a lot worse but just a forewarning. Please don't be deterred from watching this Absolutely Astounding film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1980's was the decade responsible for some of the silliest films known to man but many of these films actually have something about them  much like this satire on the antagonistic relationship between teachers and pupils. Some people may be dismayed by the massively over the top plotting but this is the entire point of the movie. It's unrealistic and silly but that's what makes the satire hit home. It might not be too over the top these days either with the shocking violence reported from some schools. The plot follows Andy Norris the replacement music teacher at a Lincoln high school a school that is run not by the teachers but by a powerful clique lead by Peter Stegman. It doesn't take long for the new teacher and the gang leader to develop an acute hatred of one another which leads to all kinds of trouble for both of them. The plot of Class of 1984 isn't important really it's the stunts and ultraviolence that is and the film features a lot of both. Some of it is actually quite shocking while other parts of the movie are downright hilarious. Basically the film is just a good time throughout.The style that Class of 1984 takes on is similar to that of the earlier teen exploitation flick 'The Warriors' and the dark atmosphere of the film creates a similarly postapocalyptic theme. The dark tone of the movie blends well with the events that take place and despite the fact that this is a satire it's actually quite frightening. The gore on display isn't relentless but it is shocking when it comes. Scenes that see someone have their arm cut off by a circular saw and someone dropped through a skylight are shocking in an almost humorous way and are hard to really be shocked by  but a scene that sees a laboratory decorated by dead rabbits definitely succeeds in being macabre and quite disturbing. The acting in the film is largely good with the ensemble cast putting in performances that are realistic and suit the mood of the picture. The film is exciting throughout but it takes on a life of it's own once we reach the final twenty minutes. That's when the story comes together and the violence is at it's most prolific. I'm surprised that this film hasn't gone on to receive more of a welcome reception but nevertheless this is really good stuff. Recommended!".

	schema:headline " One of my favourites of the '80s";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite being made on a low budget with a relatively noname cast CLASS OF 1984 has become something of a classic when it comes to cult cinema. Not since DEATH WISH have we had such a realistic gritty lowdown slice of urban exploitation and here the violence is played out brutally and inevitably within the walls of a rundown school terrorised by a gang of malicious victimising punks. This powerful film is miles ahead of something like 187 in its depiction of classroom violence and although the subject matter is offensive the film is still gripping to watch. It's one of the rare instances where I was hooked to the screen and couldn't possibly stop watching until the credits rolled.Despite being made thirty years ago the film hasn't really dated and in fact seems perhaps even more important today certainly in the age of classroom shootings and ghetto violence it's not difficult to believe that somewhere in the world stuff like this is really going on. Director Mark Lester known for making violent movies  take COMMANDO for example charts the action well with his matteroffact direction which really puts the action in your face. However it's not just about the action although there is a lot of it the characterisation and storyline are just as important if not more so. Music by the veteran Lalo Shifrin keeps things moving along and an opening song by Alice Cooper seems appropriate. There's a nice sense of pacing which means those ninety minutes just seem to fly by.Lester's cast is mainly packed with unfamiliar faces which is a plus in a realistic film like this although a couple of famous actors do show up. In the lead role Perry King THE POSSESSION OF JOEL DELANEY is excellent as the victimised teacher who is finally pushed to the edge by the terrorising punks when his pregnant wife is raped. His ordinary even kind teacher makes for a sympathetic hero and we're behind him all the way. Merrie Lynn Ross is okay as his loving wife but her role is a very minor one seemingly there for plot purposes only. Timothy Van Patten shines as the leader of the punk gang Stegman an intelligent lad who has dedicated his life to evil pursuits. The other gang members are fine too even though their roles are onedimensional.Famous faces to look out for include Michael J Fox in his debut as an extremely younglooking victim of the school bullies and Al Waxman playing a detective but then didn't he always?. However most memorable is the scenestealing Roddy McDowall FRIGHT NIGHT who plays fellow teacher Corrigan who is forced to turn to drink to forget about the problems of the class. McDowall has some excellent scenes the finest of which is when he holds up his class with a gun and asks them lifeordeath questions. There's also an excellent tragic moment where he goes gunning for the bad guys in his car causing it to crash and explode in an impressive display of special effects.The best part of the film is the gripping conclusion set on the night of the prom. Here King's wife has been kidnapped by the thugs who are leading King through the dark corridors of the school beating him up. Then he decides to fight back leading to some cool scenes of him killing the gang in various ways which will have you cheering. This is audience manipulation at its finest and it doesn't disappoint on the violence front. Although not a film for all tastes I would recommend CLASS OF 1984 to exploitation fans looking for more than just violence and gore as this is also a wellmade wellacted film besides which uses the violence in context instead of just having it for violence's sake. Great disturbing stuff.".

	onyx:emotionText "Despite being made on a low budget with a relatively noname cast CLASS OF 1984 has become something of a classic when it comes to cult cinema. Not since DEATH WISH have we had such a realistic gritty lowdown slice of urban exploitation and here the violence is played out brutally and inevitably within the walls of a rundown school terrorised by a gang of malicious victimising punks. This powerful film is miles ahead of something like 187 in its depiction of classroom violence and although the subject matter is offensive the film is still gripping to watch. It's one of the rare instances where I was hooked to the screen and couldn't possibly stop watching until the credits rolled.Despite being made thirty years ago the film hasn't really dated and in fact seems perhaps even more important today certainly in the age of classroom shootings and ghetto violence it's not difficult to believe that somewhere in the world stuff like this is really going on. Director Mark Lester known for making violent movies  take COMMANDO for example charts the action well with his matteroffact direction which really puts the action in your face. However it's not just about the action although there is a lot of it the characterisation and storyline are just as important if not more so. Music by the veteran Lalo Shifrin keeps things moving along and an opening song by Alice Cooper seems appropriate. There's a nice sense of pacing which means those ninety minutes just seem to fly by.Lester's cast is mainly packed with unfamiliar faces which is a plus in a realistic film like this although a couple of famous actors do show up. In the lead role Perry King THE POSSESSION OF JOEL DELANEY is excellent as the victimised teacher who is finally pushed to the edge by the terrorising punks when his pregnant wife is raped. His ordinary even kind teacher makes for a sympathetic hero and we're behind him all the way. Merrie Lynn Ross is okay as his loving wife but her role is a very minor one seemingly there for plot purposes only.

	schema:reviewBody "Class of 1984 has quite a bit of resonance not just for being a potent and entertaining trashy revenge flick but for also being more than a little prophetic. Its premise may have seemed far out at the time but it would barely bat an eye nowadays. It's gripping stuff well played by all involved and certainly gets the blood boiling. The protagonists are reasonably sympathetic and the antagonists are a great deal of fun in their swaggering malevolence.Perry King Mandingo stars as Andy Norris the new music teacher at Lincoln High. Lincoln is overrun by gangs crime and graffiti and people have to pass through a metal detector on their way inside the building. Andy learns soon enough that his biggest problem is a group led by the creepy Peter Stegman a constantly amusing Timothy Van Patten. He refuses to put up with their garbage leading to a battle of wills that climaxes in an intense and graphic bit of retribution while a band concert is going on.This is far and away one of the best films if not the best of director Mark Lesters' career. You really get interested in and hooked by these characters and this situation. Stegman and gang certainly go out of their way to show how rotten they are rabbit lovers beware. Andy isn't perfect and does let his anger cloud his judgment which makes him more effective as a lead. Art direction is perfect and the stunt work is impressive. Lalo Schifrin supplies the music score the film includes a performance by the band Teenage Head and the soundtrack includes tunes by Fear and a theme song belted out by Alice Cooper.King is an engaging presence in the lead with Merrie Lynn Ross doing fine as his loving and concerned wife. Van Patten is very good as the bad guy revealing himself as a true talent with his concerto sequence. Appearances are also made by Keith Knight My Bloody Valentine Lisa Langlois Happy Birthday to Me Stefan Arngrim Fear No Evil a prestardom Michael J. Fox as a dorky little wise guy he's billed here without the middle initial Canadian legend Al Waxman 'King of Kensington' 'Cagney and Lacey' as an ineffectual detective and Erin Noble Incubus. Old pro Roddy McDowall offers the standout performance as a harried biology teacher who despairs over his inability to inspire his students and in the films' best scene forces them to answer biology questions at gunpoint.This is must viewing for any lover of B cinema and  or the concept of punks on film. Followed by two sequels.At one point Stegman watches the 1977 Lesterdirected drivein picture Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw on TV.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Class Of 1984 is an excellent Exploitian Action Thriller Drama that is one of the great cult classics ever made and is one of my favorite movies of all time. Although the things about school violence happening in the film was seen as over the top now it has become a frightening reality.Class Of 1984 tells the story about a new music teacher named Andy NorrisPerry King who has just transfered to Lincoln high to teach music. While thereNorris sees students go through metal detectors and being searched by security something Andy has never seen before. A fellow teacher named Terry CorriganRoddy McDowall tells Andy if he wants to survive has to look the other way. When Andy gets to his music class he now has to deal with Peter StegmanTim Van Patten and his gang of misfits who run the school. When Andy tries tell the police and school officials with no luck Andy must deal with Peter Stegman and his gang in a violent cat and mouse game leading up to a violent conclusion.Class Of 1984 is an amazing film from beginning to end because while there are things in the film that are over the top the film is just as relevant as it was back in 1982. Director Mark L. Lester made this film because he wanted this movie to be a warning about what would happen if teenagers and High School violence wasn't handled. Unfortunatelyno one listen to Lester's warning. Lester's film greatly depicts High Schools and teenage society falling apart where violence and drugs have become the norm. High School in this film is depicted as a dangerous and scary place where there is graffiti all over the walls and the place is a war zone filled with gangs and many levels of tension. Teenagers in Class of 1984 of are violent and uncontrollable and the adults who are authority figures can't do anything about it. The teenagers can and will get away with anything and everything whether it be using drugs violencesexual assault or even death. Lester I think saw what was coming in the near futurebut hundred times worse than depicted in this film. Peter Stegman knows this and uses it to his advantage against Mr. Norris. Mr. Norris tries to tell the principal and the policebut can't do anything about it. Stegman twists the truth around where everything is Mr. Norris' fault. In Class Of 1984Stegman rules the school and he is the future of society and no one was going to stop him. I think the film is asking us this questionHow does a person stop violence and chaos without resorting to violence and chaos himself? This question definitely applies to Andy Norris who probably asks himself that question throughout the film and that's one of the great things about Class Of 1984 and where it rises above the typical BMovie exploitation film. Andy Norris is a character we can relate to and identify with because as the violence and danger keeps going on Andy questions his own morality and safety while trying to protect his wife and other students and with violence in the air testing his courage and survival. The character Peter Stegman is a great villain because while he is a gang leader he's not your typical thug he's smartdangerous and can and will manipulate people whenever he can and those combinations make Peter dangerous to Mr. Norris and the other students. Some of the wild violence in the film maybe over the topbutsome of the violence in the film is happening today and is true. The School violence in this film is very dangerous and extreme and predates the school violence and shootings we see todayi.e Columbineand one of the great ironic things about this film is that the teen villains don't use any gunsbut use knifessticks and chainsbut this was a dark and eerie foreshadowing to a frightening future and is one of the reasons Class Of 1984 holds up well and is relevant. The ending of the film is great and powerful because of it's grim and dark brutality and viciousness. It's ending that matches the tone of the rest of the film and is a unforgettable conclusion.Perry King does a brilliant job as Andy Norrisa new music teacherwith King bringing depth and intensity to the role and having great scenes with Van Patten. Tim Van Patten does a excellent job as antagonist Peter Stegmanwho in my opinion is one of the best villains in movie history. Van Patten is scary frighteningdangerousand is just very believable. Roddy McDowall is great as biology teacher Terry Corrigan who is cynical and looks the other way. Mcdowall's scene when he is teaching his students is one of the best scenes in the film and McDowall is amazing. Michael J. Fox does a wonderful job as Arthur the class jokerwith Fox bringing depth and humor to the role. Merrie Lynn Ross does a good job as Andy's wife Diane who is always supportive of Andy. Stefan ArngrimDrugstoreKeith KnightBarnyardLisa LangloisPatsyand Neil CliffordFallongive fantastic performances as Stegman's gang. Al WaxmanDetective StewskiErin FlanneryDeenenand David GardnerPrincipal Morganthaugive good performances as well. Mark L. Lester does a great job with the direction in this filmnever slowing the camera down and moving it at all costs with zoomscloseups and giving the film a sense of dread. Lester also does well with the fight scenes and violence and keeps the film moving at a tightfast pace.The score by Lalo SchifrinMission Impossiable TV series is great and adds to the films greatness. The theme song I am the Future by Alice Cooper is amazing and unforgettable and you'll be singing during and after the movie.In final wordif you love ThrillersTeen Films and Exploitation Filmsyou'll love Class Of 1984 an excellent film and a great Cult Classic that will stand the test of time and will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

Sure I've seen the EXTERMINATOR movies and DEATH WISH 3 but that was about it until I decided to watch CLASS OF 1984. It wasn't a film I'd wanted to watch one night I just spontaneously decided to watch it for no reason. Boy oh boy was I surprised.Andrew Norris is a young music teacher who has just accepted his first teaching position at Lincoln High School. Norris is shocked to find that Terry a fellow teacher carries a gun in his brief case and there are metal detectors at the doors. He soon discovers this is with good reason given the amount of gangs and gang violence in the school mostly by Peter Stegman a punk whose drugpushing gang owns the school and who just so happens to be a brilliant pianist. Andrew stands up to him which leads to fullon war between the two until Stegman goes too far and pushes Norris over the edge.CLASS OF 1984 is exploitation cinema at its finest but the film is so accomplished that it almost feels too classy to be exploitation. The acting is nothing short of fantastic featuring breakout performances by Perry King as the caring Norris who slowly begins to lose his patience the always incredible Roddy McDowell as Terry the man who has lost all hope in his teaching abilities and dreams of actually making a good change in these kids lives and of course Timothy Van Patten as Stegman who plays the role with a mix of suaveness psychosis and even tragedy at his wasted life. Oh and Michael J. Fox also makes an early appearance as a good kid trapped in such a miserable world.The film does a good job of building the antagonists up as completely despicable so by the final showdown between Norris and the gang you are itching for them to die yet they are sympathetic in a way. The film's pacing is superb as well with each passing scene continually mounting the tension until the bloodsoaked climax.The film also captures quite aptly the total hopelessness some teachers face with their students and even if you're not a teacher you can still relate to it because we've all had that ahole in our class that would never give the teacher a break. Only here in classic exploitation fashion these guys go beyond that. They actually set fire to Norris's car early on and slaughter all the animals in Terry's biology class.But have no fear exploitation fanatics! This isn't exactly an art house film as it is filled with fullfrontal nudity and some graphic violence towards the end.CLASS OF 1984 was a real surprise for me. I was expecting a gritty grindhouse exploitation movie and in most ways that's what I got. However the film is more than that. It's very professionally made it's smart and it's emotional. It really is depressing in some scenes building up to the climax and I like that. The finale will quench any exploitation fan's quench for violence. Great acting great characters great story great pacing great violence just great EVERYTHING all around.Don't pass this one up seek it out immediately.".

As a flashy montage brings us to 1938 Stan is still at his post unaware that the war is over. In a great shot he tosses a can of beans onto a mountain of cans that has been accumulating for 20 years.Meanwhile marital bliss has finally come to Oliver Hardy. Dressed in an apron he cooks breakfast for Mrs. Hardy Minna Gombell. He's a total wimp completely dominated by his wife she even gives him an allowance!. Yet when Mrs. Hardy tries to get him to realize that today is their anniversary he isn't even close. Was that the day I fell off the bicycle and skinned my knee? When he finds out what day it is he talks about whispering sweet nothings in his wife's ear. As he tells her that he's going to be gone for an hour Mrs. Hardy says And make that hour short!When Ollie leaves presumably to buy his wife a present he hears about a soldier who stayed in the trenches for 20 years and didn't know the war was over. I can't imagine anybody being that dumb. As he looks at Stan's picture in the paper he quickly changes his mind. OH YES I CAN!Ollie goes to the soldier's home to see Stan. Stan decides that sitting in a wheelchair with a pillow on it is more comfortable than a park bench. The chair however was designed for an amputee and in order to sit in it Stan tucks one of his legs under him. Ollie of course thinks that Stan has only one leg. There is one goof in this part of the film. As Ollie goes to get some water for Stan Stan turns on the water soaking him. Yet as Ollie walks over to him his suit is totally dry! Soon a soldier comes by demanding the chair so Ollie has to carry Stan. It's only when they both fall out of Ollie's car that he realizes that Stan does have both legs.Of course this only a prelude to a series of disasters including Stan dumping sand on Ollie's car then destroying the car as he tries the automatic garage door opener and helping Ollie to blow up Mrs. Hardy's kitchen. In the features Stan is often given magical powers. He can make a fist fill it with tobacco light it and smoke real smoke comes out of his mouth. Walking up the stairs he pulls down the shadow of a blind. Later after running up and down thirteen flights he takes a glass of water out of his pocket. Ollie is full of disdain. Why don't you put some ice in it? Naturally Stan removes two cubes from his other pocket.Billy Gilbert returns with the same thick German accent and short fuse he displayed in The Music Box. Only this time he's a big game hunter. After the explosion in the kitchen Mrs. Gilbert Patricia Ellis locked out of her apartment goes across the hall and is shocked by what she sees. The only thing standing in the kitchen is a large bowl of punch which Ollie brings in to serve. Of course he trips and the entire contents of the bowl land on Mrs. Gilbert. The only thing she can find to wear is a pair of Ollie's pajamas. Things get quite hilarious as Stan and Ollie have to hide Mrs. Gilbert first from Mrs. Hardy and later from the extremely jealous Mr. Gilbert. One of Lauel and Hardy's most entertaining and fun features.".

	schema:reviewBody "BlockHeads begins in WWI where Stan and Ollie are in a platoon fighting in Europe. While Ollie and the rest of the group go into battle Stan has to guard the post. You can tell that he's doing his job because he continues doing it for twenty years after the war ends.

	schema:reviewBody "The first half of BLOCKHEADS contains the most amusing skits in the feature that runs just a little short of one hour and seems like a series of farcical sketches that become a little too hectic toward the last twenty minutes. But fans of LAUREL  HARDY probably won't really mind since it's good slapstick fun.The most amusing idea has STAN LAUREL still keeping watch in the trenches during World War I and shooting at a German plane until the pilot who lands safely nearby explains to him that the war has been over since 1918. When Stan is reunited with his friend OLIVER HARDY at a veteran's home he's sitting in an unoccupied wheelchair and Oliver thinks he's a vet with a missing leg. It's one of the funniest sections of the film that has Oliver carrying him getting dumped on by a dumpster and taking all sorts of pratfalls as the routine winds on.Later at Hardy's home the slapstick gets even wilder but not necessarily funnier. Too many staged arguments with his wife MINNA GOMBELL lead to the sort of shouting matches that can become tiresome after awhile. But through it all STAN LAUREL has some good comic moments as friend Oliver gets in trouble with the lady next door and her jealous husband BILLY GILBERT.The gags are fast and furious in typical slapstick tradition and it's a fastmoving comedy that should satisfy fans of the duo. Gilbert is a joy to watch as the jealous hubby easily stealing scenes with his caricature of the man across the hall from Hardy.Summing up Delightful mixture of gags and slapstick situations in the Hal Roach tradition.".

As the film is usually shown today the joke may be briefly glimpsed in some prints before the film ends. More about that later.BLOCKHEADS has some claim to being the best of the final Laurel  Hardy  Hal Roach feature films A CHUMP AT OXFORD is it's closest competitor. In it Stan and Ollie begin in 1918 as the men are about to go over the top from a trench in the last battle of the war. But Stan is ordered by the Captain to guard the trench so Ollie goes out alone. We watch a brief spartan montage showing 20 years passed and Stan is still in the trench. He has survived on cooked canned beans  and there is a mountain of cans on the side of the trench. As he is about to eat he hears a plane's motor approaching and starts machine gunning the plane. The plane lands and the aviator comes over angrily demanding what Stan is doing. When Stan explains he is fighting the war the aviator laughs and tells him the war's been over for 20 years. Despite some questions about the truth of this It better be true or someone will get in trouble! says Stan he leaves the trench.Ollie has become a henpecked husband to Minna Gombell and they are planning to have their first wedding anniversary when Ollie learns that Stan is still alive. He goes out to the old soldier's home where Stan currently is and sees his friend sitting in a wheel chair apparently with one leg. In one of the most touching moments of their joint film careers Ollie's facial expression is deeply saddened by his friend's loss. He sits down and chats with Stan who is glad to see him and he starts wheeling him to his car  he'll take Stan home for dinner. Stan tells him I'm better now! and Ollie smilingly accepts this. But then another man comes and takes the wheelchair back over Ollie's temporary objections. A minute later while carrying Stan he momentarily has to put Stan down. Stan manages to stand up  he has both legs after all  and Ollie suddenly realizes this when Stan is back in his arms. Ollie drops Stan. A moment later in Ollie's car he says with great frustration You're Better Now!!BLOCKHEADS has been called the ultimate expanding disaster film of Laurel  Hardy  a type of expanded version of their sound short HELPMATES from a few years earlier where Stan is supposed to get Ollie's house ready after a wild party before Mrs. Hardy comes home. Instead he ruins Ollie's wardrobe Ollie ends up dressed up in a costume like a 19th Century Admiral and Stan cleans up the house  but burns it down accidentally. In BLOCKHEADS Ollie lives in an apartment house and Stan manages to wreck Ollie's car actually it's Minna Gombell's car and blows up Ollie's kitchen. He also smashes the marriage or appears to  Gombell is last seen headed for the old soldier's home to have them take Stan back. Stan is also responsible in part for a near confrontation between Ollie and his neighbor James Finleyson which almost ends up in a fist fight  but Jimmy still manages to clock Ollie in the end. But finally there is the problem of the Gilberts. Patricia Ellis and Billy Gilbert are the Gilberts the next door neighbors of the Hardys. Billy Gilbert who had frequently popped up in Laurel  Hardy shorts like THE CHIMP TOWED IN THE HOLE and COUNTY HOSPITAL is a big game hunter who has just returned home. Gilbert is very jealous of his pretty wife and she manages to get into the Hardy apartment innocently enough to help them clean up but her clothes get ruined. They lend her some of Hardy's overly large pajamas but Mrs. Hardy is in the apartment and they have to sneak her out in a trunk. But Mr. Gilbert returns and he starts sneering at Stan as a home wrecker. But shortly after he realizes there is a woman in the trunk and he starts calling Ollie an old dog for putting one over his old lady  and then starts mentioning his own extramarital activities. Mrs. Gilbert hearing this rises out of the suitcase and confronts her husband.But Billy is soon chasing Ollie and Stan with a shotgun. And he is firing it every now and then. Soon they are in the courtyard of the apartment house complex and he fires and dozens of men jump out of the windows of the apartments! Today that is the point the film ends. Most people do not mind but there is a better end that exists. The last shot was to show Billy Gilbert sitting and reading in his parlor. We see stuffed animals all over the place  and finally Stan and Ollie's on the wall. Ollie's head turns towards Stan's and says Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into. and Stan starts to cry. Interesting actual ending of a first rate comedy.".

If you're a fan of these two comedians you should enjoy this film. Anyway when anyone provides a lot of gags in just under one hour you'll hit and miss a lot....but some things will always be funny. Some are still clever too such as the bit with the window shade being a shadow.You can always count on Ollie being henpecked and Stan being an airhead he's a WWI soldier who marched in a trench for 20 years not realizing the war is long over. Of course if you think about it that premise has more holes in it than the proverbial swiss cheese but who cares? A good portion of this film involves the simple fact of Ollie and Stan just trying to walk 13 flights up the stairs to Ollie's apartment and the adventures that happen to them along the way.After watching just 57 minutes of these guys pratfalls and slapstick routines you'll be exhausted!".

Still there's nothing like home cooking.I think Blockheads offers us the proposition that Ollie can be a well adjusted if somewhat fatuous individual by himself. It's only apparently when he interacts with Stan that things just seem to happen.And in fact that's what Blockheads is a series of gags from the time that Ollie meets Stan at the home and just assumes he's an amputee because he's decided to sit a wheelchair rigged up for one. Right up to the point where big game hunter Billy Gilbert the Hardy's next door neighbor chases the both of them out of the house because he catches Mrs. Gilbert in Ollie's pajamas. How she got in them? You have to see Blockheads to find out.Best gag I thought was Stan dealing with an obnoxious neighbor who has just bullied Ollie into fetching the neighbor kid's football.

	schema:reviewBody "Although this movie occasionally looks like a retread of their earlier pictures especially the final scenewhich was done exactly the same way earlier by Laurel and Hardy it is the best they did late in their careers. For the most part apart from Chump at Oxford all movies completed after this were either subpar or even unwatchably badas the team got perhaps too old to continue they made the fateful decision to leave Hal Roach and go to 20th Century Fox a studio that simply knew NOTHING about comedy in the 1940s.So what did I like about this movie? Well the opening segment is greatone of the funnier bits they ever did. Stan and Ollie are soldiers in WWI and everyone is getting ready to go over the top i.e. leave their trenches and charge the German lines. Stan is told by the commanding officer to stay behind and guard the lines until he is relieved. So of course twenty years later he is STILL waiting to be relieved. His uniform is in tatters and he has a stack of empty food cans as high as a mountain. That's cute! Stanley is found and brought back to the states. Naturally his story makes the newspaper and Ollie discovers that his presumed dead friend is alive and well. So he goes to the Veteran's Home to get him and bring him home to stay with him and his wife. Where it goes from there I'll leave you to find out yourself. However it's a cute and wellcrafted film that shouldn't be missed by Laurel and Hardy fans or anyone needing a good laugh.FYIthe ending as I mentioned above was not very original. The actual ORIGINAL ending for this movie was much darker and funnier but the powers that be at MGM who bankrolled and distributed Hal Roach's films nixed the ending and it was reshot in the boring way. The jealous neighbor who was an avid hunter STILL chased them as he did in the new ending but instead of firing a shot in the air and all the people diving out of the apartments it dissolves to a scene where the hunter is later relaxing at home and Stan and Ollie's heads are mounted on the wall like trophies among all the other hunting paraphernalia! Then Ollie gives his old familiar line well here's another fine mess you've gotten me into towards Stan. Now THAT'S FUNNY! Too bad it only exists is a few studio stills and is not on the DVD or video copies.".

This was Hal Roach's last film under his MGM contract before switching to United Artists afterward. He sold his Our Gang shorts series to his former distributor beforehand so this turned out to be one of those playersTommy Bond'slast appearance for his former boss as he'd join the rest of the gang at his new Culver City neighbor.

Before the story proceeds it gives out warning that The events and characters depicted in this photoplay are fictitious. Any similarity to actors portrayed living or dead is purely coincidental and not our fault. Signed Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.The story starts off in France during the Great War World War I in 1917. Private Stan Laurel is ordered by his commanding officer William Royle to remain in the trenches guarding the post until relieved from duty while others in his regiment including his best pal Oliver go off to war. After the Armistice of 1918 soldiers return home and resume with their lives. Move forward to 1938. Stanley still stands guard at the post with a mountain of bean cans close by. After shooting at a passing airplane a French pilot Jean Del Val lands to tell this soldier that the war has been over for twenty years. Now home from the front Stanley makes the headline news America honors forgotten doughboy. As Oliver now living at the exclusive Elite Arms Apartments is about to go and prepare his one year anniversary celebration with his wife Minna Gombell he notices the headline on the front page of a newspaper America honors forgotten doughboy.

Remembering his old pal Oliver comes to the National Soldiers Home where Stanley is staying. Ollie then invites Stanley to return home with him for a steak dinner and meet the wife. Easier said than done.Considering the Laurel and Hardy comedies dating back to the late twenties their movies are never consistent. In almost all of them they use their own names indicating a continuing film series which it's not. It's just a series of movies with new stories using same actors bearing their same names. Laurel and Hardy can be henpecked husbands in one film or single men the next. One of them can be married the other a single pal such as the case in BLOCKHEADS. Regardless their basic characters are always the same with derby hats being their official trademarks. Then there's Ollie at one point telling Stanley Now here's another fine mess you've gotten me into. With BLOCKHEADS consisting of many fine messes Stan's memorable quote here happens to be You know how dumb I used to be? Well I'm better now. Not quite. Invitation to dinner sequence happens to be one mishap after another thanks to Stanley and scripting material written by none other than former silent comedian Harry Langdon with the assistance by James Parrott Charles Rogers Felix Adler and Arnold Belgard.Others members in the cast of Hal Roach stock players include Oliver's next door neighbor Billy Gilbert as Mr. Gilbert an avid hunter with a rifle returning home after two months in Borneo to his attractive wife Mrs. Gilbert Patricia Ellis and suspicious nature Tommy Bond Butch from the Our Gang comedies as a brat playing football in the apartment building Harry Woods as the boy's tough father Patsy Moran Lulu Oliver's exgirlfriend and James Finlayson a regular in many Laurel and Hardy comedies seen briefly as an angry tenant whose misunderstanding with Oliver has Stanley alerting the tenants There's going to be a fight!

Ollie decides to bring him home to his place to meet the wife and have a nice home cooked meal with a nice juicy steak topped off with a delicious seven layer chocolate cake with typical mishaps along the way! BLOCKHEADS is a fastmoving joy that clocks in at under an hour's running time. The laughs are pretty steadily spread throughout and there are a lot of them. My favorite scenes occur mostly during the first three quarters of the film especially at the Soldier's Home where Ollie reunites with Stan who just happens to be reading a newspaper while sitting in a wheelchair with one leg tucked under  Ollie thinks Stan lost his leg in the war and proceeds to carry him in his arms around the grounds! Hilarious!! The end of the film loses just a touch of steam which is the only reason I hesitantly pause in giving this a full four stars. But all fans of Laurel and Hardy must seek this Comedy out and new firsttimers would do well to use this movie and SONS OF THE DESERT as their introduction to Stan and Ollie. 12 out of ".

The story finds Stan discovered while still manning his sentry post from the first World War but twenty years later! Subsequently Ollie looks him up at the Old Soldiers Home and from there it's one disaster after another. I've always differentiated Laurel and Hardy from other comedy teams like Abbott and Costello in the sense that they do things funny rather than simply doing funny things. Although there are a fair share of funny things happening in this flick as well with able assists from the likes of Billy Gilbert James Finlayson and even former Our Gang bully Tommy Bond. Stan's smoking pipe bit always manages to crack me up and the topper this time has him brushing the ashes out of his hand when he's done smoking. Minna Gombel is on hand as Ollie's less than understanding wife but on the other hand what's to understand? Rounding out the main cast is Patricia Ellis as Mrs. Gilbert who's quite pretty while doling out her own share of laughs with the covered chair gimmick. A very funny treat for fans of the comedy duo that would please just about anyone.".

The antics they get up to in this section are truly sidesplitting invariably involving the great James Finlayson a brattish kid and some weird shadows. It's the stuff of comedy gold and seeing it today I'm once again surprised at how it hasn't dated in the slightest.Inevitably Laurel is the true star here playing off his weird activities against Hardy's increasingly exasperated straightman. The stuff with the handpipe and the glass of water are smaller gags but in many ways I like them better than the bigger stuff.

Given that the film was turned in the same year that saw Woodstock and the fact that the content is a pacifist parable turning to hippie style is perhaps not to be wondered at.

Even though they had a good basic plot to work on it is rendered in a rather sketchy way. There are long stretches of cheap slapstick comedy that could have been left out without any loss. The characters remain unconvincing inexpressive and schematic and do not evolve during the plot  least of all the children even though it's the children all this is supposedly about. This is particularly surprising and disappointing since the movie is based on a work of Erich Kaestner a writer most famous for his vivid and affectionate depictions of children's characters.Young children will no doubt enjoy the colors the pictures and the slapstick. Still this is not just a movie for children. Children of about six years or a bit more will miss many of the political subtones and in fact when i was watching the film quite a few times children in the auditorium loudly complained to their parents What is this what is happening now? My impression is that the filmmakers rather played on their own imagination their own tastes and their own connotations in the world of grownups  up to and including just to name one example an allusion to Nikita Khrushchev hammering the U.N. conference table with his shoe an event that happened ten years earlier and would hardly be known to young children even near the end of the Sixties.I don't know whether Kaestner liked the way the filmmakers played with his book obviously rather for their own amusement than for pleasing others or even pleasing children.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Konferenz der Tiere is a West German animated movie from 1969 so this one will have its 50th anniversary soon. these 90 minutes are possibly the most known work by director Curt Linda and he is also one of the writers who adapted Erich Kstner's book for the screen here. Kstner himself unlike with some of his older children's films was not involved. The animals group together in here to fight the humans after matters become unacceptable for them. The result is a big parallel to the Rattenfnger von Hameln. All in all I felt the film had a couple okay moments but still in terms of storytelling it came pretty short. I myself was okay with the animation without liking it too much really. It's accurate for a 1960s movie but all the animated films from that era came a bit short being the aftermath of the brilliant Golden Age of Animation. Still there is much worse stuff from the 1960s in terms of non live action films. Overall I still have to say that I did not enjoy the watch as much as I hoped I would. There is a modern animated film from the year 2010 that adapts the same material and I thought that one was superior. I do not recommend the 1960s version.".

	schema:reviewBody "From staunch militant to sensitive mother Vavilova's search for selfidentity is one that creates meaningful stories both internally and externally. She is a very curious character. With masculinity and devout patriotism as two of her defining qualities she does not subscribe to the typical female persona at least in the beginning.Each quality creates a thought provoking dynamic for how she faces internal and external wars. Her internal war is pregnancy. As the child grows within her poses a threat to her masculinity a subsequent external war is createdthat is the child additionally poses a threat to her patriotic rank as Commissar. Although both wars throw her life into a state of imbalance they also help develop her in becoming a more volitional and rounded character. In particular her internal war creates maternity and sensitivitytwo qualities that lacked in her previous commanding status.She acquires both qualities after giving birth this is depicted when singing a lullaby to her sleeping babe as well as when emotionally breastfeeding him two actions which run contrary to her initially bleak and cold persona. Her external war i.e. love of country so too created by the pregnancy introduces the most difficult challenge she has to face in the film the choice of whether to marry herself to her country by divorcing from her child or keeping her child and ridding her patriotism.What draws her to eventually side with her country is a series of haunting flashbacks and clairvoyant visions. In one specific moment while suffering through the birthing process her mind flashes to a dreary landscape filled with military soldiers who like herself struggle to push a heavy piece of artillery up the side of a steep and sandy hill. This image evokes at least one particular meaningone which acts like a stepping stone to help Vavilova make her final decision when giving up her child The collective group pushing the machine uphill is a type of not only the communist ideals that Vavilova stands for but is also a metaphor for the strenuous birthing process itself. In other words the birth of a child and the birth of a nation are equally painstaking tasksboth which require exertion i.e. masculinity and loyalty i.e. patriotism.The flashback ends with her waking up in panic repeating to herself several times Stop torturing me. These words speak on multiple levels. In one sense she is tired of being mentally tortured from the government that oppresses her with stringency. In another sense she is tired of being physically tortured during the birthing process. Rich is the emotion and meaning of this flashback and consequently it later leads to an extremely significant clairvoyant vision.During this vision she witnesses the forthcoming holocaust of WWII. She sees herself with child swaddled in arms shuffling amongst a sheepish group of Jews as they wander to their death chambers. Reluctant to follow what she sees it's as if she's asking herself while in vision Is this my fate? Her subtexual obstinacy kicks in No it can't be. She is the author of her choices and will not be subject to any deterministic beliefs. She feels she can change this outcome but she must act now. However the choice to act is a difficult one given her present circumstance. What choice does she make raise her child or fight for her country? She cannot do both for by focusing on one the other is inevitably sacrificed. Where then is optimism to be found in her utterly bleak and tortured world? The aesthetics of the film help contribute to this bleakness by the director's choice of shooting the story in black and white. Only in a world like Vavilova's are colors of the rainbow absent. The black and white look is a reflection of the coldness she feels inside empty of any optimism. Interestingly enough however the Jews surrounding her in vision seem to be optimisticthey raise their arms in an almost dancelike ritual knowing full well that death will soon embrace them all. She steps back nervously. Her body language has spoken. She remembers back on the corrupt youth that exist in her presentthe ones who so ignorantly mimic their corrupted eldersand feels an obligation to save the youth and particularly her own child from such corruption. Although most of this is more or less implied I strongly believe that this extraction is highly plausible given her final decision.She does not abandon her child though some may argue so. She leaves her child in the hands of a very nurturing family ones who she could trust since they too had nurtured her during her period of birth and even rebirth. Holding the confidence that her child will be safely watched after she returns to her former state of balance by joining the war effort. She has rediscovered her meaning place and identity in life she is a warrior. Her life cannot be lived in fairy tales like Yefim suggested when turning the war into a theatrical play for his children. Her life must be lived in truth and in truth only. That is the film's predominant theme Despite how ugly the truth of reality iseven during times of war and tortureit must be embraced and dealt with not thrown to some fantasy that creates false optimism. By living in a fairytale she potentially falls prey to becoming a victim of the holocaust by living in truth she attempts to reverse the effects of such an outcome by fighting the monster of war.".

	schema:headline " Fascinating film banned for over 20 years";
	schema:reviewBody "The Russian film Komissar was shown in the U.S. with the translated title The Commissar 1967. It was cowritten and directed by Aleksandr Askoldov. This film wasn't released until 1988 21 years after it was produced. Not only were we deprived of the film but Aleksandr Askoldov the director was never permitted to direct a movie again. The explanation for this delay and this punishment was that the film depicted the Red Army in a negative way. That sounds realistic enough until you see the movie. To me the Red Army was depicted in a heroic fashion. There must have been subtle offenses not clear to a nonRussian.The movie is set in Ukraine where the Red and White armies clashed in the Russian Civil War. Nonna Mordyukova portrays Klavdia Vavilova a Red Army commissar who is fighting against the Whites in the postrevolutionary war. She becomes pregnant and is billeted with a Jewish family during her pregnancy. AntiSemitism lies just below the surface of the entire film. Both the Reds and the Whites were guilty of it although I believe it was worse from the Whites at that time. We don't see actual pogroms during the movie. A synagogue is boarded up when the Whites take over the town as are many houses. It wasn't clear to me whether these were all houses with Jewish families.However there's a horrific scene with three of the Jewish children terrify their own sister. They tell her to come up out of the cellars and then they shoot her with their toy weapons. Obviously they are playing out a scene that they've witnessed.The acting is outstanding throughout the film. Rolan Bykov plays the husband Yefim. It's interesting that Bykov himself was Jewish. Raisa Nedashkovskaya plays Maria Yefim's wife. Both Rykov and Nedashkovskaya are excellent actors. Yefim is a strange characterin some ways brave and in some ways childish. He'd rather dance than work and he'll break into song when one would least expect it. Maria his wife is a more traditional role. The only problem with the casting is that Nedashkovskaya is incredibly beautiful. That would work if she were a young newly married wife. However the couple live in poverty with many children to care for. Beauty doesn't last long in situations like that. Realistically Maria would be worn down and broken by that point in her life. In the movie she's still youthful and radiant.The protagonist of the film Klavdia Vavilova is a loyal Communist and she is as brave and strong as any man in the movie. In fact when she's having the baby and she's told to push she has a flashback to a moment when she and other soldiers are trying to push a heavy artillery caisson over a hill. As a mother with a newborn child she is torn between her baby and her duty to the Red Army. Nonna Mordyukova who portrays Klavdia Vavilova was a great Soviet actor. She is excellent in this role. She looks like a strong tough Ukrainian woman who would not be out of place in the Red cavalry. Director Askoldov could probably have chosen a young beauty for the role of Klavdia. Instead he went with an actor with broad shoulders and strong features. Mordyukova inhabits the role and the movie's greatness is due in large part to her work.We were very fortunate to see this film at Rochester's Dryden Theatre in the George Eastman Museum. The Dryden owns an excellent 35mm print and seeing it projected on the large screen was a wonderful experience. However it will work almost as well on a small screen. The Commissar is available on DVD. Don't miss it!".

This film wasn't released until 1988 21 years after it was produced. Not only were we deprived of the film but Aleksandr Askoldov the director was never permitted to direct a movie again. The explanation for this delay and this punishment was that the film depicted the Red Army in a negative way. That sounds realistic enough until you see the movie. To me the Red Army was depicted in a heroic fashion. There must have been subtle offenses not clear to a nonRussian.The movie is set in Ukraine where the Red and White armies clashed in the Russian Civil War. Nonna Mordyukova portrays Klavdia Vavilova a Red Army commissar who is fighting against the Whites in the postrevolutionary war. She becomes pregnant and is billeted with a Jewish family during her pregnancy. AntiSemitism lies just below the surface of the entire film. Both the Reds and the Whites were guilty of it although I believe it was worse from the Whites at that time. We don't see actual pogroms during the movie. A synagogue is boarded up when the Whites take over the town as are many houses. It wasn't clear to me whether these were all houses with Jewish families.However there's a horrific scene with three of the Jewish children terrify their own sister. They tell her to come up out of the cellars and then they shoot her with their toy weapons. Obviously they are playing out a scene that they've witnessed.The acting is outstanding throughout the film. Rolan Bykov plays the husband Yefim. It's interesting that Bykov himself was Jewish. Raisa Nedashkovskaya plays Maria Yefim's wife. Both Rykov and Nedashkovskaya are excellent actors. Yefim is a strange characterin some ways brave and in some ways childish. He'd rather dance than work and he'll break into song when one would least expect it. Maria his wife is a more traditional role. The only problem with the casting is that Nedashkovskaya is incredibly beautiful. That would work if she were a young newly married wife. However the couple live in poverty with many children to care for. Beauty doesn't last long in situations like that. Realistically Maria would be worn down and broken by that point in her life. In the movie she's still youthful and radiant.The protagonist of the film Klavdia Vavilova is a loyal Communist and she is as brave and strong as any man in the movie. In fact when she's having the baby and she's told to push she has a flashback to a moment when she and other soldiers are trying to push a heavy artillery caisson over a hill. As a mother with a newborn child she is torn between her baby and her duty to the Red Army. Nonna Mordyukova who portrays Klavdia Vavilova was a great Soviet actor. She is excellent in this role. She looks like a strong tough Ukrainian woman who would not be out of place in the Red cavalry. Director Askoldov could probably have chosen a young beauty for the role of Klavdia. Instead he went with an actor with broad shoulders and strong features. Mordyukova inhabits the role and the movie's greatness is due in large part to her work.We were very fortunate to see this film at Rochester's Dryden Theatre in the George Eastman Museum. The Dryden owns an excellent 35mm print and seeing it projected on the large screen was a wonderful experience. However it will work almost as well on a small screen. The Commissar is available on DVD. Don't miss it!";

Instead it offers a direct and sensitive story of a dedicated but pregnant Red Army Commissar who sometime during the 1930s finds shelter with a Jewish family and is transformed by their affection. In the end she has to choose between motherhood and the Motherland but her decision to follow military duty does nothing to diminish her new found sympathy for her surrogate family and before rejoining her company slogging through an unglamorous landscape of Ukrainian ice and mud she entrusts her baby to the care of people and by extension a tradition she has learned to love. Stylistically the film is a mix of poetic realism with occasionally selfconscious but effective montage flashbacks plus one haunting flashforward anticipating the Holocaust.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised to hear that Komissar was filmed in 1967 a year when the USSR was already firmly past Kruschev's thaw and entering the repressive Brezhnev era because there is something very thawish about this film. The general criticism of war the dignity of ordinary people during a time of calamities and the juxtaposition of battles with moments of civilian life all hearken back to the ideas expressed in The Cranes are Flying 1956. As in all Soviet cinema many of the central ideas are expressed through symbolism. This makes the film somewhat difficult for viewers who are not used to this style but most people tend to find it refreshing and psychologically stimulating. It certainly prompts more postfilm discussions than current American cinema that simply shoves the director's point of view down the audience's throat.Some of the themes that I found particularly interesting were the use of the innocence of children to depict the horror of war the image of saddled horses without riders galloping into battle and of course the father dancing in the midst of a bomb raid. Most of all I thought that the change in Vavilova  going from a rough battle hardened Red Army officer to a nurturing mother is the most poignant aspect of this film. The scene where Vavilova is hunted my soldiers for having a child mimics her own persecution of a man who leaves the army to be with his beloved. The soldiers turn out to be figments of her imagination but the point is obvious. However Vavilova's decision in the end of the film which I will not reveal for fear of getting blacklisted by the IMDb NKVD is puzzling in light of the changes in her character. I suppose that Askoldov's opinion that a person's nature cannot be changed by one experience is contrary to my own optimism. Still I find the end to be somewhat unrealistic.".

It could also symbolize the idea of a life cycle where Vavilova just had a child and is then seen at the cemetery where she is surrounded by death. Another instance where crosses appear in the film was when Vavilova Yefim the father of the Jewish family she is forced to stay with and his family were boarding up the windows and doors to prepare for the White Army soldiers that were coming.

This would not have sat well with Soviet censors seeing a strong female Commissar traveling in search of someone to baptize her child.

	schema:headline " Christianity in Komissar";
	schema:reviewBody "The Komissar is successful because it is thought provoking and evokes emotion from the viewer. Interestingly although this film deals with a Jewish family and various issues of Judaism the careful observer notices that the film is also full of symbols of Christianity. In fact there are so many of these examples that it leads the viewer to wonder whether the filmmaker may have intended to make a commentary on the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. Although modern Christianity and Judaism are quite different from each other they have very similar backgrounds. Indeed prior to the birth of Jesus they were both one religion and became separate because Jews refused to accept Jesus as the Messiah while Christians believed that his life was the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.Some of the Christian symbols in the film are less conspicuous than others and blend into the film seamlessly. For example there are several scenes in the film that show crosses in the background. At one point the camera focuses on a cemetery that is filled with crosses. There are also crosses on top of churches in many scenes. The connection between Judaism and Christianity is apparent in the fact that in one scene the focus shifts back and forth between a Jewish synagogue and a Christian church which are both being boarded up.The beginning of the film is marked by the perspective of the two female characters Klavdia and Maria regarding pregnancy and childbirth. It is significant that Klavdia was an important military figure but was forced to give up her command because she was pregnant this would obviously never happen to a man. Although Maria has six children she talks openly with Klavdia about the pain of childbirth stating that it is not good for the mother the child or God. The scene where Klavdia gives birth further emphasizes the pain of childbirth. In both Jewish and Christian history the pain of childbirth is a consequence that God gave to women in response to Eve's decision to tempt Adam with the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.There is one scene in the film that is particularly touching because it reveals the depth of the relationship between Yefim and Maria who do not show such blatant affection at any other point in the film. This is the scene where Yefim washes Maria's feet. As he does so he looks up lovingly into her eyes and says I love you. This scene is both tender and also a little shocking because throughout the rest of the film Yefim is portrayed as brusque and a little rough around the edges. This is the one time in the film when the viewer is allowed to see through his exterior. It is interesting that the filmmaker chose to use the washing of feet as the interaction between the two characters during this personal moment. The washing of feet is a symbol that relates directly back to Christianity and the Bible bringing to mind Christ washing his disciples' feet before he was crucified.The film ends with Klavdia's decision to leave her baby with Yefim and Maria. This seems ironic because their relationship did not start out well  Yefim was outraged that Klavdia was taking a room in their house and did everything that he could to resist. Despite the circumstances however a friendship developed between the characters and they learned to trust and even to like each other. Klavdia chose to leave in order to protect her child and also the family that she had come to love. She sacrificed herself in order to protect the other characters. Again this situation seems to parallel Christianity Christ sacrificed himself to protect his followers.While the main characters of this film are Jewish it seems noteworthy that there are so many similarities between different aspects of the film and Christianity. If it were only the crosses that served as symbols of Christianity that might be dismissed as part of the setting of the film and irrelevant to the story. There are however so many different parallels and religious undertones particularly Christian that it appears that they should be significant.".

In both Jewish and Christian history the pain of childbirth is a consequence that God gave to women in response to Eve's decision to tempt Adam with the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.There is one scene in the film that is particularly touching because it reveals the depth of the relationship between Yefim and Maria who do not show such blatant affection at any other point in the film. This is the scene where Yefim washes Maria's feet. As he does so he looks up lovingly into her eyes and says I love you. This scene is both tender and also a little shocking because throughout the rest of the film Yefim is portrayed as brusque and a little rough around the edges. This is the one time in the film when the viewer is allowed to see through his exterior. It is interesting that the filmmaker chose to use the washing of feet as the interaction between the two characters during this personal moment. The washing of feet is a symbol that relates directly back to Christianity and the Bible bringing to mind Christ washing his disciples' feet before he was crucified.The film ends with Klavdia's decision to leave her baby with Yefim and Maria. This seems ironic because their relationship did not start out well  Yefim was outraged that Klavdia was taking a room in their house and did everything that he could to resist. Despite the circumstances however a friendship developed between the characters and they learned to trust and even to like each other. Klavdia chose to leave in order to protect her child and also the family that she had come to love. She sacrificed herself in order to protect the other characters. Again this situation seems to parallel Christianity Christ sacrificed himself to protect his followers.While the main characters of this film are Jewish it seems noteworthy that there are so many similarities between different aspects of the film and Christianity. If it were only the crosses that served as symbols of Christianity that might be dismissed as part of the setting of the film and irrelevant to the story. There are however so many different parallels and religious undertones particularly Christian that it appears that they should be significant.";

	schema:reviewBody "The filmography of director Aleksandr Askoldov lists a single film Commissar. After a single viewing of the film it is easy to assess why no further works exist from Askoldov. Commissar is an ambitious gutsy and subversive film. Askoldov had to have been cognizant of the imminent danger it posed against his young career. This likely awareness of the inevitability of personal ruin seemingly emboldened Askoldov to move far beyond apoliticism which was relatively acceptable to the unthinkable open hostility. When trivially compared to Chapaev the pinnacle of socialist realism thirty years prior it is apparent just how indifferent and even spiteful Commissar is towards certain parts of Soviet society. Both films share the backdrop of the Russian Civil War that is where the similarities end. Commissar not only avoids socialist realism in a time period supposedly ripe for the projection of Soviet heroism it turns the idea on its head. While Chapaev embraces the breadth of the Soviet cause against the Whites Commissar narrowly focuses on Klavdia Vavilova and the Jewish family that hosts her during her pregnancy. The fronts of each film are portrayed very differently. Chapaev embraces revolutionary romanticism. Impassioned speeches are given and camaraderie is instilled in the troops from the legendary figure himself. The only scene where Klavdia is shown with her unit she essentially condemns a man to death. She is moody heavy set and emotionally withdrawn from her comrades. The defining difference the one that provokes the comparison to begin with is Commissar's complete inversion of socialist realism's journey of the hero. Instead of the spontaneous goodhearted hero being politically educated by a Communist figure here the Communist figure undergoes a form of social education by simple goodhearted peasants. Though Vavilova verbally recites the dogma of Communism throughout the film we see how the tenderness Yefim and Maria introduce create intense internal conflict for Vavilova. The film suggests that war and the ideologies guiding them strip individuals of their inherit humanity. The family setting is an attempt at rehabilitation. Vavilova starts off talking about abortion and how she perceives her child as a parasite growing within her. Much later after living among a loving family she delivers her baby. In one of the most touching sequences of the film Vavilova paces around her room as Maria puts like a caged animal carrying her baby and singing a lullaby. The duality of her character here the callous dutiful commissar and the loving mother is perfectly illustrated by Nonna Mordyukova's nuanced complex performance. If the enlightenment of Communism is social construction the film attempts to deconstruct to reduce life to a simpler more sincere form.".

Unable to continue the fight she is thrust upon a poor Ukranian Jewish family who are told to provide her lodging.The family takes her in what choice do they have? but soon their heartfelt sharing and kindness become obvious.  When the Reds are retreating in a White advance the danger is clear  were Klavdia found out by the Whites and identified as a Red komissar the whole family could be executed.  On the other hand as the husband Yefim Mahazannik resignedly and clearly describes the Jewish community can't expect good treatment from any Russian government at the time.  In any case the family asks her to stay whether the village is under Red or White control.The story is stark as can be expected from the setting.  I enjoyed the performance of Raisa Nedashkovskaya playing the role of the wife Maria isn't this much more a Catholic name than a Jewish one?.  Her cheerfulness and kindness provide a welcome reprieve from the grimness of the film as does to some extent her husband Yefim's incongruous singing.  Even Maria and Yefim's children are forced to grow up quickly I found disturbing their playacting of the military harassing and killing Jewish people.I was surprised when the film ended to me it was sudden and missing at least one or more final scenes.  I understand that the original 1967 film was actually not finished till the 1980s or 1990s.  Apparently the film was also banned in the former Soviet Union until Glasnost.  Komissar leaves one with silence and not hope for the Russian Jewish peasants and laborers or any kind of vision of a peaceful and productive future for anybody.I did enjoy the skillfully subtle camera angles and landscapes. The actors gave strong and convincing performances.  I also appreciated that the film could have justified being quite violent but instead left most of the violence suggested and not graphic.  Overall I'd give the film a rating of 5 out of 10  neither good nor bad giving a good and perhaps realistic view into this period of history but lacking a stronger plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Commissar directed by Aleksandr Askoldov is a 1967 Soviet film based on one of Vasily Grossman's short stories. The story is set during the Russian Civil War and centers around a female commissar of the Red Army cavalry Vavilova who is introduced to the audience as a brutal soldier shooting a deserter with zero remorse. The audience clearly sees her inhumane nature when she finds herself pregnant and mentions how she would have gotten rid of it if only she had known earlier. Finding herself pregnant and due to deliver her baby any day she is forced to stay with a not so well off Jewish family who is at the beginning is reluctant to accept her staying with them. Through her time with this family her character makes a drastic change as she now embraces motherhood and life as a woman. One of the many themes in this film is the effect war has had on adults and children alike. The husband who is exhausted from constantly working while earning very little but has to feed seven children. The wife who has to do all the house chores. In one scene the children aggressively bully and begin to wage a mock pogrom on their older sister by tying her to a swing and swaying her back and forth. The action could have only been possible by observing the actions of soldiers. Although the family is caught in all this chaos Askoldov manages to capture the warm nature of family life through the slow panning of the children and their parents sleeping as well as them dancing together. Askoldov finds ways to dramatize particular scenes one noticeable moment is the scene of Vavilova struggling during her delivery which is paralleled with a scene of a group of soldiers struggling to push a wagon. Also the scene where the soldiers are drinking water after succeeding to push the wagon and the scene where Vavilova drinks water when she succeeds in giving birth. This film did not adhere to the honorable vision of Soviet life in war along with the aftermath that the party officials desired the world to see. The audience is made aware of the Soviet Unions role in the holocaust which is captured in a striking dream sequence near the end of the film where the Jewish family is happily dancing and the moment is cut short as we see the family wearing stars walking with other Jews to what seems to be a concentration camp.".

	schema:reviewBody "Commissar boasts the best soundtrack of any movie I have seen so far and the cinematography is wonderful. It has come a long way since earlier Soviet films in which the camera is frantically switching back and forth. Specifically the shots at the start of the film present a detailed scenery while at the end we see more focused views like when the horses are pulling supplies.But my favorite feature of the film has to be the ambiguous ending. We aren't told if Klavdia survives and comes back to her child or of its fate. This is a twist from similar movies. In Ivan's childhood we find out that Ivan is dead at the end of the film. In Ballad of a Soldier we know our soldier is already dead. That's not to say we don't feel for these characters but there's little left to the viewer. All the information is given to us in the film  we aren't asked Do you believe Alexei survives and returns home after the war? He doesn't. That automatically sets the tone for the rest of the film. With Commissar we can ask ourselves Is this a hopeful film or a darker one? It's true that it has its share of conflict but we can choose to believe the characters are happy at the end if we want. We do still know what ultimately happens historically but the characters can be separate from that.Where the movie is flawed for me is in its simplistic setup. A woman needs to rely on people she is hesitant to trust and ends up trusting them. That's a great plot line but for 60 minutes not 103 minutes. As I watched the movie I couldn't help but feel it could have done more with its time. In Ballad of a Soldier there are multiple stages to the journey each different. In Cranes Are Flying the story is about Veronika but switches to very distinct scenes of Boris as well as focusing on the characters' lives before during and after the war. Here we see Klavdia at the village and that's about it. Yes we see the village before and after the conflict and Klavdia before and after she gives birth but it could have been better still. We could have seen Klavdia's soldiers trying to make do without her. Or a view of the White Army. The film is solid and stands on its own but it feels like more could have been made.".

It also illustrates his message of how government and big media businesses cooperate to produce an effective propaganda machine in order to manipulate the opinions of their populations. The key examples featured for this analysis are the simultaneous events of the massive coverage of the communist atrocities of Khmer Rouge regime of Cambodia and the suppression of news of the US supported Indonesian invasion and subjugation of East Timor.";

Chomsky will be remembered far beyond the present a true maverick and one of the few people intelligent enough to address societal and institutional ills and be right close to 100 of the time.Do NOT dismiss Chomsky because you think he's a lefty nut.  He's not a preBowling for Columbine Michael Moore.  Noam Chomsky is a distinguished intellectual in the truest sense with a near 100 accuracy in placing his words properly in sentences.  When you hear him speak try to focus on how clearly and concisely his ideas are discussed.  Then look into his eyes and take note of his demeanor.  A human body does not suit a mind like his. This documentary is a must for truth seekers and lefties.  It is long but you can watch it in parts.  If you wanna have a great discussion watch it with one or two other people.

	schema:headline " A wideranging at times glowing documentary on Noam Chomsky's life and views on the American media.";
	schema:reviewBody "A wideranging at times glowing documentary on Noam Chomsky's life and views on the American media both large and small mass and alternative Manufacturing Consent took five years to create and covers Chomsky's life with over a hundred hours of interviews and lectures spanning 23 cities in seven countries. Directors and producers Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick followed around Chomsky in an effort to capture his beliefs on any media they had around them including everything from 16 mm film to 8 mm videotape. Manufacturing Consent showcases Chomsky's profound beliefs and profiles his personality in humorous and thoughtprovoking ways that compel the viewer to learn about the topics he broaches with as much vigor Chomsky himself.An anecdote from Chomsky about his childhood in the first part of the film sums up his attitudes in a charming elementary school story. Chomsky tells of a time where he attempted to defend a 'fat kid' in first grade from a group of bullies but after a while he became frightened and let the child he was defending fend for himself. Chomsky says he was always ashamed for leaving the side of that person and he parallels that instance to his defense of people free speech and his support of human rights in thirdworld nations.Often in the film Wintonick appears in the background with camera in hand or is heard off camera interviewing subjects familiar with Chomsky's controversial work. However the most visually appealing aspect of Manufacturing Consent is the visually creative segments that break up interviews onscreen talking. The segments appeal to the visual learner not akin to grasping some of the advanced concepts and often detailed convoluted at times speeches of Chomsky. The best example of this learning tool is one problem Chomsky had with the New York Times after they manipulated a story from London's The Guardian concerning genocides in East Timor. The Times rearranged the story's paragraphs and cut out entire paragraphs to add a different spin to the story as the U.S. was allegedly funneling arms and supporting the occupying Indonesians in order to make U.S. involvement appear minimal and at best positive. Hands appear on screen with the newspaper article on a mini operating table and medical instruments shiny reflective and lined up are ready to dissect and take out pieces of the article. Essentially a pair of hands in white surgical gloves 'operates' on this news article all to display the point more effectively. Similar visual segments are used during the film all with as much of an impact as this one.While Achbar and Wintonick show almost as many dissenters of Chomskys ideas as they do supporters one could easily infer that the two are supporters of his ideas. However they do not interject any of their own political ideas into the fray. The only on camera activity the two participate in is the acting out of Chomsky's ideas via the aforementioned visual segments. Although they are only acting out Chomsky's ideas the pair still help to illustrate those ideas thereby implicating their support. While Wintonick had experience doing political films before they were mostly simple campaign shorts for Canadian politicians. For Achbar as well as Wintonick Manufacturing Consent was their crowning achievement and the film went on to become the topgrossing feature documentary in Canadian history.Released in 1992 the film is only vaguely similar to today's political documentaries. While it is a far cry from the almost cinematic documentaries of Michael Moore it laid the groundwork for Moore's films with its approach full of archival footage interviews and humor. The stock footage narration over still photos and interview after interview are all used in an attempt to get as many of Chomsky's basic ideas across as possible stretching the film out to two hours 45 minutes. There are two parts to Manufacturing Consent the first covering Chomsky's life early background and his foray into protest from his professorship at Massachusetts Institute of Technology while the second portion focuses on his dissidence from the mass media's ideologies or at least his dissidence with the mass media's way of communicating information. The directors only interview Chomsky directly for a small portion of the film. Most of the interviews are done by other subjects everyone from alternative radio news anchors to talk show hosts to newspaper writers interview Chomsky and Achbar and Wintonick are right there with their cameras to capture Chomsky's ideas and often the ensuing arguments. Anyone not familiar with the ideas of Chomsky before seeing this film need not worry as this mammoth of a documentary covers the basics of Chomsky's ideas and writings. Several of his lectures at universities around the country are showcased not only exposing his ideas but the personality behind them. While The New York Times lauded Chomsky as the greatest intellectual of our time and one of the film's visual segments show a group of baseball cards only with 'philosopher all stars' as the theme Chomsky is included such blatant quotes and visuals are not needed to let the viewer realize Chomsky's genius however disputed it may be. The filmmakers profile Chomsky in a way that while it is not 'Noam Chomsky 101' makes for an interesting profile of the man and fully encompasses his ideas on general issues like the mass media and more specific ones concerning human rights violations and freedom of speech. Chomsky's detractors are also profiled in the film and at one point his defense of freedom of speech causes the Jewish raised Chomsky to be labeled as an antiSemite. His preface for a revisionist book by author Robert Faurisson is a defense of free speech. In a later scene where Chomsky is surrounded by reporters questioning his preface he says that only allowing freedom of speech for ideas that one supports inherently makes that person an adversary to free speech. While the directors make it clear that Chomsky is no revisionist or Holocaust denier their inclusion of his willingness to grapple with controversial subject matter further illustrates Chomsky's daring personality backed by his intellectual prowess. The film does not have a clearcut story per se but rather it is a loose collection of ideas and theories that Chomsky has all of which fall under his comments on the media. The directors take their time in illustrating those ideas with a variety of story telling and learning devices. Perhaps this is why the film is so long. After viewing it is safe to say that besides a few of the visual segments none of this film's content could be cut out to trim the story down. In attempting to cover the ideas and life of an intensely academic man who wrote dozens of books and articles it may not be best to compact it in a single film but the directors somehow succeed at succinctly conveying his messages. The soundtrack is similar to ones heard in other political or academic documentaries in that much of the music is reminiscent to that of the music heard on cable news channels or at worst game shows. The use of sound effects during visual segments more often than not is solely provided for humor or to induce a feeling of haste as most of the segments are played at double speed. The challenge in this film is to implement just enough background music so that the lengthy interviews and lectures do not become too monotonous. Most often the use of music or background noise is used to break up long interviews. The budget for this film is not immediately discernible. While the directors admitted to not having enough money to follow Chomsky to Japan for an award he received during the film and they had to 'direct' a local film crew there for the scene they still traveled with him to other locales. However after viewing it is obvious that the filmmakers following around Chomsky only had to film his public speaking engagements and interviews not related to the documentary. They just filmed his prearranged interviews with outside news sources and lectures at universities. The film was shot over four years and that time span can undoubtedly take up much of the budget. The main sources of tension found in Manufacturing Consent come from Chomsky's ideas themselves. His personality at times confrontational when others disagree with him or even when others merely interrupt him most notably on news talk shows such as Firing Line in 1969 can be a proponent of tension between him and others. The other less obvious sources of tension are culled from more abstract issues involving Chomsky as the dissenter to popular or as he puts it 'corporate' opinion.".

Its easy to be the Plunderer and commit the atrocities... its far more difficult to uncover the plots organize the facts and be vigilant of the actions. This is MustSee Media for the masses!Americans are too busy to begin think outside the box. This is 2h46m of intensive training in true democratic responsibility. Chomsky may favor the social structure of an early 20th century Kibbutz but certainly his lessons of observation would stand well for any social structure. If you are not bought and owned by the system... you owe it to your children or your immortal soul...or karmic rebirth to wake up and smell the fascism.".

A film so deep and full of nonstop realitybusting evidence that what you see ISN'T what you get in America.Chomsky is arguably the most intelligent political observer on Earth today. Its easy to be the Plunderer and commit the atrocities... its far more difficult to uncover the plots organize the facts and be vigilant of the actions. This is MustSee Media for the masses!Americans are too busy to begin think outside the box. This is 2h46m of intensive training in true democratic responsibility. Chomsky may favor the social structure of an early 20th century Kibbutz but certainly his lessons of observation would stand well for any social structure. If you are not bought and owned by the system... you owe it to your children or your immortal soul...or karmic rebirth to wake up and smell the fascism.";

	schema:reviewBody "Noam Chomsky has been called arguably the most important intellectuals alive by the New York Times and has been at the forefront of dissenting intellectual thought and activism for several decades now. This film takes a witty and intelligent look at Chomsky's welldocumented theories on how the media serves the agendas of the corporategovernment power structure  not as a conspiracy theory but simply as an analysis of the way things necessarily operate.This film is bound to polarize audiences. The ideas which are put forward and the facts which are revealed will shake some people's world. Many will disagree and argue against Chomsky and his ideas. Good. I think that's much of why this film was made. The disclaimer at the end of the credits states that the film was made with the intent to promote discussion about the media. If you aren't aroused one way or another by what is put forward in this film then either you must have been sleeping through it or else you are just plain apathetic.The film is long. It has to be. Chomsky points out that part of the way in which the mass media manufactures consent is through concision. Soundbytes. They don't take a lot of time to look at the facts or to thoroughly examine both sides of most issues. In order to think outside the paradigm of the mass media and to adequately discuss and defend views which go against mainstream thought then you have to take some time. That's exactly what Manufacturing Consent does. However the filmmakers Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick keep it interesting. They keep it from turning into three hours of talking heads.To do this the filmmakers use some of the very techniques which Chomsky identifies the mass media as using in order to influence their audiences. It's wonderful and humorous to see how they speak the very language which they and Chomsky are exposing and criticizing. Don't be fooled this is a propagandist film in favor of Chomsky and in favor of thinking about the world around you and then getting off your butt and  doing something about it! Keep in mind when I use the term 'propaganda' that propaganda isn't always necessarily bad the USA used propaganda to muster support for World War II and consequently Hitler's genocide was stopped. 'Propaganda' it just basically means that it pretty blatantly favors one view over another. Don't get me wrong Manufacturing Consent is not completely one sided. Both sides of the argument are given screen time but Chomsky's views come out on top.Watch this film. Even if you don't agree with it the discussion of the issues presented is important. It will raise your consciousness of what is happening to you every day whenever you turn on the TV or the radio or pick up a newspaper or even when you go to a football game. It will change your perspective and maybe even your life. And how many films really do that? That's why I say it's one of the most important documentaries ever made.".

The documentary which showcases Noam Chomsky's anarchistsocialist critique of the American media purports to be an expose a skewering of the deception and manipulation perpetrated on the public by the corporategovernmental establishment. Far from providing the needed antidote of clarity and passionate honesty however the filmmakersand perhaps Chomsky are guilty of their own manipulation of facts and appearances stacking the deck in their own favor and employing tricks and distractions to get away from the important issues.First rather than simply presenting Chomsky's biography and philosophy in a straightforward focused way the film is full of ridiculous little setpieces and interludes meant to drive home points that the highly articulate Chomsky already made perfectly clear. To illustrate the New York Times skimpy treatment of the East Timorese genocide the film gives us two actors in surgical gowns cutting up a newspaper with scalpels. We see Chomsky's face broadcast on giant banks of TV screens placed within the darkest corners of the Establishment a mall a football stadium. And of course we get the usual clips from '50s era educational films just so we can have a laugh at those stupid people not as sophisticated as we documentary viewers. These cinematic jokes sneers and posturing pad the documentary out to an absurd length of three hours despite its containing only about ninety minutes of genuine material. Worse the documentary takes a slavishly adoring stance toward its subject one which Chomsky himself to his credit would find absurd. All critics are shown up as fools or buffoons and all clips of Chomsky with an opponent are carefully chosen so that Chomsky always bests or oneups the other guy. Further the film uses innuendo rather than evidence the key portion of Manufacturing Consent deals with media treatment of East Timor and the inadequate nature of the news coverage is amply demonstrated. Chomsky and his supporters provide no arguments as to why this is the case however we are meant to assume that such media failures can only be a manifestation of social control of the masses by elites. Finally even after hacking through the padding and the carefully managed presentation the portrait of Chomsky that emerges is I think a misleading one. He comes across as a kind of intellectual Michael Moore a populist determined to dispel the lies of the powerful and reveal the plain honest truth. Nonsense. Chomsky's radicalism is the product not of commonsense decency but of the very rigid extremist philosophy that shapes and constrains his own thought as much if not more than the corporatedominated media constrains the thought of others. Noam Chomsky is an anarchist and he is not in rebellion against the GOP big business or even capitalism but against the very idea of authority of any kind itself. A genuine debate with Chomsky must be one that challenges anarchism per se and arguing about politics or the media only leads to the tedium and frustration of Chomsky and his critics talking past each otheras we see again and again throughout Manufacturing Consent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wonder how many conservatives who disqualify this fine documentary and its book are financially poor. I wonder if they realize that their attitude supports the rich folks who are responsible for their dire financial straits. I am not an activist. I admit that I'm a liberal because I was raised by liberals poor somewhat intellectual musicians none of us except for one sister university graduated scholars all libertarians the oldest before the term was invented. We are I believe the common people to whom Chomsky is speaking quite directly. The ones who because we constitute a fairly large proportion of society could make a difference if we became activists for his described controlled anarchy the purer democracy in which commoners would assume control of the economic political etc. systems now concentrated within the control of a relatively small number of moneyed individuals and corporations.What is liberal? To me it's strongest dictionary definition is the one that describes it as ideas that wishwork for change. Most liberals are for change because there are many things wrong with the present system. The secondary definition is more on the idea of leniency. Both are valid and both are despised by most conservatives. The conservative rejoinder to liberal ideas 1 don't fix what's already working and 2 there's too much moralethical leniency in our society. The irony is that many conservatives also think there are things wrong with the system but they blame liberals for moralethical changes during the past few decades what we liberals know to be minor but what conservatives consider to be drastic and are therefore for a return to the more distant past say the Victorian age as a resolve. The problem with this conservative resolve for one perhaps prime example is that there are several more times the population of humans alive on Earth than there were during the 19th century.

	onyx:emotionText "I wonder how many conservatives who disqualify this fine documentary and its book are financially poor. I wonder if they realize that their attitude supports the rich folks who are responsible for their dire financial straits. I am not an activist. I admit that I'm a liberal because I was raised by liberals poor somewhat intellectual musicians none of us except for one sister university graduated scholars all libertarians the oldest before the term was invented. We are I believe the common people to whom Chomsky is speaking quite directly. The ones who because we constitute a fairly large proportion of society could make a difference if we became activists for his described controlled anarchy the purer democracy in which commoners would assume control of the economic political etc. systems now concentrated within the control of a relatively small number of moneyed individuals and corporations.What is liberal? To me it's strongest dictionary definition is the one that describes it as ideas that wishwork for change. Most liberals are for change because there are many things wrong with the present system. The secondary definition is more on the idea of leniency. Both are valid and both are despised by most conservatives. The conservative rejoinder to liberal ideas 1 don't fix what's already working and 2 there's too much moralethical leniency in our society. The irony is that many conservatives also think there are things wrong with the system but they blame liberals for moralethical changes during the past few decades what we liberals know to be minor but what conservatives consider to be drastic and are therefore for a return to the more distant past say the Victorian age as a resolve. The problem with this conservative resolve for one perhaps prime example is that there are several more times the population of humans alive on Earth than there were during the 19th century. The population growth has consequences. The rules have changed drastically because of technology and population growth.

Viewers are shown about some of the gripping facts of news making including what goes behind the scenes. The endtoend process of news making as explained in the movie including other elements like vested interests controlling factors exposes the audience to several dark truths. After watching the movie any viewer will be in a better position to judge news and news making whether or not they are from the media background. Some of the topics are quite controversial but it helps us in understanding the rigor that Prof.Chomsky uses to advocate freedom of expression. For instance in the section on 'Holocaust Denial' Prof.Chomsky mentions that there is a difference between expressing your own views and protecting the views expressed. He makes this statement while arguing that he had supported the French intellectual who published a book to explain that the Holocaust mass murders actually did not take place. He also emphasizes that he does not endorse the views of the French intellectual but supports him in the context of expressing his own views. Prof.Chomsky's statement States are violent institutions is a connotation well expressed. There are chilling evidences to support his statement in the movie. For instance while analyzing the news articles that appeared in the media in the United States during the initial phases of Indonesia's aggression on East Timor there were negative reports. He explains that this was on account of the fact that East Timor was a former Portuguese colony. However after the invasion of East Timor U.S supplied arms to Indonesia and there was no coverage of the genocide and atrocities committed by Indonesia in East Timor. Similarly he also remarks that every Postwar American president should be hanged if Nuremberg laws are to be applied. Some of the definitions and framework put forward by Prof.Chomsky helps in understanding theories like Manufacturing Consent and Agenda Setting better. For instance he says that marginalizing the public is the intention of elite class. Similarly he also explains that elite and big media are agenda setters and that 80 percent of the population are followers in a democracy and the remaining 80 percent is composed of the elite and the political class. The movie is a very interesting eyeopener for all audiences be it a novice or a historian or a media professional. However some of the concepts like manufacturing consent and agenda setting are repeatedly explained. Further editing can improve the quality of the movie and especially remove the repeated explanations.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who take a particular interest in media and communications issues Noam Chomsky may not be an unfamiliar name. Manufacturing Consent Noam Chomsky and the Media is a documentary that takes a long serious look at Chomsky's thoughts about the mass media in the US especially those ideas that were eventually reflected in the seminal book he coauthored with Edward S. Herman. Through a mishmash of interviews and news footage about real events Chomsky talks about the Propaganda Theory giving examples and explaining the role of the mass media in imposing in the words of the man himself necessary illusions ... on the stupid majority so as to maintain the special interests of an elite group. He brings in several ideas such as how the media is owned by a specific group of people and conglomerates.What was especially intriguing for me was the detailed example that Chomsky gave about the US media coverage of the atrocities that took place in Cambodia and East Timor separately in the 1970s. In juxtaposing the different types and amounts of media coverage of the two events he argued how the interests of particular groups in the US came into influencing how much people knew and what they knew about the situations in the two countries. Could Chomsky be right about this? Or is there something else that we do not know about?It is quite obvious that the ideas that Chomsky espoused in the documentary are important and they do serve to push people to critically consider the mediasaturated world that we live in. However I wonder if it is simply too easy to blame the mass media for being specially motivated to get involved in agenda setting. After all there is a very real limitation on resources even for major media organisations like The New York Times  there is no way that a 10000page paper can be printed day to day. There will be and there must be editorial selections and cuts some information will be in while some will be left out.Moreover it may be too simplistic to think that readers cannot think for themselves. This is even truer in today's context when the number of alternative media and social media is growing steadily everyday. With this range of issues and perspectives reported people have the freedom to pick up new topics and ideas and as a result form opinions of their own.As it is the great thing about Chomsky's ideas are that they remind us that nothing is truly objective and simple. Thus they also remind us to be media literate and to probe into the media that we encounter daily.Overall the documentary is an insightful detailed film about Chomsky's thought processes and the Propaganda Theory. However there are a few sections in the film that can get rather repetitive running at almost 3 hours long this documentary would probably best suit those who are eager to better understand Manufacturing Consent and the man behind the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first encounter with Noam Chomsky was through his theory of Manufacturing Consent and the Propaganda Model the latter coauthored with Edward Herman some months back. Though these ideas were formulated decades ago it was somewhat radical for me. I felt like a fish in an aquarium that had been told Think about the environment you are swimming in. There are pebbles and plants and a constant and sure supply of food there is no lack. But the fish does not realise that it has been lulled into believing that the aquarium is its real home when it was meant for the ocean. It is living in a controlled environment and to a certain extent is being manipulated for its owners' pleasures. Though the film Manufacturing Consent Noam Chomsky and the media does not go indepth into the theories that thrust Chomsky into the public spotlight I enjoyed it because it revealed the heart behind the intellectual mind. In one segment Chomsky shared his adolescence experience of not standing up for the underdogs and how the shame stuck with him for a long time. It drove him to give up a comfortable academic career and symbols of a successful modern life to pursue what he believed to be right and moral. The film revealed Chomsky to be a firm believer of partisan common sense  he believes that people have the ability to see through the deceit i.e. the techniques that the elites are using to manufacture content with a view of furthering their political and economic interests and his theories are signposts towards greater awareness of such tactics. For Chomsky the equanimity and detachment with which people can observe events like genocide made them as bad as or worse than dictators. While the film was about Chomsky's work and had a proChomsky slant it also offered contrary perspectives of how his thoughts were ridiculed and put down by critics and other scholars. One such critic said such oppositional theories were a fashion a way of making intellectuals feel like they are a clergy there has to be something wrong.To a certain extent a film like this is an example of what it was illustrating i.e. in any media product  and this film is certainly one such product  there are perspectives that the producers are trying to portray. These perspectives are never valueneutral they have a function to inform and to persuade. One could argue that this film like other media products has a narrative to sell albeit it deals with more controversial themes. While I think Chomsky's perspectives certainly have value in helping me to see the world with a more critical lens there are areas that I am unclear about. For instance Chomsky speaks about societal transformation but does not paint an adequate picture of what that transformed society looks like  who are the actors what are its structures etc. In the film he speaks about the dominant elites in broad terms e.g. media government PR institutes but does not make the link between the individuals who run these organizations  their personal goals interests and impulses  and how they collectively come together to drive a corporate motive. When audiences asked Chomsky what they could do to fight against the dominant narrative and the system of indoctrination and convenient myths Chomsky encouraged them to search for alternative sources of information visvis mainstream media and to cultivate an independent and inquiring mind. This is perhaps my greatest takeaway from the film  that it was important essential to survival even to question what has been said think about what has not been said and the implications of what it means. And to ask What can I affect to make a change and when necessary being willing to swim upstream against the tide of popular conventions and beliefs and to speak without fear or favour.".

While this was my first encounter with Naom Chomsky I now feel I do understand what got him voted the World's Top Public Intellectual in 2005. It is bound to polarize and generate strong opinions. The message is strong and discomforting and conveyed in a no holds barred way. But if it does that it has probably fulfilled its purpose. In summary it is probably best to quote the man himself I think it only makes sense to seek out and identify structures of authority hierarchy and domination in every aspect of life and to challenge them unless a justification for them can be given they are illegitimate and should be dismantled to increase the scope of human freedom.

Through forms of interviews talk shows the two Canadian filmmakers Mark Achbar and Peter Wintonick give us an insight on the political views and life of Chomsky. The documentary film has successfully portrayed Chomsky as well as his idea of how the U.S. media operates sets the agenda and the reasons behind this process.Honestly the first 30 minutes of this film is boring and heavy to me partly due to the quality of the movie produced more than 20 years ago. However in the next part when Chomsky explains his perspective on agendasetting media how opinions are shaped and the public mind is controlled. Chomsky's major focus is on society's class He also identifies decision makers they are the government owner of the media or people who have to be in the position to make the decisions. In my opinion one of his biggest contributions is to define two main groups in the society Political group 20 of the population which is relatively educated and they are decision makers 80 of people are ordinary ones who do not think or pay attention but they usually have to pay the costs. This explains whose consent is being manufactured.The movie also emphasizes the ideas of Chomsky  Herman that the news is filtered by five factors ownership advertising sourcing flak and anti  communist ideology. And in that way like he says history is created. Nevertheless is manufacturing consent and propaganda model still relevant today? I myself believe that Chomsky and Herman's ideas still act as basic understanding about an elitistdriven media system. The limitation of the model is that it does not consider the general public among its filters of news content. In fact public opinion and social movement can play an active role as a filter especially in the era of online media social media which allow people to express their opinion publicly and broadly with an incredible scope and speed. For example In the Iraq war counterflax of populace driven dissent showed that the media was shifting from administrationdriven views toward the broader public ordinary people. In conclusion I agree with the idea that this is very valuable documentary film containing one of basic communication theories of all the time! But to apply in modern scenario Chomsky's ideas are not fully engaged because technology development has changed our thinking our society and the mass media's traits as well.".

This movie shows his views about the media that we consume. Initially it is shown how he put forward his views about the control of the 'free' media by the hegemony. How political and other influential people influence the media in our world. The parallel comparison of the coverage of the East Timor and Cambodia atrocities show us the control of the media on issues of political interest. Chomsky proposed a Propaganda model of media criticism which explains how the systematic biases function in the mass media. The movie shows interviews and debates Chomsky faced in his journey and how he was criticized several times by the political leaders and even by the public. There are examples of wars where US government did not allow media to let the world know about the peaceful alternatives that they had instead of indulging in the war acts. The example of Chomsky not being invited on the Nightline show also shows that media is highly controlled and people did not want him to say about the propaganda setting in public. He usually found his audience through the alternative media. Chomsky advocates the Alternative media to be set up which should be citizen controlled. The movie also gives suggestions about the falsification of history by government officials to create a popular ideology towards a particular group or a country. Even the historical beliefs of Nazis using Gas chambers and causing atrocities have been questioned in the movie. This movie was made long time back but its concepts and theories are valid even today. Now we see the falsification and biases in the news at all levels. Thanks to the internet that now we have a platform to at least critique and analyze the information provided to us by the mass media lords.The quality of the audio and video is not good as it's an old work. But the examples shown in the movie are really interesting and relevant. I really liked the flow of the movie. I recommend this movie to every individual who wants to understand the communication theories and their relevance in our lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary film attempted to explore Noam Chomsky's ideas on the role of media in the US. Despite sometimes poor audio and video quality this film successfully reveals Chomsky ideas of how major media in the US set the agenda of the public and create 'history'. In the beginning of the film Chomsky disclosed that the term 'manufacturing consent' derived from Walter Lippmann's book Public Opinion 1921 that attested that the manufacture of consent is a revolution in the practice of democracy it is the technique to control people's mind. Chomsky postulated that regardless of political system role of media is crucial because more powerful groups always try to control people's mind and shape how people think. That is what he suggested as propaganda. After more than 20 years since it was first released I feel that some notions he postulated in this film need to be adjusted. While some aspects are still relevant with today's issues rapid and major shifts as the consequences of the development of communication technology made differences in today context. For example when Chomsky mentioned about public's addiction to the media newspaper in that time we can also relate with this notion because public is still addicted and attached to the media traditional AND new media in this era. For me the highlight of this film is the propaganda model Chomsky and Herman coined in their book with similar title as this film. This model depicts how media mobilise public supports for special interests that dominate government and public sector. Dominant elite groups shape the media both in content and framing to serve their interests. Today we can still recognise how these powerful groups affect mainstream media. However the fact that new media provide more alternatives to the audience is irrefutable. These alternative media create more affluent marketplace of ideas and change media consumption pattern. What is personally intriguing for me is that Chomsky is against developing public personalities and making people 'stars'. He did not show interest in the fame he is into and even decided to keep his family life strictly isolated from his career and stay discreet about his personal life.".

	schema:headline " The best of the Universal series";
	schema:reviewBody "This sixth entry in the Universal Sherlock Holmes series was the third which defied the initial conception of the franchise. Universal had envisioned Sherlock Holmes as a sort of archetypal hero who transported into the modern era of WWII could be put on the government payroll as it were to work as a contract agent to hunt down Nazi spies on behalf of the Allies. Perhaps somewhat unexpectedly this idea met with a great deal of consternation not only from serious Sherlockians but also from film critics whose knowledge of Doyle's work was marginal at best. Granted most of the Holmes films made up to that point had been updated to their respective eras in fact only Fox's two Holmes features with Rathbone and Bruce had taken place in their appropriate time period but in those cases the modernization was all on the surface. Automobiles telephones and the fashions of the day were all on display...but that was for all intents and purposes scenery. The stories though changed sometimes drastically from their original forms had a timeless quality about them. The first three Universal films however were very timely with plots focused explicitly on the events of the Second World War. This took Holmes out of his element...not only in the literal sense of removing him from VictorianEdwardian London as previous films had done but in transforming the character of Holmes from a consulting detective into a spyhunter. Indeed at times there is more James Bond than Sherlock Holmes in this character. This trend peaked or bottomed out with Sherlock Holmes in Washington...the final straw for critics and audiences alike. The film was a critical and box office flop and Universal saw fit to alter the series' direction from that point on.Though still taking place in the 1940s the subsequent films did their best to place Holmes back in his proper role solving intricate mysteries with deductive reasoning...rather than the pure chance and intuition that often guided him in his forays into international espionage. This may or may not be accredited to the director Roy William Neill who directed all but the first entry in the series who with the fourth film Sherlock Holmes Faces Death became the associate producer...a title he would retain throughout the series' run. From that point on the films became more Gothic in tone in many ways more closely resembling the Universal horror films of the era than the first three Universal Holmes pictures. This decision yielded immediate positive results. Sherlock Holmes Faces Death was easily the best of the first four entries and subsequent films topped one another until peaking with The Scarlet Claw.Oddly enough the film is set in a French province of Canada...for no discernible reason. The setting is completely superfluous to the plot which could easily have played out anywhere ideally Great Britain. This is made all the more puzzling by the fact that the predominant accent present in the film is British rather than French Canadian...even American actors threw on Brit accents despite the fact that American accents would have been more sensible in Canada. But no matter. This slight idiosyncrasy aside The Scarlet Claw is the ultimate RathboneBruce Universal outing. Not adapted from any of the original Doyle tales though borrowing heavily from The Hound of the Baskervilles The Scarlet Claw is dripping with atmosphere. Fogwreathed marshes are the setting as Holmes tracks a ghostly apparition that has graduated from sheep mutilation to murdering humans. The local villagers believe the culprit to be supernatural but levelheaded Holmes rejects the idea out of hand and sets himself to the task of finding the murderer.Rathbone as Holmes is at the top of his form here...cold and detached clinical in his reasoning. And Bruce's Watson even in this dumbed down incarnation is a pleasure to watch. Crisp direction beautiful cinematography particularly for a Bfilm plenty of twists and turns along the way and no small amount of deductive reasoning from Holmes make this the strongest entry in the Universal series. The later films were often good but none ever matched the achievement of The Scarlet Claw...which is simultaneously Gothic suspenseful and very very Holmesian. It is not without its logical flaws but the flaws are justified by the picture's enormous entertainment value. And of all the films in the series this one is by far the most entertaining.".

	onyx:emotionText "This sixth entry in the Universal Sherlock Holmes series was the third which defied the initial conception of the franchise. Universal had envisioned Sherlock Holmes as a sort of archetypal hero who transported into the modern era of WWII could be put on the government payroll as it were to work as a contract agent to hunt down Nazi spies on behalf of the Allies. Perhaps somewhat unexpectedly this idea met with a great deal of consternation not only from serious Sherlockians but also from film critics whose knowledge of Doyle's work was marginal at best. Granted most of the Holmes films made up to that point had been updated to their respective eras in fact only Fox's two Holmes features with Rathbone and Bruce had taken place in their appropriate time period but in those cases the modernization was all on the surface. Automobiles telephones and the fashions of the day were all on display...but that was for all intents and purposes scenery. The stories though changed sometimes drastically from their original forms had a timeless quality about them. The first three Universal films however were very timely with plots focused explicitly on the events of the Second World War. This took Holmes out of his element...not only in the literal sense of removing him from VictorianEdwardian London as previous films had done but in transforming the character of Holmes from a consulting detective into a spyhunter. Indeed at times there is more James Bond than Sherlock Holmes in this character.

The first two manage keep a degree of the surprise in reviewing them but once you see THE SCARLET CLAW you are so aware of the secret of the villain that you note things each time about him that you would not the first. Yet his performance is so good that you still enjoy the movie.Unlike HOUSE OF FEAR SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH and THE PEARL OF DEATH THE SCARLET CLAW has no literary basis in the actual Conan Doyle stories about Holmes. This plot was concocted by the scriptwriters from whole cloth. Indeed one element of it seems to be based on the work of another great mystery story writer G.K. Chesterton  who is mentioned late in the film by Watson. The atmosphere of the bogs which is the setting of much of the film is reminiscent of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES but that story had already been made into a film with Rathbone and Bruce earlier. In fact the discussion of a swamp monster brings in the occult and this film with THE HOUND is the closest in the series to remind us of Arthur Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism and the occult.The weapon involved is not one from any of the Holmes stories although it should fit into one had Conan Doyle ever thought of it. The motive  vengeance on several people who all live in this Canadian village  actually is a sensible one for a change some of the motives for murders especially robberies in the later films seen stretching it.Being a war movie Holmes and Watson have a final patriotic comment at the end regarding Canada as a link between the U.S. and Great Britain. It actually is one of the more tolerable patriotic closing lines in their war films although given the way Prime Minister MacKenzie King of Canada had to twist the situation regarding a draft of French Canadians to help beleaguered Britain Not necessarily conscription but conscription if necessary it remains somewhat ironic.Paul Cavanagh whom I mentioned in THE HOUSE OF FEAR review was one of the many character actors who popped up in several of the RathboneBruce films over the series. In THE HOUSE OF FEAR he was a suspect. In THE WOMAN IN GREEN he played a victim. Here he is a subsidiary victim who resents the appearance of Holmes on the scene of his tragedy but whom ends up helping Holmes in solving the case. Note also Arthur Hohl usually playing villains or comic characters but here possibly having his best straight performance.".

He seems to be so comfortable with this role by this point that his mannerisms just flow.  As good as Rathbone is it is the comic performance of Nigel Bruce as his bumbling sidekick Dr. Watson who really does a whale of a job stumbling and mumbling through his role.  Bruce plays off Rathbone wonderfully and he has a larger than life presencesteals many a scene too I might add.  The rest of the cast is definitely all quality.  The direction by Roy William Neill is firstrate. He directs very smoothly by enhancing the two central characters but also creating a very effective moody atmosphere.  The story is imaginative and not derived from a Doyle story.  I like the way that the scripter managed to put mystery writer G. K. Chesterton's name into the film.  The last little monologue by Holmes at the conclusion of the film is a wartime thanks to Canada and how it acts as a link for mankind.  Interesting tribute.".

While this yarn isn't quite up to the standards of The Hound of the Baskervilles it still represents another success in turning the detective novels into films. This time round we follow a remote village that is at the mercy of a mysterious ghost who appears to be killing them off. Not being a believer in ghosts our logical protagonist Sherlock Holmes decides to take the case on and travels to the remote village to find as usual that there's more going on than meets the eye. Once again this story is riddled with inventive twists and a plot that is constantly full of suspense and as usual it makes for great viewing. While the plot doesn't have any depth or substance it doesn't matter at all because this film is made for pure entertainment value and on that front it certainly delivers! Once again Basil Rathbone takes the lead role as the supersleuth Sherlock Holmes and as usual does excellently with it. He does so well at playing this character that you when you think Sherlock Holmes it's Rathbone's image that instantly pops into your mind. While this may have hindered the rest of his career a little it's definitely a good thing while you're watching a Sherlock Holmes movie. Also reprising his role from previous Holmes movies is Nigel Bruce in the role of Dr Watson. He too makes great use of the role and again it's hard to imagine anyone else playing Dr Watson. The supernatural elements of the story are nice and seeing the numerous atmosphere scenes is always a treat. The black and white cinematography helps to create a foreboding atmosphere which compliments the story nicely. The ensemble of characters surrounding the mystery are well done and the film throws in a number of red herrings in order to keep the conclusion from the audience until it is finally time to give it away. All in all great stuff!".

	schema:reviewBody "Universal's Sherlock Holmes series brought the characters into the 20th Century. Many of the were related to World War II stories in which Holmes went in pursuit of spies and counterspies others tried to mimic the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories with a presentation of mental puzzles. Although generally well executed seldom did any of the titles rise above the level of B Picturesbut on the rare occasions that they did they did so with a vengeance and THE SCARLET CLAW is such a case. Directed at a fast clip by Roy William Neill memorably photographed by George Robinson and sporting an expert cast in a particularly clever script this is easily among the best of the series.The story hearkens back to such titles as THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. Lord Penrose Paul Cavanaugh is convinced that his small Canadian town is beset by an evil spiritand is indeed giving a lecture on psychic phenomena when his wife is found murdered presumably by a apparition that haunted the town many years before. Convinced that it is the work of an otherwordly being he does not welcome the arrival of Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone who is convinced that there is nothing ghostly about the matter in the least.The Universal films counted a great deal on the chemistry between Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and sidekick Dr. Watson and indeed that chemistry is on full display in this particular title. But the overall cast is remarkably fine not only the aforementioned Cavanaugh but most particularly Gerald Hammer who frequently appeared in these films and here offers a uniquely memorable turn as the fearful postmaster. And unlike most other films in the series the solution to the crime is indeed a shocker.The restoration is very handsome and the DVD comes with two nice bonuses a short documentary on the challenges faced by those who restored the series THE SCARLET CLAW receives particular mention and an erudite audio commentary by film historian David Stuart Davies. If you've seen one or two films in the series and been unimpressedgive this one a try to see what Rathbone and company could do when when they had all the right makings. Recommended.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Convinced that it is the work of an otherwordly being he does not welcome the arrival of Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone who is convinced that there is nothing ghostly about the matter in the least.The Universal films counted a great deal on the chemistry between Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Holmes and sidekick Dr. Watson and indeed that chemistry is on full display in this particular title. But the overall cast is remarkably fine not only the aforementioned Cavanaugh but most particularly Gerald Hammer who frequently appeared in these films and here offers a uniquely memorable turn as the fearful postmaster. And unlike most other films in the series the solution to the crime is indeed a shocker.The restoration is very handsome and the DVD comes with two nice bonuses a short documentary on the challenges faced by those who restored the series THE SCARLET CLAW receives particular mention and an erudite audio commentary by film historian David Stuart Davies. If you've seen one or two films in the series and been unimpressedgive this one a try to see what Rathbone and company could do when when they had all the right makings.

Turns out it's one of the very best entries in the series up there with THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES and THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES as essential Holmes films.It has all the atmosphere one would want in a Sherlock Holmes story and a mystery that deepens as the plot goes forward but resolved in a very satisfying way by Holmes. The cast includes an excellent performance from PAUL CAVANAGH as Mr. Penrose whose wife dies a vicious death at the hands of a killer and leads to Holmes' investigation. GERALD HAMER as a nervous postman and VICTORIA HORNE as a frightened housekeeper are also fine as is MILES MANDER as a judge whose life is in danger from a serial killer.Although this one takes place in Canada it might just as well have taken place on the Dartmouth moors in Devonshirethat's the kind of atmosphere it has with plenty of mist and fog to add to the Gothic ambiance of the tale.Well worth watching for Sherlock fans. Especially good is NIGEL BRUCE as the bumbling Dr. Watson who inadvertently helps BASIL RATHBONE from time to time. His blustery interpretation of the comic sidekick is especially well done in this caper. Rathbone of course is beyond reproach.".

Movies being another art form though one must certainly make allowances for alternative interpretations. Rathbone as usual excels himself here and in my personal Holmes actor ranking he's first just before Jeremy Brett.At the outset I had the slight impression that the story is a bit of a ripoff of the HOUND but very soon one realises that the storyline goes into quite another direction. But since The Hound Of The Baskervilles is my very favourite Holmes story that didn't undo the story for me.What made me wonder a bit was that although set in francophone Canada the only French allusions are the use of the address 'monsieur' and the name of the village... Everything else sounds quite English.Still the movie is greatly entertaining and the eerie marshland atmosphere with a hint at the supernatural is cleverly caught.".

These two are the best Holmesfilms because they're atmospheric and unsettling horror stories rather than simple detective films revolving on an allknowing hero. The story is worth digging into and the scenery  set pieces are terrific with fogmachines seemly on every street corner and a mysterious villain hiding out in the marshes of a small Canadian town with a dubious name La Mort Rouge. Holmes and his loyal assistant Watson who seems to get dumber every film are in Canada for a congress about the supernatural and decide to stay when they're facing seemly authentic supernatural murder case! A woman's throat has been brutally torn out and the villagers of La Mort Rouge fear there's a 100yearold ghost at large. Skeptical Holmes however doesn't really believe this and looks for a suspect who's more human. I really appreciated how the screenplay doesn't idolize Sherlock Holmes too much! For example despite his amazing deductiontalents Holmes still can't prevent some extra murders from happening and not once but twice he arrives to late in order to stop the murderer. It might be a detail but for me this makes the character a lot more convincing and realistic. The obligatory WWII references are more camouflaged than usual and Roy William Neill's direction is as solid and professional as ever. The Scarlet Claw is a highly enjoyable mysteryhorror classic with some fascinating storytwists and engaging performances. Recommended!".

Despite Bruce's retarded portrayal he did have good screen chemistry with Rathbone. The series started and ended rather feebly but in between there were some exceptionally fine movies and The Scarlet Claw shows the team at their peak. A genuine whodunit with plenty of suspense atmosphere and the usual number of endearingly eccentric performances from the supporting cast all handled with great aplomb by Director and Producer Roy William Neill.The story owes a little to The Hound Of The Baskervilles with its plot device of a supposedly supernatural creature stalking the marshlands but manages to be its own beast pun intended by weaving around the premise an intricately plotted mystery. The characters too are well drawn with their own backstories and motivations which affords the audience a wealth of suspects. The production design is richly dark with fog shrouded marshes and shadowy buildings for Holmes and Watson to stalk through. Such is the heavy atmosphere seething through every frame of this film that even the brightly lit tavern scenes in which the townspeople gather for a drink and a sing along are tinged with a sinister edge.Plot character design performance and direction all come together perfectly to create a Bmovie that puts most Amovies to shame.".

When Holmes gets a note sent by the dead woman before her death saying her life is in danger he realises that it is murder and stays in the town to investigate.Although I prefer the Holmes adventures that occur in his own time this is a good example of how well the characters and mystery works no matter the setting.  Here this story is set in Canada as a salute to our Allies during the Second World War.  Happily this flag waving style salute is confined to the final scene as opposed to becoming the whole body of the film as in some of the Holmes v's Nazis' films.  For the vast majority of the film the plot functions very well as both a mystery and a chiller.  The mystery side is good even if the villain is not very good at delivering lines when confronted by Holmes  no cat and mouse wit here.  The chiller element of the film is much better than I assumed it would be the director gets a great atmosphere even if the beast' is a poor effect by today's standards.The actors all do a reasonable job my only complaint is that all of them seemed to have English accents rather than Canadian  only one or two of the characters spoken in French or with a French accent.  Rathbone is as assured as ever and is very comfortable in the role.  As reliable as ever Bruce is an expert at playing the blustering side kick Watson and he is given plenty of humorous moments throughout the film  a drunken moment in the local tavern and a good reoccurring interaction with the bog!  Cavanagh does a good job in support  the tension between him and Holmes feels very real and adds real spice to the drama.  The rest of the support is good with colourful characters and a little cutie in the shape of Harding.Overall this is a solid little thriller  a real good atmosphere of mystery to it and the bogs are filmed with a real sense of tension that only Watson manages to break up with light touches!  The feeling of loss and tension between the characters are very well brought through and make for a nice addition to the relationships. The lack of a real masterful villain is always an issue but with so much good here that is a minor complaint.".

As a story I guess it resembles The Hound of The Baskervilles in deed its even referenced. However the story is so clever full of intrigue and full of twists. The scenes on the marshlands look wonderfully creepy and eerie and the accompanying music works very well. It is remarkable to realise that this is now over seventy years old they knew how to sell a story then! Great performances as always in these films our two lead actors are on top form but it's Gerald Hamer who'd appeared in a few of the films who steals the show. The best bit for me has to be Nora's murdering the judge its a very creepy scene. The accents are a little messy apart from the odd 'monsieur' we could easily have been in Britain. All in all this is a fantastic film one I truly love watching. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoy films from a series in which casual references are made to stories that went before. The Charlie Chan flicks of the same era used to do it all the time. In this one Dr. Watson compares the current mystery to the one encountered in The Hound of the Baskervilles all the more interesting because that film was made at competing studio Twentieth Century Fox. There was also that reference to author G.K. Chesterton's mystery stories and his fascination with the occult.Of the postFox movies there were only two this is by far the best I've encountered certainly more entertaining than the first three Universal films which had Holmes Basil Rathbone dealing with Nazi agents. The atmosphere is established right from the beginning with a great image of a fog enshrouded landscape the location of the drama taking place in the small Canadian town of La Morte Rouge ominously translated as 'The Red Death'. Holmes and his assistant Watson Nigel Bruce are drawn into a murder investigation by virtue of a letter he receives from a woman who's found dead after it was posted.The plot intriguingly involves the use of disguises not only by Holmes but the resourceful murderer who is revealed via some clever writing and the film director's sleight of hand. On the way to solving the mystery Watson's role as an 'inconspicuous' guest at the Journet Caf Hotel adds just the right comedic counterbalance to the story but it's probably best not to try to follow that whole 'hoots and honks' conversation with butler Drake Ian Wolfe. Once was enough for me.There's one scene I did question though. Why would Holmes immediately begin shooting at the phosphorescent 'ghost' on his midnight stroll through the swamp? Granted there was a logical connection to be made regarding similar sightings preceding the murders of livestock and Lady Penrose but what if there was some other explanation? Holmes could have shot an innocent person. I thought he quite literally jumped the gun on that one.Otherwise Holmes' brilliant deductive reasoning is played out quite credibly in a fairly tense finale. The picture closes in similar fashion to those I've seen from the earlier Universal stories whereby Holmes invokes Winston Churchill's admiration of the bond between Canada America and the British Empire. A half century later some may find it a bit heavy handed but at the same time it's a constructive reminder that tradition has some value in a current world turned upside down.".

	schema:reviewBody "The theatrical film series of Sherlock Holmes continues with Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce Doctor Watson starring in THE SCARLET CLAW Universal 1944 as produced and directed by Roy William Neil. For this sixth installment for the studio it basis its characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle rather than resorting to stories taken from any one of his many novels. Acquiring an original story by Paul Granglin and Brenda Weisburg certainly was a welcome change in this modernized series yet intentionally or not has more of Doyle's 1890s period setting feel to it resulting to the best if not one of the best of this UniversalHolmes entries.Though none of the 14film RathboneBruce Sherlock Holmes franchise never resorted to remaking itself from its earlier works THE SCARLET CLAW comes close to being Universal's own contribution to RathboneBruce's introductory roles from THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES 20th CenturyFox 1939. In fact there's one scene where Bruce's Watson briefly brings up in conversation one of the earlier cases being The Hound of the Baskervilles. The intention obviously was there using fogdrenched marshes moody set pieces and assortment of suspicious looking characters as sheer reminders. With no hounds involved there's enough anticipation of fear in the dark by some murderous monster for added suspense. This time the locale of Canada is used in place over Holmes' homeland of London England. Very much a Universal product known mostly for its horror film genre one would expect this mixed bag of horror mystery to have Holmes and Watson coming face to face with a werewolf or Frankenstein monster. Comics Abbott and Costello would take care of that later in the decade. In true essence to the Doyle character and Universal as well Holmes does encounter some strange admiration forming great admiration for followers of this series.A brief prologue opens in a small French village of La Morte Rouge The Red Death outside of Quebec Canada where at Journet's Tavern townspeople gather together talking about a ghostlike glowing image roaming about at night connected with a series of brutal murders involving a clawlike weapon tearing the throats of its victims. In attendance at the bar include the hotel proprietor Emile Journet Arthur Hohl his young daughter Marie Kay Harding Potts Gerald Hamer the postman and Father Pierre George Kirby. Due to the unforeseen late night bell ringing at a nearby church Father Pierre goes to investigate only to find the body of Lady Lillian Gentry Penrose Gertrude Astor with her hands clutching the bell rope. Word reaches her husband Lord William Paul Cavanaugh addressing a meeting for the Royal Canadian Occult Society at a Quebec hotel meeting room with Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone and assistant Doctor John H. Watson Nigel Bruce in attendance. Because Lord Penrose associates the ghastly murders with the supernatural Holmes believes otherwise. Later that night after receiving a letter for help from the late Lady Penrose Holmes postpones his return to England to assist Sergeant Thompson David Clyde with the investigation. As Watson remains at the tavern to mingle with the guests while keeping an eye on a prime suspect Holmes risks his own life roaming through the foggy marshes alone races against time to prevent the murder of a frightened Judge Brisson Miles Mander living a reclusive lifestyle with his mysterious maid Nora Victoria Horne before finding evidence leading to the unmasking of the phantom monster.Running ten minutes longer than the usual standard 65 minutes THE SCARLET CLAW strictly a second feature B product is pure A murder mystery material with entire cast in fine form. With Gerald Hamer Miles Mander Ian Wolfe and Arthur Hohl as repeat cast members all assuming different roles from earlier to latter Holmes installments missing this time around are series regulars Mary Gordon Mrs. Hudson and Dennis Hoey Inspector Lestrade. Regardless of any similarities between this and THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES THE SCARLET CLAW is firstrate entertainment throughout right up to Watson's runon gag falling into a hole in the marshes. Be aware this being a motion picture release during World War II era audiences would get to listen to the master detective as he did in SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON 1943 recite a passage from a speech by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Distributed to home video in the 1990s later DVD in 2006 THE SCARLET CLAW formerly part of Sherlock Holmes Theater on broadcast television turns up occasionally on various cable stations notably Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere December 26 2009 with its restored print taken from the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Next installment THE PEARL OF DEATH 1944 another creepy tale where Holmes and Watson meet another mysterious image known as The Creeper. ".

However Holmes and Dr. Watson Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce commit to avenging Lady Penrose's death by unveiling her murderer a dastardly serial killer who uses a toothed gardening trowel as his weapon of choice.The mysterious aristocrat played by the amazing Paul Cavanaugh wants Holmes off the case but of course Holmes ignores the man's veiled threats and persists in his inquiries. Soon another murder sets Holmes and Watson to redouble their efforts before further disasters follow which they do.In this film we get a little reincarnation of The Hound as Holmes and Watson track their shrewd nemesis into the nearby swamps where this killer lurks like a phosphorescent apparition. But of course Holmes has been this route before! The movie is a filmnoir moreso than previous RathboneBruce entries due to one particular murder in the story can't say which one because it's a SPOILER! which makes this particular killer all that much more of a rotten scoundrel. Viewers will also note that the cast is bulging with crusty old curmudgeons perhaps the most profound and the best ever cast of any in this renowned film series.I have my favorites in the RathboneBruce Sherlock Holmes series of films I'm really hot on Sherlock Holmes Faces Death but I have to say that this entry certainly upholds the excellence for which these great old black and white British mysteries are known.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a major work of cinema. It might not be well known but this film ranks with Fellini's La Strada De Sica's The Bicycle Thief or Mrinal Sen's Oka Oori Katha based on Premchand's storyCoffin. Why is it a major work? A UCLA graduate makes a film far removed from Hollywood approaches to cinema in Iran during the Shah's regime. The film was made 10 years before Shah quit Iran and was promptly banned. It was smuggled out of Iran to be shown at the Venice Film Festival to win an award even without subtitles.The film does not require subtitles. It's visual. It's simple. The story is set in a remote Iranian village where owning a cow for subsistence is a sign of prosperity. The barren landscape true of a large part of Iran reminds you of Grigory Kozintsev's film landscapes as in Korol Lir the Russian King Lear where the landscape becomes a character of the story.The sudden unnatural death of the cow unsettles the village. Hassan the owner of the cow who nursed it as his own child is away and would be shocked on his return. Eslam the smartest among the villagers devise a plan to bury the cow and not tell the poor man the truth. Hassan returns home and is soon so shocked that he loses his senses. He first imagines that the cow is still there and ultimately his sickness deteriorates as he imagines himself to be the cow eats hay and says Hassan his master will protect him from marauding Bolouris bandits from another village. Eslam realizes that Hassan needs medical attention and decides to take him to the nearest hospital. He is dragged out like a cow. Hassan is beaten as an animal as he is not cooperative to the shock of some humanistic villagers. The demented Hassan with the force of an animal breaks free to seek his only freedom from realitydeath.The film stuns you. Forget Iran forget the cow. Replace the scenario with any person close to his earthly possessions and what happens when that person is suddenly deprived of them and you will get inside the characters as Fellini De Sica or Sen demonstrated in their cinema.Every frame of the film is carefully chosen. The realism afforded by the story will grip any sensitive viewer. There is a visually arresting use of a small window in the wall of the cowshed through which the villagers watch the goings on within the cowshed. The directors use of the window serves two purposesit gives the villagers a perspective of the cowshed and the viewer a perspective of the cowshed watchers.The film is also a great essay on the effects of hiding truth from society and the cascading fallouts of such actions.But there is more. Director Mehrjui affords layers of meaning to his simplistic cinema. There is veiled criticism of blind aspects religious rituals Shia Islam a critical look of stupid villagers dealing with their village idiots the jealous neighbors the indifferent neighbors the village thiefall elements of life around us not limited to a village in Iran. The political layering is not merely limited to the poverty but the politics of hiding truth and the long term effect it has on society. Ironically there are values among the poorest of the poorthe hide of a poisoned? animal cannot be sold!I was lucky to catch up with the rare screening of this film at the ongoing International Film Festival of Kerala India that devoted a retrospective section of early Iranian cinema.This is a film that should make Iran proud. It is truly a gift to world cinema.".

The film follows Hassan an Irani peasant who owns the only cow in his village. The tight frames and slow pacing reveals a special relationship between Hassan and his cow. Which creates an especial pressing moral dilemma for the town when they discover the cow dead while Hassan is away. What follows is a dark harrowing vision of the depths of the human psyche and man's dependency on nature for survival. Shot in harsh black and white it takes on the luscious countryside of Iran and the strength of community and the fallibility of human kindness.

The film was smuggled out of Iran in 1970 and subsequently won critics choice at the Venice Film Festival.The Cow originating from a novel by Iranian author GholamHossein Saedi portrays the obsession loss of faith and demise of a poor rural village that loose their single salable commodity  a cow. Hassan played by Ezatollah Entezami who received best actor at the Chicago Film Festival has a face that vividly captures his physical and emotional change after a breakdown when he becomes the cow. Mehrjui uses theater actors with compelling faces as key elements in the cinematography Feridun Ghovanlu as did the Italian Neorealist.The film explores the looming fear of a foreign invader as the villagers come to believe Hassan in his cowlike state will be captured in crossborder raids from rival tribes. Politically this is reminiscent of the Shah's constant allusions to the neighboring Arab threat over oil. While set in traditional rural Iran Mehrjui shows an alternative view of Iran where collective fear and poverty can cycle in hopeless desperation.

	schema:headline " Surreal";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about as far as one can get from Hollywood blockbusters. Its about a cow. About a cow and a very loving owner. And what happens to them ultimately. There's melancholy and madness in the tragic ending. But the movie also scales new heights in the bonding between human and animals in this case a cow. The camera has been used is a surreal way. Shadows and people mix creating a spookiness which adds to the oddity of the general environment depicted. There's very palpable tension in the movie created by the elements related to the cow and the three shadowy thieves who perhaps symbolize lawlessness.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is about as far as one can get from Hollywood blockbusters. Its about a cow. About a cow and a very loving owner. And what happens to them ultimately. There's melancholy and madness in the tragic ending. But the movie also scales new heights in the bonding between human and animals in this case a cow. The camera has been used is a surreal way. Shadows and people mix creating a spookiness which adds to the oddity of the general environment depicted. There's very palpable tension in the movie created by the elements related to the cow and the three shadowy thieves who perhaps symbolize lawlessness. What also struck me was the looming silence of the black burkahclad women and occasion glimpses of their crinkly faces. All very surreal. There are some very interesting personalities which come alive through the script other than the cow of course!";

Well obviously. A man who believes that he is no more himself but his cow that's madness on all accounts.Madness? Hassan was living in his own universe ignoring the real world. But here's the point Hassan had always lived in his own universe  he and his cow. A whole system of memories events lived together. Natural phenomenons lived together and having a particular significance for them a whole system of codes and signals. Was it full moon? It meant the cow was thirsty.This universe could not disappear once the cow was no more. The memories were still in place. The codes and signals were still in place. Was it full moon? It meant the cow was still thirsty.So Hassan was just defending now this universe of him only his universe was no more fit with the world. Hence the madness.Usually when the beloved one is no more the survivor is tempted to imagine that the other is still somewhere not far. You go to the cemetery and speak to your beloved one who is buried there. Hassan was trying something more forceful to imagine that he Hassan was somewhere not far and that the cow was here in his body instead of him! I know how it sounds but it was Hassan's way to keep his universe.Meanwhile life was going on in this village. A bunch of clay houses surrounding a small dirty pool. Old men chatting at some kind of a tea house old women attending silently the daily events and waiting for the outcome the village idiot tortured by kids for mere distraction the nightly incursions of neighboring villagers just a small closed universe around a small dirty pond.Faced with the sudden madness of Hassan the community comes to help with great kindness and patience to discover that help is sometimes useless and that kindness and patience have narrow limits.A tragic ballade telling us that some things happen just because that's their way to happen and nobody could change anything.".

The plot is simple and it seems to show the mental decline of Hassan and the village's collective inability to deal with that within the confines of daily life. In painting a realistic picture of village life the film was shot using a mix of actors and real villagers the film maintains an interesting setting even if the development is rather slow and unsatisfying. It requires you to think of course but I didn't think I had the knowledge to really appreciate it and I suspect that many other viewers will struggle for the same reason.The stark direction is good but I'm not sure if it suited the material as I would have preferred a washed out colour to compliment the sentiment in the film. It worked though and the performances are mainly good  Entezami in particular convincing in his slide into instability. Worth seeing because of its stature within Iranian cinema then but perhaps you need a greater understanding of the culture than I if you are to take more from it.

Basically in a remote and desolate village middleaged villager Masht Hassan Ezzatolah Entezami has a close relationship with his cow the only one in the village Hassan is married but has no children. When Hassan goes away for a short time the villagers look after his beloved and pregnant cow but they find it dead. Knowing how much Hassan cherishes the cow the villagers fear his reaction when he returns so they decide to cover up the death and dispose of the corpse. When Hassan returns they have covered up all evidence of the death and they lie to him telling him that the cow ran away. Hassan is unconvinced that his cow would ever run away he is devastated and finds great difficulty in confronting by his loss and the loss of livestock affects his social stature in the village. Hassan starts to spend more time in the barn his grieving pushes him over the edge and he has a nervous breakdown. Hassan goes insane and has developed boanthropy a psychological disorder in which he believes himself to be a bovine in other words he believes he is the cow. Hassan has incorporated many cowlike mannerisms including walking on his hands and knees and eating hay and the villagers cannot snap him out of it. In the end his wife Mahin Shahabi and the villagers try a drastic method to cure his insanity tie him up and drag him up a hill it ends in tragedy when he runs away and he falls to his death. Also starring Jamshid Mashayekhi as Abbas Ali Nassirian as Islam Khosrow Shojazadeh as Boy and Jafar Vali as Kadkhoda. I can see why this is considered an influential film apparently it was banned as well it is a very simple story with themes of poverty superstition and paranoia it is both strange and fascinating to watch a terrific drama.

The United States the United Kingdom and their respective corporate cartels stage a coup and successfully overthrow the democratically elected government of Iran specifically Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh who was set to nationalise local oil. Enter Mohammed Reza Pahlavi your classic dictatorial Western puppet leader. He's a full blown oil pimp. His people hate him but the West love him. He rules as Shah of Iran until 1979 at which point he is overthrown by a local revolution led by the religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The rise of Khomeini is presented as a populist and spontaneous uprising but Khomeini was backed by both the US and UK with the specific aim of ousting Pahlavi a one time puppet who like Saddam Hussein had grown too big for his boots. Prior to his ousting Pahlavi had begun to flex his muscles refusing to sign away exclusive oil rights and beginning a programme to seek oilsales policy independence. The oil barons and superpowers don't like this. They stage another illegal coup. Not wanting leftwing democrats taking over from the Shah the CIA began courting the Muslim Brotherhood and the Ayatollahs all essentially religious fundamentalists. These clandestine operations echo CIA orchestrated coups against democratically elected officials in Guatemala Venezuela Nicaragua Cuba etc etc see Alex Cox's Walker most of whom were trying to institute land reforms nationalise resources or help bridge the gaps between the peasantry and landowners. Can't have that.Shortly prior to the toppling of Reza Pahlavi a soft war was waged against Iran. The West refused to buy Iranian oil began a campaign of economic pressure planted covert agitators to fan religious discontent put embargoes in place staged oil and banking strikes and began cynically protesting the presence of Iranian abuses of human rights. Meanwhile Ayatollah Khomeini who was being groomed to be the new leader of Iran began appearing on news networks which willingly gave voice to his propaganda. The message was clear AngloAmerican intelligence was committed to toppling their puppet. The Shah fled in January and by February 1979 Khomeini had been flown into Iran to replace the Shah's government and proclaim the establishment of his own repressive theocratic state. Almost immediately the US then began funding Iraq's decade long war against Iran.Over the years leaks and whistleblowing would reveal the point of the Iranian fiasco the radical Muslim Brotherhood movement behind Khomeini was endorsed specifically in order to promote the balkanization of the entire Muslim Near East along tribal and religious lines. In encouraging autonomous groups it was hoped that chaos would spread in what was termed an Arc of Crisis which would spill over into Muslim regions of the Soviet Union. Of course such arrangements never go quite to plan but then chaos partially was the plan.Iranian art cinema was born in 1962 with The House is Black a documentary by Farough Farrokhzad which revolved around a leper colony. From here the Iranian New Wave's compassionate neorealist and humanist qualities would spring. Seven years later Dariush Mehrjui's The Cow was released regarded by many as the first true feature film of the Iranian New Wave. The film was funded by the Shah's government but was then quickly banned by the Ministry of Culture presumably because it dared portray the impoverished conditions of rural Iran ironically after brutally oppressing his people the errandboy Shah was granted freedom and citizenship in the United States. In 1971 the film was smuggled to the Venice Film Festival at which point it gained considerable recognition. Thanks largely to its odd and ambiguous plot  which plays well to Western audiences unfamiliar with Iranian culture history and customs  the film raced across the world.The Cow's plot? Dark allegorical mysterious and twisted the story revolves around an Iranian villager played by Ezzatolah Entezami who owns the only cow in his village a village perpetually terrified of thieves and invaders. After a brief absence Ezzatolah returns home to find that his cow has died. This event plunges the man into madness such that he eventually comes to believe that he is himself a cow.The film plays like a cross between Kafka an old folktale and the neorealist movement neorealism is almost like a rite of passage which nations must at one point pass through. Of course those familiar with neorealist works may find little of interest here but The Cow was nevertheless daring in its depiction of rural poverty in a society where the ruling class enjoyed all the fruits of economic growth. With its modernist score and bovine metamorphosis the film also has an unsettling quality particularly in the way it portrays a man whose identity work income life and happiness are so inextricable from his beast of burden his property that its absence instigates an almost immediate and total meltdown. Our hero isn't just close to his one earthly possession he seems to embody it before its absence. Elsewhere the film points fingers at scapegoaters blind religious faith jealousy and the dangers of suppressing truths. Incidentally one of the chief chapters in the Koran is titled The Cow and like this film deals with those who cover up reality and the way denial leads to disease. In that story a cow's death is responsible for deciding who is guilty of a crime. Here it's almost as though Ezzatolah becomes the cow to prevent crimes being forgotten. Unsurprisingly the film was written by GholamHossein Saedi a staunch Marxist. The plot loosely but not necessarily echoes Marx's writings on animallike estranged objectified human labour.Aesthetically Mehrjui stresses flat planes windows squares frames screens and frequently has his characters arranged like we the audience looking in as Ezzatolah's grotesque transformation takes place. The film has a creepy primitive quality like a folk tale reenacted by a gang of centenarians.8.510  Worth one viewing.".

	schema:headline " Interesting yet moribund study of human relationships";
	schema:reviewBody "This simple tale is open to interpretation which can be considered positively or otherwise  it perhaps hearkens back to folk tales which are passed down orally and contain simple plots which are then the basis of discussion. In this way it is easily remembered and its meanings can be deciphered afterwards by those who watch it. However it also means that the film seems overlong for the most part preoccupied with repeating sequences and behaviour again and again and even drawing out the fairly dramatic ending which arguably diminishes its strength. Perhaps it would have been better presented in a shorter runtime or a more heavily stylised manner such as that of the title sequence. Nevertheless regardless of enjoyment there are many threads of discussion that can be considered.One of the key questions raised by the film is that of the mental stability of the protagonist Hassan whose loss of his animal will bring about his somewhat metamorphosis into the same creature. At the start of the film he is seen behaving extremely strangely as he leads his cow back to town exultantly dancing around it as he washes and caresses it. This man is not behaving as the other people such as the children do. Hassan is mirrored somewhat by the town idiot who is berated by the other people and even locked up so as to keep Hassan himself from learning the secret of his cow's death.

	onyx:emotionText "This simple tale is open to interpretation which can be considered positively or otherwise  it perhaps hearkens back to folk tales which are passed down orally and contain simple plots which are then the basis of discussion. In this way it is easily remembered and its meanings can be deciphered afterwards by those who watch it. However it also means that the film seems overlong for the most part preoccupied with repeating sequences and behaviour again and again and even drawing out the fairly dramatic ending which arguably diminishes its strength. Perhaps it would have been better presented in a shorter runtime or a more heavily stylised manner such as that of the title sequence. Nevertheless regardless of enjoyment there are many threads of discussion that can be considered.One of the key questions raised by the film is that of the mental stability of the protagonist Hassan whose loss of his animal will bring about his somewhat metamorphosis into the same creature. At the start of the film he is seen behaving extremely strangely as he leads his cow back to town exultantly dancing around it as he washes and caresses it. This man is not behaving as the other people such as the children do. Hassan is mirrored somewhat by the town idiot who is berated by the other people and even locked up so as to keep Hassan himself from learning the secret of his cow's death. This mirroring and Hassan's transformation make it possible to consider the village's relationship to both Hassan and his cow  certainly throughout neither are treated with respect and the film's end highlights this.Perhaps Mehrjui the film's creator comments on the actual importance of the cow and this man's relationship an idea that is supported by the title of the piece.";

He was pretty effective the first time around but that one didn't have a script as silly as the one he has to contend with here.  Of course scripts never meant much to Frankie anyway.  If the Chairman of the Board WAS bored or just tired he'd rip a few pages out of the script to keep things moving.  When the movie was something like Lady in Cement it probably didn't matter anyway.  Besides with a more stunning than ever Raquel Welch in the cast I mean who really cares?Wherever Ol' Blue Eyes went his entourage of goons and sycophants were sure to follow and one such unfortunate Pat Henry a comedian of little talent is along for the ride as Frank's buddy.  Richard Conte the fine actor from such interesting film noirs as The Blue Gardenia and Cry of the City shows up as he often did in Sinatra films Ocean's 11 Assault on a Queen and provides the mostly mediocre film with his usual competence. The best performance however belongs to TV's Hoss Dan Blocker.".

If the Chairman of the Board WAS bored or just tired he'd rip a few pages out of the script to keep things moving.  When the movie was something like Lady in Cement it probably didn't matter anyway.  Besides with a more stunning than ever Raquel Welch in the cast I mean who really cares?Wherever Ol' Blue Eyes went his entourage of goons and sycophants were sure to follow and one such unfortunate Pat Henry a comedian of little talent is along for the ride as Frank's buddy.  Richard Conte the fine actor from such interesting film noirs as The Blue Gardenia and Cry of the City shows up as he often did in Sinatra films Ocean's 11 Assault on a Queen and provides the mostly mediocre film with his usual competence. The best performance however belongs to TV's Hoss Dan Blocker.";

The mystery this time around is more clearcut because it starts off with a body the titular figure eventually the hero once again played by Frank Sinatra himself is incriminated  leading to him falling out with his cop friend Richard Conte! The female roles aren't as effective however Lainie Kazan makes a good impression as a gogo dancer but despite her high billing is restricted to just one sequence! as for leading lady Raquel Welch she's okay but no match for Jill St. John from the original the script relies a bit too much on Welch's glamorous presence alone to carry the role  and there isn't even that much chemistry between her and Sinatra! With this in mind the star strikes up an unlikely alliance throughout with beefy and imposing Dan Blocker from the Western TV series Bonanza  which gives a humorous vein to the generally hardboiled proceedings and immediately reminds one of the Philip MarloweMoose Malloy partnership in MURDER MY SWEET aka FAREWELL MY LOVELY 1944.Again most of the suspects in the case are unsavory characters  from former mobsters now ostensibly leading a respectable life to homosexuals remnants perhaps from Sinatra's previous collaboration with director Douglas THE DETECTIVE 1968. Incidentally while the mystery in the original led to an unexpected revelation the clues here point to either Welch or Blocker but  predictably  the identity of the real culprit is much more obvious for what it's worth the script was cowritten by Marvin H. Albert who created the Tony Rome character in the first place on the written page! Miami  in all its aspects  still acts as an alluring yet dangerous backdrop to the sex and violence going on however Rome even gets to fight the inhabitants of the ocean as a number of sharks are attracted to the 'lady in cement' in the opening sequence! Similarly the bouncy score supplied by Hugo Montenegro emerges to be a definite plus. One final thing apparently Joe E. Lewis  the singerturnedcomedian played by none other than Sinatra in THE JOKER IS WILD 1957  puts in an appearance here as himself!".

Of course in a rather long chase sequence toward the end of the film Frank does get the better of Conte and half the Miami PD. In order to appreciate Lady In Cement and Tony Rome you have to really dig Sinatra's whole hipster Rat Pack shtick from the times. If you don't both films will leave you cold.

After the Stonewall Rebellion a lot of establishment figures even in the entertainment world mocked the movement and Frank Sinatra was no exception. Interesting because in The Detective Sinatra played a detective who got a coerced confession of a gay suspect in the murder of a gay man and then when evidence showed New York had executed the wrong man took it upon himself to get justice applied rightly.A few in jokes for wannabe swingers abound in Lady In Cement the strip club where the deceased woman worked was called Jilly's after Sinatra favorite eatery in New York. And at one point Frank remarks to leading lady Raquel Welch that he 'once knew a broad who collected bull fighters' a reference to former Mrs. Sinatra Ava Gardner. I've got to wonder what Ava must have thought of that. Even more important how did Richard Deacon who was a closeted gay man and had a small part in the film must have felt about some of Sinatra's lines in the script?Still the smarmy lisps of mockery really have made Lady In Cement not wear well over the years.

Its an enjoyable 93 minutes certainly the laughs and the fun nature keep you watching unfortunately you really do wish that there was some weight to the proceedings. The mystery has no real urgency and no real need to be solved other than it puts Rome in motion. Many of the actors Sinatra included seem to be walking through the film and Raquel Welch seems unable to even do that. Of course then there is Dan Blocker as Gronsky the man who hires Sinatra and who is much more trouble than he's worth. Blocker is a real joy to behold and if there is any real reason to see this film its him and his performance its a blast.

I'll just say that Lady in Cement is well paced with very few dull moments. Other than a handful of really seedy looking locations it's a harmless enough way to spend an hour and a half. To be as light as much of it is however there are a few nice twists and turns along the way. In fact the identity of one of the killers really caught me offguard. Sinatra may be the star but he's not the attraction here for me. Instead Dan Blocker and Raquel Welch are the films highlights  and in two very different ways. Blocker is very entertaining as the huge behemoth of a man Waldo Gronsky. And Raquel is equally entertaining in her own way as wealthy socialite Kit Forrest. Finally as with Tony Rome I get a real kick out of the shots of a mid60s Miami. Forty years later it looks almost like a foreign country. I suppose the thing that bothers me the most about Lady in Cement is the amount of lame comedy found in the script although the scene with Blocker watching Bonanza on television made me laugh out loud for some reason. You'll find comedy in Tony Rome but I don't remember this much. The worst is the overthetop gaybating that Sinatra tries to use as humor.

As you'd expect since this is a cheesy detective movie from 1968 there's lots of bikiniclad broads naked broads oneliners that will either make you chuckle or groan fight scenes full of humor and a musical score that couldn't have been more 60s if it tried. If that's not what you're looking for you'll probably sigh and complain for 90 minutes but if you liked Tony Rome you'll love seeing Frankie do it all over again in Lady in Cement.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film sees the return of Miami private investigator Tony Rome. As the story opens he is scuba diving at a site that a friend assures him is the final resting place of a number of Spanish galleons he doesn't find and wrecks just a naked blonde with her feet set in a concrete block! Soon afterwards he is hired by a large man named Waldo Gronsky to find a blonde named Sandra who he assures him is not the one he found earlier. The last place Sandra was seen was the house of Kit Forrest a wealthy and attractive young widow. She had been throwing a party but didn't recall if Sandra was actually there as she had been drinking. She doesn't really want to talk so calls her neighbour retired gangster Al Mungar. His investigation takes him to a gogo club where the manager is murdered shortly afterwards leading to the police wanting to arrest Tony for murder! If he is to clear his name he will have to stay a step ahead of the police and solve the case he was paid for.Frank Sinatra returns for a second and sadly final time as Tony Rome. He does a fine job as this likable detective cool but not too cool. The case is interesting and provides several potential suspects including Kit Forrest Gronsky and Mungar as well as more victims. For the most part the movie still feels fresh with its bright Miami locations and cool '60s feel but in other ways it has dated most notably portrayal and treatment of homosexual characters including by the protagonist something that almost certainly wouldn't be accepted in a modern film. The secondary cast are solid enough Raquel Welch is fine as Kit Forrest her introduction where she exits a pools wearing a bikini is certainly impressive! Unfortunately she isn't quite as good a female lead as Jill St.John was in the first 'Tony Rome' film she was sexy but lacked a certain something. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting some '60s fun if you liked the first Tony Rome film you should enjoy this too.".

	schema:reviewBody "The second and last Tony Rome film Lady In Cement was released in 1968. Its bright colours perky background music and slang terms like fuzz and split etc. are typical of the period but there are also some features which aren't. The practice of murder victims being anchored underwater in cement shoes was prevalent in the 1920s and 1930s and the movie also draws influences from the films noir of the 1940s and 1950s. For example the sequence in which the lady in cement is found by Rome strongly evokes an underwater sequence in The Night Of The Hunter 1955 and a character called Gronsky is identical to Moose Malloy from Raymond Chandler's Murder My Sweet 1944. A scene in which Frank Sinatra gazes at a large portrait of Raquel Welch's character is also a conscious replication of a motif which was frequently seen in the noirs of the 40s and 50s.In this movie Tony Rome is a typical noir private detective working on a missing person case that involves murder and gangsters but also shows certain characteristics of James Bond e.g. fighting off a shark being surrounded by semiclad young ladies etc.. The incongruities highlighted above could be regarded as disconcerting but in this movie seem to have been used purely for laughs.Private eye Tony Rome Frank Sinatra is scubadiving somewhere off the Miami coast at a location where some Spanish treasure had reputedly been lost many years earlier when he sees the nude corpse of a blonde woman whose feet had been set in cement. Shortly after reporting the incident to the coastguard he gets approached by a hulk of a man called Waldo Gronsky Dan Blocker who hires him to find his lost girlfriend Sandra Lomax. Rome's investigations take him to the gogo bar where Sandra used to work as a dancer and he speaks to her roommate and gets a hostile reception from the camp owner Danny Yale Frank Raiter and his bartender boyfriend.Having learned from her roommate that Sandra had been at a party at the home of Kit Forrest Raquel Welch on the night when she died Rome goes to visit the alcoholic heiress who tells him that she can't remember much about the night in question. Shortly after Rome has to make a quick exit after being threatened by her protective neighbour and exmobster Al Mungar Martin Gabel. After Sandra's roommate is found dead and a couple of thugs try to kill Gronsky Rome gets into a whole series of tight spots including being framed for the murder of Danny Yale before he eventually brings his investigation to a successful conclusion.Despite the nature of its plot Lady In Cement is essentially a lighthearted confection which enables Sinatra to indulge in numerous injokes and have fun with women who are half his age. He does well in conveying how jaded Rome has become and is also good at delivering some snappy oneliners. Among the supporting cast Dan Blocker makes the strongest impression as the largerthanlife Gronsky. The emphasis in this movie is very much on the humour and judged on this basis it clearly succeeded.".

	schema:reviewBody "TITLE Lady in Cement was released in New York City on November 20 1968. Lady In Cement is a 1968 detective film directed by Gordon Douglas and starring Frank Sinatra Raquel Welch Dan Blocker Martin Gabel and Richard Conte. A sequel to the 1967 film Tony Rome and based on the novel by Marvin H. Albert Lady In Cement was released on November 20th 1968.Summary It's a warm sunny day in Miami and Tony and a Buddy of his are on Tony's boat out in the middle of nowhere looking for treasure. Tony loses at poker so he's the one that has to put on the scuba diving gear and has to go in the water to look for the treasure.

When she walks up the ladder out of the swimming pool in that   it just made you want to melt. You can never get enough of Raquel and she played a lot bigger role in this film then in the last one she was in. I give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first is because the action in this movie keeps you on the edge of your sit trying to figure out how this movie is going to finish. The second reason and the main because of Raquel Welch. Raquel brings out the best of any movie she's stars in with her body and she's a great actress.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is quite an amazing film to watch. Using digital technology the director Rohmer has literally encrusted his living actors into painted backdrops. Most of the time this works brilliantly especially at the start where the film is like a pop up story book come to life. It is less successful in a few scenes where it limits camera angles they had not painted the side of some of the buildings for example but it is a very interesting way to film a historical film which is as much about our own misconceptions and limited views of history as History itself. It is narrated using the memoirs of the Duc d'Orleans' ex mistress Grace Elliott. So an event usually claimed as one of their own by Marxist historians especially in France is here told from the point of view of a female aristocratic foreigner. Inevitably a different point of view emerges there can be no objective representation. The use of the memoirs device does give the film a rather episodic quality. Personally I found the story line around the King's death the most interesting. A staunch Royalist she is shocked when the Duc votes for the King's death a basic knowledge of the French Revolution is probably helpful to follow the dialogue between Grace and the Duc here. He was Louis's cousin and had himself elected to the Assembly where he promptly changed his name to Philip Equality. The filming of Louis's death is masterly. Grace and her maidservant are in Meudon out of Paris watching from a hill with a telescope. We do not see the execution we only hear the maid's commentary like Grace. The most dramatic event of the Revolution happens off screen. Grace cannot bear to watch her king be killed. Her view is that of an aristocrat. Any justification of Louis's death is literally beyond her vision. This is powerful keenly intelligent film making. The love story between the duc and Grace is insinuated never told and is powerfully moving tho the Duc does seem a bit of a pompous fool at times what does she see in him? No accounting for taste. The undercurrents of madness simply existing being enough to be a suspect that sweep individuals along in a time such as the Revolution are illustrated as Grace's life is turned upside down her house is searched daily yet she still orders her servants to cook her food and is incapable of dressing herself! If you have any interest at all in a subtle well told film making clever use of new technology to tell an old tale or the representation of a pivotal moment in Europe's history narrated by an aristocratic foreign woman its ultimate outsider then this is well worth your time. It is a little slow in places but your patience is amply rewarded.".

As played by Lucy Russell Grace is an unwavering royalist who goes on living her gentlewoman's lifestyle in and around Paris regardless of the dangers which are considerable for someone like her. She has no sympathy with the revolutionaries and is horrified by the execution of Louis and his Queen which she observes from afar.Having once walked out of an Eric Rohmer movie Clair's Knee' rather than die of boredom my expectations were not high. This movie taken from Graces' memoirs is mostly talk   gentlewomen did not after all engage in much action  but she does harbour an aristocratic fugitive at one point to the Duke's dismay. Grace's relationship with her exlover the portly and rather pompous Duke JeanClaude Dreyfus is an intriguing one. She is not able to exercise much influence over him not because of any lack of persuasive powers but because he is too weak and irresolute to follow her advice. As a foreign woman living alone she was widowed a year or two previously she needs a powerful friend or two but the Duke for all his courtly manner isn't a lot of help. The cast weave in and out of stylised and digitised backdrops and this production style fits in well with the historical setting. The sets are intended to be seen as backdrops unlike say the Coliseum scene in Gladiator'. This has the effect of focusing the audience on the actors rather than be distracted by the set. It was brave of Rohmer to adopt such an innovative format but it works well here. There are a few dramatic moments such as when Grace is hauled before the local revolutionary committee on suspicion of spying for Britain naturally the most handsome revolutionary takes her side. It is however basically a talk show what I did in the revolution I hated' and often rather slow. Lucy Russell though is quite compelling as Grace and this time at least I was not driven from the theatre.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this film quite fascinating apart from the fact that it is a well acted structured story. Set in revolutionary France it tells the struggles of a Scottish emigre royalist and her life during the revolution and her somewhat complicated relationship with a former lover a aristocratic Duke with revolutionary sympathies. Despite being a revolutionary politician the Duke is eventually consumed too by the revolution.The film is fascinating on several levels. The relationship between the Lady and the Duke is at some levels a doomed love story. They are interestingly former not current lovers but continue to have fond if not strong regard for each other despite differing political viewpoints and comprimised actions during the ups and downs of the revolution  I found it interesting watching the strains placed on this relationship by the buffeting of historical events. I think this relationship is at the core of the film. Though I did enjoy the political side of the film. It is somewhat refreshing to see a historical epic from the  side of the losers the despised aristocracy. Rohmer resists the obvious counter point in the film of the film in showing a sideviewpoint of the poor majority. Maybe he assumed that most film goers would be aware of the socialpoliticaleconomic conditions that lead to the revolution. Whatever the reason I think the film is stronger for it because we see the events through the eyes of the Lady and the fear and terror of the Royalists and moderate revolutionaries ultimately consumed by the more extreme fires of radicalism. The victims are shown as human beings and not some carictures.Having said that I enjoyed some of the ambiguities of the film. The aristocrat the lady helps is someone she held no particular high regard for in the Royalist days and indeed first helps him only out of a sense of duty. Even Robiespierre the radical is shown briefly in the film. Instead of some frothing of the mouth caricture he is shown as a focused almost reasonable type. He stops one of his underlings arresting the Lady at a revolutionary tribunal saying the revolution has more important things to worry about. I think possibly these interesting ambiguities arise from the fact the story is based on the actual experiences of the Scottish Lady who transcribed them after her eventual escape to Britain after the revolution.Finally a commendation to the two actors the Lady and the Duke who I really enjoyed. The Duke was particulary goodhe was the right mixture of idealistcharmer and self important but endearing pomposity and you can see why despite all his faults the Lady was still hung up on him.".

Set in revolutionary France it tells the struggles of a Scottish emigre royalist and her life during the revolution and her somewhat complicated relationship with a former lover a aristocratic Duke with revolutionary sympathies. Despite being a revolutionary politician the Duke is eventually consumed too by the revolution.The film is fascinating on several levels. The relationship between the Lady and the Duke is at some levels a doomed love story. They are interestingly former not current lovers but continue to have fond if not strong regard for each other despite differing political viewpoints and comprimised actions during the ups and downs of the revolution  I found it interesting watching the strains placed on this relationship by the buffeting of historical events. I think this relationship is at the core of the film. Though I did enjoy the political side of the film. It is somewhat refreshing to see a historical epic from the  side of the losers the despised aristocracy. Rohmer resists the obvious counter point in the film of the film in showing a sideviewpoint of the poor majority. Maybe he assumed that most film goers would be aware of the socialpoliticaleconomic conditions that lead to the revolution. Whatever the reason I think the film is stronger for it because we see the events through the eyes of the Lady and the fear and terror of the Royalists and moderate revolutionaries ultimately consumed by the more extreme fires of radicalism. The victims are shown as human beings and not some carictures.Having said that I enjoyed some of the ambiguities of the film. The aristocrat the lady helps is someone she held no particular high regard for in the Royalist days and indeed first helps him only out of a sense of duty. Even Robiespierre the radical is shown briefly in the film. Instead of some frothing of the mouth caricture he is shown as a focused almost reasonable type. He stops one of his underlings arresting the Lady at a revolutionary tribunal saying the revolution has more important things to worry about. I think possibly these interesting ambiguities arise from the fact the story is based on the actual experiences of the Scottish Lady who transcribed them after her eventual escape to Britain after the revolution.Finally a commendation to the two actors the Lady and the Duke who I really enjoyed. The Duke was particulary goodhe was the right mixture of idealistcharmer and self important but endearing pomposity and you can see why despite all his faults the Lady was still hung up on him.";

Her French seems to be excellent as it appears she is fluent in it. As the Duc d'Orleans Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution making us believe he is the nobleman himself without any effort. The supporting cast also was great.

However Rohmer's computerenhanced tableaux of revolutionary Paris by contrast effectively evoke period art. Indeed they are filmed engravings. Do they work?

The growing terror of the revolution is Rohmer's chief concern. In this film it is palpable and fearsome and evokes some of the totalitarianisms of the 20th century.

	schema:reviewBody "This film from Eric Rohmer is very very unusual. While it's not unusual to use matte paintings to create effects such as to paint in buildings in the background to cover up modern skyscrapers for period films here Rohmer uses another techniqueone I have never seen before in a fulllength film. The movie makes no attempt to blend in what is real and what isn't. Instead in many scenes you have folks walking within giant paintings which appear to have been painted during the 18th centurywhen the film was to have occurred. It is VERY striking and very unusualand you can't help but notice it.The story is an essentially true story about a woman named Grace Elliotta very very interesting lady. She was the mistress of the future King George IV of Britain and after giving birth to an illegitimate child she left to live in France. There she became the mistress of the King of France's cousin the Duke of Orleans. However the timing for all this was very poor. That's because a few years later the French Revolution arrivedand her now exlover the Duke begs her to leave the country. She insists she's safe and time passes. And as time passes the country becomes more paranoid and more selfdestructivekilling off aristocrats and foreigners in the wake of a now insane revolution.At this point in time the Duke and Elliott have changed. Now the liberalminded Duke has embraced the Revolution and is an official in its new government. She on the other hand is a diehard royalist who really should keep her opinions to herself. Yet despite their different paths they remained friendsthough there was a lot of tension between them as the Duke eventually consented to the execution of the Kingsomething Elliott had a hard time forgiving. What's next for this unusual lady? See for yourself in this excellent film.The film was based in part on the autobiography of Elliottwhich was published after her death. Earlier I said the story is ESSENTIALLY true because I did some reading and found that she had a tendency to sometimes 'embellish' the facts though what's in the film is what occurred. Overall a fascinating look into the insanity of the French Revolution and at a particularly unusual woman. Well worth seeing.".

It's an altogether depressing tale that remains true to the facts of the period and directed with an artistic flourish by Eric Rohmer. The film is also in French with English subtitles which may turn off some potential viewers. Grace Elliott was a highclass courtesan who is most famous for being the mistress of the Duke of Orleans a first cousin of the King of France Louis XVI. Unfortunately for the King and Grace the Duke takes a position on the side of the radical Republicans and votes for Louis' death on the guillotine. The rest of the movie follows Grace as she does her best to avoid the same fate of her remaining Royalist friends. She barely makes it out alive. The Duke isn't so lucky. The Radical Jacobins turn on their own and in the ensuing blood bath the Terror the Duke finds out that what comes around goes around.All things considered The Lady and the Duke is a fine period piece although some might find director Rohmer's technique a bit distracting. In lieu of real scenery he films some scenes with his actors situated directly in front of large paintings of the countryside. It doesn't cheapen the movie in any way but it is a bit excessive and overly ornate. One of his better scenes and where he uses a real location shot is when Ms. Elliott rides through Paris during severe upheaval and outbreaks of horrific violence. The chaos of the times is duly recorded and once again our heroine escapes with her head still on her shoulders.The Lady and the Duke features excellent performances by the two leads Russell as Elliott and JeanClaude Dreyfus as the Duke. The rest of the cast is uniformly good. The film is informative about the events of this tragic age and is worth viewing even if one is not a student of France's Revolution. And no wonder the French turned to Napoleon after the Terror ran its course. Compared to Robespierre Marat and their ilk the Emperor must have seemed like a humanitarian.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background.  At times it works well the scene where Grace and her maid witness from afar the King's execution is particularly striking.  At other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look resembling a home video.  However the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer.  We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters?  To be frank I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke.The other major failing I regret to say is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role.  She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance.  OK she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion.

	onyx:emotionText "Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background.  At times it works well the scene where Grace and her maid witness from afar the King's execution is particularly striking.  At other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look resembling a home video.  However the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer.  We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters?  To be frank I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke.The other major failing I regret to say is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role.  She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance.  OK she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion.  Her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend Mme de Meyler an excellent performance by the debutante Helena Dubiel seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience.

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen a lot of films set during the French Revolution and this odd and tiresome effort by Eric Rohmer is definitely not one of the better ones. I can't help but feel that Rohmer had some grand vision for this movie as recreating the life and vision of some late 18th century aristocrat and he did not entirely succeed.  For starters the film seems less 18th century and more like a late 19th century stage play filmed in the style of an early silent film circa 1915.  One almost expects the actors to begin to gesture wildly and start rolling their eyes.  Character development is nonexistent and the direction with its paucity of camera angles is nothing to write home about.  The actors do the best they can but there is only so much that they can do given the clunky script and direction.  I didn't find the film to be boring exactly... just odd and halfbaked.  The muchballyhooed digital backgrounds add to the air of weird nevernever land detachment to the entire proceedings.All in all this is not the worst movie I've seen but if you really want to get into the mindframe of 18th century nobility then I would highly recommend the 1999 Masterpiece Theater miniseries Aristocrats which is far more entertaining convincing and involving than Lady and the Duke. If you wish to see a great film about the French Revolution then go see La Rvolution Franaise with Jane Seymour and Klaus Maria Brandauer if you can find it or Danton with Gerard Depardieu.  Even the 1938 Marie Antoinette is more interesting than the Rohmer film and Norma Shearer's reaction to the Princesse de Lamballe's head is a great deal more powerful than Lucy Russell's.".

He works with the nature of the telling by focusing on the manner of telling. Here he selects a subject that concerns artifice and abstraction the aristocratic manners with a former mistress and theideals of the French revolution. And he presents them according to his understanding of how artificial and abstract they are.The presentation is shocking. If you haven?t seen it he has flattened all the sets by literally using paintings with people superposed. This is done inside as well where all the walls are flat and have texture painted on them. Doors cupboards also. We are transported to a theatrical world where the actors not only perform for us the characters perform for each other. Very clever notion that reminds us how synthetic ?normal? film is.At the same time we have Rohmer?s constant fixation with how abstract notions interact with reality. Here we have the French revolution. Unlike that which took place in North America the decade before this was pure ideals not at all practicalized. Dr Franklin was appalled. And it was heavy with opportunists and posers. The notion of how things were how they should be how one should comport what constitutes a ?nation? or ?liberty?  all abstractions. Presented in the form of dialog between two people who could not shape it.Sex is the driver here at least of the characters we see. But it is so refined so submerged one completely forgets the moist clutch and replaces it with the unctious glance. It seems to me that Rohmer?s relationship with his actors and the text is slight as it should be allowing him to focus on the space around them. Other filmmakers frame their shots around the principles and a few elements from the environment. Rohmer frames his entirely from the environment which incidentally flattens everything  even without the painting trick.This is the logical extension of Marquis May Rohmer live long enough to go further.Ted?s Evaluation 3 of 4  Worth Watching.IMDB 10".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lady and the Duke is based on a true story and taken directly from the memoirs of Grace Elliott a welltodo Scottish woman who lived in France during the French Revolution.  The film concentrates on her months in Paris during the later years of the revolution 17931794 better known as the Reign of Terror.  Director Eric Rohmer took the unusual and odd step of filming his actors superimposed over 18th Century scenic paintings. Perhaps it was his intention to contrast these inanimate objects with the reallife pain and utter misery of his subjects' existence. Lucy Russell is elegant and believable as Grace Elliott a woman torn between loyalties to an old lover and her former aristocratic way of life. As the Revolution becomes more horrific she sees all her friends who haven't been wise enough to leave France annihilated and begins to wish she had left the country herself.  JeanClaude Dreyfus is also excellent as the Duke of Orleans Grace's former lover who still remains a close friend. Although a royal himself he makes the ruinous decision to vote for the King's death which has disastrous results for both himself and his country. Grace and the Duke's relationship are the centerpiece of the movie juxtaposed against the changing times and the coming doom and radical phase of the Terror.   Director Rohmer's movie is both exquisitely mounted and historically knowledgeable.  He has taken one of history's more volatile times and brought the audience into all the suffering and injustices of that period. Although one might need to know a bit of history regarding the French Revolution beforehand this movie can still be viewed by anyone who has sympathy for the human condition.  Man's inhumanity to Man is well on display in The Lady and the Duke.".

One of the earliest of the French New Wave filmmakers Rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative.  After all in the midst of the rebellingyouthVietNam days of the late 60s and 70s he was filming romantic little confections like Claire's Knee.  But don't sell the old boy short folks he's always been a student of human nature not an ideologue and L'Anglaise et le duc continues to bear this out.Rohmer's characters are never the bad guys nor the good guys' they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities and limitations.  That's why his movies are always provocative and this film is no exception.Now for the technological nuts and bolts.Rohmer though making his way into his 80s is still on the cuttingedge of cinematic innovation.  The look of L'Anglaise is like something you've never seen before.  You guessed it the old guy like several of the festival's directors this year has gone digital.All of the movie's exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original 1780s Parisian settings.  As a matter of fact you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film's look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film's psychological and yes I'll say it political insights.Toronto features some of the world's edgiest young filmmakers this year as well as some of the world's oldest.

Perhaps the most striking deviation from classic film is his use of hypersaturated digital colours. As other reviewers have pointed out this is Rohmer's way of creating a living 18th century oil painting. But as the other reviewers also have pointed out it's not always convincing. Indeed there are a handful of magnificent scenes where he succeeds. For a split second you're not sure if the camera is focused on a fancy Rococo painting...until suddenly the characters begin to move and talk. But the problem arises once the gimmick wears off and those same vivid images begin to look like cheap CGI trickery common in low budget madeforTV films.The next biggest flawan bizarre oversight which I can't fathomis the lack of music except at the very beginning and the very end. If this movie is indeed an aristocrat's view of late 18th century France complete with impeccable costumes and fancy furniture shouldn't there be at the very least an occasional Mozart Rousseau or Brval sonata in the soundtrack to help us settle into the period? Instead the scenes are awkwardly silent. I never realized how distracting it can be to NOT have music in a film!Last topic character development. We get a nice performance from Lucy Russell as the Englishwoman she did an excellent job of creating a Parisian accent tainted with Scottish roots and when she dumbs it down in the scenes where she's pretending to be a tourist it's very impressively done. But unfortunately I feel like hers was the only character that had any soul. JeanClaude Dreyfus the Duke who was riveting in DELICATESSEN as the heartless villain and equally memorable in CITY OF LOST CHILDREN as the big ole softy never seemed to have a clear character in this film. This I believe is the fault of the director. He should have given Dreyfus a few closeups to allow us to see that very expressive face of his. Instead I recall seeing only full body shots and profiles where we're not sure how genuine he is. The result is that you never trust the Duke at his words you never know if he's a good guy or a bad guy. It also doesn't help that the Lady is constantly flipflopping her affectionshatred toward him. The resulting character confusion leads to us the audience becoming apathetic and distanced from the Duke.The story itself is very interesting but I won't get into that because I don't want to ruin anything if you decide to see the film. Overall... I really don't know what to think of this. It held my interest for two hours but was never quite satisfying. Watch it on a rainy day and judge for yourself.".

The digital sets in this film are very attractive and are used much better than in Attack of the Clones. The performances are moderately good The heroine's dependence on servants reminded me of Scarlett O'Hara.Neither of these makes up for the poor script though. The heroine's royalist sentiments are zerodimensional But he's the king!. Her flight from Paris is completely devoid of suspense. There's no indication of the smouldering romance that supposedly exists between the lead characters. But the worst part is the repetition! Characters repeat what they said in the previous scene which was a summary of what happened in the scene before that. I sat through this twice the flight from Paris and the return to Paris but when it happened again the vote I WALKED OUT. I can't wait for digital sets to become the norm so that people will again pay attention to the rest of the movie.Oh and I hope the next film about the French revolution doesn't have Republican soldiers who act like the Keystone Kops.".

The film looks beautiful with each scene designed as a period painting like a tableaux vivant. And I expected much talking as that's Rohmer's style.

I simply didn't understand her an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the Revolution keep shifting political focus I think I was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations like a character out of The Scarlet Pimpernel. Hey the only reason she didn't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the Prince of Wales or somebody.

Although not written for our picture at all this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable...The only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer Heinz Roemheld is the rather weary one of using a popular songthe themein as many arrangements as possible. Throughout we have musical references to Please Don't Kiss Me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material. The tune is pleasing it may do very well on the Hit Paradebut Lady from Shanghai is not a musical comedy...Mr. Roemheld is an ardent devotee of an oldfashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as Disney. In other words if somebody falls down he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra etc. etc...If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative I couldn't be unhappier about the results...Just before I left to go abroad I asked Vi Viola Lawrence the editor to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxicab and also quite a bit of dialogue. I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut...saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence this was not done accounting for the main weaknesses of the film's opening reel...There is nothing in the fact of Rita's diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo...What does matter is Rita's beauty...the evil overtones suggested by Grigsby's character and Michael's bewilderment. Any or all of these items might have inspired the music. Instead the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony a pratfall by Pluto the Pup or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck...There is no sound atmosphere on the boat. A little wind and water is sorely missed. There's no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen...At the start of the picnic sequence...in the temporary score we used a very curious sexy LatinAmerican strain...This has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequelbad stock stuff...This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit...There is a big musical outburst after Grigsby's line I want you to kill him. This is absurd...The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio...was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point. As it stands now it's on about the same level as the rest of the scoring. Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we're kidding...The aquarium scene needs more echo. Please Don't Kiss Me is in again!...A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michael's run down the pier. From the gunshot through to the phone call a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort. For some reason this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo. As a result the whole sequence seems dull...The audience should feel at this point along with Michael that maybe they are going crazy. The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they're going to sleep...The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music...The closing music again makes reference to Please Don't Kiss Me...This finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture.All of these edits from Orson were ignored".

	schema:reviewBody "After CITIZEN KANE in 1941 Hollywood executives turned their cobwebbed backs on the great Orson Welles.  With the exception of KANE Welles lost all creative control on MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS JOURNEY INTO FEAR and many other films to come.  Welles was an innovative and creative genius the most unconventional of filmmakers when Hollywood was in need of a few more.  THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is yet another example of the misunderstood view of Welles' films at the time a movie that seems a bit choppy and nonfluent. It has a conventional 1940's premise told in a most unconventional way and I am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.  It is now legend that Columbia mogul Harry Cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about.  In hindsight many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master storytelling of Orson Welles and THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is only nearly great because of their intrusion.Beside being arguably the greatest director of alltime Welles was also quite a performer as an actor.  At 25 we all know what he did as Charles Foster Kane perhaps the most famous character in film history.  Here he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence something unfamiliar to those familiar with Welles other great work.  Instead of a slick wise tongue he speaks with a rough Irish twang.  Rita Hayworth his unhappily married wife at the time plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts Welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment.  He is a large lug who may have even murdered a man but the real mystery lies in the relationship between Hayworth with stunning blonde hair and crippled hubby Everett Sloane Mr. Bernstein from CITIZEN KANE.  A creepy partner of Sloane's is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has Welles' Michael O'Hara head spinning.  Welles narrates the picture as O'Hara but things are still unclear throughout. See for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what's up.An uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around O'Hara with Sloane defending him.  It is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods including Sloane crossexamining himself.  I didn't really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway.   Up to this point the cinematography is great some scenes are shot with craft and skill aquarium love scene but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us the audience in.  Reportedly the court scene was reshot against Welles' requests 10 closeups of Hayworth were ordered and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at Cohn's insistence.  A gaudy score infuriated Welles who once again was left out of the editing process.  Thank Welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tourdeforce ending that will always be treasured.  The socalled Hall of Mirrors scene brings buffs back time and time again rightfully so.It must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented.  The crash of the mirrors represents O'Hara's disillusionment and the crazy house itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration.  It seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed crazy twisted and turned like a Dali painting.  This is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the AFI's Top 100.  Then again 3 or 4 more of Orson Welles films may have made all collective best of lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic.NOTE Look for the Mercury Players that are so prominent in Welles pictures. They pop up all over. RATING  8 of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s this has to rank as one of the strangest and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors Orson Welles Rita Hayworth Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me especially Anders. His character George Grisby is one of the strangest people I've ever seen on film. His voice and some of the things he said have to be heard to be believed. Slaone isn't far behind in the strange category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short blonde hair but still is Hayworth which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles' is as fascinating as always. One tip if you have the DVD turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending visually with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As bizarre as this film is I still thought the buffoonlike carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that no complaints. This is great entertainment which is the name of the game.".

	schema:headline " Orson Welles takes on a pulpnoir novel and at the least makes it his own";
	schema:reviewBody "As I watched one of Orson Welles' last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker I knew I was watching a great movie unfold though at times I did not know why. The story in The Lady from Shanghai has the prime elements of a filmnoir averageJoe lead femme fatale conspicuous supporting characters and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure. It is an entertaining ride and it's filled to the brim with Welles' unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or don't feel complete in what was Welles' full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer Harry Cohn and the Columbia execs are to blame for that.Welles costars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth as Mike O'Hara an Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people. Hayworth is Mrs. Bannister married to Mr. Bannister Everett Sloane who played Mr. Bernstein in Citizen Kane who is accompanied by a friend Mr. Grisby Glenn Anders who has great control in his eyes. They want to go sailing on their yacht and take O'Hara along for the ride and at first he's reluctant but agrees since he's falling for the married Mrs. As their journey unfolds O'Hara finds that Bannister and Grisby are not pleasant to be around and more so with Grisby who at first seems out of his gourd. Yet as the plot unfolds O'Hara is drawn into a scam that Grisby is planning for insurance money with results that I dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others.Whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years. Though he doesn't have the terrific Greg Tolland Kane's DP at his side dependable Charles Lawton Jr. assists Welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works. A particular accomplishment is the funhouse mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others. Welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isn't anything special and Hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story. The Lady from Shanghai is worth checking out especially for Welles Hayworth or filmnoir buffs fans of the Coen brothers might find this fascinating as well. It may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for Touch of Evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in.".

	onyx:emotionText "As I watched one of Orson Welles' last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker I knew I was watching a great movie unfold though at times I did not know why. The story in The Lady from Shanghai has the prime elements of a filmnoir averageJoe lead femme fatale conspicuous supporting characters and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure. It is an entertaining ride and it's filled to the brim with Welles' unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or don't feel complete in what was Welles' full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer Harry Cohn and the Columbia execs are to blame for that.Welles costars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth as Mike O'Hara an Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people. Hayworth is Mrs. Bannister married to Mr. Bannister Everett Sloane who played Mr. Bernstein in Citizen Kane who is accompanied by a friend Mr. Grisby Glenn Anders who has great control in his eyes. They want to go sailing on their yacht and take O'Hara along for the ride and at first he's reluctant but agrees since he's falling for the married Mrs. As their journey unfolds O'Hara finds that Bannister and Grisby are not pleasant to be around and more so with Grisby who at first seems out of his gourd. Yet as the plot unfolds O'Hara is drawn into a scam that Grisby is planning for insurance money with results that I dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others.Whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years. Though he doesn't have the terrific Greg Tolland Kane's DP at his side dependable Charles Lawton Jr. assists Welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works. A particular accomplishment is the funhouse mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others. Welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isn't anything special and Hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story. The Lady from Shanghai is worth checking out especially for Welles Hayworth or filmnoir buffs fans of the Coen brothers might find this fascinating as well. It may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for Touch of Evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in.";

However as a filmnoir and a piece of Orson Welles' body of work this film is top notch.Its biggest flaw besides Welles accent is that the beginning of the movie is very slow. However it is necessary for the ending to payoff. It's unfortunate that the current world is moving at light speed and that movies are chastised for taking ample time to develop their world. A modern example of length being put to good use is The Count of Monte Cristo. Still that film doesn't compare to Shanghai.Once the trial which is often hilarious begins the movie reaches the heights of greatness. It all climaxes with a visually stunning ending in the mirror room of a fun house and a fantastic performance by Hayworth.The film sticks with you. Also recommended The Third Man".

No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. Lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the Film Forum in New York just ended or his films either on tape or DVD form.Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair as a blonde she is just too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie.The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles body of work was his own appearance in it. Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O'Hara a different film might have been achieved altogether. Orson Welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street.

The cinematography of this film is filled with Welles' characteristic quirks of odd angles quick cuts long pans and sinister lighting.  The use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in Touch of Evil and the mysterious Chinese characters and the sequences in Chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration in many ways to Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately it is Welles' obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety.  The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques.However despite this criticism the story combined with wonderful performances by Welles Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders Laughter make this film a joy to watch.  Orson Welles pulls off not only the Irish brogue but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor.  Rita Hayworth who was married to Welles at the time breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions.

	schema:reviewBody "Michael O'Hara is a charming Irish sailor a drifter who encounters a beautiful woman in Central Park saves her from attackers and finds himself drawn inexorably into her eerie world.     Orson Welles wrote this screenplay and adaptation of of a Sherwood King novel.  He had great difficulty getting it past Joseph Breen the overseer of the Motion Picture Production Code and in the end had to drop the ending in which O'Hara persuades Elsa to kill herself.  Welles also directed the film and played the key role of O'Hara a character with strong Wellesian resonances.  As Higham Welles' biographer puts it Like Welles O'Hara rejoices in being eccentric and poor ... and sees through and condemns all corruption.       The great Rita Hayworth was estranged from her husband Welles in mid1946 and agreed to take the role of Elsa Bannister as part of a final bid to save the marriage.  Elsa is the Lady From Shanghai the temptress whose sexual allure ensnares O'Hara.  Arthur Bannister the complaisant cuckold is played by Everett Sloane stalwart of the Mercury Theatre and longtime Welles collaborator.  The disturbing role of the deranged George Grisby is taken by Glenn Anders his face distorted by wideangle lenses to suggest the psychotic menace of the law partner with the bizarre deathwish. It has been claimed that Welles based Grisby's character on the reallife Nelson Rockefeller.     As one would expect from Welles there are some stunning visuals in this film and some hauntingly memorable screen moments.  Hayworth sings the love song beautifully and the Acapulco interlude is visually delightful. The cast works brilliantly as an ensemble delivering the Wellesian dialogue with purring efficiency.  The Central Park sequence involves the longest continuous dollyshot ever filmed.  Later we see the arches of the Calle del Mercadero slip by moodily as the camera tracks down the street and then the angle is reversed and we see the colonnade from inside.  Only Welles could come up with the aquarium idea with shots of a different better aquarium matted in to give the exact effect that he wanted  a silent commentary on predators.  The rounded tops of the fish tanks link the aquarium thematically with the Calle del Mercadero.  The famous final sequence in the fun fair was butchered by the studio reduced to a mere sherd of Welles' original scheme but still terrific.  Our spatial perceptions are toyed with much as O'Hara's moral bearings have been skewed by Elsa.     One part of the film which fails badly is the trial scene.  Absurdities proliferate.  A defence attorney finds himself called to the stand as a prosecution witness and if that is not silly enough he then proceeds to crossexamine himself.  The surprise subpoena is nonsense.     Verdict  A relatively lightweight offering from Welles contains good things but is marred by the risible courtroom scene.".

I know there are those who think it's a terrible movie and who blame the moneymen saboteurs but I loved it warts and all. Although you never get used to that brogue Welles is great in the lead role Hayworth too in a misunderstood role. Then characters like the greasy grisly Grisby and the lame sardonic husband the way he drawls the word lover really get under your skin as they're meant to. And there's more those closeups showing the sweat dread bewilderment and blankness of his characters' faces the great dialogue especially the analogy of humans with sharks the little dots of humour with the various reactions of the public in the gallery of the court scene You're kidding right? and the chase scenes so reminiscent of The Third Man to name but a few.Someday I'd love to see the film Welles had in his head but then you could say that about almost all his projects going right back to Citizen Kane. I'm a fan and in the end have to be grateful for the small mercies of just whatever he was able to get released through the studio system flaws tampering and all.

	schema:headline " Chinese Puzzle";
	schema:reviewBody "The first mystery is to guess what Welles' original film was like. That makes this a real adventure  to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics imagine the beautiful woman it once supported.If you do you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever. As mysteries go the narrative is rather ordinary a simple diversion one jealous husband as red herring.What's rather miraculous is Welles' placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark dark multifaceted world. The first real noir but even darker. It's not an obviously twisted world unless you think about the camera. What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common.For all the celebration Kane was a success because of the great drama and story. The camera's eye was shocking but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the selfreference of Shakespeare with this eye. Othello and MacBeth are both begun in this period and I consider them part of a single vision with this. The noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives even a little  they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So in telling this story Welles has to make the environment into a character. Several characters as suspects in the mystery.Thus we have the famous lighting blocking and angles we know and have since seen countless times. And we have the deliberately closed sets the park yacht picnic area aquarium dock courtroom Chinese theater and funhouse. I am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of 'external' narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments.My own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it among the other characterenvironments introduced as suspects. In other words the manipulation of Black Irish who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist was neither a force of human conspiracy the park or the civilized version the courtroom nor of nature the picnic or the civilized version the aquarium.Instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement. This is of course a selfreference to what Welles is doing putting these people including himself through hell for our own caprice a matter underscored by the Peking Opera set with Welles doped up. And of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception.More about the selfreference surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife. But I believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked the studio environment. Surely Welles was as much screwed with and in much the same way as his character. And that screwing took the form of the murder of this film leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment.That poor Rita comes from China ties up the whole thing the Chinese theater the expected rape from above the loss of the woman. The investment in environment beyond all.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the point in time that The Lady from Shanghai was being made the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth was disintegrating. The film was as much an effort by Welles to rekindle the old flames as it was to make a classic noir. Not received well at the time The Lady from Shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass. Gotten better with age so to speak.Welles is Irish seaman Michael O'Hara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three muggers in Central Park. Sparks do fly but then comes the rub turns out the lady is married to crippled but brilliant criminal attorney Everett Sloane. Nevertheless Sloane takes an apparent liking to Welles and hires him to skipper his yacht.So far this film is starting to sound a lot like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member he would have skedaddled back to the seaman's hiring hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself pegged for two murders and Sloane as his eminent counsel.Welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film. Supposedly Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair. This may have soured him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw Welles's vision of independent film making a threat to their power.Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner Grisby who is one slimy dude he winds up a corpse. The other corpse to be here is Ted DeCorsia a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself.It's a good noir thriller showing Rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here. The final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged but I wouldn't recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance.".

Orson Welles made this on a lark to fulfill an obligation and you can tell it is loose to the point of careless in some ways. And the plot isn't totally clear as you go nor are the motivations of the characters.But this slightly off slightly illogical slightly or very bizarre construction is exactly what makes the movie work. So first off I think this is a masterpiece. The way it veers from telling a story to suggesting one the way it shows reactions by heightening them to the point of surreal drama the way scenes that are improbable and invented and made fabulous as in some kind of dream all of this is great moviemaking and makes for an interesting movie too the one not always leading to the other.If you asked Godard he would say this is Welles's best film and I'm inclined to at least see why. It has the total excess and expressionist eye candy of the best of both Kane and Touch of Evil but it also has something they don't have and that's this feeling of being on a journey floating through the world in a beautiful way regardless of what happens. And this is what the main character experiences the man called Michael played by Orson himself with a terrible and irritating accent that is an attempt at a brogue.There are fascinating tidbits behind the movie but maybe the one that you need to know for it's layering of meaning is that the leading woman Rita Hayworth had just ended a relationship with Welles. They were still married but were separated and you can kind of feel their lingering feelings mixed with doubts on screen. Or so I thought.The filmingthe photography and lightingis amazing truly phenomenal stuff. It ranges from moody water scenes the twilight party is terrific visually to closeups of sweaty faces to the legendary rightfully final scene with the mirrors shattering multiplying dissecting. So just for what it looks like this is a terrific ride. But in fact the acting is intense and edgy and the plot once it starts to gel halfway through is clever and fun. The whole Asian slant to the title and the opening conversation comes around full tilt with a great ending in San Francisco's Chinatown.If you like Orson Welles you've probably seen this by now but if not do so. But don't expect the kind of tightly constructed movie you get with his other films. It's almost an art film with a bigger budget and is rightfully in its own category. Great stuff.".

	schema:headline " Welles' jazz eye of seduction";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm in awe of Welles and all he achieved. Look Welles at the time was already on his way out of Hollywood and this was far from his ideal film not a pet project. And yet you wouldn't know it from the end result which just oozes creativity. Here is genius being able to throw yourself in the circumstances and creative joy working for the work itself.But for all intents and purposes this is simply not the film Welles conceived of and shotthat has to be one of the great lost films. Once more the studio botched the thing the third time for Welles at this point. It's not just that an hour is missing but that extensive reshooting and editing has fundamentally altered the original piece. Miraculously it still works because every studio imposed decision goes to cement the thriller and so long as you have the girl and gun a thriller generally works.But in feel and tone this is a much more ordinary noir than Welles intended. And yet it's still a masterpiece.The film is in the manner of a jazz improvisation between narrators for room in the music and each change of narrator subtly transforms the music and the new music mysteriously repositions the walls and and even who the viewers are. This is likely what many viewers identify as surrealism though I find it deeper than anything conceived by that group.First is Welles' himself  narrating when we first see him the story as already in the past and being recalled. At some point there's even talk of a book he's planning to write. In his story he is fascinating and desireda fanciful storyteller trying to pass himself as a schmuck in both senses. Of course he meets a dreamy blonde out of thin air. Of course he valiantly rescues her from crooks. The husband is anxious to hire him and not any other in a roomful of stooges. Inbetween we get interjections her song and dreamy swimming tropical animals slithering all around all intrusions in his story of seducing the woman. All the while you'll quite literally see the chorus change from the roomful of sailors and later the Acapulco band in Welles' storyspace to the gossipy crowds at the docks aquarium and courtroom to the mysterious faces in the Chinese opera.During the Acapulco picnic Welles silences the villains with the shark story and coolly walks away still in control. Even the killing of the Franco spy as backstory smacks of a narrator's conceit allowing him to portray himself as both noble and dangerous. Can you imagine the character as played by Welles having killed anyone? I could buy Bogie Mitchum even Gable. Not Welles any more than Astaire. The spaces in his sailorworld? Open seductive seas evocative tropics.Banning the lawyer husband takes over initially through his stooge Grisby. His main centerpiece is the trial his natural space. Here the dynamics shift to a cheaper mockery and satirethe meaningless legalistic objections the gossipy spectators the self interrogation the judge's whimsically oversized chess game the slapstick hullabaloo of O'Hara's escape by mingling in a jury. The spaces are confined and stagy. The air stringent.And then we wander off to her world one of veiled Chinese intrigue and lying mirrors both calling attention to staged image. Previously the aquarium dark submerged hushed. Once in the Chinese opera our narrator is fully under her spell the sleeping pills. And of course the mirrors where discovering her deception is rendered as his stumbling through staging gear odd architecture. Imagine! This scene was to run for 20 minutes in the original.So wonderful overall. Welles takes the erotic thriller and turns it into layered drift through inner worlds. As characters enter his story originally a story where he'd seduce a beautiful woman they acquire life dictate new spaces change the watching chorus creating their own currents in the story that fool with the seduction. Just beautiful.And yet I find myself coming back to that alluring and lost original.Welles' main intention was simple challenge both the cinematic language and our eyes in two ways first a capricious self awareness of the dark elements of noir in the sailor losing control of his story. This is preserved throughout the movie easy to spot its function being that Welles is fooling with what we're accustomed to take serious. The Maltese Falcon was based on this stance.But the real loss for me is the second challenge Welles imposed the authentic world and camera. Supposedly the original was done in long distanced sweeps of camera which is completely unlike the film we have. Studio reshoots and patchy editing ruined the effect completely altering the fabric leaving us with some of the location work but a different feel. Oddly enough the patchy and hyperedited tone is not unlike Welles though it does not show his mastery. But I was happy that I could spot one occasion that was left intact a simple shot from which we can somewhat reconstruct the intention it's when Grisby approaches the yacht for the first time Welles is at the bulwark looking out he is standing in soft focus and very close to the camera and moves out to meet Grisby. It's all in that movement from soft focus the creation of lived space. Epstein had been doing it before others. But a studio film with the visibility of Welles and Hayworth behind it would have changed cinema as much as Kane did. It'd be a different world.Alas we can only imagine. Amusingly Welles' violent fistfight in the judge's rooms another remaining instance of Welles' original plan of real impact in the eye was kept in the film because it's a fistfight and there the immediacy was apparently desired by the studio still is if you look at Hollywood blockbusters..Noir Meter 44".

Inbetween we get interjections her song and dreamy swimming tropical animals slithering all around all intrusions in his story of seducing the woman. All the while you'll quite literally see the chorus change from the roomful of sailors and later the Acapulco band in Welles' storyspace to the gossipy crowds at the docks aquarium and courtroom to the mysterious faces in the Chinese opera.During the Acapulco picnic Welles silences the villains with the shark story and coolly walks away still in control. Even the killing of the Franco spy as backstory smacks of a narrator's conceit allowing him to portray himself as both noble and dangerous. Can you imagine the character as played by Welles having killed anyone? I could buy Bogie Mitchum even Gable. Not Welles any more than Astaire. The spaces in his sailorworld? Open seductive seas evocative tropics.Banning the lawyer husband takes over initially through his stooge Grisby. His main centerpiece is the trial his natural space. Here the dynamics shift to a cheaper mockery and satirethe meaningless legalistic objections the gossipy spectators the self interrogation the judge's whimsically oversized chess game the slapstick hullabaloo of O'Hara's escape by mingling in a jury. The spaces are confined and stagy. The air stringent.And then we wander off to her world one of veiled Chinese intrigue and lying mirrors both calling attention to staged image. Previously the aquarium dark submerged hushed. Once in the Chinese opera our narrator is fully under her spell the sleeping pills. And of course the mirrors where discovering her deception is rendered as his stumbling through staging gear odd architecture. Imagine! This scene was to run for 20 minutes in the original.So wonderful overall. Welles takes the erotic thriller and turns it into layered drift through inner worlds. As characters enter his story originally a story where he'd seduce a beautiful woman they acquire life dictate new spaces change the watching chorus creating their own currents in the story that fool with the seduction. Just beautiful.And yet I find myself coming back to that alluring and lost original.Welles' main intention was simple challenge both the cinematic language and our eyes in two ways first a capricious self awareness of the dark elements of noir in the sailor losing control of his story. This is preserved throughout the movie easy to spot its function being that Welles is fooling with what we're accustomed to take serious. The Maltese Falcon was based on this stance.But the real loss for me is the second challenge Welles imposed the authentic world and camera. Supposedly the original was done in long distanced sweeps of camera which is completely unlike the film we have. Studio reshoots and patchy editing ruined the effect completely altering the fabric leaving us with some of the location work but a different feel. Oddly enough the patchy and hyperedited tone is not unlike Welles though it does not show his mastery. But I was happy that I could spot one occasion that was left intact a simple shot from which we can somewhat reconstruct the intention it's when Grisby approaches the yacht for the first time Welles is at the bulwark looking out he is standing in soft focus and very close to the camera and moves out to meet Grisby. It's all in that movement from soft focus the creation of lived space. Epstein had been doing it before others. But a studio film with the visibility of Welles and Hayworth behind it would have changed cinema as much as Kane did. It'd be a different world.Alas we can only imagine. Amusingly Welles' violent fistfight in the judge's rooms another remaining instance of Welles' original plan of real impact in the eye was kept in the film because it's a fistfight and there the immediacy was apparently desired by the studio still is if you look at Hollywood blockbusters..Noir Meter 44";

	schema:headline " Brilliant jumble of a film";
	schema:reviewBody "This could be well have been THE definitive film noir of all time had not the Columbia Studios cut so much of Orson Welles's original. What we are left with is a flawed yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actordirector and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent.'The Lady From Shanghai' is film noir at it's most sizzling and confusing. Welles with an uneven accent portrays Michael O'Hara a journeyman Irishman who after a fateful encounter with the seductive dangerous Elsa Bannister Hayworth in a GREAT performancefinds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband's Everett Sloane yacht. Elsa or 'Rosalie' as Michael likes to call her plays the innocent helpless doll very well ensnaring O'Hara in her web. As the lovers conduct a notsosecret affair at sea Arthur Bannister's partner in his law firm George Grisby Glenn Anderscomes aboard. He is a weird untrustworthy figure who offers Michael a unique proposal He will get 5000 to assist Grisby in the faking of Grisby's death so it looks murder. The plan is for Michael to get off a technicality and run off into the sun with Elsa. But things do not go to plan.Hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal. At times she seems genuinely vulnerable and childlike at others brutal worldweary and hard. Always she is brilliantly beautiful whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black brandishing a gun. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here and she is a farcry from her famous 'Gilda' role. Her thenhusband Orson Welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop angering Columbia boss Harry Cohn. It was a terrific marketing ploy and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully. She is not the sympathetic femme fatale that 'Gilda' is here instead she is a predatory blackhearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option.The Welles and Hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage. They would divorce after the film was made so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship. They are hateful not romantic lovers in this so it's hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen. Certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality with Welles as the 'fall guy' he even admits it himself in the film! and Rita as the doublecrossing babe.Welles character is the typical noir 'drifter' with not much sense. As Welles voiceover proves to use O'Hara indeed does not use his brain very much 'expect to be thinking of her Elsa'. Welles usually played intelligent charismatic fellows so his turn here as the dimwitted Michael is unusual and very interesting. Indeed Welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well.Everett Sloane is suitably slimy as Hayworth's crippled husband. One wonders why he hires Michael. It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically so why does he invite a 'threat' on board? One interpretation could be that Michael provides the 'service' to his wife that Bannister cannot in his crippled state. There is definitely something to that theory with a lot of implications toward Elsa's behaviour before she met her husband was she some sort of prostitute?and Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes.This is a jumbled convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed. We are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot as with most noirs. Welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches including the justifiably famous 'hall of mirrors' climax. It's a terrific scene one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness. This fun house scene is visually stunning with a Dalilike feel to the painted sets apparently Orson painted them himself. Subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by Welles enhances the plot and makes this a thoughtprovoking experience.The dialogue is scorching and confusing delivered superbly by Rita's alternately breathy low voice and helpless highpitched littlegirl voice. Hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale of 'noir'. It's a pity only a slight one  as Rita was a brilliant dancer that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for Columbia in the 40's instead of darklythemed noir like this. She was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent.910.".

It is also an unlikely success but sometimes films come together despite their mishaps and disparate elementsThe Wizard of Oz comes to mind.Reading the trivia notes in IMDb about the film one would have to say that the odds were against TLFS being a consistent and successful entity but somehow it became a wonderful piece of art noir.Starring Rita Hayworth as Elsa Bannister the beautiful wife of a very successful but bitter attorney played by Everett Sloane the story is told by central character Michael O'Hara Orson Welles a tough but vulnerable seaman with a fatalistic point of view. He immediately falls for Mrs. Bannister and is drawn into the web of their dysfunctional relationship. Glenn Anders plays George Grisby Bannister's partner with a brilliantly offkilter and manic intensity.The cinematography is beautiful giving the brightest objects the darkest shadows. The scenery is spectacularfrom the shots over the city of San Francisco to the glittering scenes of Acapulco.Though the storyline is convoluted it holds up. The film is really a mystery about the true nature of Elsa but it hinges on a point of law like Double Indemnity that is questionable but irrelevant in the biggest scheme of things.Welles' decision to cut and color the luscious locks of his estranged wife Hayworth was severely criticized at the time but for my money it gives her a look that is more severe more dangerous more inscrutablebut just as beautifuladding to her mystery. The courtroom scene with its comic elements is also often criticized but the viewer is not supposed to laugh. It adds to the farcical nature of the film. O'Hara always feels like the gods are laughing at him so it is appropriate that the procedure that will determine his fate feels less than serious. The film ends with the famous hall of mirrors scene where all is explained. And the viewer is left with the impression that he navigated a crazy house of illusions andlike O'Harabecame victim to his own nature. It is a stylistic classic that retains at its core the markings of a genius.".

It seems to me that this perspective manifests in the way that the universe of The Lady from Shanghai continually and incessantly laughs at Michael O'Hara's misfortune and helplessness. Certainly Welles has obliged stylistically  his strange morphed compositions increasingly begin to collapse around O'Hara as he is drawn slowly into the mystery of the murder conspiracy. The blocked paths of the actors crisscrossed and circle each other venomously as the aquarium creatures loom large in the background. The narrator seemingly jumps readily inside his own story as the voiceover switches seamlessly into dialogue. And then there is that famous climax in the house of mirrors where all sense of direction and orientation is abandoned for our characters  each shot and each shattering of glass further distorts the space although the lost footage is apparently much longer and grander. In some instances the cosmic farce is literal in its humour  as the hobbling Bannister ends up on the stand interrogating himself in the trial that is little more than a slapstick affair. But for all the effort in maintaining this pervasive aura of paranoia and disorientation by ramping up the convention stylistic tones of noir the film falls a little flat. The murder plot itself which is meant to be increasing hard to follow until that final reveal is secondary to Welles' atmosphere so what we have is a distancing effect due to his own plodding almost bored narration guiding us along. What is supposed to be irregular and affecting merely highlights its own flaws  the clumsy ADR dubbing which does the dialogue no favours the oddly stilted romance that doesn't quite lure us into a false sense of security perhaps a casualty of the director and starlet's impending divorce awkward little zooms and smash cuts that merely draw attention to themselves rather than establish a tone. I would so very much like to see this lost artefact.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mizoguchi is acclaimed for all of his work but is mostly praised for the succession of masterpieces he directed at the end of his career. The Crucified Lovers is my favourite. Note the original title means A Tale From Chikamatsu after the classic Japanese author Chikamatsu Monzaemon who wrote the early 18th century play the movie is based on.It is a rare film where each image is finely crafted as a piece of art yet without ostentation. We must clean our eyes between each shot Mizoguchi said he perfectly applies this precept here. Each shot is meaningful none feels superfluous. WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS The movie narrates a love story yet with important social and psychological themes as show the regular alternation between the lovers' scenes and others. It depicts a harsh society where nobles rule ruthlessly money reigns people are dominated by conventions and adultery is punished by crucifixion. Traditions overrule everything including family bonds Mohei's father rejects his son instead of helping him and denounces him even if he frees him afterwards OTama's uncle blames his niece for a petty lie OSan's family blames her and finally gives her up. Women are the main victims OSan's family decided to marry her to a much older despicable man he cheats on her but she has to go OTama is abused but also has to go.It is a world of corruption and hypocrisy Ishun condemns the adulterous lovers at the beginning but cheats on his wife Isan pretends he is concerned by Ishun's misfortune but conspires for his downfall Sukeimon betrays his master there are political intrigues involving debts and law. This society seems doomed to carry on as show recurring events and symbols the output of the printing house is calendars issued every year the chestnut merchant comes every year there is a crucifixion at the beginning and another one at the end when Ishun is eventually discharged Isan who will take over looks just as vile though more intelligent perhaps.In this context the love story is all the more compelling since OSan and Mohei fight against everything law reputation conventions family. The scenes between the lovers become increasingly intense. Eventually when they are condemned they look happy because they can remain together even if they die.Images express how their relationship liberates them. At the beginning they are suffocating in the printing house it is filled with people objects beams screens shadows and even spider webs when Mohei is held captive. OSan has financial issues. Mohei is sick. When they run away they are first obliged to take shelter in dark places and hide between huge barrels that seem to crush them. However when and after they voice their love they are in nature despite the difficult situation it feels as if we can breathe. A unique shot shows there is no going back as Mohei runs down a hill followed by OSan the camera pivots down on the two characters lost in the endless slope. It signifies in a simple powerful way the intensity of their love but also how it will lead them to irreversible consequences.However this liberation is shortlived after Mohei's father refuses to help them they are confined in a small dark hut. Then they are held inside again. The movie ends on a stunning camera movement zooming high out of the lovers among the crowd. It is the only such movement in the film making it more gripping somewhat reversed from the abovementioned shot on the hill although in the latter the camera pivots down without zooming it magnificently summarises the love story surrounded by a hostile society.Mizoguchi's images are more than masterly they are metaphysical. He shows a high respect for oppressed characters they are framed close and the camera discreetly follows them slightly going up as they come closer or going down as they kneel which happens frequently. He also demonstrates decency the shot becomes distant when the scene grows too personal for instance when the lovers spend their first night together or in the example below. These superb aesthetics show even in apparently simple scenes. Just one example when OSan meets OTama in her room at the beginning of the movie.Shot 1 general view of the room. OSan enters moves forward and kneels while OTama moves to the back. The camera adjusts to OSan as described above.Shot 2 closer image precisely when OTama moves forward. This subtle coordination of movement image and character makes the shot transition look completely natural. We get closer as the conversation becomes more intimate.Shot 3 even closer image from the opposite side of the room precisely when OTama turns around. Again the transition is fluid and the close image shows the increasing intimacy. The opposite shot illustrates the shock of OTama's revelation Ishun is abusing her. Music rises at the end.Shot 4 same as shot 1 but we now see the two women from the back since they have turned around. The camera has resumed its initial distant position out of consideration for the despaired characters. Both women are faceless dominated denied a proper existence. The music insures the transition with shot 3 and highlights their sorrow.Hence in just four seemingly plain shots of which two are similar Mizoguchi reveals the characters' emotions and condition. The scene lasts a bit more than two minutes but embodies a whole story. One jewel amidst many others.A last note about the score. The aggressive music during the opening credits announces a movie without compromise be ready for an aesthetical and emotional experience. During the film the score delicately beautifies scenes e.g. the discreet bells when Mohei is captive at the beginning. Eventually the music becomes more aggressive e.g. at OSan's family's house and the movie ends on notes similar to the beginning the inevitable tragedy has unravelled.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is adapted from a work by Chikamatsu Monzaemon one of the defining writers from the early Tokugawa era. His name often reaches us in the contours of a Japanese Shakespeare and as usually with these Western imports to explain Eastern art it is mostly a lazy comparison. Unlike Shakespeare who continues to inspire a steady flow of film Chikamatsu's name has been largely neglected however there is this and films by Uchida Shinoda and Yasuzo Masumura 'shunji'doublesuicide stories that were Chikamatsu's forte each enlivened in its own way by the intensity of vibrant artifice and a story of forbidden passions cleansed by death.So filmwise the heart of these things has been extrapolated from where centuries of concentrated practice refined them in the stages of kabuki or bunraku both of which featured elaborate contraptions for generating illusions. The stage having been set it was all a matter of achieving a cinematic mobility around it. Shinoda made the most clever simple use of that stage in Double Suicide he was essentially filming what domestic audiences had enjoyed for centuries on the stage of bunraku as part of unbroken tradition but trusting our eye to be naturally dislocated the right distance to absorb this as a puzzling modernity. It is not unlike what has happened with Mizoguchi a visual purity from tradition dislocated thus obscured through Western interpretations.But let's backtrack a little. We know that Chikamatsu abandoned kabuki for the puppet theater of bunraku an author's theater with pliable actors held on strings and the gods that move the world made visible. There he worked in favour of better integrated audience manipulation in favour of an idealized realism sprung from the author's mind.So here we have a film about a scrollmaker himself an artist charged with cultivating idealized images fighting against the idealized reality he has helped cultivate in a quest for the true love he had all his life sublimated into perfect service.It is very similar to Oharu in this way the film structured around the tension that rises from characters performing idealized roles and the tortured heart that gives rise to them. There is a master printer who cultivates the image of the noble benefactor but who is a cruel deceiving scumbag. Nobles who act magnanimous in the open but then use their position to barter for money. The rival printer who feigns congratulations or compassion but who is secretly plotting for the imperial position.So this idealized world that Chikamatsu advocated and in a small part helped cultivate Mizoguchi posits to be a system of organized oppression with victims its own characters.But it is in thrusting through this world of idealized thus largely fictional appearances that the two lovers can finally realize feelings that were socially prohibited. In this fictional world true beauty a love fou is realized by shedding the artificial. As it turns out the two of them become the couple they were groomed to be.As usual with Mizoguchi the narrative on the surface level is never less than obvious. It is clean disarmingly earnest. It seems like the film does not demand anything of us. But beneath the controlled histrionics there is a heart of images that beats with abstract beauty.The final image is of the two lovers publicly declaring love by simply standing together. It is again clean but resonates outsid the narrative. Their fate is sealed but the image no longer cultivated but naturally arisen now has the chance to blossom across the audience of curious onlookers. It is an image with the power to inspire change.Mizoguchi is not a filmmaker I can deem personal. But he's a remarkable study just the same.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was near the end of a wonderful sequence of films made near the end of his life by Mizoguchi. As Tony Raines says in the DVD extra for the Masters of Cinema edition this was a studio project that he was not wholly enthusiastic about. This shows a little in the film as it lacks some of the real flair and emotional power of some of his earlier great films. However it shares with them his wonderful flowing camera and great cinematography. Its also a terrific story based originally on a story from the great Japanese 17th Century playwright Monzaemon Chikamatsu hence the Japanese name A Tale from Chikamatsu. The screenplay is skillfully worked from the original story which depends a lot of some pretty unlikely coincidences.The film has a great cast although the lead actor and major star at the time Kazuo Hazegawa is a little old for the role of the shy lover. Kyoko Kagawa is great as the wife of a powerful merchant who is mistakenly accused of having an affair with her servant but then falls in love with him as they both go on the run. As you'd expect from a Mizoguchi film technically it is flawless with lovely sets and some beautiful camera work. The Masters of Cinema version on DVD is a beautiful restoration. For Mizoguchi fans this film is well worth getting but for those who haven't seen many of his films it would be better to start with some of his earlier masterpieces.".

Did you know that adulterers at that time were crucified in Japan? This and many more traditions of the Old Way were up for reexamination by the Japanese culture soon after their defeat in World War II.

Mizoguchi really cared for women and wanted to make statements on man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty yet he sometimes gets ahead of himself in trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means. This is certainly a case in 'the Crucified Lovers' 'Princess Yang Kwei Fei' and 'Zankiku monogatari'. He sets the scenario in feudal Japan which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially right exclamation boy does feudalism suck I'm glad that it is over.... And true some of the scenarios such weaker films of Mizoguchi present would be literary impossible today. Also his women characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic selfsacrifice which also simplifies the scenario less appealing. Saying that Crucified Lovers is a good film with such few relative weaknesses though the sometimes chilly cynical prose by Ueda the screenwriter helps this film allot. I still highly prefer and recommend Mizoguchi's 'realistic 'contemprary' films of 1936 'Osaka Elegy' and 'Sisters of the Gion' as well as his late masterpieces in which he showed more restraint and subtlety 'Ugetsu' 'Sansho Dayu' and 'The Life of Oharu'.".

A relatively minor infraction on his part is turned into a major offense by his nasty employer and when the Master throws Mohei out and has charges brought against him the Master's wife happens to discover that the Master has been having illicit adulterous affairs on the side.The punishment is literal crucifixion for Mohai so the Master's wife helps him escape and runs away with him.

The wife is on the verge of suicide but recovers her desire to live when she discovers that she and Mohai have secretly loved each other for years. She willingly joins Mohai in their journey up hill and down dale and for this she too is charged and faces crucifixion.It's a story for grown up sensibilities because the emotional bonds involved  not just between the pair of illicit lovers but their friends and relatives  are intricate. The parents don't want them around because if they're caught hiding the fugitives they face the same punishment. Everyone is ready to squeal on them because what the lovers are doing is against the law. The performances are adequate once you accept and get past the Japanese filigrees.

When she turns to one of his top apprentices Kazuo Hasegawa she sets in motion of a chain of events that ultimately have them fleeing together because the apprentice normally a virtuous man intended to take the money from the scrollmaker and was caught. The story reveals emotion and desire that is both on the surface such as the scrollmaker sexually harassing a young servant Yko Minamida as well as that which is concealed. It shows us the randomness of events which may cause everything to suddenly change in one's life as the wife puts it at one point Nothing is more unpredictable than a person's fate. In just one day all of this has happened to us. If you've ever had your life flip suddenly because of love you'll identify. The film also shows the alltoocommon fate of women the advice given to the young servant being harassed is to Just take it. That's the duty of an employee. Adultery is also blamed first and foremost on the women It's frightening what women are capable of and it's ominous when a couple of adulterers are being led through the town to be crucified early on in the film. It's a solid film throughout  the cast is strong the story is well told and there are some gorgeous scenes one of which is in a bamboo forest.

The lovers are unfairly punished for having an affair Osan escapes her husband's home while Mohei is forced into exile. Chikamatsu is a highly charged work but I'm not entirely sure if I would call it a masterpiece on par with Zangiku monogatari The Life of Oharu Ugetsu Sansho dayu and Princess Yang Kwei Fei  Mizoguchi's richest and most beautiful films. The photography is extraordinarily ravishing and evocative with Mizoguchi's masterful fluid camera. Also the sound quality of Chikamatsu is interestingly rich and astounding but the film doesn't stay with you for a while like those aforementioned films.

The whole thing was quite an experience for me and was my most visceral introduction to a corner of Japan that I have since enfolded into my own life and eye. At the root of this is dissymmetry which is different from asymmetry the presence of items that have sibling states which are not expressed. It gives a tension that springs the pumps blood and makes real beauty because it provides space for the definition of beauty.This is one of the reasons I appreciate Kurosawa. He understood this and is why I eagerly watch recommended Japanese films. And why I came to this. Surely Mizoguchi is one of the most celebrated Japanese filmmakers. But what I'm experiencing with him lacks that katachi that clean beauty of tension I wished for. What I see is comparatively western. Oh the story is traditionally Japanese and the manner of the story. But everything cinematic is perfectly constructed balanced. Every frame is a masterpiece of construction and in three dimensions. Its geometric its rich its balanced every vision. Every bit is lovely every motion perfect every jot complemented.Its not Ichibana. Its too pretty to be beautiful.

Director Kenji Mizoguchi's fascination with classical literature from and dramas originally written for the Japanese puppet theater that later became stage plays during the Edo period couldn't be more obvious. Chikamatsu is a pen name not a place in Japan! of a playwright who created puppet dramas but is probably best remembered for his domestic plays of love and suicides written in the early 18th Century that seemed to cater to women audiences. Mizoguchi's scenario starts with a purely accidental romantic encounter and continues through many twists and turns as a high socioeconomic romantic barrier between the wife of a wealthy merchant and an employee slowly dissolves even in the face of institutionalized execution for adultery. Once again the Director spins a tale where the male protagonist's happiness is derived from a woman's sacrifice and the emphasis from personal experience? is on the attraction that some strong women have for weak impoverished men with close to zero prospects. While this is not a morality photoplay Mizoguchi stresses perhaps to the extreme? that adultery real or imagined was a big deal in Japan's Premodern Social System. Adultery laws were a bit tricky though. Husbands could have were expected to have? unmarried female lovers. Wives who took on male lovers married or single were deemed to have committed adultery. Both lovers faced execution for their actions. Proof of adultery could be based on heresy gossip or other circumstantial evidence and motivated by business jealousy or revenge. The husband and families of adulterers could be thrown in jail and have their assets confiscated. Even villages the adulterers came from could be punished! It would seem that samesex adulterous relationships were not legally addressed since apparently they were assumed never to occur! Criterion's restoration is outstanding! Cinematography is very good often due to the camera subtly floating on a crane. Subtitles are a bit long and often fail to fully capture the KensaiBen flavor of line deliveries. Music uses only Japanese instruments. While this may be commendable performances are uneven with percussion used more to provide irritating acousticshocks than to enhance scene richness. Recommended.

	schema:headline " LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI  classic tale retold in jazzedup version";
	schema:reviewBody "LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI 1983 is a liveaction Japanese costume fantasy retelling the ofttold tale of eight warriors identified by their receipt of magic crystal balls sent by a longdead princess to insure protection of her descendants. Here the eight warriors who receive the crystal balls come together to protect the fugitive Princess Shizu of the Satomi Clan which has been all but wiped out by the supernatural descendants of the Hikita Clan. The action is larded with fantasy elements including a couple of monsters a giant centipede and giant snake and the longlived evil matriarch Tamazusa Mari Natsuki who stays alive a hundred years after her 'death' at the hands of the Satomi Clan by taking special baths in blood.Despite the title there's no mention of samurai in the film's Englishdubbed dialogue. The characters refer to each other as ninjas even though few ninja costumes or accessories are visible. It's an unwieldy film with over a dozen major characters none of whom take center stage until well past the film's halfway mark. The main focus of the plot is the gathering of the eight warriors as they meet and realize their destiny to protect the princess and attack Tamazusa's castle to destroy the Eternal Spirit who keeps alive the evil remnants of the Hikita Clan. Too much of the film is spent on gathering the eight a task which is not completed until 100 minutes into the 133minute film. When things finally get going here the main characters turn out to be Princess Shizu Hiroko Yakushimaru and the reckless young Shinbei Hiroyuki Sanada who kidnaps Shizu at one point and travels quite a distance with her before they're reunited with the others. Both are too callow and unformed to be of much interest while the more exciting characters such as the loyal retainer Dosetsu Sonny Chiba and the female fighter Kano Sue Shiomi get far less screen time.The climactic battle at Castle Tamazusa is rousing and full of action but it proves too little too late to compensate for the two hours it took to get there. The earlier action scenes are all too short and choppy to generate much excitement. To make matters worse the English dubbing is particularly horrendous and the tackedon music score is all synthesizercreated with three incongruous American pop songs sung by John O'Banion thrown onto the soundtrack with utter disregard for the historical and cultural tone of the film.The film is especially disappointing because it was directed by Kinji Fukasaku a highly regarded director known for Yakuza gangster films and the recent box office hit BATTLE ROYALE 2000. His earlier space opera MESSAGE FROM SPACE 1978 was a variation of the same story told in LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI and featured some of the same cast members Hiroyuki Sanada Sonny Chiba and Sue Shiomi who played the princess in that one. Fukasaku also gave us the U.S.Japanese coproduction THE GREEN SLIME 1968.On the plus side LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI is quite colorful and beautifully appointed and the special effects are for the most part pretty impressive. The giant centipede flung about on wires is the notable exception. But the film lacks the formal beauty of traditional Japanese samurai films and seems pumped up in style with the youthful romance played up in order to suit the 1980s youth audience. For U.S. fans the botched English soundtrack and overlength are quite fatal along with the absence of any exceptional action scenes until the very end. The story comes from the 19th century Japanese novel 'Nanso Satomi Hakkenden' by Bakin Takizawa which was also the basis for the breathtaking 13part animated series THE HAKKENDEN 1990. Elements of the story also turn up in the original 'Dragon Ball' animated TV series.".

Being one of the country's very traditional legends stolen from China the writers drew from literary sources to make their movie and it shows. The movie has heaping doses of melodrama decapitations and dead children. It also has characters dressed like a costume shop exploded giant flying snakes hanging by ropes a truly terrible 70's power ballad love song and a plot so stereotypically Japanese it can be considered prototypical.None of that is to say that the movie is bad. All of those things add to the ambiance of the movie. It also contains incredible special effects for 1983 some of the moments are surprisingly poignant and the fight scenes are great. The plot may be telegraphed from a mile away but it is still entertaining to watch it all unfold. If you are at all a fan of Japanese culture you have seen this movie before in one way or another. Yet if this sounds at all appealing to you you owe it to yourself to see the original. Satomi Hakkenden deserves a larger spot in great camp history.".

You have been warned!Much of what I could say about this movie has already been said by other reviewers with some minor exceptions.Story elements  for example turning the group of captive women into magic temptresses with poisonous breath  get introduced and then dropped or brought back for a few seconds' cameo at best the poisonous women turn out quite pathetic achieving only one kill among them. Also if you've seen this movie and watched the scene where the entire backstory is explained via scroll you will know what I mean when I say whatever happened to the dog? The reincarnated princess gets her father's lightsaber I mean her predecessor's flute but the dog puts in no reappearance as a dog or as a human unless I missed something very subtle about either Hiroyuki Sanada's or Sonny Chiba's characters... and he was shall we say rather important to the original princess. And although the tragic female ribbon dancerswordfighter far classier than her descendant ORen Ishii gets relatively little screen time it's still more than the later additions to the group get in terms of character development or backstory which is practically none. Chiba doesn't even get one line of clichd surprise that two of the crystalholders are a woman and a young boy. I can only conclude that the movie was written and edited under the same sort of chemical influence required to fully enjoy it.I also believe that Sanada must have had a clause in his contract requiring his thighs to be on display at all times. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Indeed in one scene he falls to the ground unconscious and Chiba slings him over his shoulder and carries him toward the camera. Sanada's butt and thighs occupy the center of shot for a surprisingly long time before the director cuts away. So there are indeed redeeming moments in this movie. Another is when the group has defeated the giant centipede demon which had approached them disguised as an old woman and one of the samurai astutely remarks THAT wasn't your mother! A sidenote as much as the movie borrows from Lucas which is quite a lot he seems to have borrowed back from it for aspects of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The demon matriarch's headgear wouldn't look a bit out of place on Queen Amidala in The Phantom Menace and Lucas does the droppedstoryelement midichlorians anyone? and underdevelopedcharacter wuxia master Ray Park as Darth Maul the assorted villains  Jango Fett Count Dooku General Grievous most of the Jedi Council routines like a master.One point for having Sonny Chiba in it there are other elements in this movie that show up in Kill Bill in whose first volume Chiba has a small honorific role. One point for Hiroyuki Sanada's butt. One point for strong female characters. One point for the interesting sociological fact that apparently evil undead demon clans have no incest taboos. It is however a mystery to me why the matriarch is attracted to her son who is sort of the medieval Japanese Jame Gumb. Minus several million for the soundtrack. I found myself devoutly hoping that the writer and singer of those godawful pop ballads would be crushed in the destruction of the castle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although based on a classic Japanese novel Legend of Eight Samurai owes an awful lot to the work of George Lucas with plenty of moments inspired by ie. borrowed from Hollywood blockbusters Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back with even the occasional nod to Raiders of the Lost Ark but hey that's OK because George owes a lot of his success to Japanese cinema. What goes around comes around as they say.An epic fantasy tale of good versus evil complete with gorgeous princess handsome heroes and a wicked villain in a heavily guarded fortress this is unashamed popcorn action aimed at an international market. A great cast including Japanese action legend Sonny Chiba international star Hiroyuki Sanada and the extremely cute Hiroko Yakushimaru spectacular stunts from Chiba's Japan Action Club flashy special effects and brisk direction from Kinji Fukusaku ensure that the film is consistently fun throughout despite the somewhat random nature of the plot and a running time that clocks in at well over two hours. Fukusaku also manages to lend the whole thing a touch of class with his stylish visuals giving those of an artistic bent something to appreciate amidst the film's many crowdpleasing battles.NB. For what sounds like ideal family fare there is a touch of surprisingly gruesome imagery and some brief nudity which may deter those looking for something nonoffensive to entertain the kiddies. For me though a witch tearing her face off the occasional decapitation and the sight of a naked woman bathing in blood only added to my overall enjoyment.".

	onyx:emotionText "Although based on a classic Japanese novel Legend of Eight Samurai owes an awful lot to the work of George Lucas with plenty of moments inspired by ie. borrowed from Hollywood blockbusters Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back with even the occasional nod to Raiders of the Lost Ark but hey that's OK because George owes a lot of his success to Japanese cinema. What goes around comes around as they say.An epic fantasy tale of good versus evil complete with gorgeous princess handsome heroes and a wicked villain in a heavily guarded fortress this is unashamed popcorn action aimed at an international market. A great cast including Japanese action legend Sonny Chiba international star Hiroyuki Sanada and the extremely cute Hiroko Yakushimaru spectacular stunts from Chiba's Japan Action Club flashy special effects and brisk direction from Kinji Fukusaku ensure that the film is consistently fun throughout despite the somewhat random nature of the plot and a running time that clocks in at well over two hours. Fukusaku also manages to lend the whole thing a touch of class with his stylish visuals giving those of an artistic bent something to appreciate amidst the film's many crowdpleasing battles.NB. For what sounds like ideal family fare there is a touch of surprisingly gruesome imagery and some brief nudity which may deter those looking for something nonoffensive to entertain the kiddies. For me though a witch tearing her face off the occasional decapitation and the sight of a naked woman bathing in blood only added to my overall enjoyment.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of many Japanese sword and fantasy films but in that genre it stands out. This comes as no real surprise since it is directed by Kinji Fukasaku who is one of the masters of Japanese cinema. But if you are looking for a masterpiece here you won't find it. There are many flaws. The character development is nonexistent and even silly. One character who had been a bloody killer of women and children suddenly reforms. His explanation I heard a flute and it awoke something inside me. Well don't let that or any of the many plot holes bother you. It is simply not that kind of movie. And you probably won't notice these flaws anyway because you will be so wrapped up in the excellent action sequences that you won't care. Fukasaku uses his considerable skills to pull out all the stops on pure entertainment. Aside from the action sequences the special effects are excellent and the production values are high.Fukasaku was known for getting the best from his players and this is no exception. Among the actors Sonny Chiba is up to his usual antics here but Fukasaku brings out a certain charm that makes him a plausible romantic lead. Hiroko Yakushimaru plays the female lead. In this type of film her type of character is usually just a pretty face that other more interesting characters revolve around. But she takes the role beyond this and is not only beautiful but charming and exciting. She gives the character a kind of positive energy that makes her character interesting and can't help but make you smile. The other characters also represent themselves well.What really makes the film work is the pace. It is quick and pulls carries you through the story so that you don't notice its flaws. And really do these flaws matter that much? To a purist perhaps but a purist would miss the obvious good time of watching this film. So just let the film carry you away into that fantasy land that we all need to go to once in a while. It is fun and refreshing. Enjoy  it is one of the best rides like it that you can find.".

Unfortunately the elements of the film fail to tie together into a good coherent film.The movie deals with a princess destined to destroy some evil undead guys unfortunately they're not zombies which are always Bmovie gold.  Told through a confusing Chinese manuscript back story she is apparently the reincarnation of a martyred girl from generations ago.  Over the course of 133 long minutes she is joined by the titled eight warriors although I think only two of them even come close to being samurai... including Sonny Chiba as the typical fighterdude a huge cavedweller and his son a female ninja assassin and an evil general who sees the light side...or something.As earlier mentioned this movie is one of those martialarts epics that attempts to cram everything that should be cool into one twohour feature. This story might work exceedingly well as a video game Final Fantasy anyone? but just as FINAL FANTASY THE SPIRITS WITHIN failed to convey a sense of a coherent world LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI also tends to focus more on poorly conceived set pieces and monsters than atmosphere and action.  There are a few good moments to be found in the ending storm of the badguy fortress but the sacrifices made and the triumph attained mean nothing to the viewer due to the huge amount of material thrown in their face.  My rating 610".

	schema:reviewBody "At two hours and ten minutes LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI could do with some serious pruning especially in the romantic scenes which seem to last forever. Yes some producer or another saw this actionadventure romp and decided to appeal to the teenage girl audience by throwing in plenty of love scenes which only serve to slow down the pace for us redblooded males. The worst scene in the film is undoubtedly the lovemaking in the cave which seems to go on and on and on forever. To make matters worse in the English dubbed version a cheesy pop song plays out over the action which has scant regard for the subject matter of the film. If you think a similar moment in LUST FOR A VAMPIRE is bad just wait until you see this.Anyway I digress. LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI is a lengthy epicfeeling STAR WARS ripoff with a popular fantasy theme. Influences about from George Lucas' aforementioned space opera to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and even CONAN THE BARBARIAN. Director Kinji Fukasaku is the man responsible for MESSAGE FROM SPACE another STAR WARS ripoff and here he is dedicated to delivering a straightforward historical romp complete with a colourful palette and some distinguished actors. And unfortunately it's one of those deeply flawed movies which alternates between crashing boredom and ultimate entertainment a movie where the budget is saved for the finale and the first ninety minutes is really a time waste. In a film where eight samurais team up to save a kidnapped princess it really isn't a good idea to wait until the LAST FIFTH of your movie until the scene where they actually attack. There isn't even any characterisation in the long hours beforehand the characters just wander around and interact occasionally.The film wins points by being imaginative when it comes to the fantasy aspects. There's an undead witch dissolutions an evil statue magic glowing crystals a huge giant rubbery snake  a cool effect inspired by the aforementioned Schwarzenegger flick  and the cheesiest fakestlooking giant centipede that you'll ever bear witness to. Throw in some gorgeous girls who have poisoned blood and breath and a surprising display of nudity and gore watch out for the witch bathing naked in blood like Ingrid Pitt in COUNTESS Dracula numerous decapitations skin grafts and gory impalements and you have one heck of a kid's movie that would never get made in the west! As mentioned the cast is a quality one. Yakushimaru and Sanada are emotive leads even if such emoting is out of place in a movie like this. Sonny Chiba is of course the best thing in the movie and the scenes where he gets to kick backside are dynamic. The supporting cast are all pretty good even if the characters are wooden and prove to be little more than attractive scenery waiting to get bumped off at the end of the film. And what an end this film has. The last thirty minutes alone contain some of the most exciting action and destruction I've seen in a long time. It had me cheering on the lead characters. Rated on its own this ending would deserve the highest score but sadly the long mindnumbing buildup drags the overall quality down. Still if you want to see dozens upon dozens of Darth Vaderlookalike bad guy henchmen getting chopped up with swords and picks a massive set getting destroyed via some nifty SFX and tons of bloodshed and heroics then the last thirty minutes are for you. This is a colourful and crazy enough film to warrant a look!".

	onyx:emotionText "At two hours and ten minutes LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI could do with some serious pruning especially in the romantic scenes which seem to last forever. Yes some producer or another saw this actionadventure romp and decided to appeal to the teenage girl audience by throwing in plenty of love scenes which only serve to slow down the pace for us redblooded males. The worst scene in the film is undoubtedly the lovemaking in the cave which seems to go on and on and on forever. To make matters worse in the English dubbed version a cheesy pop song plays out over the action which has scant regard for the subject matter of the film.

However for its longwinded running time this gaudy Japanese 80s even though it looks older than that period ninja fantasy hokum just doesn't deliver enough of it. Sometimes fairly ponderous especially the journey part gathering all the 8 ninjas but many distractions finds its way in. Like the godawful outofsync dubbing. The tasty dialogues are outrageously daft but the dubbing only tops it off. It's funny especially the outtheplace tones in the voices. One character goes about discussing his regrets where he killed women and children and for some reason the dubbed voice seems so gleeful despite the sorrowfilled actions. Although there's a wry smile evident. Then we get these retro guitar riffs electronic beeps and power ballads finding its way in. Talk about painful namely the corny American induced power ballads. You know it accompanies the lovemaking sequences or scenes of utter happiness. To balance out the cheese. We get colourful costumes plastic armour hokey sets important historical picture stories curses aplenty blood bathing hysterical screaming evil cackling puffedup sulking delicious snake eating heartfelt flute playing magical crystals an demon rock with flickering lights voices from beyond the grave a gigantic flying snake and centipede yep it's a sight to behold glowing bow and arrow set and excitingly kinetic action setpieces of martial arts combat. It's very well staged with some atmospheric encounters early on and plenty of scope within its framing but it doesn't really fire in to full gear until it reaches its unsparingly climatic battle of good vs. evil. The stilted plot is dramatic but at the same time a complete mess involving tragedy witchcraft romance and one's fate in almost capturing a surreal daytime serial vibe to it all. Must have been the music soundtrack. Hey was that a car horn I just heard too? The villains are sinister exaggeratedly zany and pure comic quality. You know they just build themselves up being so evil for one great fall. The 8 samurais ah I mean ninjas had some interesting drawings albeit stereotypical but their character arches are never truly expanded on. Disappointing. Instead more time is spent on the two young leads which starred Hiroyuki Sanada. The performances are okay with Sonny Chiba making an appearance. Directed by Kinji Fukasaku who would be known for Battle Royale there are some interesting visuals and charming special FX despite the scratchy lowbudget look. Daftly out of sorts but fun junky nonsense.There's no power on this earth that can destroy us. Wrong!".

The religious epic with its idealized figures takes up the narrative in flashback and ends with Gopa kneeling before Gautama asking to become his disciple.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an easily watched and enjoyed film for its portrait of premodern India. This is the film that kicked off Indian cinema! It claims that its actors actually held nonacting careers but took time off for the film creating an entirely new industry in India. The cinematography is great and it seems that several of the actors went on to be directors and producers. We also have a cast of thousands hired hands from the colonial streets mystics and fruit sellers. The director claims that no sets or mockups were made and no makeup was used a unique sort of claim for the 1920s was this the first Dogme 95 film?On the subject of the life of Buddha which I'm most qualified to comment on this film is a little weird so I subtract just a little from its ranking for that. For a story which is meant to teach Buddhist audiences about the twin vices of wealth and asceticism the film seems to relish its display of royal splendor a little much and unfamiliar aspects of the Buddha story are emphasized for the Imperial British audience. But this does seem to demonstrate how different aspects of the Buddha's story interest people of different places and times and how the Orientalist tastes of the 1920s differ wildly from our own. So I can't be too harsh on what's actually a very interesting part of the film.Also occasionally a great image of Buddhism shines through for example Siddartha looking at her wife only to be shocked by a vision the poverty implied in her wealth and a vision of the old age that awaits her in the future. The scene that follows this is chilling and worth watching and excerpting.I was shocked to see the filmmakers unchain and let loose a real cheetah to kill a deer for a hunting scene most of the scenes are not so dangerous as that one but none of them were monitored by the ASPCA and the differences are apparent. Sensitive viewers will find that Buddha is just as aggrieved about this as they are.".

Much of the excitement of the story seems to revolve around the preparation and delivery of the suit cases and the spy and counter spy activities.My reason for choosing this film was to see more of the work of Klaus Kinski an explosive personality if ever there was one but in this film he was very much in control. In the role of Kurtz he is responsible for selecting Charlie Diane Keaton to spy among the Palestinians.  Charlie being a superb actress could handle the job expertly using her feminine charms.The film has a very large cast...too large in fact...and one tends to get lost amongst all the characters trying to remember which are the Israelis and which are the Palestinians.The film literally starts with a bang and the search is on to find the perpetrators.  As the tension mounts and the bombs explode one keeps asking Who will be next?One cannot visualize a happy ending for such a film.  While it makes exciting viewing the tragedy is that lives are still being lost each day as the confrontation continues and hopes of peace seem to become even more remote.".

It's a little hard to follow if you don't know much about the world of IsraeliPalestinian conflict but provides quite an education by its end.It begins with the assassination bombing of an Israeli diplomat and family and then jumps to an American stage actress Charlie Diane Keaton who's currently living in Britain.  She is ideologically a supporter of the Palestinian cause.  She has a problem with falling in love easily and sympathizing with her lover.  You begin to see the wheels turning in Israeli intelligence as they research and try to react to this most recent terrorist bombing.They skillfully recruitseduce her by pretending to support the Palestinian movement.  To be effective in their scheme they need someone authentic. They try to get under her skin and into her personal psyche why she is an actress pain in her life.  Klaus Kinski is superb as the head of the Israeli intelligence effort.After feeling more confident they put her work to infiltrate the Palestinianbacked terrorist camps to ultimately get to the almost impossible to find bomber Khalil.  This involves serious physicalmilitary training.  She excels and is given more and more trusted tasks as the story progresses.  The story takes many twists and is very detailed and realistic in it's portrayal of both sides.  It gets a little heavy but is fascinating to watch unfold even a second time.I give it a solid recommendation.".

When he writes a book or story he is thinking of certain actors that will can bring his characters to life.I must admit that the script and casting for Little Drummer Girl were good enough however casting Diane Keaton in a part that was intended for Judy Davis a powerful actor destroyed most of the potential of a movie that could have garnered several Academy Awards. Diane Keaton is a nice sweet little woman and she was pleasant in Annie Hall and that is all that she is capable of doing. Diane Keaton playing Charlie a radical leftwing English actress was absurd and at best a travesty of the original story.It was an ordeal watching Diane Keaton in this movie missing 90 percent of the potential of the part she was given!".

To paraphrase Sidney Bruhl Michael Caine in Deathrap 1982 it's a story so good a bad director can't fk it up. Check out the other comments I agree with them. Klaus Kinski is great he chews the scenery and the supporting cast are all minigems. I was trying to decide if I liked Yorgo Voyagis and I do. He may be too still for some people but I believe Diane when she falls in love with him. And he has haunted eyes when he has to do bad things which are necessary for the Cause. Diane Keaton is so miscast. She's too old she can't be an American doing St. Joan in England! She's good but she can't be Charlie she just can't.

To paraphrase Sidney Bruhl Michael Caine in Deathrap 1982 it's a story so good a bad director can't fk it up. Check out the other comments I agree with them. Klaus Kinski is great he chews the scenery and the supporting cast are all minigems. I was trying to decide if I liked Yorgo Voyagis and I do. He may be too still for some people but I believe Diane when she falls in love with him. And he has haunted eyes when he has to do bad things which are necessary for the Cause. Diane Keaton is so miscast. She's too old she can't be an American doing St. Joan in England! She's good but she can't be Charlie she just can't. Maybe Helena BonhamCarter or Vanessa Redgrave when she was young oh heck there must be hundreds of english actresses slavering for this role at that time.Nevertheless I love the movie despite Diane Keaton she does a good job it's just I can't buy her in the role!.";

In THE LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL we see a fifth motive used Screenwriter's Fiat.Charlie a little proPalestinian Jane Fonda wannabe is kidnapped by the Israeli Mossad humiliated and offered the job of spying on Palestinian terrorists.  She accepts because um because well the screenwriter says so.  Okay so there's a vague effort to make us believe that Charlie's in love with one of the Mossad agents but since her attraction to him was based entirely on the belief that he was a romantic dashing leader of the Palestinian revolution' there's no basis for her to continue being attracted to him once she learns he's a spy for the Israelis whom she hates.I'm not sure any woman in the world is quite so easily manipulated as Charlie in this movie.  If such a woman really exists anywhere why on earth would anyone want her as an intelligence agent?  Anyone who can be convinced to change sides that easily once can surely be convinced to do so a second time.  You wouldn't dare let her out of your sight for ten seconds and as for allowing her to join a Palestinian terrorist training camp where she'd be out of sight and in the presence of her old friends for months on end forget about it.  It's absurd.  If I were politically correct I would call it a misogynist movie but that would probably be unfair.  There's no evidence that director George Roy Hill imagined Charlie's weakness and stupidity to be typical of all women.It's a shame that Charlie is neither a believable nor a likeable heroine because in every other respect THE LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL is a great spy movie. I can't say precisely how realistic it is technically but it feels authentic at every turn.  The brutal interrogations of the captured terrorist and the intense multilayered surveillance of Charlie ring very true. There's no onemanarmy James Bond crap here the Israelis assign a full squad of spies to every job.  More importantly it gives us the psychological feel of the espionage profession.  The stock in trade of professional spies is the betrayal of loyalty and the abuse of friendship. Naturally this does not make for likeable characters however much one may admire the cause for which they work.  Hill does not attempt to sugarcoat this he shows it to us as it is.Diane Keaton should not be blamed for failing to make her ridiculous character convincing she is clearly doing the best she can and quite probably the best that anyone could have.  Klaus Kinski steals every scene he gets as Mossad master agent Marty Kurtz.  David Suchet gets a fine small role as a terrorist thug.THE LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL is a fine example of how outstanding supporting performances dedication and sincerity you rarely find movies this honest in Hollywood anymore can rescue a movie whose protagonist is badly written. It's not half the movie it could have been but it's a good movie anyway.Rating   out of .Recommendation  See it on video or DVD with your friends.".

Neither the difficulty of a bystander drawn into violent conflict in the Middle East e.g. Eva Marie Sainte in Exodus nor the violence nor the espionage presents anything novel to the viewer.And there is one central problem that outlined by Daniel Baker below in his review. The movie's central charge is that promiscuous Western women are fools and will in exchange for a pleasant lunch be willing accomplices to any violence anyone has in mind. Thus the initial killings in the movie are caused by a Swedish girl. Why? She enjoyed sex with the terrorist who enjoined her to do so  after she met him at a club. The protagonist Diane Keaton's character suddenly and dramatically changes the politics of a lifetime  due to a pleasant lunch and evening with an Israeli member of Mossad  even though she realizes that the Israeli deliberately caused her to believe he was another. Indeed it's telling that Keaton's character came to adore one hooded man due to a short talk he gives another because he gives her a pleasant lunch and subverts the entire objective of her mission after she has slept with a third man. The statement OH! He's cute presages a complete change of life for any woman.One is tempted to be kind and think that presenting ongoing Palestinian terrorism was novel when this was released in 1984 but we'd seen Exodus Cast a Giant Shadow and others long before. Both are more interesting movies. Moreover it had been a dozen years since everyone had watched the Munich Olympics' kidnapping it was 36 years after the Arabs in Palestine began their campaign of terror against the new state of Israel and a century after the Arabs began to terrorize the Jews in Palestine. SPOILERS  Another problem I had with this movie is the completely different reaction of Keaton's character to witnessing the killing of her friendcoworker in Lebanon and her witness of the killing of the man she had worked throughout the movie to trap and kill. Why is she not unhinged by the former  but devastated by the death of her mission's enemy? One would think people who had spent long periods in terrorist camps would be inured to this sort of thing  and moviegoers have seen aplomb in the face of such violence in movies so frequently that her reaction at the end of the film  seems strange. SPOILERS END   This attempt to mix romance with a story about terrorism didn't work. There's too little real suspense  and since we hardly see any romance merely a woman who makes a fool of herself with each good looking man we have a very hard time sympathizing with her. Moreover we hardly SEE any romance  simply a puppylike enthusiasm about possible mates.In some respects this movie should have been rejiggered to be expressly about the Keaton character's sad loneliness about her pathetic yearning to marry in incipient middle age. Then the movie would make more sense of why she falls for anyone from anywhere with a smile  and she'll do anything including participation in terrorist training camps to win his favor  and when she likes another she'll reverse course. The problem is that pity for the main character does not easily yield moment by moment to sympathy with a fool.  It's not very good.".

A choice the entire production never could overcome. Although a good actress Keaton was about 15 years too old for the role of an ingnue who becomes the obsession of a terrorist and her pronounced New York accent was too much at times.The movie follows the novel very closely perhaps too closely for it's own good. It should nave been about 20 minutes shorter. Still even at it's full length the screenplay misses the most interesting moment in the book where the reader is left to ponder if Charlie has truly joined the movement and was ready to kill for the terrorist group she had infiltrated.The actual production seemed a bit on the cheap side. It appears the director wanted a look of reality but by 80s standards that meant filming on location using real streets with little local activity to get in the way.The rest of the cast except for Klaus Kinski's star turn is totally forgettable.Finally over the years I've come to realize The Little Drummer Girl was a story that was best served on the written page. Too much of the story is internalized in Charlie's mind and that personal struggle is not easily translated to film.".

The story concerns the labyrinthine politics of the Middle East and the main character's unsuccessful attempt to make any sense of the issues involved.Unintentionally 'The Little Drummer Girl' reflects the American bewilderment at understanding the almost tribal loyalties of the political situation between Jews and Arabs which it still finds virtually impossible to comprehend. This is a facile rendering of issues that perhaps are too serious to be regurgitated as entertainment for the masses and for this reason 'Little Drummer Girl' is to say the least disappointing. It does not escape me that I am writing this at the time of the Egyptian uprising of January 2011. The film opens in the provinces of England where a young American actress Diane Keaton is plying her trade on the stage an unknown personality but pretty and talented. She attends a local meeting of Palestinian sympathisers and is recruited to the Palestinian cause as a secret agent. Or so it seems. The meeting was merely a front for the secret Israeli Mossad agency and she is in fact expected to help the Mossad find a socalled Palestinian terrorist who has escaped their socalled 'justice'. Naturally being an allAmerican red blooded girl she discovers the terrorist's whereabouts and falls in love with this dashing freedom fighter. Keaton then proceeds to blunder around London and the Middle East attempting to trap him because the Mossad is telling her that he is only a murderer of innocent civilians who is getting what he deserves. So feelings get mixed up with political conviction.If 'The Little Drummer Girl' is to believed not only this woman but most Americans in general are an extremely nave lot when it comes to understanding American foreign policy in the Middle East. The audience as well as Keaton are meant to feel foolish by the mechanics of the plot in which neither viewer nor protagonist is told a whit about what is going on amidst the mayhem of violence bombings and secret double crosses. 'The Little Drummer Girl' can't be accused of being a dull film on the contrary it expects too much from the audience there is too much story to take in there are no discernible heroics for the audience to cheer on as both sides Arab and Israeli appear to be ruthless and untrustworthy and the main character is vacillating constantly left uninformed and is constantly making the wrong decisions when it comes to trusting any individual. As the audience is meant to identify with her they end up feeling the same way ie out of their comfort zone which is not a good thing for an audience to be feeling.For Diane Keaton this is a demanding part but I believe that she was miscast. To me a better choice would have been someone with more cojones perhaps Susan Sarandon or even Jessica Lange who was probably too young for the part anyway. Klaus Kinski makes up for this miscasting as he has an important role as the chief of Mossad a wily character who manages to make the Mossad seem likable and their reactionary politics tolerable for a piece of escapism which this is despite its pretensions toward being something more important.Directed by George Roy Hill this was once available on rental video but I have not seen it anywhere else. 'The Little Drummer Girl' is little more than the sum of its shortcomings. It's about an important subject and it tries to take that subject seriously its production values are high there's plenty of action as well as plot and for such onerous subject matter the film is reasonably entertaining. It's a good example of how a film can still retain its entertainment value as a genre entry and remain something that is worth seeing for curiosity value but it would be a mistake to indicate that it signified anything more than that.If anyone was to accuse 'The Little Drummer Girl' of being Hollywood propaganda I would not attempt to argue with them.".

Her role will be to get close to the terrorist by claiming to be the girlfriend of the terrorist's brother. She is proPalestinian so will she play along or not? Does she even want to get involved? It is not obvious as to why Charlie chooses as she does. I think that while she supports the Palestinian cause she does not condone their bombings. Later when she gets to know the terrorist responsible for the bombings she is swayed back towards favoring the terrorists but perhaps not all the way back. As typical with spy stories characters are not always who they seem to be but it isn't that difficult to follow. The only character whose true identity is in question is Charlie and that is partly the role she is asked to play in the plot and partly her ambivalence and uncertainty as to what she should do.Diane Keaton is excellent as Charlie and the rest of the cast are also terrific.".

For those who have seen few if any 1980s movies and think anything older than a decade can't be all that good I should remind you that 'The Godfather' is 30 years old. In the same year as 'Little Drummer Girl' the following movies were released The Terminator Blood Simple The Bounty Tightrope. Granted 1984 was not a year rich for good movies except the ones I mentioned.Diane Keaton gives a solid performance. Klaus Kinski excels at being a cold 'so and so'. If you have an evening of Let's watch some old movies keep this one in mind. For those who like more recent LeCarr's movies there's always 'The Tailor Of Panama' and the soon to be released on DVDBlue Ray 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. The earliest one I've seen and a classic it is watch 'The Spy Who Came n from The Cold'. As my summary statesimplies 'Little Drummer Girl' is easier to follow than other LeCarr's novels on screen you simply don't need to think as much to figure where it is going or how you got to wherever you are in the story.

	schema:headline " The poignant sweet story of Andula one of Milos Foreman's fine warm and subversive movies";
	schema:reviewBody "Milos Forman's Loves of a Blonde is a wonderful movie...sweet and awful. Sweet because Forman gives us no one we can dislike as he tells us the story of Andula Hana Brejchova a young factory worker in the depressing town of Zruc making endless pairs of shoes alongside dozens of other young women. Not Milda Vladimir Puchott the young piano player who comes to town with a band seduces Andula and then leaves for Prague. Not the factory bosses or the other young women who are bored and eager for husbands they outnumber the men 16 to one. Not even the regiment of aging smoking unattractive soldiers who were based in Zruc to lower the odds a bit. Not Milda's parents who one day find Andula at their apartment door suitcase in hand because she gave her heart to Milda and took him seriously when he told her to come visit him in Prague sometime. And awful in a desperate sort of way because Forman let's us see the lives all these people live in a Communist society that is petty officious and incompetent. We can smile at a lecture an older woman gives the young factory girls about maintaining their honor and dignity with boys we can even smile when two young leaders stand up and call for a vote to dedicate all of them to this idea and we can smile when every girl in the room raises her hand to vote in favor none against and none abstaining. Then we realize it might not be a good idea to snicker at a vote in favor of honor when a boss thinks it would be a good idea. There are two long set pieces in the movie that are terrific. The first is a dance in town held by officials so that the soldiers can meet the girls. We move around with the camera listening in to the appalled girls as they really see these desperate coarse guys and listening to the guys as they eye the girls drink for courage and in one case surreptitiously remove a wedding ring and then dropping it on the floor for all to see. There's that safe chirpy dance music...the angling to get a girl to take a walk in the woods...the possibility that the bored girl will agree. The second set piece is in Milda's apartment in Prague. Andula has arrived unannounced. Milda is playing with the band at a nightspot and there are only Milda's parents to welcome her. And welcome they don't. They've heard nothing about her. It's clear Milda is in for a surprise when he gets home that night. Milda's mother is not someone you'd want for a motherinlaw. Milda's father is more realistic but not exactly comforting. Their apartment is a living space of ancient appliances chipped paint and doilies. The nagging opinions of the mother and the exasperated gruffness from the father make us smile. Of course they have the opposite effect on Andula who now is close to tears. Forman seems to be quietly pointing out to us what living in Communist Czechoslovakia has come to mean. Poor Andula. Will she have a happy future with Milda? Or will she return to Zruc...wiser perhaps but with nothing better ahead for her. Watch the movie and hope for the best. Andula a nice person. Loves of a Blonde is so poignant and sweet it hurts a little. Forman used mainly nonactors for most the roles and he had a genius for either eliminating their selfconsciousness or for making it work in the context of the story. The movie at the basic level of storytelling is effective because the people from Andula to the bit parts of people at the dance look and act like people who aren't acting. We wind up liking most of them and feeling indulgent toward the rest. The Communist regime eventually caught on to the picture of life in Czechoslovakia which Forman presented with such apparent good humor in Loves of a Blonde and The Firemen's Ball. It was happy to see Forman leave the country during the crackdown in 1968. Anyone who thinks Forman when he came to America lost his subversive sympathy for people who are at the mercy of institutions and governments needs to watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Ragtime or The People vs. Larry Flynt.".

We can smile at a lecture an older woman gives the young factory girls about maintaining their honor and dignity with boys we can even smile when two young leaders stand up and call for a vote to dedicate all of them to this idea and we can smile when every girl in the room raises her hand to vote in favor none against and none abstaining. Then we realize it might not be a good idea to snicker at a vote in favor of honor when a boss thinks it would be a good idea. There are two long set pieces in the movie that are terrific. The first is a dance in town held by officials so that the soldiers can meet the girls. We move around with the camera listening in to the appalled girls as they really see these desperate coarse guys and listening to the guys as they eye the girls drink for courage and in one case surreptitiously remove a wedding ring and then dropping it on the floor for all to see. There's that safe chirpy dance music...the angling to get a girl to take a walk in the woods...the possibility that the bored girl will agree. The second set piece is in Milda's apartment in Prague. Andula has arrived unannounced. Milda is playing with the band at a nightspot and there are only Milda's parents to welcome her. And welcome they don't. They've heard nothing about her. It's clear Milda is in for a surprise when he gets home that night. Milda's mother is not someone you'd want for a motherinlaw. Milda's father is more realistic but not exactly comforting. Their apartment is a living space of ancient appliances chipped paint and doilies. The nagging opinions of the mother and the exasperated gruffness from the father make us smile. Of course they have the opposite effect on Andula who now is close to tears. Forman seems to be quietly pointing out to us what living in Communist Czechoslovakia has come to mean. Poor Andula. Will she have a happy future with Milda? Or will she return to Zruc...wiser perhaps but with nothing better ahead for her. Watch the movie and hope for the best. Andula a nice person. Loves of a Blonde is so poignant and sweet it hurts a little. Forman used mainly nonactors for most the roles and he had a genius for either eliminating their selfconsciousness or for making it work in the context of the story. The movie at the basic level of storytelling is effective because the people from Andula to the bit parts of people at the dance look and act like people who aren't acting. We wind up liking most of them and feeling indulgent toward the rest. The Communist regime eventually caught on to the picture of life in Czechoslovakia which Forman presented with such apparent good humor in Loves of a Blonde and The Firemen's Ball. It was happy to see Forman leave the country during the crackdown in 1968. Anyone who thinks Forman when he came to America lost his subversive sympathy for people who are at the mercy of institutions and governments needs to watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Ragtime or The People vs. Larry Flynt.";

In a big country that's one of the nationally accepted stereotypes. But in a small country it's often the story about what it means to be Cuban Romanian Czech.Its exaggerated by the fact that films themselves are distilled stories which become divorced from context when viewed later and far away. But I do think I can see into the soul of Swedes and Poles when I see unique trends in the better crafted films from those areas. That's why its so interesting when the Norweigian soul seems so distinct from the Swedes. And the Czech soul so radically different from the Polish. Its a matter of the Polish character that the world is essentially defined by human existence and humans are defined by essential goodness. This gives a delicate filigree of interaction that underlies everything else including government religion which is always the church and other humantriggered disruption. Polish films enter into what it means to be human always choosing the most lovely even holy notion of being.Czech films and life however seems to have completely different shuffle of the same layers. At root are the mechanics of God who instead of working with golden threads of human intent has his own ideas about pain confusion and testing. Within this storm of fate humans try to sparkle bond love. But they are always fighting a storm God's storm sometimes facilitated by clueless but comfortable apparatchiks. Its nearly impossible to make a good film with these constraints with this national story because what works to define self doesn't work in packaging something that needs to stand alone.This may be the only Czech movie made in the country that finds a solution. Its strange and unfamiliar but it works. The key characteristic is that its rooted in the fact that there is no story. There cannot be a story. All real stories are hopeless and the best you can have if you are Czech are dreams about stories. The form of the narrative is extremely capricious we focus on different small groups apparently accidentally. Are they where the seed of thing will be planted and grow? The factory girls in their dreaming dormitory the factory owner with the bosses the aging reservists trying to score the pianist who plays the girl into bed the parents who annotate storytelling by wondering about the nature of story for 15 minutes. We end with the girl back with her dormmates not knowing whether she is recounting what we have seen or something rosier.Its an amazingly endearing story about the lack or stories about the desire from love with no ledges.It is unlike anything I have seen before save two films. And naturally they are by this same fellow. I except the disastrous Amandeus which like Mozart's music is all ornamentation and nothing else.If you rewatch Cuckoo's Nest and Man in the Moon against the context of the storyteller you'll find he is the character. He does allow the character in the story to bounce around in a void looking for some structure to use in weaving a self but he denies any reference excepting the rejection of what surrounds. They are both just glossy simple versions of this this perfect solution of making a story without stories.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " a gem of a film about girls wanting love";
	schema:reviewBody "At a club that looks more like a high school dance during the 60s in some remote factory town in Czechoslavokia three girls are trying not to make too much eye contact with three of the many soldiers who are in attendance. After much arguing and hesitation the three soldiers approach the girls not before ordering drinks for them that ended up at the next table of girls. But one of the girls the main character of the story has her eye on the young piano player. And with this Milos Forman's socially conscious oddball romantic tragic comedy called Loves of a Blonde gets rolling.The soldiers in spite of much persistence don't get the girls who end up going home bored and tired I mean except the main girl who ends up in a room with the piano player. Subtle humor and youthful and lustful recklessness are portrayed so precisely in this scene where the piano player cleverly gets the girl in bed before ranting about Prague and the girls resemblance to a Picassoesquire guitar.To cut a long story short the girl ends up falling for the guy and goes to visit him in Prague but ends up meeting his parents. The mother's and the father's argue for some time about the girls arrival for this is Eastern Europe and girls just don't come to a boys house to stay the night after a one night stand or maybe its like this.... So the mother and the father partake in some of the most entertaining dialog I've seen in any film about this girls arrival about their sons travels and job and ultimately about the issues prevalent to the times echoing an European conservative sentiment. The boy ends up coming home late after a gig and who knows what else and is met with much heat from his pants wearing mama and he claims to have never invited any girl...If I had to say something bad about this film at gun point I might say that it is too small. Its so compact and grounded and so simple. But then again without any gun to my face that is exactly what makes this film work. Its like a hidden little gem from the former commie infested corner of Europe.Forman is a true auteur and this film demonstrates it well. Its a study of youth in the need for love and overworked women in search of something unfamiliar and maybe life saving maybe city life more likely love and simply its about the need to find what you don't have. The factory filled with girls the soldiers the dance halls the parents the girls dormitory all paint a very real and comically tragic picture definitely worth seeing. 8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A movie in search of itself";
	schema:reviewBody "Loves of a Blonde for some obscene reason is listed as a comedy.Perhaps that was Milos Forman's intention when the movie was first released in 1965. I ask anyone who has seen the movie to please enlighten me on what was funny aside from the scene with Milda's parents which was more pathetic than humorous.What really makes the film intriguing is its unintentional voyeuristic quality. The Black  White film magnificently highlights the Czech countryside where we meet Andula  a worker in a local shoe factory. Andula and her friends outnumber the men by some ridiculous margin and the factory owner gets the People's Army to station soldiers there. Unfortunately the soldiers are old and mostly married. They have a party one night at a local bar and she meets Milda a musician with the band.The seduction scene between Milda and Andula takes up most of the film but everything about it still resonates today which is basically a guy will do or say anything to get into a girl's pants. Unfortunately Andula takes him seriously when he says to come visit him in Prague which she does.SPOILER ALERT Andula with suitcase in hand shows up at his home in Prague. What she doesn't know is that Milda lives with his parents. The father is actually a likable character who feels sorry for Andula. Milda's mother on the other hand gave me nightmares condescending controlling and downright creepy. Milda eventually comes home after seducing yet another girl and to his parents pretends not to know Andula and denies ever inviting her. When with Andula alone he's quite different. His mother eventually grabs him and throws him into the parents' bed to get some sleep. Mind you this is not a 4year old having a nightmare  this is a grown man who likes to seduce young virgins. Perhaps the comedy is in their trying to position themselves as they try to sleep which is hard considering its three adults and the mother refuses to shut up. All the while Andula is on the other side of the door listeningSPOILER ALERT Although Andula and Milda are quite fascinating as is the conditions and times they live in I was quite disappointed with its beyond ambiguous ending. Its as if the last pages of a book you were reading were ripped out. You see Andula back with her friends you have no clue how she got there and lying about how it was great seeing his parents. Duh??For style and historical content however I would recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a romantic comedy with some drama undertones made with charm and lots of style by a Milos Forman way before Amadeus and One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest this is a film made during his Czech phase which is also interesting. He's always a great director his films are very sharp and he knows exactly how to balance drama and comedy in a perfect composition looks like a great chemist and this film is quite a surprise if you consider his other works. But it is equally great! In Lsky Jedn Plavovlsky Loves of a Blonde Hana Brejchov plays Andula a pretty young girl living in a small city whose majority is formed by young girls like her waiting for a nice boy to appear. We follow Andula and her friends during a party where they are seen as object of adoration by three soldiers out of duty and way out the girls league since they're quite old for them but they insist with them dancing and paying a bottle of wine they don't even want. But in the same party there's Milda Vladimr Pucholt a young pianist interest in Andula also a persistent guy who liked Andula and keeps most part of the film trying to make a move on her. He'll be more successful than the soldiers but the destiny awaits some surprises for him...and for her too.Loves of a Blonde is a humored tale about a woman's journey to the discover of the first love the enchantments and disenchantment's of it but also about that old talk about woman's virtue the value of female honor in not hanging out with too many boys at the same time because this wasn't seen in good eyes by the society you'll see this in the school scene where the teacher says that to the girls and they make a pledge based on a elevated moral behavior. I quote as old talk because times are way different than the one presented in the film and people have another values in terms of almost everything so what was a something that only men could do now women can do too if they want if boys can date or kiss several girls girls can do the same. It's a quite updated view this film had back in the 1960's in showing Andula trying to not flirt with soldiers in one way but end up talking to them then later to have a romantic evening with Milda and...she already had a boyfriend as we discover way later. Even though some might condemn this kind of behavior in the film is presented without any vulgarity and without any excess it's well humored very simple and it doesn't demand much from the viewers to make them laugh laughter comes naturally with Loves of a Blonde. Among the best moments of the film are the soldier who lost his wedding ring in the ballroom during the party the whole segment of the party is funny with the unsure soldiers trying to make a move on the girls then the girls keep saying to themselves they don't the guys near them but can't stop looking at them Milda's insistent moves on Andula that even includes teaching her how to defend herself from guys like him the I don't have a girl in Prague quote Milda keeps saying trying to amuse the girl saying she's the only one in his life and segment with Andula visiting Milda's irritating parents although this moment got more irritating than funny specially because of the mom one of the most annoying characters ever presented in a film. Highly recommended. 1010".

	schema:headline " An Ironic Tragicomedy";
	schema:reviewBody "In Loves of a Blonde Milos Forman continued dealing with the same subjects he did in his first feature film Black Peter 1964 the aimless youth and the Czechslovakian society. After Loves of a Blonde he started working on his next film The Firemen's Ball 1966. Once the film was released it caused an incredible strife over ten thousand firemen announced a strike and Milos Forman was about to get sentenced to jail for 10 years. Fortunately Francois Truffaut the master of Nouvelle Vague helped Forman out of the trouble and so Forman went to United States where he has made some of his most remembered films such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus.Loves of a Blonde is often overlooked even that it is one of the finest representatives of Eastern Europe new wave or Novifilm. Alongside with Yugoslavian Dusan Makavejev and Czechslovakian Jiri Menzel Milos Forman was an integral auteur for the movement. It had the same cheer that the Nouvelle Vague did but the Novifilms were much more politically bold and took clear statements against the Communist government  due to which many of the films got banned.Loves of a Blonde is a cheerful tragicomedy. Its protagonist is a workingclass girl Andula who works at a shoe factory. One day she becomes acquainted with a young pianist to whom she falls in love with. The film is quite ruthless but also humane and Forman treats his characters with warm love. He accepts his characters as they are with their flaws and controversies. In the beginning he portraits a group of three middleaged army men who try to hit on three teenage girls. The soldiers are portrayed as dumb and selfthinking but also as humane sympathetic characters.It's strongly a social film. It portrays the 60's Czechslovakia as a dull place with nothing to do so people try to find their amusement from sexuality and other pleasures. The officers are stupid and selfish as is the society. The teenagers are also naive but try their best to survive. The first sequence where the men try to hit on the girls is brilliant and full of significance one man takes a wedding ring off his finger drops it and follows it as it goes through the dancing floor. The men try to send a bottle to the girls but the waiter messes up and takes the bottle to the wrong table. Nothing works.Loves of a Blonde is an ironic social film but also a warm story about love and soul searching. Its characters are lost in a country which has lost its course as well. Whether it's the middleaged men or the teenage girls or the young pianist no one really knows who they are. This is a basic tragicomic element in the films of the new wave. The film is clearly naturalism as it describes Czechslovakia as realistically as possible mud old clothes bad wine and cruddy vehicles. It's paradoxically truly a melancholy love story but also a cheer comedy.".

Why do I want to watch a movie about a slut? Loves of a Blonde huh?

In this film men treat women horribly. They act like lascivious lechers. I haven't seen such behavior in Czechoslovakia. In general men treat women quite well that's why feminism has never gained traction here.Oh by the way dialog in this film is idiotic and insipid.GOOD ASPECTS OF THE FILMThe film has some good scenes including the loss of the wedding ring at the dance as well as Milda and his parents arguing in bed together.CONCLUSIONIf you want to view truly excellent films about pleasant simplistic life in Communist Czechoslovakia see Ji Menzel's My Sweet Little Village and The Snowdrop Festival.".

Made when Malle was twentyfive with the young Jeanne Moreau to the romantic Sextette that Brahams wrote when he was 27 this was the perfect sexy romance for its time and place.I just saw it again now watching as a sixtysomething in an age in which Les Amants would probably get an R ratingand a tame one. I'm jaded too. It's hard to feel much sympathy for a desperate housewife of the upper middle class as she battles ennui. But the love sequence is still a knockout. You can't stop to think about it as the lovers who as yet barely know each other except for their terrific physical attraction go from gardentoboat to bedroom it's still erotic in its implication. the garden is too lovely to be true the boat is white and clean and Moreau wears her pearl necklace throughout but the message of a woman who has only known pedestrian sex being introduced for the first time to the Real Thing rang a bell with me I had a similar experience minus the garden the pearls and the boat. I sat there bawling my head off with nostalgia this time for an unrecoverable experience through the whole sequence.But the ending also rings true. What do you do when you come up for air?From one of the interviews on the CD I learned that the plot was based on an 18th century story and I can readily see that just as could see the findesicle Viennese origin of Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. In neither case does the contemporary updating of the tales make them any less effective.".

However here we have a married woman in the 1950s committing adultery not once but twice and without remorse. If Vivant and Malle had told their tale the accepted way the situation would have led to bloody murder and given the grim coldness between Jeanne and her husband that's exactly what the audience expects. But  SPOILER the authors opted for a happy ending. So of course they were seen as condoning adultery. Violence it seems would have been no big deal by comparison...Happy ending? Well not quite. Les Amants is odd in another respect while it is all about the transforming potential of falling in love it idealizes the process far less than most socalled romantic comedies do. As the blissful couple purr out of the picture in Bernard's 2CV we hear a sage voiceover comment on the uncertainty of their future. This echoes the background of the opening credits a fictitious map of the land of love depicting as far as my memory serves me a river named Affection passing through  many little hills such as Respect Dedication etc. far from the Lake of Indifference and flowing to a Dangerous Sea and to Terra Incognita. In this sense there's more to the story than beautiful socialite meets handsome young guy. This is no fairytale. It's about stuff like living in the moment openness and courage  and about the archetypal meeting of animus and anima. Or should I say projection? Fuhgeddabahdit!

	schema:reviewBody "In this director Louis Malle's second film which for awhile seems like it will be another high society soap opera a seemingly arbitrary plot detour occurs that places the beautiful Jeanne Moreau in a situation all the less convenient and all the more frustrating because of how accustomed she has become to her privilege. Consequently Moreau is less like a Sex and the City character and more of a realization that a social ladder does not leave problems below it. They follow you from decision to decision to decision. And the further up it she climbs the less considerate her decisions seem to be of the world outside of herself.As a 25yearold French director at the dawn of the New Wave he was not alone in satirizing and criticizing the bourgeoisie. Ironically being younger than fellow Nouveau filmmakers Godard and Truffaut as well as having been born into a wealthy industrialist family had no hand in blinding him by way of his privileged ego. Watching this biting romantic drama about adultery and the reality and illusion of rediscovering love I see that Malle understood the upperclass freedom of never having to worry about tomorrow and not only does he characterize it with an almost humorously frustrating edge he wisely satirizes love at first sight. The movie was made in 1958 but Malle's style has yet to garner an expiration date. There are no outdated lap dissolves or screen wipes or quick fadeouts. The controversy at the time surrounding this film's alleged obscenity had a rebounding effect on the flimsy subjectivity of society's accusations. He was simply being honest which he is in the aforementioned portrayals beyond the simple night of passionate love Moreau has with her lover. Instead of a coy imitation of a spectator blushing and looking away as many other films did and still do when the camera moves to the window or the ceiling Malle fixates on her ecstasy. Even now rarely do we see a close shot of a woman's sexual pleasure. A bit like Woody Allen would come to do in a few decades Malle tends to saturate his soundtracks with a single composer. Here it is Johannes Brahms whose music is a brilliantly and acutely intuitive choice for the film since much like the characters he has a classical sense of form and order yet he's bold in his exploration of harmony and rhythm.".

The black and white is more appropriate than colour for French film very captivating and unreal.What can you say about the French people? Desperados and aficionados of romance and love. Hopelessly romantics.Simple story told like a poem regardless of any moral criticism there is no such thing call moral or immoral in the realm of art. Art is a rival to morality it allows all sorts of existences. In this movie the sin is adultery but no one cares to condemn it the pursuit of love takes it all.

	onyx:emotionText "Crazy about French movies ever since I started watching them. The black and white is more appropriate than colour for French film very captivating and unreal.What can you say about the French people? Desperados and aficionados of romance and love. Hopelessly romantics.Simple story told like a poem regardless of any moral criticism there is no such thing call moral or immoral in the realm of art. Art is a rival to morality it allows all sorts of existences. In this movie the sin is adultery but no one cares to condemn it the pursuit of love takes it all.

	schema:reviewBody "Louis Malle's Les Amants is the most romantic film ever made. Screw subjectivity and critical judgment. I've just come off fresh from seeing it and in the spirit of the film I'll let my excitement wash over me instead of letting it die down to see it coolly. Seeing it gave me one of those precious moments moments where you gasp and go ohmygod disbelieving your eyes that cinema could go to places like this and make you feel things you never felt were possible in fiction.Buried within the Optimum Releasing of the Louis Malle box set but it emerges the most deafeningly romantic even when compared to the already celestial ending of the more famous Elevator to the Gallows. Its blissed out view on happiness makes it impossible to attach any critical adjectives to it it requires us to suspend all thinking faculties and just go with that one powerful emotion.It's amazing how it turns what could've looked like a cover of a chick romance novel into something this beautiful. Henri Decae who almost singlehandedly created the first images of the New Wave literally sets the screen aglow in ecstasy painting the two lovers in a heavenly light in that pivotal centerpiece which is one of the greatest moments of cinema bar none. Even Jean Vigo's L'Atalante holds nothing on this. There will be spoilers from hereon and I would urge you to stop reading this paragraph if you've not seen the film. The joy of discovery in this film is so much more than any other film I've experienced that I'm wholly convinced that one should experience this as fresh as a virgin. Stripped of their daily pretenses and graces the two lovers traverse a Godmade Eden becoming simply Man and Woman and reuniting again several millenia after the First Man and First Woman were expulsed from paradise. When Jeanne Moreau takes JeanMarc Bory's hand and asks him 'Is this the land you created for me to lose myself in?' the gaze is sealed and the viewer can do nothing but share in their passion. The two lovers become such eminent symbols of love sex and happiness that it's hard to imagine anything more sensual and erotic than this especially when compared to the fully colored and fully exposed sex symbols of today. They belong to an era removed from any other not the era that the film was made in but a blackandwhite pristine era that exists only in cinema one in which true love still exists without the moorings of reality.And the decided lack of moorings in this film is what makes it so bewitching. Whether it's the fleeting white horse or the eyes of the beautiful beautiful Jeanne Moreau the film doesn't look back but indulges fully in the moment that moment of sensuousness. It is so fitting that the film should be called Les Amants because anything else would be pretension  the lovers become the lovers of any era any millennium by their love alone they have been elevated to the great lovers that have long passed. They transcend being nature rules and become one  spirits entwined  with a world that is beyond the tangible such that any rational reasoning will not be understanding. It's a magical world a fantasy world a world that is as unreal as we want it to be real. And this world the film proposes can only be reached through a temporary moment of love unselfish immaterial illogical and unquestioning love. And when you're able to give yourself in together with the film it suddenly becomes so clear and not that unreal anymore.At the risk of sounding like a nut I just wanted to recommend this film to everyone who thought that this century has made us cynical. Cinema which began and evolved with this century has rarely stepped out of its time so gloriously that it becomes a monument a structure of those classical and probably impossible days. It is the single most ravishingly beautiful moment in the history of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jeanne played by Jeanne Moreau is a married mother and housewife in the provinces. Her husband Henri is handsome successful and cultured but also an arrogant stuffed shirt who seems indifferent to her unhappiness. She has little to do and is lonely at home. To divert herself she spends time with her shallow trendfollowing friend Maggie in Paris. She begins an affair with suave high society polo player Raoul but is still unfulfilled.Henri invites Raoul and Maggie over and in the course of the night makes the two of them seem ridiculous and sows discord between them and Jeanne. Raoul in particular is revealed as a lightweight whose dedication to starting a new life with Jeanne is destroyed by Henri's bourgeois solidity and ability to make their sham marriage seem real. Meanwhile Jeanne has gotten a ride home after her car broke down by a young handsome archaeologist Bernard. He is abrasive and immature but also sincere and romantic and the two fall in love. She is able to find happiness again in loving Bernard after years of boredom but the future of the lovers is uncertain.Jeanne Moreau is brilliant at depicting a woman who is bored and unfulfilled looking beautiful but not so secretly empty both in her fancy bourgeois house and in the childish diversions of Parisian fashionable circle. Alain Cuny as Henri is imposing and selfsatisfied as her husband who doesn't take Jeanne seriously feeling that he has the money and the power and is ultimately in control. Jose Luis de Villalonga as Raoul is convincing as a man who appears at first sophisticated and dapper but is actually weak and indecisive. Judith Magre as Maggy is somewhat overly comical as the shallow society friend. JeanMarc Bory as the young lover is very handsome and with his physical presence and warm gaze and smile convey the ideas of sincerity beauty and natural masculinity that can spark Jeanne's happiness although I felt that there was something lacking in his performance and chemistry with Jeanne to be totally convincing.There is something still impressive and challenging in the movie's depiction of Jeanne abandoning everything solid in her bourgeois life and even leaving the home where her child is growing up in a search for authenticity love and happiness. In particular the film feels still shocking in its refusal to condemn Jeanne with the expected moralizing ending.The relationship between the two lovers however seems somewhat unmotivated and abrupt. Even though we know that Jeanne is very unhappy and the stranger represents the sincerity missing from her life nevertheless the attraction doesn't feel convincing and it's even less clear why exactly Bernard chooses her. Bernard seems too good to be true and one keeps expecting him to reveal himself as flaky and regretting his whim.Then too the attack on bourgeois society in the person of Henri could be sharper. If one is young and rebellious and inclined to dislike people like Henri the critique might seem convincing. Otherwise one might find him relatively sympathetic  true he is not as warm and idealistic as Bernard but arguably his practicality stability and respectability have as much of a role to play in society.This is a good film that stands the test of time as interesting and worthy. Even if the sex scene in it is by no measure shocking nowadays it still is challenging in its depiction of a passion that shocks convention. It's not at the level of later films by Malle like The Fire Within or Lacombe Lucien that feel more complex and realistic but the focus on the feminine perspective gives it a special interest.".

Jeanne couldn't stop laughing at Bernard's calling her husband a bear? Puleeeeese! The sex scene considered racy in 1958  even prompting the arrest of an Ohio theater owner  looks tepid today. Even the drawnout seduction scene elicits yawns. Jeanne's muumuu is more Grimms Brothers than Victoria's Secret. And stretching out in that boat long abandoned in a bog? Ewww...cobwebs and creepy crawlers come to mind!A most distracting element to The Lovers is the moral vacuity of its leads. Presumably Jeanne is not mentally diminished and she had married Henri Alain Cuny clearly embodying one of film history's most thankless roles of her own free will and not at gunpoint. She hasn't been married long her daughter's small enough to be lifted and she lives in the lap of luxury in Dijon which while it ain't Paree boasts sumptuous grounds on a body of water and a retinue of servants to anticipate every need. Jeanne's husband works a lot but hey someone's gotta pay the bills. Still the lady of the house is not content. So one day she meets Bernard by happenstance Bernard makes her laugh Henri invites Bernard over Jeanne and Bernard cavort when everyone else is asleep and the two run away together  without a word of farewell. Er OK. We are told as a coda that Jeanne is afraid but has no regrets. That's nice. I guess the moral of this tale is When you have a onenight stand run away with him. He just might be your soul mate! OK again I guess. I admit I have long admired the work of Moreau. No one else can so believably pull off hangdog and stunning at the same time.The voiceover narration in this film seems highly derivative of Jules et Jim  yet that memorable film directed not by Malle but Truffaut came out four years after this one did! I don't want to end this review without citing the excellent work of Jose Luis de Vilallongo as the somewhat shallow but vulnerable playboy character Raoul. The tenderness he shows toward Jeanne and his sensitivity at the Tournier dining table adds admirable depth and pathos to his character. I love you because you are quite different he murmurs to Jeanne holding her closely while they dance  different from all the other women! Now that's romance. What woman wouldn't yearn to hear THOSE words? And you can bet Bernard won't be thinking them up...As a great poet opined What fools these mortals be.".

Film opens with Jeanne  Maggy two glamorous high society aristocrats watching a polo game cheering the star player the equally glamorous society page poster man Raoul Flores. Later cozy snuggling between Raoul and Jeanne who we learn when she goes home is married to another man  a prominent newspaper publisher Henri. Over dinner we observe quickly that Jeanne and Henri's marriage has been on deep freeze for sometime inside that capacious ornately furnished countryside mansion. Henri more or less convinced of Jeanne's affair with Raoul insisted on having Jeanne invite Maggy and the polo player for the weekend. On her way back from Paris that weekend Jeanne's sports car breaks down. She's given a ride by archaeologist Bernard definitely proletariat definitely more comfortable studying rocks from diggings than at the polo field. Henri invites Bernard to stay for the weekend with Raoul and Maggy. At dinner Bernard shown to be an obvious outsider of this group. After everyone goes to bed Jeanne wanders out into the night in her white diaphanous nightgown starting the fortyminute final sequence the heart of the movie. This is the mildly sensuous moonlit epiphany for Jeanne that true love still can happen. This sequence was deemed shockingly erotic in 1958 when the movie was released becoming the main reason for calls for censorship if not outright banning in many countries. In a long sequence of lyrical black and white dayfornight shots of shadows in the moonlight a long walk on a vast field of shrubs and flowers delicate embraces on a cozy boat floating unaided on a stream Jeanne falls for Bernard's nonaristocratic nonhighsociety proletariat charms. Maybe it is the moonlight or Bernard's open collar workingarchaeologist shirt or his 2cylinder minicar or the portentous bat that flew into the room when they were dining but at the break of dawn Jeanne decides to leave everything including her sleeping daughter another reason which shocked the critics and the Catholic church into condemning this movie and drive away with Bernard into a new day aborning. As far as I can remember this is the first movie I know where the central characters at the fadeout ride into the sunrise instead of into the sunset. One extra point for the then 25year old Louis Malle. This movie has acquired its classic status for several reasons It was a notable and controversial! work from a young director who was just starting to get noticed Malle's fifth movie his second for 1958. It portrayed succinctly the phoniness of the affluent as it showed a portrait of a woman confined within the rituals of her social status and then acting on her sudden feeling to get out. It presented a sex scene considered bold and shocking at that time Jeanne's orgasm shown only through a closeup of her trembling hand is I think a clever idea from Malle. And it has Jeanne Moreau. Although for me anything with Jeanne Moreau is automatically on my personal classic list. Even by today's standards I think this is a very wellmade movie if only for the subtlety with which Malle presented how these characters show the spectrum of their raw feelings. Moreau is on every frame Malle's words from a 1994 interview and perfectly so. She shows the buildup in Jeanne's simmering feelings so flawlessly we actually feel the tension of when it's going to explode. Magre is pure delight as the fullyenjoythemoment Maggy. De Villalonga captures perfectly the unctuous charms of someone who's enraptured with his own image endlessly watching and listening to himself in his own head. Cuny is admirably subtle in showing Henri as someone who has really stopped caring a long time ago just enjoying watching these people make fools of themselves eventually to choke on their own flirtations. Note his stiff indifference watching Bernard drive away with Jeanne. In the Moreau performances I've seen I think this is one of her finest. In her every movie the main tension is her eyes  no one really knows what's going on behind that hypnotic stare. Love passion hatred murder tenderness bewilderment? We always have to wait for the end of the movie. Some clever prefiguring clues Malle gives us The bat flying in during their dinner causing a brief consternation  their fortress has been breached their aristocracy is not invulnerable anymore. Bernard's minicar slow but unstoppable in the highway  stability simple and quiet persistence. Bernard freeing the fishes from Henri's traps  obviously about Jeanne. Excellent luminous restoration from Criterion of this stunningly photographed black and white film by Henri Decae. Extras include two interviews from Malle and one from Jeanne Moreau. ".

Bernard's minicar slow but unstoppable in the highway  stability simple and quiet persistence. Bernard freeing the fishes from Henri's traps  obviously about Jeanne. Excellent luminous restoration from Criterion of this stunningly photographed black and white film by Henri Decae. Extras include two interviews from Malle and one from Jeanne Moreau. ";

From a content point of view I must admit that I found it hard to get into Jeanne as a character because the film did sort of expect us to accept her adultery and sex as part of her escaping and growing in some way  a thing that will not always be true sometime people just cheat and there is no reason for it other than the most basic. However unless this really bothers you there is still much to enjoy in the character if not totally in the story.

The support cast are all good with similarly natural performances from Bory Magre de Villalonga and others however the film belongs to Moreau in terms of performances. The other main reason for watching is the crisp and stylish direction from Malle and the wonderful black and white photography. Although it has long lost its shock value today the love scene is pretty strong stuff considering the period.Overall this will not appeal to the masses because it is pretty slow and is all about complex inner issues that do not lend themselves to clear plotting easy answers or pace. This is not to say that it can cope with these problems well because it doesn't totally manage it and it does come off a little up itself in how it presents some of the issues but the direction cinematography and acting all make it worth seeing meanwhile the material will engage whether you are annoyed by it or sympathise with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Malle's landmark 1958 film is a fascinating study in selfishness. Bravely taking two thoroughly unlikeable characters as its leads it examines their motivations and passions as they conduct an extramarital affair.Throughout use of voiceover and closeups to reflect emotion emphasise that this film is largely a character study. Moreau's character Jeanne Tournier is established from the outset as superficial and materialistic seeking desperately to keep apace with her more successful friend who married a Parisian.The languid pace of the film mirrors her bored listless existence.Her lack of gratitude when help arrives when her car breaks down points to how selfcentred her whole existence has become. Seeking to mirror her friend's wealth and power she treats her helper the young academic Bernard as though he were a paid chauffeur ordering him to do her will. His lack of wealth is apparent from the fact that he drives a Citroen 2CV. Only when he defies her and outright rejects the vanity of her friends is a deeper interest in him aroused.Malle however subverts any notion that Bernard will provide a moral centre to the film as it is he who joins Tournier on her next affair. Hence both the wealthy and academia stand accused together of moral bankruptcy.The final scene echoes the ending of Ibsen's play the Dollhouse just as controversial in its day when Jeanne Tournier chooses to abandon her child to find happiness in her new life. However there is no indication here that the relationship between Tournier and Bernard will last he seems to be just another of her passing fancies and one of whom she is likely to soon grow bored. Furthermore there is no protofeminist statement here as in the Dollhouse  Jeanne is merely acting to satisfy her own desires not to make a moral stance for independence. She receives no comeuppance at the end and no heavyhanded moral lesson is given.Just as in real life she will not face immediate consequences for what she has done but there is a sense that all will not end well for her when this affair collapses. With no social standing of her own she will be reliant on her friends' whims of generosity and they may grow bored with her. Indeed her social standing may eventually fall. She is seemingly floating through society with her lover just as she floated on the boat without direction or purpose.The child is a marginalised figure in the film and has no real voice of its own yet its prominence in the final act emphasises what Jeanne is sacrificing with seemingly very little concern. Likewise her husband has no real voice but this reflects his emotional distance from her. The audience do not really come to understand him just as Jeanne does not though on her part it is due equally to her lack of effort.Ultimately this film then gives much insight into why extramarital affairs occur. However due to Jeanne Tournier's vain and superficial nature it is hard for her character to sustain one's interest for the full running time. Just as she becomes bored with those around her. we become bored with her.The languid pace ultimately becomes tiresome and the climactic erotic scenes seem very demure by today's standards leaving one with an unsatisfied feeling at this dated film.In making a story about superficial people there is always a risk that the film itself will end up being superficial and while Malle does his best to avoid this trap one can't help but feel he wasn't entirely successful.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the story of a bored wife and mother Jeanne Moreau. She lives in a lovely manor home filled with servants in the country. However she is unhappy and her marriage is without passion. She and her husband sleep in separate bedrooms and she is bored with life. For a while she deals with it by taking frequent trips to Pariswhere she takes a lover. Yet deep down she's still bored. Then out of the blue she meets another man quite by accidentand they spend a night making love in her homewhile her husband lover and best friend sleep.Back in the late 1950s when it was released this film created quite a furor in the US. Because of its amoral plot involving a married woman having multiple affairs and showing nudity it was considered obscene by many and eventually made it to the Supreme Court several years later to decide on its decency. In a landmark case it was not considered indecent and it led the way to more explicit films being shown in the US in subsequent years. When you see it today however you'd never suspect any of this as the film has almost no nudity at alland if you are seeing it hoping for some sort of cheap thrill you are bound to be disappointed. I saw one review that said today it would get an Rratingheck I could even imagine it receiving a PG13. Yes times have really changed.As far as what I thought of the film it's really a mixed bag for me. While some can look past the moral problems with the film I couldn't. It wasn't that the sex scene bothered mebut that the main character seemed like a spoiled child. You see her put nothing into her marriage and instead of dealing with life responsibly she screws around. It's not that she's immoralit's more like she's amoralwith no compass to guide her or sense of responsibility or regret. And the way the film is constructed it appears to condone and possibly encourage these behaviors. It's sad as the film ends on a happy notelike life will be great with her running off with a man she hardly knows. I predict in real life in 97 of cases like these the woman STILL will find herself bored and might eventually realize that much of the problem is within.Now aside from my moralistic views on the film I cannot simply dismiss the film because I didn't like the characters and now that I think about it I didn't like a single one of them. Artistically speaking the film was quite brilliant. Louis Malle managed to take a threadbare story and stretch it out to 90 minutes without it becoming dull. Great cinematography music and acting really carried the film. And I must add that although there is almost no nudity the sex scene is highly erotic and exceptionally well made. It managed to make adultery SEEM quite beautiful. And because of this and its importance to US law it makes for a mustsee experience for cinephiles.By the way on the Criterion disc is an interesting special feature on the US release. While it's just various clips and a bit of text seeing the posters and lobby cards for the American release was funnyand a bit sad. You'd swear that the film was MEGAhot and full of hot steamy sex based on these print adswhich it certainly is NOT. I am sure many seeing the film went home very disappointed.".

	schema:headline " a near masterpiece of the sadness and touching escape of love";
	schema:reviewBody "Louis Malle had quite a running start in his mid20's. Following the amazing noir feature Elevator at the Gallows so hip and cool a film that Miles Davis himself did the score Malle made The Lovers a drama about a bored and unfulfilled housewife who has a onenight fling with a man she just met by the side of the road and decides to leave her husband and child for him. This is trivializing of course what is an incredibly potent and incredibly bittersweet tale that features a filmmaker so confident with his craft already that romance fills any scene that's required like a shotgun aimed directly at its target. When its at its best The Lovers reminds us why we love watching people falling in love in the movies or what the characters think in a moment of passion as does happen in French films since they are some of the best at it and as a kicker Malle adds a catch something that elevates it from something more cynical in tone.The main character Jeanne played by Jeanne Moreau is married to Henri who works well enough that she lives pretty much as a bourgeois. She also has a man on the side a polo sportsman and sees him from time to time at sort of programmedtobefun locations like an amusement park. She's obviously unhappy and one might find this looking at it today to look a little dated like oh she's unhappy she'll go find someone I've seen this before. And in fact she does find someone else or rather completely by accident or chance or whichever you'd be willing to pick. Her car breaks down on route to a dinner party with her husband and other friends and a man Bernard Bory a relative of someone in the bourgeois circle but not one himself picks her up and drives her there. He is invited to dinner and stay the night and it's here where we see the two have an incredible and deep connection.I should stop now since I've given away whatever sort of plot there is here. The Lovers is foremost a character piece and Malle knows this so he makes it an incredibly rich film of character. We're not seeing just the basics of people like an unfaithful wife or hardworking and bitter husband or sweet woman bestfriend to Jeanne or a stuffy Polo guy or even a dashing man out of the blue. There's a lot more nuance to it than that more that's tucked under and given clarity by the little moments that threaten to shake everything up be it just a fly in the room or a bat flying in through the window during dinner or a mention of a time at an amusement park.One can have an moral problem with what Jeanne does which is leaving her husband and child for a man she just met. Logically it's absurd and wrong and all that jazz... but when it's filmed and presented like this it becomes like a hyperrealistic tale something that should be fantasy but is too real for these characters to pass off. Part of this is how it's filmed and timed. Henri Decae does the cinematography and with one or two exceptions in nitpick fashion I spotted a boom mic in a couple of scenes that made me feel uneasy for such a highly regarded film which of course passed it's gorgeously filmed with light streaming in in that last third with Jeanne and Bernard in the garden and in the bedroom at night given that hyperrealistic sensation that only happens in heightened romance in movies but made earthy and passionate because of the sincerity of the actors.The other part I must mention is Jeanne Moreau. She is one of the most captivating and desirable actresses in the past 50 years but part of that is even as she is fairly young here late 20s or just turning 30 something about her face looks older more experienced in the world weary. Maybe it's just for the character but it's something about her that makes this and other parts she played in this starmaking period so wonderful. Another actress might have made Jeanne look more unsympathetic. Moreau keeps us thinking about what her character may be thinking disheartened by life and then rejuvenated by some possibility that terrifies her even more watch her in the last couple of scenes it's staggering work in the subtlest of ways or if something with her character has made her react or feel a way that is only possible because she is playing it a certain way. There's magnetism to her here which goes a great to making the hot scenes with her and her partner so memorable.It's precisely unpornographic as if I need to point it out following the Supreme Court's ruling that it was not pornographic precisely because the Judge saw it as such because of the filmmaker's connection and care for his characters even as they're doing possibly foolish and irreversible choices. It's liberating still 51 years later to see characters allowed to be this passionate and erotic on camera  whatever minor flaws this has more love and lust going on than 2 dozen romcoms in America as of late with usually not much regard to the way people actually react and think when thrown into romantic peril. At any rate Happy Valentine's Day!".

We're not seeing just the basics of people like an unfaithful wife or hardworking and bitter husband or sweet woman bestfriend to Jeanne or a stuffy Polo guy or even a dashing man out of the blue. There's a lot more nuance to it than that more that's tucked under and given clarity by the little moments that threaten to shake everything up be it just a fly in the room or a bat flying in through the window during dinner or a mention of a time at an amusement park.One can have an moral problem with what Jeanne does which is leaving her husband and child for a man she just met. Logically it's absurd and wrong and all that jazz... but when it's filmed and presented like this it becomes like a hyperrealistic tale something that should be fantasy but is too real for these characters to pass off. Part of this is how it's filmed and timed. Henri Decae does the cinematography and with one or two exceptions in nitpick fashion I spotted a boom mic in a couple of scenes that made me feel uneasy for such a highly regarded film which of course passed it's gorgeously filmed with light streaming in in that last third with Jeanne and Bernard in the garden and in the bedroom at night given that hyperrealistic sensation that only happens in heightened romance in movies but made earthy and passionate because of the sincerity of the actors.The other part I must mention is Jeanne Moreau. She is one of the most captivating and desirable actresses in the past 50 years but part of that is even as she is fairly young here late 20s or just turning 30 something about her face looks older more experienced in the world weary. Maybe it's just for the character but it's something about her that makes this and other parts she played in this starmaking period so wonderful. Another actress might have made Jeanne look more unsympathetic. Moreau keeps us thinking about what her character may be thinking disheartened by life and then rejuvenated by some possibility that terrifies her even more watch her in the last couple of scenes it's staggering work in the subtlest of ways or if something with her character has made her react or feel a way that is only possible because she is playing it a certain way. There's magnetism to her here which goes a great to making the hot scenes with her and her partner so memorable.It's precisely unpornographic as if I need to point it out following the Supreme Court's ruling that it was not pornographic precisely because the Judge saw it as such because of the filmmaker's connection and care for his characters even as they're doing possibly foolish and irreversible choices. It's liberating still 51 years later to see characters allowed to be this passionate and erotic on camera  whatever minor flaws this has more love and lust going on than 2 dozen romcoms in America as of late with usually not much regard to the way people actually react and think when thrown into romantic peril. At any rate Happy Valentine's Day!";

	schema:reviewBody "A married woman some years after concluding a successful affair I might add once lectured me that love was about commitment and being able to get on with one another. Perhaps I thought. Except poetry  and perhaps French literature especially gives the word a somewhat more vibrant texture. A meaning many of us will still maybe yearn for  and powerfully  in our heart of hearts.'Jeanne' in this film is played by Jeanne Moreau. Beautiful and sexy. She is trapped in a marriage of monotony. Husband is a successful newspaper publisher. Their Dijon country chteau is one of understated wealth. Industriously posh establishment if you like.Jeanne visits her friend Maggy in Paris regularly. Maggie is trendy and superficial. She approves of Jeanne's affair with Raoul a rather buff polo star. Unlike Jeanne's husband Henri who it must be said is a boring old fart Raoul is attentive and adoring. Society chic if you like.Into the mix suddenly appears Bernard an archaeologist. He hates Maggy's incrowd  describing them as 'flavour of the day.' He is probably everything Henri would be if Henri had a life. Henri has years of slaving in a publishing house. Plenty of money. Plenty of nice furniture. Including a wife. He politely welcomes Bernard who has rescued Jeanne when her car breaks down.If this were a romcom you'd guess the rest. Queue steamy sex with artistic lighting. And while Les Amants gives you plenty of what you expect it also gives you plenty of what you don't. Unresolved moral quandaries  if you like or not.It was the moral outrage  a married woman leaving her husband and children after a night of sex  that probably led to obscenity charges on its release in America in the late fifties. Far more than the momentary nudity. The latter seems mild today. Yet the film is as fresh as it was then. As challenging as it was then. And as beautiful.Les Amants is shot in immaculate black and white. The men playing polo. The exquisitely photographed French countryside. And a Brahms Sextet in Bflat Major leitmotif which both immortalises the passion and encourages us to attach importance to its emotional and aesthetic qualities. Jeanne's first world with Henri is dead and empty. Her second with Raoul is a pleasant distraction but shallow. Visually and verbally Bernard connects to Jeanne in an altogether different way. He makes her work for it but then rewards her. Henri makes her work for attention but doesn't give it. Raoul showers it on her with no effort on her part.Bernard ignores Jeanne's 'damsel in distress' pitch when her car breaks down. Engines and I don't see eye to eye he tells her. Until Jeanne breaks out of her pathetic helplessfemale stereotype he is uninterested. He makes her to laugh comparing her husband to a bear. We see Jeanne making a determined effort with her appearance. Bernard's poetry wears her down. He fills her head with visions of how beautiful the night is  and then associates her vision with how he sees her. He awakes the divine in Jeanne  Her angel's smile gleamed. The moonlight tryst sees light rippling through leaves onto water. Bernard frees the fish caught by Jeanne's husband's traps. He is freeing her spirit from her dark depths. His intrusion like the bat and flies at the house is first seen as a threat. But it is her freedom he acknowledges that she has denied herself that is too horrible to countenance. Is this a land you invented for me to lose myself in? she asks.Jeanne realises that the part of her she dreads the most is the only thing that makes her feel alive. Her world is falling apart. A hateful husband and an almost ridiculous lover. The tragedy Jeanne thought she was in had become a farce. Suddenly she wishes she could become someone else. Readers may recall the not too dissimilar dilemma of Julianne Moore's character in The Hours. She leaves a husband and child and disappears to become someone else. In that story no lover complicates the dilemma. She is simply suffocating. We are tempted to condemn Jeanne's action because of her night of passion. But she is similarly escaping from an impossible life. A duty to her husband yes. To her offspring of course. But isn't the highest duty to her own being her own life? And it is not as if Bernard is a philanderer. He wants her for always. But instead of reassuring us that everything will turn out well director Louis Malle realistically allows our protagonists to acknowledge that they face an unknown. They are wellsuited  there is none of the narrative primitivism of say Women in Love. But Les Amants is a film of emotional and moral honesty. No wonder it shocked the bourgeoisie. And American values.The obscenity charges in the USA went to the high court. Justice Potter Stewart overturned them and made his famous pronouncement on pornography I know it when I see it and the motion picture involved in this case is not that. European films of this ilk helped to push the bland American filmmaking of the time towards greater artistic freedom. Les Amants established Jeanne Moreau's on screen image as a sexually independent woman. Her strong performance as someone responding to three very different life choices cemented her onward career.This is a film of courage of a sophisticated beauty singing in tune with her own nature rejecting the limiting values of industry and society. It is the story of a woman finding she is the equal of man  and finding a man that is her equal. The last portion is perhaps overly sentimental. But it is sentimental about the dark night of her soul. Not a disneyfied happy ending. If you are shocked after seeing the film ask yourself why.".

The morality of the film is very confusing certainly we can applaud Jeanne's existential urge to escape from her stifling fling her marriage and her Parisienne lifestyle but the fact that she leaves her daughter behind is execrable. The woodland scenes are intriguing but a bit too contrived.

	schema:headline " half a century leaves its mark on this romantic classic film";
	schema:reviewBody "While Louis Malle was contemporary with the New Wave of the French cinema he chose to use much more classical means of expression and is not considered to be part of movement. Yet his films do have something different in their stylish approach to the life and romance of the French middle and upper class and this film is one of the best examples. He is closer to Bunuel than to Truffaut or Agnes Varda. Half a century after the controversy the film screening generated in the United States half a century in which all taboos about representing sexuality on screen were broken one wonders what is left of value in this film. The impression I was left with is pretty much mixed. The story has a level of simplicity and originality that I liked with the bored provincial wife living a triangle life but never satisfied emotionally and finding the true love by chance in what we call today a one night stand. Yet all the nightly erotic setting seems unrealistic and the presence of a child left behind in the story leaves the viewer with a feeling of uneasiness. It is not that I am a moralist when it comes to judging movies but the solution of what must be the harshest dilemma for a mother looks now and I believe looked then cheap. Jeanne Moreau is a fantastic actress and is at its best here but the rest of the cast is far from her with the exception maybe of Alain Cuny in the role of the husband. A few more style elements like using the music of Brahms or the love scene focusing on the face and ecstasy of the woman give the film a stylish look but on the other hand the camera work did not survive well the passing of the time or I may have seen a not to well kept copy and the offscreen commentary  probably from the 18th century original story that inspired the film  sound too didactic and noncinematographic. Overall 'Les Amants' stays as a milestone in the history of the cinema but not necessary a good contemporary piece of entertainment for the viewer of today.".

The film portrays the harsh existence of the homeless as Alex Michele and Hans an older vagrant survive on the streets with their wits. As they both slowly get their lives back together Michele becomes increasingly dependent on Alex as her vision deteriorates further. Fearing that Michele will leave him if she receives a new medical treatment Alex attempts to keep Michele practically a prisoner. The streets skies and waterways of Paris are used as a backdrop to the story in a series of stunning visuals which dominate the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Obsession addiction violence and love. Sometimes all four at the same time. If nothing else this movie is a complete rollercoaster ride through the emotions. It's hard to say whether it's really a love story. Is it love when you want to possess someone to the point where you would rather they go blind than go away? Is it love to want to drag someone down with you to bottom of your own degradation? Is it love when you would take someone's life because they wanted to go home? But then again is it love when you allow all this to happen and still come back for more? I have my doubts.This is really a story of obsession and possession between two people who find themselves marooned out on the edge of human existence. They find something like tenderness something like love by holding on to each other like two children lost in the dark woods. But obsession is ultimately destructive and so it is here. Alex wants Michelle but never really shows any real tenderness. He has nothing to offer except cheap wine and an old overcoat. He is destructive violent and childlike. The relationship between Alex and Michelle is quite impossible to comprehend sometimes. What this movie does have is passion. But this is real life passion. Real and raw. If you ever see real people like Alex and Michelle and they do exist you can see how they cling to each other how they abuse each other how they are possessed by their lifestyle unable or unwilling to fight their way out of their humiliation. So in the end they just drag each further down drowning in hopelessness.But just as you think the story is going to end in tragedy...well you have to watch it for yourself.The cinematography in this movie is breathtaking at times but in a very unconventional way. It is beautiful to watch even though there is precious little that is attractive. Paris looks by turns both shiny and exciting and then dark grey and filthy. Which if you've been there you will know is exactly how it is. There is not a single shot of any famous Parisian landmark either. Only the river Seine and the bridges around Pont Neuf are part of the landscape in this story.It's really an ensemble piece for two characters two characters caught up in obsession possession and some kind of love story. The two lead actors Juliette Binoche and Dennis Levant produce performances of real emotional power and subtlety. There is nothing coming out of Hollywood to match movies like this nor are there many actors if any who could get close to performances like these. One day the Academy will begin to recognise that acting and movies is not just about box office returns and bestow their awards on movies like this.".

Binoche and Lavant performed terrifically well together and the third character Klaus Michael Gruber as Hans the homeless senior also with a mysterious past added accents with his performance. The sequence towards the end first you get the telling of a joke with hearty laughter then the fateful phrase of  ce soir c'est le soir to the underwater sequence and what follows  Carax would not let up with any moment for you the audience to breathe after laughs and gasps.

	schema:headline " A clever if uncompromising juxtaposition between socialrealist despair and abstract romanticism";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins on a crossroads where a blind Juliet Binoche fist encounters Denis Lavant's seemingly schizophrenic vagrant and their relationship begins. With this even the most disinterested of viewers will be able to appreciate that the particular setting much like the rest of the film has a stark significance. Les Amants du PontNeuf 1991 was the third film from firebrand filmmaker Leos Carax and one that shows an obvious attempt to build on the ground previously covered in his first two films Boy Meets Girl 1984 and Mauvais Sang 1986 whilst simultaneously allowing himself the room for growth and creative development. Besides being a fairly successful combination of superfluous fantasy and biting social realism the film remains something of an intriguing experiment into the juxtaposition of tone the malleability of character and the cinematic use of architecture as a model for the plot while simultaneously standing as an affecting and uncharacteristic romanticdrama in its own right.Nonetheless it is that bold use of design and the bolder integration of such concerns as expressed within the narrative itself that makes the film something to be experienced. The bridge here is more than just a mere setting it is a symbol for our two protagonists. Most directors would have used this grand vision of design in all its historical splendour to comment on the prosperousnature of the country in an ironic fashion and of the ample possibilities of its characters. Instead Carax shows us a structure that is tired worn and close to collapse. As the film progresses note how the restoration of the PontNeuf comes to mirror the restoration and rehabilitation of the central duo. Their final union sees all three 'characters' cleansed and rejuvenated whilst the crossroad is now open to allow their two very different worlds to collide. It is brilliantly captured by Carax who once again uses the locations in a way that is entirely expressive while all along showing a complete understanding of the relationship between the camera and the design that is truly unlike anything else demonstrated in his work both before and since.One of the most striking sequences here involves the lovers getting drunk and descending into childlike revelry while a hundred years of cultural evolution is expressed through a densely layered soundtrack. We also have possibly the greatest use of fireworks in any film as the duo steal a speedboat during the celebrations of the French Bicentennial with the combination of music and movement energy and spirit bringing to mind the night time walk that Alex takes in Boy Meets Girl as Bowie plays on his oversized headphones and kissing couples are treated with all the reverence of a talented streetmusician or the iconic run down the street scene from Mauvais Sang with Bowie again scoring a defiant burst of unrequited love articulated as a wordless burst of physical expression. Bowie again features here along with a character called Alex again played by Lavant but this certainly isn't a retread of the director's earlier achievements.Many critics have continually argued that the combination of mental illness and skidrow misery with declarations of love and happiness against scenes of deliberate fantastical exaggeration is all decidedly problematic in tone. Again these same accusations have been levelled against everything from New York New York 1977 to The Moon in the Gutter 1983 with the natural shock of the harsh contrast between content and form no doubt jarring the audience out of their usual expected comfort zones. It is almost unheard of in the more recognisable cinema of Hollywood to expect a romantic drama to open with a scene set in a homeless shelter where wizened naked men stand prostrate under shower heads or moments of unrequited love and ennui are expressed in bursts of unprovoked violence and shocking brutality. Naturally the film was a spectacular failure on release and soured Carax's interest in film indefinitely only one film in the subsequent seventeen years but for me the legacy of Les Amants du PontNeuf as both an experience and a creative excess is more potent now than it ever was before.Although you could certainly argue that Les Amants is a somewhat flawed work in comparison to the director's smaller projects most notably the controversial POLA X 1999 it remains so simply as a result of aiming too high. However regardless of such slight limitations it is what cinema should be an expression of ideas and emotions that are inventive funny shocking beautiful gritty and continually enigmatic and all tied to the director's repeated allusions to the work of Jean Luc Godard R.W. Fassbinder Scorsese and Jean Vigo. Regardless of its reputation as a costly flop or a work of pure selfindulgence Les Amants du PontNeuf remains a film unlike any other an epic love story cast against a backdrop of depression and desperation and the same kind of bold cinematic evocations that Carax's work is celebrated for.".

Stylistically it is very flamboyant and bold especially in it's editing and shot selections. And that may be why some don't like it. The love story too is hard to believe but most love stories rely on a leap of faith so that's nothing new.

	schema:headline " One of the great romances...";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the great romances precisely because it goes against the grain of all the great screen romances.  Because of its ability to strike new terrain  to go where no romance has gone before to take chances in essence  it achieves a level of passionate intensity that most romantic films could only dream of mustering.The camera work  by JeanYves Escoffier one of the great cinematographers working today who shot Leos Carax's early films  Bad Blood and Boy Meets Girl  as well as Larry Clark's Kids and the directorial debut of Harmony Korine Gummo  is absolutely breathtaking.  I cannot overemphasize this.  It is perhaps one of the most beautiful color films ever made.  The style of the film suits the subject matter perfectly.  It proves that the great films have a form that not only compliments the subject matter but becomes it.  The content is the form and vise versa. The film is shot CinemaVerite style with rough handheld choppy camerawork and a gritty realistic aesthetic quality.  There are moments of fancy and surrealism that would seem to utterly contradict this style.  On the contrary these moments are rendered believable avoid presenting problems of logic because of the film's harsh balancing tone.  The wild style of the film captures perfectly the passionate stormy affair of the lovers  the truest love and certainly the most passionate the film says is that closest to nature to the base element of humanity.Another layer of enjoyment comes from the film's similarity to Jean Vigo's L'Atlante.  In fact the final sequence in the film has the two lovers plummeting from the bridge into the cold water.  They are picked up by a sand barge on its final trip to the ocean.  The husband and wife who we learn have spent their life shipping sand agree to take them along.  It is almost as if the couple in L'Atlante have reappeared to prove that passionate tumultuous love affairs can end happily despite their problems. One of the last shots of the film shows the two lovers walking across the barge over the hills of sand to the bow  a direct quotation of L'Atlante.The last shot for enemies of James Cameron's Titanic  an absolutely shallow romance as cold and heartless as the iceberg that dooms the ship shows the two lovers hovering over the bow of the ship magically as if suspended by love.  It is obvious James Cameron plagiarized this moment Les Amants... came out in 1991.  This fact should be trumpeted far and wide.  Titanic is a bloated whale of a movie.  Les Amants du Pont Neuf is simply the greatest romance to have erupted on the screens in the last decade.".

That in itself is no reason to downgrade this film but trying to resolve the frequent fluctuations between brutal realism and unbelievable fantasy ultimately wore me out.Alex and Michele are homeless and camping out on the PontNeuf while it is under repair. Michele is going blind and Alex is an alcoholic with a drug problem on the side  certainly a setup that will challenge all but the persistent to bug out. We see rubble on the bridge but never any indication of there being active renovation going on. This is in keeping with there being almost nobody on the streets of Paris or in the subways. Maybe the intent of this population void is to focus our attention on the protagonists but it lent an unreal air to the proceedings for me. And just when we are willing to cut the film some slack in this area we are brought back to harsh realities.Indeed there are some wonderfully filmed scenes like Michele waterskiing on the Seine at night with Alex manning a speed boat. But what is to be made of that? Prior to this scene we see that Michele is weak and hardly able to walk. Most scenes overstay their welcome. When Michele takes to drugging the drinks of restaurant customers in order to put them to sleep so she can pick their pockets we are saturated with scenes of about a dozen people as they slowly succumb to the drug. And is that mode of theft really practical? And so on.What are we to take away from this film? That homeless people desire love and acceptance just like anybody else? That the homeless have their reasons for being as they are? That love can exist among the ruins? That a few dazzling scenes will keep people watching? That Juliette Binoche fans will put up with a lot just to see her in a movie? There were no new insights for me here.".

	schema:headline " A magnificent failure";
	schema:reviewBody "Oddly enough Les Amants du PontNeuf reminded me of Francis Ford Coppola's own romantic extravaganza One From the Heart. Think about it both were directed by cinematic wunderkinds both went way over budget and had troubled productions and both were at their hearts rather simple love stories that their directors inflated rather perversely into massive technical undertakings.On that level at least Les Amants... works. The movie is filled with striking images  the fireworks display as seen from PontNeuf the flaming posters lining the walls of the Metro and so on. It is not at all inaccurate to call this one of the most stunningly photographed films of all time.But whereas the movie succeeds as a grand visual spectacle it disappoints just about everywhere else. The relationship between Alex Denis Levant and Michele Juliette Binoche who manages to be as radiant as ever in spite of her role as a fairly grungy homeless painter occasionally results in some moments of pure emotional power which are promptly deflated with one of Alex's bizarre unexplained transformations into a possessive selfish nearly sociopathic jerk. His dreadfully unconvincing hyenalaugh doesn't help much. Since the romance between these two characters is the crux of the film this inconsistency mortally wounds the film. Maybe Carax was trying to convey a sense of the amour fou French romances are famous for if so he failed.Even worse though are the myriad subplots that Carax introduces but doesn't do anything with. The old man KlausMichael Gruber with whom Alex hangs around with serves no purpose other than to give Michele the key to an art museum yet he has the film's only significant supporting role. And it becomes clear later in the film that Michele who is rapidly losing her sight is in fact on the run from her past but we learn next to nothing of it  who exactly is Marion? Why does Michele apparently shoot her exboyfriend Julien? These aren't just analretentive questions  these are major plot points that would have helped tremendously in developing Michele. But Carax doesn't care he was either in too much of a hurry to get the script done not at all unlikely  see the Trivia section or didn't regard the story as anything more than a clothesline to hang his visuals on.There are two other major irritations. First is the way the plot falls back on the miracleworking ophthalmologist. You know that device that's the one were the heroheroine isis going blind but can have hisher sight saved by visiting some lone eye surgeon who has developed a miraculous cure for their affliction. Not only does this trivialize Michele's torment but it also robs the film of what could have been an even more poignant ending  surely I'm not the only one who thinks the portraitpainting scene would've been more touching if Michele had done it blindly.That brings me to the second sore spot the ending. Michele ominously tells Alex she has to leave Alex flies into a rage and pushes her into the Seine following her in. When they rise to the surface though Michele is laughing as though Alex's little tantrum had never happened as though she doesn't care that he would rather see her drown than risk losing her. We're never told by the way why Michele had to leave. They then board a garbage barge together and the film suddenly turns into an homage to Vigo's L'Atlante that is so blatant that the only way it could've been more obvious was if Vigo had received codirecting credit. Since nothing else in the film suggests L'Atlante this unexpected reference comes across as just more evidence of sloppy writing that Carax couldn't be bothered to think of a decent ending and just threw together the unsatisfying but beautifully shot  go figure climax we're stuck with.Don't get me wrong  this is NOT a bad film. But it IS a tremendous disappointment even for me who has never exactly been a fan of Carax's work. Foreign film buffs should still see it  maybe you'll have better luck focusing on the sights and sounds and blocking out the meandering screenplay.".

If the other reviews here tempt you to see it anyway that's fine but don't say you weren't warned.";

The story is simple two down and outs meet fall in love yet despite the harsh realities of life and love on the streets they live out an exciting and romantic in all the senses of the word existence. This movie is relevant for its amazing visual and tour de force performances. Binoche is simply standout she seems to live the role something she later admitted deeply disturbed her. The film is fabulously directed from the grainy opening sequence to the amazing fireworks scene and the exhilarating conclusion. The film is littered with cinematic allusions from Truffaut Les Quatre cents Coups to L'Atlante. In terms of context the film is amazing because it juxtaposes harsh realities the opening sequence and fairytale like fantasy. We are led to question what is actually real from Binoche apparently committing murder to the street littered with gigantic litter. In the end Les Amants du Pont Neuf is a film which needs multiple viewing and some explaining or knowledge of French New Wave cinema to be wholly comprehended yet it is certainly accessible for the majority of casual cinema goers! The film as I always predicted is only now beginning to get the recognition it truly deserves. Binoche has avoided this type of movie since although Michael Hanekes wonderful Code Unknown though on a smaller and more subjued canvas has many similarities. Roll on the US release of that one too. And Miramax its about time you began releasing this type of movie on DVD you're beginning to lag behind the other companies such as Fox Lorber and Criterion!".

And Carax has really a thing for filming movements as in this scene when Michelle lays on the floor to watch at feet moving on a dance floor. But as much as this love story is intense especially because of their despair homeless they won't find anybody else to share their loneliness with it's really not plausible to me that this love survives his prison time and her return to normal life when people loving each other take so different paths I can't see how they could catch up. There is however another wonderful thing in this film i.e. how Carax questions without ever saying it the French utopia Liberty Equality Fraternity. I think the beginning is really accurate in showing the reality of being homeless in Paris and of meant to be shelters but being more something between mental institution and prison. And above all placing the movie around the 14th of July 1989 i.e. around the bicentenary celebration of the French Revolution underlines without a word the paradox of the French society advocating inside and outside its boundaries for Liberty Equality and Fraternity but unable to provide it to all its citizens. I finally found here what I was expecting in Three colours maybe because it's more subtle.".

There are many I could point to but there's also a suddenness to the work moments that pop out and make the viewer put into perspective the tragic nature of this story and the characters. There's an unpredictability but not without logic or something in line with life in this situation and place.One such moment that few reviewers may talk about involves the character of Hans and his death. Throughout the film he's been more than wary of the presence of halfblind Michelle Binoche who has also fallen in possible love with Alex Lavant the drunkendruggie firebreather and for a while we as the audience see him as a rather ugly being. But then he opens up to Michelle how he came to be on this bridge without a job or without his wife and the death of his child and he offers her to take her to a museum which he has a key for from his job as a guard to see a painting as close to the surface as possible late at night. He's actually quite a touching character gradually still grumpy and grisly but with a conscience and feeling for Michelle's plight... Then as he walks down a set of stairs and comes to the side of the riverbank he slips and falls and dies.In any other hands this could become high melodrama a director pulling out all the stops to make this a really significant event for these character Michelle and Alex. But just as soon as he was there he's gone and I was overwhelmed for a moment by pure anguish at this man's demise. There's other moments like that as well in Carax's film where he substitutes stark poetry or something truly alive and fast and ebullient poetry with his camera and wonderful expensive set some of the time and balances so satisfyingly between the grime and clutter of this little enclave on the bridge and the torrid love between two people who are together for various reasons some known well and some intimated by just the slightest moves or lack thereof. With some minor exceptions like the very end which leads to some curious and surreal ambiguity it's a sensational ride.We're taken along on the story of Alex a firebreather as his only trade and with hobbies of booze and drugs in order to sleep and Michelle a painter who has nowhere to go except to old lovers she'd rather not see or can't see because of flailing eyesight or if she does bad things happen or appear to happen again the ambiguity. They become very close maybe too close for the extremely lonely and possibly brain damaged Alex and pull off a money making scheme which ends with a moment of a selfish act as well as have nights of debauchery and excitement. The most notable of the latter probably of the best kinds of exuberant crazy type scenes in any motion picture is when Alex and Michelle smashed to hell run and jump and dance to a giant fireworks display with Carax pumping up Iggy Pop and Blue Danube Waltz music and finishing off with a waterskiing down the river. This is one of those sequences I probably will never forget not just for the power of the filmmaking but for the feeling one has for the characters at that moment of time in the movie sublime momentary escapism.Things end up getting very dark for the characters not least of which for Alex who goes on a rampage tearing down posters looking for Michelle for an eyeoperation this is one of those scenes that goes between reality and fantasy that's jarring it verges on pretension but I actually didn't mind it for how wrapped up one becomes in the plight of Alex with his Michelle and the ending finds the two years later changed only on the surface. All the old wounds are there and how they'll exactly end up is difficult to say. But what is clear for Carax after going through a story that features real homeless people in shelters this footage shot like a documentary plunging us so far into this world we forget most of the time the bridge is a set of numerous fights and cries and hugs and laughs and fights between the two wouldbemaybe lovebirds that what would be cynical in any other hands is treated as bittersweet humanism.

	schema:reviewBody "I got the chance to see this film for the second time after a very kind fellow IMDb user sent me a copy of it and I must say that my opinion of it has improved with the rewatch. I guess once you accept what it is and what it isn't it becomes much easier to appreciate. It seems to have been one of those films whose makingof story was perhaps more dramatic than the film itself. It took three years to make and went three times over budget. In fact it was the most expensive French film of its day which was caused in a large part because the delays in production meant that the period in which the filmmakers were allowed to film on the PontNeuf ran out leading to the construction of a huge replica bridge and surrounding buildings to exactly mimic its location in the middle of Paris. When it was released it received lots of critical acclaim but little interest from the general public and it bombed at the box office. This led to its director Leos Carax to make far fewer films to date he has directed a mere two others in the intervening 25 years. It reminded me a little of the Francis Ford Coppola film One from the Heart 1981 which was also a romance told in a highly expressive and expensive manner. Funnily enough that film was also a box office disaster. It seems like very personal romanticdramas are perhaps more sensibly told in a smaller scale. Nevertheless for me this very bold film is Carax best film and the sheer craziness of the production only adds to its overall impact. Set in the middle of Paris the action occurs on the PontNeuf bridge which is closed for renovation work allowing for some homeless people to take up residence on it this includes two young people who begin a love affair one an alcoholic street performer the other an artist who is going blind.This is one of the last films of the cinma du look movement and is the third film of one of its chief proponents Carax. As such it showcases his passionate style and with its tale of young love against the odds was a typical subject from him. While it is a very cinematic movie the drama works quite well due to a couple of committed performances from Denis Lavant and Juliette Binoche. They are playing very unglamorous characters indeed which may account for the film being a bit of a hard sell commercially. They are not especially likable either with Lavant's character in particular being fairly reprehensible in many ways his obsession with Binoche leads to some highly selfish actions such as preferring his lover to go blind than to risk the possibility of her leaving him and inadvertently killing a man as part of his quest to achieve this. But like others in the cinma du look this is a film which places style above substance ultimately. It benefits from good cinematography and great sound design  you really feel like you can feel Paris in this film all the more impressive when you realise much of it is a giant model!. Perhaps though it is best remembered for some notable setpieces though. The most famous being the sequence on Bastille Day where the lovers dance across the bridge while fireworks go off soundtracked to an amalgam of hiphop dance and classical music. This setpiece is followed up with another memorable scene where the lovers waterski down the Seine. While the film ends with a nod to the influential L'Atlante 1934 with the central couple boarding a barge and heading out to the sea. Ultimately in order to fully appreciate this film you need to surrender yourself to its look and feel and don't concern yourself very much with sense or realism. If you can do that then there is much to appreciate in this unusual overthetop romance.".

	onyx:emotionText "I got the chance to see this film for the second time after a very kind fellow IMDb user sent me a copy of it and I must say that my opinion of it has improved with the rewatch. I guess once you accept what it is and what it isn't it becomes much easier to appreciate. It seems to have been one of those films whose makingof story was perhaps more dramatic than the film itself. It took three years to make and went three times over budget. In fact it was the most expensive French film of its day which was caused in a large part because the delays in production meant that the period in which the filmmakers were allowed to film on the PontNeuf ran out leading to the construction of a huge replica bridge and surrounding buildings to exactly mimic its location in the middle of Paris. When it was released it received lots of critical acclaim but little interest from the general public and it bombed at the box office. This led to its director Leos Carax to make far fewer films to date he has directed a mere two others in the intervening 25 years. It reminded me a little of the Francis Ford Coppola film One from the Heart 1981 which was also a romance told in a highly expressive and expensive manner. Funnily enough that film was also a box office disaster. It seems like very personal romanticdramas are perhaps more sensibly told in a smaller scale.

	schema:reviewBody "The most eagerly awaited Flynn movie has at last made it to DVD! Unavailable for some years except on a VHS tape and an obscure over priced Korean disc it thankfully is back in the Warner Bros. stable where it belongs. The wait was worth it for the disc is simply pluperfect! With rich vibrant threestrip Technicolor and sharply defined images it is a joy to behold! Flynn is terrific in the title role of the great lover and roue. Not withstanding perhaps a nod to the actor's own lifestyle the part was nevertheless taylor made for him. And although it was said at the time that he was slowing down and that he hit the booze while filming there is no evidence of it on screen. The great swashbuckler cuts a fine figure in his many fabulous costume changes throughout the picture. These costumes  designed by the great Travilla  won the 1948 Acadamy Award for best costume design.The supporting cast were well chosen too! Robert Douglas is great as Flynn's adversary  the evil Duke DeLorca. His dark eyes blackened even more to make him look that bit extra villainous. Alan Hale is once again Flynn's faithful sidekick but after 12 movies this was to be their final picture together. He died the following year. The female lead is taken by the beautiful Swedish actress Vivica Lindfors. Here she plays Margaret Queen of Spain and the one true love of Juan. Lindfors' final film was Stargate in 1994! She died in 1995 at the age of 75.The Adventures of Don Juan is well directed by Vincent Sherman and is probably his best remembered movie. The atmosphere the colour and the sets in the court scenes are really very impressive. But now and then the film gets a little bogged down with some palace intrigue until the picture's famous set piece  the brilliantly staged swordfight on the magnificent palace staircase. It ranks as one of the cinema's finest duels and Flynn will always be remembered for it even though that amazing leap with the knife was performed by stuntman and B picture actor Jock Mahoney.Then of course there is the music by Max Steiner  one of his very best scores! Particularly splendid is his music for Juan's Parade into London with its masterful use of bells and chimes. Also the wistful Ballade which accompanies Juan on his many and various balcony climbings the driving action music for the fight in the palace and the gorgeous love theme for the scenes with Juan and the Queen especially for the sequence near the end. Here the theme is heard in full bloom as the lovers say farewell to each other forever I shall be the only one who knew for just a little while that there was no Queen. Interestingly Flynn's usual swashbuckling composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold  who had served him brilliantly on past successes such as Captain Blood The Adventures Of Robin Hood and The Sea Hawk was originally slated to score The Adventures Of Don Juan as far back as 1945 but by the time the picture went into production the esteemed composer had left Hollywood and returned to his birthplace Vienna. As brilliant a composer as Korngold was it's difficult to imagine he would have topped Steiner's exceptional score. But alas we will never know!So quite a wonderful disc all round with good extras consisting of a commentary by director the late Vincent Sherman and Flynn authority Rudy Behlmer a trailer and some instantly forgettable old fashioned shorts but the movie is all so enjoy. En Garde!".

	schema:reviewBody "Like his swashbuckling predecessor Douglas Fairbanks Errol Flynn tackled the part of Don Juan in his late years he was 39 when he made this film for Warner Brothers. Like Fairbanks Flynn plays an older and wiser famous lover who's getting a bit bored by it all. Not unlike the real life Errol Flynn.The Adventures Of Don Juan finds Tirso De Molina's famous lover sent home after a couple of escapades in the newly formed Kingdom of Great Britain. King Philip III and Queen Margaret give our hero a chance to redeem himself by teaching at the royal fencing academy.He's up to his neck in trouble soon enough but not the kind of trouble Flynn's usually in. The first minister Robert Douglas is planning a move against the Queen who he sees as his main obstacle for total power in the kingdom. And the great lover starts behaving more like Sir Lancelot and less like Don Juan where Queen Margaret as played by Viveca Lindfors is concerned.Although Philip III was not the great ruler his father Philip II was by no means was he as big a fool as Romney Brent plays him. The real Queen Margaret who was his Hapsburg cousin did in fact have considerable influence over domestic and foreign policy in Spain.The Adventures of Don Juan was given a sumptuous production and won an Oscar for Costume Design and was nominated for ArtSet Design. I think the film's best asset besides Errol Flynn is Max Steiner's music. As Flynn films usually are well scored this one even stands out among that group.The Adventures of Don Juan marked the thirteenth and last film that Alan Hale made with Errol Flynn. If Alan Hale or Frank McHugh did not appear in Warner Brothers production it didn't seem quite right. Jack Warner kept those two guys busiest of all at his studio.Although Errol was getting older and his hedonistic living was starting to show the part calling for an older and wiser Don Juan was well suited for him. One wishes he'd done the role back in the middle Thirties as a young man however.".

As Flynn films usually are well scored this one even stands out among that group.The Adventures of Don Juan marked the thirteenth and last film that Alan Hale made with Errol Flynn. If Alan Hale or Frank McHugh did not appear in Warner Brothers production it didn't seem quite right. Jack Warner kept those two guys busiest of all at his studio.Although Errol was getting older and his hedonistic living was starting to show the part calling for an older and wiser Don Juan was well suited for him. One wishes he'd done the role back in the middle Thirties as a young man however.";

Errol Flynn plays the role he spent his whole life training for  Don Juan  in this spectacular Warner Brothers adventure film. There is so much to recommend this film it's a shame American audiences didn't respond to it the way European audiences did at its initial release. Flynn does his best work in years as Don Juan ably supported by perennial sidekick Alan Hale and Robert Douglas as the evil Duke De Lorca. The costumes are amazing the sets splendid the Technicolor never looked better  but to top it all off the swordplay choreographed by the legendary maestro Fred Cavens Adventures of Robin Hood The Mark of Zorro is second to none. From the brief duels with jealous husbands to the scenes in the fencing academy to the final rapier and dagger brawl capped by a spectacular leap performed by stuntman Jock Mahoney the sword work here is awesome. btw historical fencing fans should note the use of Thibaults' Mysterious Circle on the wall of the fencing school completely appropriate since this is the Spanish school of rapier play. Future Perry Mason Raymond Burr has a memorable role as one of the villains in this court intrigue adventure and Viveca Lindfors is excellent as the Queen but it is Flynn with his wit panache and blade skill who dominates just as it should be. For terrific entertainment in the classic Hollywood tradition take a look at The Adventures of Don Juan! UPDATE 2907 This film will soon be available on a new DVD in the second Errol Flynn collection box set along with another good Flynn film The Dawn Patrol.".

	schema:reviewBody "Errol Flynn is back in swashbuckling costume eight years after the excellent The Sea Hawk and it feels like he never went away. I was expecting this film to be not that good and I imagined Flynn as looking tired and puffy as a result of his wild lifestyle. However I was pleasantly surprised. It's a wonderful piece of entertainment. Of course the plot is really no different from any other swashbuckler but it's still a heck of a lot of fun. Flynn is perfectly cast as Don Juan really who else can you picture but the Tasmanian Devil in the role? This film is about Don Juan in love with his Queen a suitably regal Viveca Lindfors and putting his life on the line for Spain. Aside from the natural ageing process and looking a little puffy around the face Flynn is as attractive charming and witty as ever. Alan Hale his sidekick in many of his previous films joins in again. He's Don Juan's loyal friend who keeps the horses under the boudoir window so Flynn can make a quick getaway if a jilted husband bearing a sword arrives. We even have Una O'Connor there which makes us all sigh and remember Robin Hood. The Warners team do a great job in creating a fresh new swashbuckler for more cynical PostWar audiences Flynn character is more knowing and sarcastic but in a good way whilst being an affectionate tribute AND sendup to the earlier great classics. I guess Warners capitalised on news of Flynn's rape trial and reports of his hedonistic lifestyle in creating this film. But Flynn seems to take it in good humour. The costumes sets and colour are first rate as is Max Steiner's stately score. And the last line is a classic!".

As Duke De Lorca he was a very ambitious minister with a hand of steel... I'm Spain! he expressed once... His declaration remembered me Vincent Price in The Three Musketeers when he states in his role of Cardinal Richelieu I'm France!The duel between De Lorca I warned you Seor this time I shall cut deeply. and Don Juan This time I'm wearing my old clothes. is exciting and stylish...With humorous moments displayed by the sympathetic dwarf actor Jerry Austin Don Sebastian and with a splendid exhibition of young swordsmen lovely ladies secret plots drinking escapades swords clashing furious fights and with a great complementary score by Max Steiner The Adventures of Don Juan is a great entertaining swashbuckler highly recommended...";

Of his swashbucklers the BIG THREE were always Captain Blood The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Sea Hawk. But two movies often omitted from a list of his best are The Adventures of Don Juan and The Master of Ballantrae. Don Juan is a movie in the vein of Burt Lancaster's Crimson Pirate or The Flame and The Arrow being a tongueincheek swashbuckler that scores on several points. Flynn was clearly comfortable with light comedy it featured some great bad guy work by Robert Douglas and despite production problems caused BY Flynn's excesses the editing in of sequences from Robin Hood and Elizabeth and Essex worked very well. The fencing scenes were thoroughly enjoyable! All in all I would recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of the genre.".

	schema:headline " Errol Flynn Shines As Legendary Lover!";
	schema:reviewBody "THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN was intended as something of a 'comeback' film for Warner Bros. resident 'bad boy' combining the heroic elements of 'ROBIN HOOD' and 'THE SEA HAWK' with Errol Flynn's wellestablished by 1948 reputation as a hellraising womanizer. Unfortunately the color production Flynn's first swashbuckler in nearly a decade was not a box office hit but the comic adventure is today embraced by his many fans as one of his best roles!It was not an easy film to make as Flynn's carousing and disappearances officially called 'sicknesses' stretched the filming and forced frequent reshooting. Director Vincent Sherman cinematographer Elwood Bredell and editor Alan Crosland often had to 'cutandpaste' snippets of many takes to achieve a decent performance from the star and careful lighting had to be used to play down the increasingly obvious effects of the star's hedonistic lifestyle. The closing scene featuring then wife Nora Eddington was shot nearly a year before the remainder of the film and the change in the Flynn's physical appearance is clearly evident. At 38 the star who always hated being called a 'pretty boy' to the extent that his home had few mirrors was aging rapidly.All this being said Flynn tried to give the film the best he could. It had been a landmark film for his friendmentor John Barrymore in the first Warners' film with sound employed for music and special effects only in 1926 THE JAZZ SINGER would introduce 'talkies' a year later. It reunited him with friend and frequent costar Alan Hale who at 56 was still a popular character actor and whose son Alan Jr. was starting to make his mark around town he would eventually be best known as the Skipper in 'Gilligan's Island'. The script for DON JUAN in development since 1939 passed through many hands including uncredited help by William Faulkner and Robert Florey with the end result being marvelously tongueincheek. The score by the legendary Max Steiner became an instant classic and would be reused years later in George Hamilton's ZORRO THE GAY BLADE. This was a film which despite Errol Flynn's selfdestructive lifestyle had enough talent involved to still stand up as one of the better films of the 1940s.The plot involves rou Don Juan tossed out of England after breaking up a 'diplomatic' wedding a VERY funny scene returning home to Spain to find evil Duke de Lorca the sublimely nasty Robert Douglas controlling weak King Phillip and taxing the population to near starvation with only the beautiful Queen Margaret standing in his way. Flynn quickly dispatches a de Lorca press gang earning the Count's hatred and the Queen's attention...and Don Juan finds himself truly falling in love for the first time with the youthful monarch played by the radiant Viveca Lindfors. Assigned as a fencing master at the Academy the legendary lover draws the ire of the Queen by stating his feelings for her then is manipulated into another disastrous diplomatic blunder involving of course another woman. On the run he discovers de Lorca's ultimate scheme manipulating the Crown into war and with the help of the students of the Academy he must save the King and Queen.Featuring a great early appearance by Raymond Burr as a de Lorca henchman and a stirring final duel between Flynn and Douglas expanded from the 1926 version and featuring an astonishing climactic stairway jump performed by stuntman and future 'Tarzan' Jock Mahoney THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN is a gloriously adventuresome romp. Sadly it didn't save Flynn's flagging career but it certainly has earned a place among his classic films!".

The acting is superb across the board.The film true to the studio system protocols of the era is stylized but the stylization works brilliantly. I am certain that any contemporary aspiring director writer or actor who is serious about his or her craft can learn an immense amount from this film.".

Queen Margaret upsets Don Rodrigo by trying to maintain her power who is also at odds with Don Juan. Don Juan and the queen are eventually captured by Don Rodrigo and his aides but the great romantic escapes from the dungeon to stop Don Rodrigo from going ahead with his plans. The film is good but plays more as a parody of Flynn's former films such as Robin Hood Sea Hawk etc. with little emphasis on action until the final reel which gives us one of filmdom's best sword fights with Flynn vs. Douglas and his men on the staircase. Lindfors plays more for eye candy rather than give a good performance. Hale in his last film w Flynn plays the role adequately and Douglas is superb as the villain. Nice script with many humorous touches. Rating 8.".

Comparing it to The Three Musketeers and Robin Hood.  Getting my two children to agree on a movie is pretty spectacular.We all enjoyed the action scenes and the humor that Errol Flynn displays throughout the movie.  The costuming was well done not overly lavish as some of the movies from the 40's can be.  The scenery was confined to a few well done sets.The acting was genuine from almost every character including the young Raymond Burr. The script did follow the story line of many swashbuckling hero type movies but the quality of the actors made the movie fresh.One of the things I like best about this movie is that the good was truly good and the bad truly bad.  There is a theme of redemption for Don Juan who in the end quietly leaves to pursue his life.  and of course women He leaves Spain in the hands of King Phillip III and the Queen to her King. He loves the Queen but knows he cannot have her.  A noble ending for a gem of a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Loves of Hercules was one of two peplum films featuring Hercules the other being Goliath and the Dragon released in 1960 following the success of Hercules and its sequel both starring Steve Reeves. This marks American sexsymbolactress Jayne Mansfield's only peplum entry because I guess what to do when you have a hunky slab of bodybuilder beef lying around the house but cast him as the legendary strongman and play his main squeeze? It's a good idea on paper.Mansfield and Hungarian bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay married in 1956 and this was the second film they made together. Both have been better elsewhere but let's face it their most enduring and worthwhile contribution to the performing arts was producing daughter Mariska. It certainly isn't this turkey which sees Herc buffeted by a succession of women who do him wrong. Indeed the theme here seems to be that musclemen should stick to slaying monsters and performing heroic feats because women will just mess with you. Hargitay despite his build is not very convincing in the role  he has a round boyish face that in this context makes him look more like a lost and confused lad than a god among men. Mansfield's performance is too selfabsorbed and anachronistic to be anything but distracting. She has a dual role as the good Queen Deianira and the evil Queen Hippolyta and neither Hercules nor viewers can tell them apart. Hint her hair color changes. Oddly the two real life partners have no onscreen chemistry here.None of the rest of the cast are particularly interesting the set pieces are unremarkable as are the set design and costumes. The treemonsters the Amazons transform men into are a little spooky and the large cast of extras look like they are having fun. Despite being filmed at Cinecitta this looks as cheap as it probably was  especially the monsters Hercules battles which includes the paperiest of paper mache Hydras and an emaciated looking gorilla suit. The only energetic fight sequence is when Hargitay dispatches Mansfield's blowhard fianc by picking him up spinning him around a bit and throwing him across the room. This is the only moment the film manages to sell the idea that you shouldn't tangle with Hercules. This is only for Hercules andor Mansfield or Hargitay completists  everyone else can skip it.".

Jayne Mansfield was probably most noted for her very large breasts which when displayed next to actresses of normal endowment actually makes those actresses look flat chested. But as large as they were Jane carried them very well. And while she was often considered a dumb blonde she in fact was very smart and was a fine actress. I remember when she died in 1967 in a car wreck in Louisiana not very far at all from where I was working on a postgraduate summer Chemistry project.In this movie Jayne Mansfield is darkhaired Queen Deianira. When her husband the King is killed she becomes the sole ruler of the small kingdom. From some other battles with his people Mickey Hargitay who in real life was Mansfield's actual husband plays the part of Hercules  seeking justice. Massimo Serato is the traitor Licos  a member of the King's own inner circle he had the King killed so that once he romanced Deianira and married her the kingdom would be his. But after a side trip and an encounter with the Hydra plus an encounter with an Amazon who made herself look like Deianira Mansfield also played the seductress Hippolyta with red hair to entrap Hercules he made it back to Deianira and helped defeat the traitor Licos. The ending was like an American Western with Hercules and Deinira on a horse riding into the sunset with lush music playing. By today's standards this is not a good movie at all the sets looks fake most of the action looks amateurish as well as most of the acting. But it is a good watch for Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield icons of a bygone era plus it shows how far production values have come in 50 years.".

Watch a bunch of the other Hercules actors and you'll see what I mean. Best of all the movie veers off into delirious Alexander Ptushko territory about halfway through when Herc encounters the threeheaded Hydra in the land of the Amazons. Anyone who loves Ray Harryhausen type fantasy films will get a kick out of this one. The weirdass forest of human trees is especially good. Definitely a winner.".

Anyone who loves Ray Harryhausen type fantasy films will get a kick out of this one. The weirdass forest of human trees is especially good. Definitely a winner.";

Ever since I saw Bloody Pit Of Horror I've had a soft spot for Hargitay but he and Mansfield and let's be faireveryone else are pretty bad here. Not horrible mind you  the casting leans toward attractive and interesting looking people and everyone in the cast acts at about the same level  but pretty bad.In Hargitay's case especially the vocals dubbing? just sucks. It's as if they used Tommy Wiseau the epically awful actor from The Room to utter his lines and Tommy had a bad migraine that week and couldn't be bothered to pay attention to what he was saying. Combine that with Hargitay's perpetually dopey yearning expression and you have a screen portrayal that's at the opposite end of the scale from the gravitas and dignity you'd get from someone like Steve Reeves or Reg Park.And Hargitay's blocking and fight choreography are off. For a strong man and body builder Hargitay seems stiff awkward and unconvincing. I know he can do better than this because he moved like a different person entirely in Bloody Pit. The fight with the Hydra in the middle of the film is an especially egregious example of this  I've seen fights staged better at my local community theater productions. Mansfield  well I 've read that she was actually an intelligent and multifaceted person but you'd never guess that from her role here. She stands around and pulls various tragic faces and well juts a lot. Adding insult to injury is a screenplay that calls for the murder of Hercule's innocent wife in the first 5 minutes of the film and then has the character and the movie forget all about her immediately afterwards. Seriously she's never mentioned again. And there's a plot against Hercules that can only succeed if all the characters display less mental acuity than the girls in a junior high locker room. Which they do. Oh and there's a trial against the Queen that proves her innocence when Hercules throws 4 axes at her...and succeeds in MISSing her on purpose instead of hitting her. You'd think that missing a woman who occupies less than 30 of a target area would be ridiculously easy for a demigod and professional warrior but here the movie acts as if it's a heroic miracle. Hmmm and the central plot point of the movie  where the queen of the Amazons decides to seduce our hero  just marks time for 20 minutes until Herc's shield bearer finds him and then he basically walks away without doing anything heroic whatsoever. The queen gets killed by a tree. Really. Boy.Take my advice and watch the Reeves or Parks or even Gordon Scott Hercules movies again instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen dozens of Hercules or Maciste or Atlas or whatever you want to call him movies over the years but The Loves of Hercules just might be the worst of the bunch. It's got so many problems there's no way I can innumerate all of them. A few I'll mention 1. Mickey Hargitay doesn't fit my image of Hercules at all. Guys like Steve Reeves Reg Park Alan Steel Lou Ferrigno and even I can't believe I'm saying this Peter Lupus are more suited to the role and better look the part. You know it's a bad sign when Herc's love interest physically dominates him. His acting is as stiff and unnatural as the Hydra he battles. And Hargitay wasn't helped by the dubbing choices made for the movie. The Shakespearian wannabe who voiced Hercules in this movie got it all wrong.2. I just can't take Jayne Mansfield seriously. She has less believability in her role than Hargitay in his. She doesn't do drama very well.3. The Loves of Hercules is also known as Hercules vs the Hydra. As I've already alluded to the Hydra is horrible. It doesn't move! A boat anchor has more dexterity than this thing. To kill it Hercules calmly walks underneath it hits it with a few very weak and awkward looking ax blows and the middle head just sort of falls off. End of the Hydra.4. As the movie went on I became frustrated with Hercules' motivations. At the beginning of the movie he sets out to avenge the death of his wife I think she was his wife. However his motivation changes completely the moment he meets Deianira  his new one true love. The dead wife is all but forgotten. Next the moment he meets the Deianira lookalike Hippolyta he falls madly in love with her. Herc apparently falls for any woman with two legs in his immediate vicinity. What happened to being a good upstanding guy with some sort of moral compass? 5. Herc's fight with the bull  nothing else needs to be said.6. The big finale the storming of the palacecastle is about as lame as you'll see. Herc's big contribution is to carry a wooden wagon wheel over his head so he can presumably block the archers' arrows. Why not shoot around him? The wheel's not that big. Or why not go low and shoot Herc's legs? He carries the thing so high that his head is about the only thing truly protected. Like I said lame. Other than Massimo Serato as the evil Licos I can't think of anything else positive to say. I'm going to be very generous and give The Loves of Hercules a 310 for curiosity value if nothing else.".

Fans of these bizarre Italian muscleman flicks will no doubt find this a hugely entertaining experience even if the acting is poor and the dubbing is even worse. Seemingly every review I've seen comments on how bad this film is but I've seen a heck of a lot worse. At least this is an actionpacked experience and one which is never boring.Mickey Hargitay takes over the reigns from Steve Reeves as muscleman hero Hercules his body packed with rippling muscles his mind the size of a pea. Hargitay was of course Mansfield's husband which is probably the sole reason of him appearing in this film. As he is dubbed  by himself I think  it's difficult to assess his performance but he does pull a lot of strange and amusing expressions along the way. Interestingly his character is given a strong Italian accent whereas heroes of these peplum films typically have strong American accents  this difference makes things a little more genuine don't you think? Jayne Mansfield is this film's biggest selling point. Her presence is so great that she has a dual role that of a good queen and an evil queen. Mansfield isn't really required to act in the film only scream occasionally and look as ravishing as possible at every moment. Also in the cast is the great Italian actor Massimo Serato playing the baddie he's evil in the classic oldfashioned sense of the word doublecrossing friends murdering off people all the time being cruel torturing and whipping those who oppose yet still manages to be the gentleman at times notice the way he protects Mansfield from a threat at the film's conclusion. The rest of the characters are either village idiots simpering buffoons or beautiful yet dumb women who amusingly scream aaaah! when they are killed. Oh and the stuffy old courtiers who spend a lot of time talking but not actually doing much. The film is quite well made and the low budget is disguised through some lovely crisp photography. One thing I particularly liked about this film was the score which really helps to give it that historical epic feel.Hercules gets to show his might at various intervals during the film's course from the expected picking up of incredibly heavy items a cartwheel a tree trunk a rock to fighting off nasty opponents in the form of a mountain ape man and a huge firebreathing dragon. The dragon fight scene is the film's centrepiece and although the special effects aren't up to much I found it very impressive. The dragon supposedly the Hydra although it's nothing like the Hydra of Greek mythology for a start it has only three heads and doesn't grow them back after getting them cut off is a gigantic puppet okay it may not be very realistic but the sheer effort that they put into animating it is the impressive thing about it. For me this is a sheer unmissable experience! The ape man turns up unexpectedly at the end as a means to dispose of the villain whom it strangles and providing yet another cheap adversary for Hercules to battle. The ape man's appearance can be described in one word as laughable although I felt quite sorry for it. One minute its eyeing up a halfnaked Mansfield the next it gets crushed by a huge rock! There are plenty of other fantastic elements to keep this film interesting. One evil woman changes her appearance at will helped by a blackcloaked witch who hangs around with her. She also kills all men in her kingdom after loving them transferring their souls into trees where they remain trapped forever in order to demonstrate this amazing fact a minor characters breaks a branch on one of these trees and sure enough blood spurts out!. This trees of woe scene is also pretty cool.Lots of minor characters get killed off in this film either getting stabbed or shot with arrows and stuff. A couple of people fall into a bubbling pit of acid for good measure at the end. There are a couple of big battles to enjoy including an uprising for the film's finale as well as mild torture whipping seems to the preferred torture method for these guys. In all it's pretty exciting. If you don't mind cheesy adventure flicks in the same tradition as JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS then this one is for you. See it to believe it!".

It seems that the evil King of Ecalia and his armies are responsible and it's up to our hero to kick butt and right wrongs.The fact that The Loves of Hercules was a terrible film should have come as no major surprise for me as every HerculesMaciste film I have ever seen from Italy have been rather bad. In the late 50s to about the mid1960s the Italian film industry produced a ton of these films. Most starred some foreigner such as Steve Reeves though there were GOBS of others such as Peter Lupus and Mark Forest and had otherwise allItalian castswith generally lousy dubbing in the English language versions I've seen. So why did I watch this bad film? Well curiosity. I was curious to see the starsMickey Hargitay and his then wife Jayne Mansfield. Mansfield plays two characters and Hargitay plays Hercules.So what did I like about the film? Well Miss Mansfield looked nice. I particularly liked seeing her in a brown wig for a change of pace. Now you know it's bad when this is the only thing I really liked! The acting was stilted the plot was quite boring and for an epic it sure was amazingly small and nonepic! Overall it's no better or worse than any of the other films of the genrewhich isn't saying much. My advice is see a couple then you've pretty much seen them all. And if you want to see the most enjoyable of these see the much later film Hercules in New York with Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is so incredibly bad that it's actually a lot of fun to watch! As for The Loves of Hercules it's forgettable and dumbno more no less.".

	schema:reviewBody "Certified Copy is at first sight a romantic drama set on a single day in a small Tuscan village. A beautiful if typical European arthouse picture but in fact it has something much more significant to offer.I have to laugh at the constant use of the word pretentious on this site in relation to films which are challenging thematically and which do not engage all viewers. These reviewers use it in place of the word 'boring' because I suppose they feel that labelling it as merely boring suggests they have difficulty understanding it or engaging with it when in fact that's their criticism.It's a miss representation of both the correct meaning of that word and what this film achieves. This film is not pretentious it is exactly what it purports to be  an examination of a relationship in terms of reality and perception. A conversation examining the value of copies within our lives. It is also unmistakably a Kiarostami film. It's not for everybody.A French woman Binoche attends a lecture from a British author James Miller Shimell. Miller has just published a book on the subject of copies in the art world. She leaves the lecture early but not before leaving her number for the author. The next day he calls to her gallery and the pair travel to Luciagno on what seems at first like a date.As the day progresses and the pair discuss his book and argue about the validity of copies versus originals a complicity between them emerges. Perhaps they know each other quite well. perhaps this is not a first date. In a caf a waitress mistakes them for a married couple and they decide to play along. However this game seems to get out of hand as they assume the roles of a couple who have been married for 15 years. Or do they. Perhaps they are or were married...Kiarostami skillfully weaves his tale around these two characters while examining his central theme that nothing is really original and that we all assume roles in our lives. This is a recall of the themes he masterfully examined in Close Up.At first sight the film may seem like an almost clichd European art film but it is in fact a version or copy of one this is examined in a startling scene where the couple argue about the aesthetic value of a fountain. Which is not real and was only placed there for the film. She loves it he doesn't. He finds it clichd and ornate while she has a very personal and sentimental reaction to it much like many viewers are having to the film. However Kiarostami is keen to ensure that it's clear that her perception is no less important or correct than his. Hers may be an emotional reaction but it is a perfectly legitimate one. This film is not called Certified Copy' for nothing it's Kiarostami's copy of a European art film but is it any less valuable than the originals? Of course not. It exists in and of itself independently of the 'original'.Kiarostami's film is very open ended. It never really explains the relationship between the two which will exasperate audiences looking for a clear resolution. However while people may come to different decisions as to the truth all the ingredients necessary are there.My interpretation is that they are not married nor are they strangers I believe that she is his mistress of 15 years and she longs to be his wife while he is somewhat indifferent to her and probably has a wife. Their relationship is a 'copy' of a marriage without the legitimacy afforded to the other brides who appear regularly throughout the film. Kiarostami's film makes it clear that although she is 'only' the mistress her feelings are legitimate.Kiarostami's film looks beautiful and uses it's location to great effect without becoming a postcard travelogue. His usual visual tropes are all present from the long unbroken takes to the direct to camera acting. In his first screen role William Shimell gives a solid and believable performance as the pompous and emotionally distant English man while Binoche in her Cannes Best Actress winning role is a revelation. Her character is a mess of emotions and Binoche performs them with sheer skill. At times one can see that she is portraying her character as portraying these emotions and this acts to add depth to the concept of copies and reality. A brave and thoughtful performance.Certified Copy is not for everyone. To really 'get' the film one must fully engage in their discussion of some abstract and philosophical themes and in that respect the film may be more enjoyable in retrospect or on second viewing I need to see it again!. However for those who submit to it it's a rich and rewarding cinematic diversion from the Iranian master of illusion.Terrific!".

I think it counts that Kiarostami has designed it to be impenetrable by logic blurred the cause and effect which is a way of dispelling the notion that we can know the world by it. Is he going to put his hand on her shoulder will he take the 9 o'clock train out of there I'd rather ask these questions myself. Both pertain here eventually as abstractions of life. A man and a woman whose relationship real or imaginary we might know from our own efforts.They stop in a museum before the picture of a portrait thought for centuries to be the original though lately discovered to have been only a perfect copy. What value has changed in this object what new perception now regards it this is where I believe this is best unraveled.Things change the man quips philosophically an intellectual much like Kiarostami perhaps. Yet we see the same cypresses standing by the same old road the same plazas and hotels they once visited then young and booming with love. Having spoken so well we see however that the man understands little of that. He can't even enjoy a simple glass of wine without complaining that it is corked what should be a simple pleasure is tainted by the gross irritation that comes from too much satisfaction. Having satisfied our desires so many times in so many different ways we can see that we are no closer to happiness.Where does this weariness then born from too much familiarity from having seen or tasted too much come from and why does it invest our gaze with this constant dissatisfaction? Another line of thought to connect the web of allusions. The woman who has made herself beautiful for him in the day of their anniversary says he doesn't see her anymore. He looks at her but doesn't see meaning something has dissipated with time grown withered in his eyes though she is still the same except a little older.Kiarostami perfectly visualizes the burden that saddles these people in the scene where they are driving around town in the car. On the windshield we see cast over their faces the reflections of buildings gliding by not simply the gap that exists between them indeed between any two human beings but the burden of time life passing them over. In a poignant metaphor we see them move through existence.A perfect copy the original two identical objects which we are taught to perceive differently. The lines being the same in the same places the hues of color painted exactly the same the one intrinsic value that separates the two is merely time. Which is to say that as humans who wither away with time we allow ourselves to regard it as the most precious good the one we cannot buy or sell. The movie shows us how although we may understand our transience as an idea we live as though we will always be here as though we have time enough to postpone a small gesture of affection.But if we simply perceive the world around us this present moment? This draught of air now coming from an open window or this glass of wine? Or indeed this woman who has made herself beautiful for us? This is a great film by one of the few gifted filmmakers of our times perhaps his first truly great one. In the right ears this will be a sutra that will permit us to meditate on fundamental precepts of existence how time thought to matter matters little how craving and ego blind us. How ultimately like a mandala upon which Tibetan monks work tirelessly day and night only to destroy it upon completion life is to be lived in full with knowledge that it will come to pass.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pitch It's like looking in a mirror only not.The Review Juliette Binoche has had a career spanning nearly thirty years and for much of that has jumped between roles in her natural language and English. You might think that with the supposed paucity of good female roles in movies that there's not much left for Binoche to cover that she hasn't before but here she gets to explore some new territory to Cannes best actress awardwinning effect. In the process she gets to cover a range of languages not only English and French but Italian but in this case there is a specific purpose to the variances of the language.The setup is simple William Shimell plays James Miller an British author on a tour of Tuscany where his work on originality in art has been better received than in his homeland. Binoche is the woman who comes to hear his talk and the two are then drawn together in a discussion of his work. Once the two meet again the course of the movie charts their discussions over the course of an afternoon taking in the Italian countryside and engaging with a number of characters along the way who cause them to reflect on their differing viewpoints on Miller's work.There's a turning point as we approach the halfway mark where one of those characters seemingly mistakes the pair for a married couple. What starts as a role play set off by the misunderstanding takes on more and more aspects and eventually both the pair and the audience are lost in the drama. The whole movie reveals itself to be an intricate construct on this concept almost every aspect of the theme the performances or the setting playing with the motif of originality versus imitation. Reflections in car windows sometimes obscure the actors themselves POV shots ask us to engage directly in the drama almost as a participant and this even extends to the leading pair themselves  Shimell is a renowned baritone not an actor and there is a slight but noticeable difference between his performance and that of Binoche which almost feels like a copy of acting rather than being fully immersed in the role.While this reinforces the concept it does prevent the audience from fully engaging being kept slightly at arm's length by the constant artifice. That's not to say that there's not a lot to enjoy here with the confusions and the tensions making this verge on a romantic comedy at times. Despite the differences in acting ability Shimell and Binoche make an engaging couple at times and as time wears on you find yourself more keen to believe that the beginning was the illusion and that their relationship is real and not the copy. Much of the credit for this must be placed at Binoche's door using the language differences to vary mood effectively but also adding colour and emotion in all of the languages she uses. The only one here who's on familiar ground is director Kiarostami who's explored these themes before but never to such mainstream effect  worth checking out if you'd like to engage your mind and your heart.Why see it at the cinema There is a very literal aspect of the visuals which runs throughout the course of the movie which the cinema screen will allow you to fully appreciate.The score 710".

	schema:headline " Profound intelligent enthralling.";
	schema:reviewBody "Certified Copy is a film essentially cut in two. Both halves are lovely and when put together it makes for a remarkable whole work. It's a very simple film on the surface the plot made up almost entirely of a daylong conversation between an author William Shimell and a woman Juliette Binoche showing him around town. The conversation begins with them being these strangers meeting for the first time as they discuss his new book the title of the film and the theories he brings up within it. They discuss the significance of a copy as opposed to it's original and the film brings up a lot of questions on artificiality within culture and within life. Questions arise as to whether or not every individual person is just essentially a copy of someone else and this becomes absolutely fascinating. Then everything changes. A waitress at a cafe mistakes them for a married couple and the two spend the rest of the day going along with this playing a game that they are married and they go back and forth as an unhappy couple would.Or was it mistake? It becomes clear that these people have some connection with each other whether they are divorced former lovers or something entirely separate and the conversation becomes much more biting and intriguing. Writerdirector Abbas Kiarostami keeps us gripped into this conversation as these two ponder on the copies of the world along with the tribulations of a marriage what makes a good husband what makes a good father and so much more. She attacks him for being such an absent father is her son really his? and he explains that sometimes one partner in the marriage just has to be gone and that's the way the world is. The film poses so many interesting questions on the world and leaves it up to the viewer to decide the answers for themselves. Each character has their own strong opinion but Kiarostami never takes a side and tells the viewer the resolution. It's a powerful picture that keeps you thinking long after it's over.Part of the power of course relies on the strength of the performances and both of these actors knock it out of the park. William Shimell was the perfect choice for the distant simple author. Juliette Binoche however steals the show with an authentic and brave performance that ranks up with some of her absolute best. She is arguably the finest actress in cinema today and has a grasp on portraying vulnerability that very few actors can come close to achieving. Within her you really see the pain of a woman scorned and the exhausting life led by a single mother constantly having to think of someone other than herself. She is everything here emotional strong falling apart and beautiful. It's a perfect performance in a magnificent film. I feel like this is a picture that will only get better on repeated viewings and it's still quite strong on the first one.".

	schema:headline " An authentic fascinating confusion";
	schema:reviewBody "If certifying an art piece as a copy means defining the authenticity of its original watching Certified Copy means reviewing how much ideals expectations and fantasies about love you have projected to your life. What does your true self intrinsically need from love? And how do time and life changes affect your perspective? James the protagonist would rather challenge himself with one of the most difficult writing tasks i.e. endorsing the originality of art work than get engaged in the search for an authentic love. For marriage he holds a pessimistically detached attitude which is seen at different points in the film and cannot be clearer when he refused to take a picture with the young couple at the popular wedding spot. For him marriage is just a copy of an image of what people think love should ultimately lead to but marriage is not exactly what love is meant to be. For him love should be liberating like the way that Cypress trees extend their branches it cannot be maintained without adaptation to changes including changes caused by the lapse of time new responsibilities career ambition etc. His detachment towards Juliet Binoche who played the nameless character the woman who sometimes seems to be his wife and sometimes simply seems to be a book fan may be an expression of his insistence on the originality of love.Binoche is the opposite of James. She gives values to copies even though she recognizes the superiority of originals. This is reflected in her antique shop where both originals and copies are displayed and sold. While James shows contempt to Original Copy she highly regards it. Original Copy is the painting copy which was mistaken as the original for such a long time that it eventually got acknowledged as a valuable art work and displayed in the Tuscany museum. For her love is an ideal but not without responsibilities. Marriage may be just an illusion of love but it can be just as real and rewarding if you believe in it hard enough and work on it hard enough. Unfortunately she is in love with someone who does not share the same value as her someone who does not want his own liberal spirit to be inhibited by responsibilities and someone who does not conform to the inferiority of copies. The most intriguing part of the story is that you never know the relationship between James and Binoche. Obviously this is not a mystery to solve but an idea to play with. You can see them as two people who newly met but just play along after being mistaken as a couple. Both of them have demonstrated certain transference as the story goes but Binoche was almost overtaken by it. Unintentionally they projected their feelings towards their spouse onto each other. You can also see James as the constantly unavailable husband of Binoche a man who needs to be free from obligations to enjoy life. It is interesting to note that what seems to be confusing to viewers is plain and clear to the people around these two persons  they all see them as a couple including the waitress the new young couple at the church the old couple by the fountain and the inn keeper. For us viewers the confusion did not start until after the conversation between the waitress and Binoche. From then on James and Bionche started role playing or revealing their past. Either way the process is punctuated by intense and emotional moments. It raised the questions of how we react to others' interpretation of us what constitutes their interpretation and how our reaction to the interpretation affects us in return. If one's identity is shaped by  or worse caters to other's interpretation how authentic can his life remain? How well are we aware of our true self? How much does awareness matter?I love the way that the director uses the camera. At some points the viewer feels like standing behind a twoway mirror watching the characters. At some points the viewer feels like sitting in the position of James or Binoche being looked right into the eyes and talked to. At some other points the viewer feels like being in the position of the new couple whom Binoche was waving at. The open ending is excellent. The question that is left to be answered is whether James took the train and left or he stayed with Binoche.How to draw the line between the value of originality and the value of copies? Are you going to compromise? What is the standard for a certified copy? What are acceptable and not acceptable for an authentic lovelife?".

Here he left Iran for Western Europe because Binoche could not have done this in Iran. A twisted touching thoughtful relationship story that plays with what is a copy and what is an original what is reality and what is imagination. Beautifully filmed and Binoche is at her best. The many languages spoken between the protagonists  none from Iran  just confirmed for me the many levels of a relationship the confusion and misunderstandings you are confronted with no matter where you are. Definitely worth seeing and talking about with intelligent friends.".

The difficulty resides in the multiple layers involved in the relationship of the two protagonists not to speak of the three languages that they both speak in various circumstances. The more the the action evolves the less we seem to understand the real nature of their relationship. What we do know is that those two have a problem of communication. It is this struggle of seductionrejection with setbacks and all that make it worth watching. Atmosphere and the manwoman tension is what keeps it going. The filming is impeccable with lovely scenes of Tuscany excellent camera and the great work on surrounding noises which I believe replaces any music at all. The acting is also very fine with Binoche deservedly getting a major Cannes Film Festival award.".

	schema:reviewBody "Certified Copy is a film of great beauty and mystery. The first thing that strikes you about it is how real it feels. Not just its plot not just the acting but also the dialogs  they are laced in the anguish hope fears disappointments and joys of the life we all live everyday. To try to explain what the film is about it to rob it of its sense of poetic irony but all you need to know about it is that it revolves around two people who strike up a conversation after meeting in picturesque Tuscany. Binoche plays the part of a woman apparently a single mother who owns a small antiques store. She meets a visiting British writer James Miller opera star William Shimell in his debut who is there promoting his new book a treatise on copies in the art world. The two decide to meet later for a discussion dinner but what at first seems like mundane musings on the every day quickly takes a turn when it appears to us that the two are familiar to each other and perhaps even might have met. We are never told not directly at least whether this is the case but numerous hints are dropped a joke that Miller shares for instance than Binoche seems to have heard before then an anecdote that is all too familiar to her and which can relate to about the replica or copy! of the David statue outside the Academia in Florence. Dialogues therefore drive the film. Binoche's description of her sister and her problems with stammering are so succinct so clairvoyant that when we almost feel we know her as well and later in the film when Binoche uses the pseudo stammering 'JJJJames' it tells you so much about her. If you listen carefully to the dialogs and are intent on picking up inflections body language and facial expressions the film is richly rewarding.Credit for this greatly goes to director Abbas Kiarostami for his use of formalism combined with minimalism and tight framings. Let's just say he knows where to place his camera and what to get out of his actors. His closeups of the faces of his two leads is both intrusive and revelatory. In the finest example of this and in an outstanding unbroken single take he lingers on the beautiful ever luminous face of Binoche as she powders her face and applies her lipstick. Ordinarily the scene should have been inconsequential but in the scheme of things it is both a private moment with the character that Binoche plays and fine testament of Binoche's ability. She is outstanding throughout  shifting from one extreme to the other crying and laughing sometimes at the same time. In the films most heartbreaking scene she asks Miller if he noticed whether she dressed up for him that day. When he answers that he didn't she responds by telling him how she was able to pick up the scent of his new perfume. This might be nothing more than the deconstruction of all cross gender relationships yet we learn so much about both of them while being kept at a distance. Because we can only infer what is going on but still not be entirely sure about it the film envelops us into its puzzle completely. At a time when many directors most film and almost all actors are stuck doing the same things Certified Copy feels like the real thing.".

	schema:headline " Ambiguous talky";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no action except talking unless you figure that two people getting in and out of a car is action. The movie is essentially one long conversation between James and a women billed as Elle Juliette Binoche. James is an art historian and Elle is an antique dealer specializing in art. James has just written a book Certified Copy which asks why good reproductions should not be equally as valuable as originals. The book appears to be one of those that takes an idea of some merit and intellectualizes it to death like asking if an original of anything exists or if we are only DNA reproductions of our parents or if a tree is not to be considered an original work of art? The conversation struck me as only a slight cut above what you might hear in a typical college dorm.Halfway through we are thrown a curve ball. While at a restaurant James steps out to take a phone call during which the proprietor dispenses wisdom to Elle about malefemale relationships like how a wife should be happy that her husband works since work is necessary for a man allowing the wife to live her own life. The proprietor mistakes Elle and James for husband and wife and Elle does not dispute that assumption. From here on I was left to deduce whether James and Elle had known each other in the past and were playacting at the beginning or weather they had just met and were playacting after James' return to the restaurant.Perhaps a point is being made about the relationship between perception and reality or that maybe perception is reality. There was a scene between Elle and her young son Julien in a caf where he asks her why James did not sign his book using Julien's surname. This question so upsets Elle that she runs out of the caf. I thought that there must be some significance in that scene. Does James have an alias with the same surname as Julien? Is James Julien's father out of wedlock? I could not ultimately make any reasonable inferences about this scene though I feel it is of importance. In the end I found the message being delivered if there is one so muddled that I lost patience in trying to figure it out. I found James to be a cynical pretentious obnoxious and petulant pedant. The main positive is Juliette Binoche who is almost always worth watching no matter what movie she is in. While her performance is not without interest here it was not enough to save the day for me. The production values are high and there are some nice scenes of the Tuscany countryside.".

From here on I was left to deduce whether James and Elle had known each other in the past and were playacting at the beginning or weather they had just met and were playacting after James' return to the restaurant.Perhaps a point is being made about the relationship between perception and reality or that maybe perception is reality. There was a scene between Elle and her young son Julien in a caf where he asks her why James did not sign his book using Julien's surname. This question so upsets Elle that she runs out of the caf. I thought that there must be some significance in that scene. Does James have an alias with the same surname as Julien? Is James Julien's father out of wedlock? I could not ultimately make any reasonable inferences about this scene though I feel it is of importance. In the end I found the message being delivered if there is one so muddled that I lost patience in trying to figure it out. I found James to be a cynical pretentious obnoxious and petulant pedant. The main positive is Juliette Binoche who is almost always worth watching no matter what movie she is in. While her performance is not without interest here it was not enough to save the day for me. The production values are high and there are some nice scenes of the Tuscany countryside.";

When they arrive in the village they are mistakenly taken as husband and wife and the woman decides to play the game and soon the bitter James Miller assumes the role of her husband.I am not a fan of Abbas Kiarostami but I see his movies since they are usually challenging and open to interpretations. I have just seen Copie Conforme on DVD and I have my understanding of the story that may be or may be not the real intention of this Iranian writer  director.Juliette Binoche's character definitely knows James Miller and there are evidences first she has a reserved spot in his lecture then her son comments that she had decided to fall in love with the British writer last when James arrives in her antique shop they do not introduce themselves to each other and they are not too formal as strangers certainly would be. I believe that James Miller first met her years ago while she was walking on street with her son following her but never together. She probably would be a single mother with rejection to her son and on that occasion they might have become lovers or they had at least a love affair in the hotel that they visit in the end but James probably would be married.They travel to the romantic village of Lucignano and they have a long discussion about copies and originals art works. When the owner of the cafeteria believes that they are married the French woman plays games with James Miller pretending that they have been married for fifteen years probably because she might have wanted to be his wife in the past. In the end there is a parallel with the central subject of the story copies vs. originals and the drama turns into a faithful copy of a romantic comedy with a longterm marriage. My vote is seven.Title BrazilCpia Fiel Faithful Copy".

	schema:reviewBody "So it goes like this...My parents have quarreled as always. My boyfriend is on the other part of the world and I haven't seen him for a month 5 more to go. OK so I'm sitting in my room and pitying myself as good as I can. And along came...no not Polly. Along came 'Certified Copy'. Couple of things to consider before watching the movie I wish someone's told me those. If you're looking for a French romantic comedy in style of 'Jet Lag'starring Binoche and Renodon't count on this one. Get ready to struggle through the first 40 minutes of the movie. It may seem boring even for those who are interested in art. Why? 'Cause it's not about art as you'll discover later. I have to give credit to Abbas Kiarostami for that plot twist that finally brought the story line to life. At the end you even start to appreciate that first part which seemed to be meaningless. So it's not about art. The subject is trivial and eternal  relationship between husband and wife. The whole plot could be put in one line  here's what almost every couple will be after 15 years of marriage. And no matter what she does no matter how hard she tries to recreate the past full of happy illusions he still has to catch his train at 9 o'clock. In the course of the movie you keep stumbling across happy newlyweds here and there. However seeing the protagonists at the same time you do realize that not many of those married couples will grow old together sweetly holding hands everywhere they go. For many people everything written above is obvious 'cause they've already lived through this and have come to terms with the fact that there's no eternal love and the marriage ceremony is much more beautiful than the marriage itself. However if you're in your early 20's and everyone around you keeps saying 'Stop dreaming this is real life wake up!' But you remain stubborn and say 'No I can do better than that. I'll find my real love and I'll treat it with care'.After watching this movie you may think 'Well it's time to admit everything they've told me is true'. And that's when you grow up.".

	schema:headline " Great movie once you understand the plot";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen the movie twice and here is my interpretation of the plot.Fifteen years before the start of the movie the woman played by Juliette Binoche and James have an affair. They live in France. James is probably married since she sees her relationship with him as a certified copy not an original like his relationship with his wife. They go on a holiday to Tuscany staying at the hotel shown at the end of the movie. The night before the day shown in the movie is the 15th anniversary of their first night there. Her son is conceived early in the relationship. Although they never marry the affair lasts at least a year or two. After the breakup James abandons his son.Five years before the start of the movie without telling James she moves to Florence. By coincidence James visits the city shortly afterward. He happens to see her and the boy walking past his hotel window but he doesn't recognize her. Later in the piazza he notices her againshe is looking at a statue with the boy. Although James still doesn't recognize her he is struck by the fact that the boy apparently loves the statue a copy just as much as if it were the original. This gives him the idea for a book about certified copies in art. The central theme of the book is that a copy can be just as good in some ways as the original as evidenced by the subtitle Forget the original just get a good copy.The book is published a few months before the movie begins. She discovers the book in a bookstore and buys several copies. By this time she has moved from Florence to a town near the place where she and James vacationed 15 years earlier. She runs a local antique shop. After she hears that James is visiting her town to lecture about his new book she contacts him to see if they might meet. Apparently they haven't seen each other in many years.He plans to arrive the evening before his lecture and they agree that she will meet him at his hotel. While James considers their affair to be a longago closed chapter in his life her feelings for him are as strong as ever. On their 15th anniversary she is hoping to rekindle their relationship both romantically and sexually. But James isn't so enthusiastic. Not only does he arrive late but he falls asleep while she is freshening up in the bathroom. Finding him asleep on the bed she leaves and returns home.The next morning she attends the lecture but has to leave early to get the boy something to eat. Before leaving she passes a note to James asking him to meet her at her shop after the lecture. At the restaurant she gives the boy a book she got James to autograph and the boy teasingly asks why she got James to write only his first name. The fact that her son had to take her last name because he was born out of wedlock is such a painful subject for her that she has to leave the table.Later when James arrives at her shop they act almost like strangers because they haven't seen each other in years. They apparently spoke only a few words the night before. For the moment she overlooks his rude behavior at the hotel hoping to salvage what she can of her original plans. James suggests an afternoon ride in the country before he catches his nine o'clock train. She says I'll take you to a place that you might find interesting meaning the town where they stayed 15 years earlier.As they drive through the countryside they start arguing about his book. From the outset it is clear that she doesn't agree with his main point. Although it seems that they are discussing art she is really talking about their relationship. She tells him that she doesn't like copies she never wanted their relationship to be a facsimile of the real thing. But he tells her that he thinks copies are just fine.When they arrive at their destination they stop at a coffee shop. She asks how he got the idea for the book. When he begins to tell her about the woman in Florence she realizes that it was her and at the same time she thinks How could you not recognize me? Once James sees the tears in her eyes he slowly starts to comprehend his mistake in Florence but doesn't openly acknowledge this fact to her.After James takes a call perhaps from his wife Binoche says that the woman behind the counter mistook them for a married couple. As they leave the shop they fall into a game of pretending to be married. She uses the roleplaying as a way to voice her complaints to James. She tells him how difficult and frustrating it is to be a single parent. Later when they stop at a restaurant she talks about how he hurt her feelings the night before. At this point James is fed up with the game and yells at her even telling her that he hates her after they leave the restaurant.They wander through the streets and end up at the hotel where they had stayed so many years before. As they sit on the front steps of the hotel he apologizes for fifteen years ago and five years ago. She softens and becomes more flirty. She suggests that they go look at the room where they stayed. She remembers every detail about their holiday but James doesn't recognize the hotel or the view outside the room window. Hoping to seduce him she lies on the bed and asks him to stay with her. Instead he goes to the bathroom to freshen up as the bell outside the window rings eight times.".

Binoche is utterly captivating and her award for Best Actress at Cannes is entirely deserved. She is seemingly inexhaustible communicating in Italian French and English and losing no degree of vulnerability bitterness or magnetism between the languages and she has a remarkable way of kind of softly inhabiting any given situation but being able to turn caustic and uncomfortable with immediacy. There are moments when the characters are sitting opposite each other in conversation and they are speaking directly into the camera and when Binoche does this it's never less than transfixing.Shimmel for a first time actor is for the most part quite grounded and reserved but it's with him that the film often feels at its flattest. He's the more outwardly ruminating intellectual always approaching things with a contemplative thought and it often feels like the film is struggling to maintain a deep thought as if in fear of being mocked for being nothing less than poetic. Maybe that's the way the character is supposed to be but all his affectations get tiring. He comments on Eucalyptus trees being so totally unique how each one has its own shape and definition and being unlike the other one and as truthful as it might be it's just a comment that leaves you thinking 'And?' At other times the exchanges of these characters are scintillating as when an innocuous pitstop at a caf becomes changes the gears of their relationship and Binoche begins to furiously criticise his cool charming bullshitmasquerade. The dialogue operates in these two modes between fascinating and questionable but never really finds its footing.Abbas Kiarostami is clearly a man who knows exactly what he wants to do and how to do it and at the jolly age of 74 all the wisdom and joy and despair he must have accumulated in his lifetime can be felt here in the vivaciousness and the bitterness of the characters in the way a camera can just sit and stay trained for minutes on end and let the people unfurl themselves but sometimes it feels like all he is trying to much to do justice to all his collected experience in life. There's a shot toward the end with our couple standing in a courtyard together and just in front of them is a far older couple man and wife standing on the same side of each other tentatively walking and supporting each other. The imagery is obvious but the connotations are beautiful and it's the sort of a shot that could only have worked as aposiopesis to the journey preceding it. Maybe that is the pointSo there was an ambivalence I felt throughout the film but it's hard to dismiss something this lovingly made as an expression of the melancholy of our relationships in life. There's a blustery and picturesque feel throughout this Italian journey that is hard to argue with.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. OK I feel terrible. This movie is a darling of the critics. Juliette Binoche won the highest acting award at Cannes for her performance. It's the first film from outside of Iran by legendary writerdirector Abbas Kiarostami Under the Olive Tree. It is a technical masterpiece filled with various philosophies on art love and life. It's filmed in one of the most beautiful historic areas in the world. The one thing it didn't do very well was capture my interest. I know ... I feel terrible.In my defense this is a very odd film. Is it about two people courting each other? Is it about two people roleplaying? Is it about two people trying to recapture or deflect a previous relationship? Is it all of those things? To make matters worse it plays a bit like a grownup Before Sunrise or Before Sunset. Brace yourself ... I didn't much like either of those Richard Linklater classics. Again I feel terrible.Pretty much everything I have to say about this movie is positive. Ms. Binoche is outstanding and captivating. William Shimell is a long way from his British Opera fame but does an admirable job as the lessthanenchanting writer and object of Ms. Binoche's attention. The quaint Tuscan town of Lucignano comes off beautifully as the locale that newlyweds flock to for romance. The sound editing is spectacular birds chirping and flapping water dripping from fountains footsteps clattering ... all of these make up the realistic backdrop for the barrage of verbal tangling. Even the camera work is expert. Sometimes we are POV with our characters while other times we are the eyes unto which they gaze. Both effects are startling.All those pieces are very well done and technically expert. The two characters are interesting enough on their own but the story or approach of having these two playpretend just didn't grab me. Yes Yes Yes ... I feel just terrible about it.".

The movie making is based on endlessly insistent closeups and overly dark contrast.

Heroes returned home from the Civil War to be greeted by the Secretary of War Edwin Stanton Kevin Kline and other highprofile members of the War Department. President Abraham Lincoln was occupied elsewhere.After the assassination of Lincoln we follow not so much the trials of the conspirators but the trials of lawyer Frederick Aiken James McAvoy. McAvoy has quickly forged an incredible career where he has a propensity to play the man next to historical figures and provide us with an inside view like the doctor to Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland or secretary to Leo Tolstoy in The Last Station.Here McAvoy is the very patriotic soldierturnedlawyer defending Mary Surrat Robin Wright the lone female conspirator. The film focuses only on Surrat's part of the trial of the conspirators mostly because this film is about her lawyer. A devout supporter of Stanton and the Union Aiken believed that Surrat was guilty and spent just as much time proving her guilt as her innocence. His internal struggles accepting everything that he had to do and what he should do were rather profound. I also think they make up McAvoy's best performance of his career. Too bad that the Academy will have forgotten it by the time the Oscars come around.Like the best historical dramas Redford never comes out and says if he believes that Surrat was innocent or guilty. The Conspirator isn't about that. This is about the trial. His views on the use of a military tribunal versus a civil trial are clear.I was blown away by the impeccable production the cast and the sheer atrocities committed by so many of the characters not on trial. There may have been a few artistic licences taken but I doubt it was with the extremes to which some military personnel will go. The great Kevin Kline and the upandcoming Johnny Simmons play the two least sympathetic characters in the movie. Phenomenal casting is just one the great aspects of The Conspirator.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Redford's The Conspirator dramatizes the military trial of Mary Suratt a boarding house owner accused of harboring conspirators and being involved in the plot to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln. It is a strong if somewhat obvious drama that depicts the mood of hysteria that followed the assassination and suggests its relevance to today's politics. Written by James Solomon who spent fourteen years researching the story the film opens with a brief introduction showing the agony of combat troops in the Civil War then focuses on the assassination of the President on April 14 1865 by actor John Wilkes Booth Toby Kebbell a Southern partisan and his companions Lewis Payne Norman Reedus David Herold Marcus Hester and Samuel Arnold Jeremy Tuttle at the Ford Theatre in Washington D.C..Stealthily entering the President's box Booth shoots Lincoln in the head then leaps onto the stage shouting sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants and escapes on horseback. The assassination results in an outpouring of grief all over the country and prompts the Secretary of War Edwin Stanton Kevin Kline to vow revenge against the conspirators. After a two week search Booth is found hiding in a nearby barn and shot to death while seven suspected coconspirators are arrested including Mary Suratt. Suratt is tried by a military tribunal where the rules state that only a majority vote is required for a guilty verdict and a twothirds vote is needed to sentence a defendant to death. It is a court where a defendant is prohibited from testifying in their own defense.Senator Reverdy Johnson Tom Wilkinson from Virginia and a former U. S. Attorney General agrees to defend Suratt on the grounds that she is innocent until proved guilty. The Senator however withdraws because he fears that being a Southerner might prejudice his case and asks Frederick Aiken James McEvoy a northern attorney to defend her. Initially reluctant and dubious about her story Aiken resolves to prove her innocence after seeing that the defendant was up against an overbearing prosecutor Danny Huston a biased head of the tribunal Colm Meany and the behindthescenes antagonism of Secretary Stanton.At great cost to his personal life Aiken tries to prove that Ms. Suratt knew the boarders who lived in her house but was not involved in their conspiracy. As the case progresses it becomes apparent that only her son John Johnny Simmons a known conspirator who fled to Canada can save his mother by surrendering. While there is limited dimension to the characters The Conspirator is true to the historical record and the film presents its message in a clear and powerful way. Redford long a champion of civil liberties implicitly reminds us that the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution expressly guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life without due process of law and provides no exception for war.It is not only an important message for those unfamiliar with our nation's history but is strikingly relevant to the present day in which hundreds of detainees at Guantanamo still languish in prison without trial where a U.S. citizen suspected of terrorist activities is targeted for an assassination attempt without having been charged with let alone convicted of any crime and where the ideal of due process and the presumption of innocence is slowly being replaced by unlimited violence the repudiation of legality and the undermining of democracy.".

I came out feeling very contented and a little teary. This movie is very well acted and truly conveys the emotion felt by the characters in history unlike some civil war films. This movie truly is about the struggle between justice and country. I won't give much away but the emotional conflicts in this film are very deep and strong. I was very surprised at James Mcavoy's handling of the character and more so his good American accent D. Robin Wright and other supporting cast are also superb. Do see this movie when it comes out! It's a fantastic drama that will keep you at the edge of your seat mixed in with fantastic period details. Any fan of American history and the civil war will enjoy this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again the young actor JAMES McAVOY gives an earnest and altogether convincing portrait of a man assigned to be the defense lawyer for Mary Surratt accused as one of the conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.Since the whole story is told from his point of view it emerges as a realistic depiction of how events might have unfolded taking no firm stand on the innocence or guilt of the accused. As the nation mourns the sudden death of its leader taken from them just as the Civil War ended we are told that justice must be swift to heal the wounds of the public and satisfy a thirst for revenge. It's that viewpoint that makes this film relevant today in view of other controversial historical events but first and foremost the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.One glaring quibble Apparently to fully immerse the viewer in this time of history and to suit the flavor of the grim tale Redford has chosen to use very muted color photography so that this is almost a sepia tone experience. But do we have to be reminded so flagrantly that this was the candlelit era? Scenes outside of the courtroom could have used flashes of real color as could the social circle interiors of other scenes instead of keeping the lowkey lighting so constant. It became a distraction for me. He may as well have used glorious BW.Other technical aspects are fine and the background score is effective without becoming overwhelming. ROBIN WRIGHT PENN plays Mary Surratt with quiet dignity and strength. KEVIN KLINE is almost unrecognizable as the stubbornly determined EDWIN STANTON seeking quick justice EVAN RACHEL WOOD is effective as the distraught daughter Anna Surratt and JOHNNY SIMMONS is sobering as the accused woman's son who manages to escape imprisonment for his role in the John Wilkes Booth caper. His character unfortunately isn't fleshed out at all.Biggest supporting role goes to TOM WILKINSON as the man who urges McAvoy to take the defense case against his wishes. He and McAvoy share most of the running time on screen and do magnificent jobs.History buffs will no doubt find this more interesting than the average movie fan looking for a more adventurous look at the past but despite flaws it is competently made and does recreate the actual events in a satisfying manner by use of flashbacks and an intelligent script.

	schema:reviewBody "As far back as I can remember I have always been a LincolnKennedy assassination buff. There are many similarities between the lives and deaths of the two men sadly one of them is that we will never know the entire truth behind their deaths. I eagerly awaited this film and I will say up front that it was well worth the wait. Except for the 1998 TNTTV film The Day Lincoln Was Shot this is the finest motion picture about the terrible events of April 14 1865. For this history lover watching this masterwork was like reading history by flashes of lightning! Robert Redford is a true genius as a director. He won an Oscar for the 1980 movie Ordinary People and as far as I'm concerned the Academy should just mail him another right now and save everyone a lot of trouble! This great filmmaker perfectly captures the mood texture and feel of the nation after the assassination when people wanted revenge and not justice and innocent people paid a terrible price. People don't realize that Lincoln's death caused the country as much heartache as JFKs did. There can be not greater injustice then an innocent person being executed and watching this film I am convinced beyond any possible doubt that poor Mary Surrat was such a person. Robin Wright Mrs. Forrest Gump is amazing as this dignified brave woman. She should also get Oscar gold. She is a simple widow who is caught up in this race for vengeance. You feel for this poor woman who is caught in a nightmare. A young actor called James McAvoy also shines as her young lawyer who at first is reluctant and then fights with passion. The courtroom scenes are the best I have seen since A Few Good Men. I was so angry because Mary Surrat and the others were illegally tried by a military court. It was later ruled that this trial should never have taken place. It was a trial that stank with perjury and she did not stand a chance. SPOILER ALERT the final scene of the hanging is bone chilling. You feel like a time traveler standing there watching it. To me this is Robin Wright's finest hour as an actress as she bravely faces death while her three male counterparts are weeping. Robin made Mary Surrat seem so real to me and that is the greatest compliment that you can pay an actor. I was so angry at her cowardly son John. He was the real culprit. He was the one who was going to help Booth and the others escape. The assumption is and this film makes a convincing case that the government only arrested Mary to draw out her son and when he did not come forward they had no choice but to hang her. SPOILER ALERT in the last scene of the film after the execution John Surrat is finally caught and there is a scene where Aiken visits him in jail and gives him his mother's religious jewelry. The credits mention that John Surrat was tried but set free I hoped that he never had a happy day for the rest of his life because his mother's innocent blood was always on his filthy hands. This is a four star two thumbs up masterpieces and this is the reason that we go to the movies.".

Neither of these happily turns out to be true. The film is utterly impassioned and its interest for today is nicely noted without being too underlined. Nearly every element one wants in a great film is there visual beauty strong acting fine pacing stirring and wellmade music. But there is a flaw. The creators have taken their creation too seriously. There's not a shaft of levity or humor anywhere. A requirement for great art is thereby missed. It doesn't matter how somber the subject is supposed to be. King Lear has his fool even Wagner's ultradark Ring cycle has its powerful currents of humor. It's got to be there otherwise the whole organism suffers. I think this is the weakness to which reviewers have responded even if none of them has precisely named it. On that ground the film falls short of greatness but in every other respect it approaches or achieves greatness. The Conspirator is hugely recommendable and I will certainly see it again.".

	schema:headline " The Law Goes Silent";
	schema:reviewBody "With the release of The Conspirator director Robert Redford hopes to be making more films like this which he says are historically accurate. At least by Redford's interpretation of historical events and the one he picked is still being picked over by many historians of the Civil War and Reconstruction period.This film focuses on the trial and aftermath of the Lincoln assassination and most particularly on Mary Surratt at whose boardinghouse in Washington DC John Wilkes Booth and his curious band of conspirators met and plotted. One of those was Mary's son John who was the only one to escape apprehension. The villain in the film is Secretary Of War Edwin M. Stanton played by Kevin Kline. It was not hard for him to do what he did he certainly had public approval. The assassinated president Abe Lincoln had suspended the right of habeas corpus during the war so this trial by military tribunal was not an unforeseeable step that Stanton would take. It is important to remember that at the time we actually were at war with Confederate Armies still in the field. Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox five days before the assassination but Joe Johnston was in the field and when it is announced that the last Confederate Armies have surrendered the day of the hanging they are referring to Richard Taylor's troops in Texas. James McAvoy is a young army veteran and lawyer who becomes Mary Surratt's lawyer. In the end he believes in her innocence but the forces of vengeance are too much for him to overcome. And while Surratt might not have been as innocent as the film makes out no case beyond reasonable doubt was proved at least by the rules of any civil trial that should have taken place.The film really belongs to Robin Wright as the implacable and fatalistic Mary Surratt. She definitely merits some Oscar consideration next year. Up there on the screen she becomes everyone's mother and one wonders about Johnnie Simmons as John Surratt seen in flashback as to why he isn't coming to the plate on this.Perhaps because even Stanton was afraid of public opinion if two Surratt women were in custody on trial for their lives daughter Anna Surratt played by Evan Rachel Wood was never charged. She must have had some knowledge of what was going on. One aspect of the story I think Redford missed and I'm surprised as he's an actor and matine idol back in the day himself. John Wilkes Booth though his southern sympathies were well known though his plotting a secret was the great matine idol of his day. And he certainly attracted his fair share of what would be called groupies back in the day. I think he probably favored Anna Surratt and certainly John Surratt was glad to be included in his entourage. Put in those terms the relationship becomes clearer.Still Redford has crafted a justly well received film and it will no doubt lead to talk about the rights of the accused of the worst kind of crimes.".

The central issue in the movie is the style of the trial.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw 'The Conspirator' in the theater and as a huge history buff I must say that I was quite impressed with this movie.The movie begins in April 1865 with providing the viewer with a brief glimpse of life on the battlefield during the bloody American Civil War. President Lincoln is then assassinated by John Wilkes Booth.The federal government soon determines that Booth plotted his murderous campaign in the boardinghouse of Mary Surratt. One of Booth's coconspirators is John Surratt son of Mary. Since John cannot be found by the feds his mother Mary is soon arrested as a Booth accomplice. Her young lawyer is a former Union soldier Frederic Aiken. At first Aiken is reluctant to defend Mary but soon becomes determined to ensure she receives a fair trial.Robin Wright is excellent as Mary Surratt. Her demeanor dialect and body language are all quite convincing and perfectly balanced.James McAvoy is superb as the young lawyer Frederic Aiken. His tenacious defense of a woman who is deemed a traitor by the federal government that staged a virtual kangaroo court is very moving and impressive. Mr. McAvoy's American dialect was absolutely flawless.Veteran actor Kevin Kline once again demonstrates his impeccable acting skills in his role as the heavy handed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. In my view Mary Surratt was a Southern woman of her time. I believe she hated the Union as well as it's leader Abraham Lincoln. However I do not believe she was an assassin. On the contrary Mary Surratt was most likely a victim of a government and a nation eager to seek rapid justice for the ruthless murder of America's greatest president.I believe an Oscar should go to Robin Wright James McAvoy Kevin Kline and Robert Redford. I highly recommend this excellent historical film.".

	schema:headline " Robert Redford quietly makes another gem of a film.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent film in my estimation. All of the acting is first class there is no weak link letting the side down here. All the more remarkable when it is considered that many of the cast are speaking in accents not their own. I am not an North American but familiar with the accents from numerous films television programmes and to me they were faultless. It would be unfair of me to pick any performance out for special mention they are all perfect.As a history film  television production  documentary nerd this does what a retelling of history has the power to do when an intelligent film maker and scriptwriter join forces. It brings something new and moving to an event that you think you already know all about. For example there can be few people out there who do not know about the assassination of President Lincoln. What really 'got' me at the beginning of the film was the genuine horror I felt watching this event unfold on the screen. The relaxed theatre goers some sitting watching the production some gathered in the bar area clearly happy and enjoying a night out. No doubt with extra joy at the final cessation of the bloodshed of the Civil War. What else it brings is no less important in a film about the past. It has direct and powerful reverberations of our present. It was hard to watch the frustration of James McAvoy's character as it slowly dawns on him that 'revenge' and 'anger' does indeed either destroy or weaken the Law and Constitutional Rights of individuals. As the film reveals slowly we are all diminished when the Rights of individuals are curtailed. I kept thinking about Guantanamo Bay and the slow erosion of individual freedom post September 11th. In this way regardless of your point of view the film is very much a meditation on the past and the wars and trials of the past ten or so years. The sheer brutality of the death penalty is brought home to the viewer every bit as poignantly as the brutal murder of President Lincoln. It begs questions.When the final bits of information come up on the screen the fact that John Surat tried in a Civil Court not Military like his mother Mary after the initial shock of the President's murder is over is released after there not being 'sufficient evidence'  it says so much about the danger to individuals when passions are high and people are baying for revenge rather than justice. If you enjoy a well acted thought provoking film I highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " A Deeper Exploration of a Famous American Conspiracy";
	schema:reviewBody "THE CONSPIRATOR may have had difficulty at the box office because of the controversy over the use of military tribunals that rings across the media today. But this film based on fact but altered somewhat for cinematic purposes deals with probably the first misuse of a military tribunal  the infamous trial of the assassinators of President Abraham Lincoln by a conspiracy of citizens most especially the nonmilitary affiliated Mary Surratt. James Solomon wrote the story and coscripted the screenplay with Gregory Bernstein. The director is Robert Redford who manages to give the entire film the feeling of mid19th century aura  visually and politically  and suggests there is little difference between the approach and consequences of that time and the current management of 'antigovernment' prisoners. The film opens with some scenes from the Civil War battlefield where we meet the severely wounded soldier Frederick Aiken James McAvoy attempting to save the life of his buddy Nicholas Baker Justin Long. The film then jumps to the end of the war when the Confederate generals have surrendered to the Union generals and parties are underway. Aiken and Baker have survived and Aiken has decided to pursue law. The President is assassinated by John Wilkes Booth and in the aftermath Booth is killed but it is discovered that there was a plot to kill Lincoln as well vice president Andrew Johnson Dennis Clark and secretary of state Kevin Kline. The response of the nation is terror and the suspects of the conspiracy are arrested and set for trial. The conspirators had been meeting in the boarding house of Mary Surratt Robin Wright so the military decides she must also be a conspirator and tried with the others 'to put this madness to an end.' The men in charge of the tribunal include Joseph Holt Danny Huston and David Hunter Colm Meaney. There is one lawyer Reverdy Johnson Tom Wilkinson who feels that the tribunal is not an acceptable manner in which to try a citizen and assigns the fresh new lawyer Frederick Aiken to defend Mary Surratt. At first Aiken hates his role but as time passes and he gets to know Mary Surratt he is convinced of her innocence and implores Mary and Mary's daughter Anna  Evan Rachel Wood to reveal the location of the true problem in their family  Mary's son John Johnny Simmons. The story features the change of approach of Aiken and the abuse of justice at the trial and the film ends with some very poignant lessons not only about our history but also about our present. The pacing of the film is slow at times but the cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel and the musical score my Mark Isham keep the film involving. James McAvoy offers a sterling performance and the rest of the cast is impressive. THE CONSPIRATOR is a healthy dip into our nation's past and makes us more alert to our nation's present.

	schema:headline " Historically Inaccurate but causes you to ask questions";
	schema:reviewBody "I find it quite uncanny to be sitting alone in a dark theater at midnight watching the first viewing of a film about the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln on the very night that he was assassinated. Yes you read that correctly. I was alone and had the theater to myself. There was nobody else. The night was Thursday April 14 2011 exactly 146 years after the president was shot by John Wilkes Booth.Shortly after ten o'clock on the night of April 14 1865 President Lincoln was fatally shot at Ford's Theatre while watching the play Our American Cousin. He was taken across the street to William Petersen's boardinghouse where he died at 722 a.m. the next morning. An attempt was made on the life of Secretary of State William H. Seward at the same time. It was later revealed that Vice President Andrew Johnson and General Ulysses Grant were also candidates for assassination. After a trial by a military commission conspirators George Atzerodt Lewis Powell David Herold and Mary Surratt were hanged on July 7 1865. Of course you knew that. It's in the history books.The film The Conspirator directed by Robert Redford and produced by the American Film Company is about the trial and hanging of Mary Surratt as viewed through the eyes of her attorney Frederick Aiken. It opens with the assassination attempts and ends with the hanging just like the story in the history books.It's the stuff between those scenes that concerns me.First the positives. The Civil War reenactors used did an above average job compared to some other films like Gettysburg God's and Generals Glory and Cold Mountain where the services of reenactors were utilized but sometimes are misdirected. Because this is not a film about a specific battle reenactors were used as extras and performed wonderfully.The cinematography was excellent. Even though the actual trial took place in Washington D.C. in a courtroom constructed on the third floor of the Washington Arsenal the film was shot at Savannah Georgia. The reconstructed Arsenal gives you the feeling of actually being there. The courtroom layout was accurate based upon the descriptions of those who were there and the sketches in Harper's Weekly.The casting was excellent. Robin Wright gave a stellar performance as Mary Surratt. Kevin Kline surprised me. It wasn't until they flashed the credits that I realized that he portrayed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. It was a fabulous performance. Evan Rachel Wood Anna Surratt and Johnny Simmons John H. Surratt Jr. gave great performances which made me feel as if I was actually watching the events unfold inside the Surratt boardinghouse. The casting of the remaining conspirators and major characters was well done  except Toby Kebbell John Wilkes Booth. Kebbell did the best he could so this is not a criticism of him. It's in his looks. The other actors each had a strong likeness to their respective character. Kebbell seemed to be misplaced. I give Avy Kaufman high marks for her abilities as a casting director.Now for my criticism.It wasn't accurate. Even with the Dr. James McPherson as a historical consultant there were so many inaccuracies that I could drive a Mack Truck through the holes in this film giving it the appearance of Robert Redford's attempt at revisionist history. He tries hard to assert the innocence of Mrs. Surratt and make Secretary of War Stanton to be the bad guy. He ignores a lot of historical detail including the fact that Surratt rarely uncovered her face. When her daughter Anna took the stand a key moment in the film it has been recorded by numerous sources at that time that Surratt sobbed while holding a white handkerchief to her veiled face.Right after her arrest Surratt was thrown into the same cell at the Arsenal that she remained in for the duration according to the film. Historically she was brought to the Old Capitol Prison for thirteen days before getting moved to the Arsenal. Furthermore her feet were not bound by iron manacles as the film suggests on a few occasions.Lastly regarding the legality of the trial which is where Redford spends the most of his effort it was a point repeatedly brought up by Senator Reverdy Johnson her lead attorney. This is historically accurate but there were more witnesses and questioning from other defense attorney's which would have given us a more accurate picture of the trial.The most accurate point of the film was the hanging. The gallows looked real and felt real. Other than mounds of dirt near the coffins looking a little too clean again looking for historical accuracy here it felt like I was watching the hanging of the conspirators.Overall I give this movie five of ten dollars signs  because of the great job in casting and cinematography. It gives you a feel that you are in an 1865 trial. Unfortunately as somebody who has studied the Civil War for nearly two decades I find that there are too many historical inaccuracies to overlook.Should you see this movie? It depends. If you are looking for accuracy no. If you are looking for what it might have looked like yes. If you are looking just for pure entertainment it will probably bore you.I would recommend reading Michael W. Kauffman's American Brutus AND Kate Clifford Larson's The Assassin's Accomplice before watching this film.".

	schema:headline " A Whitewash of Mary Surratt";
	schema:reviewBody "Adding to another reviewer's comments about key elements being left out of the movie trial of Surratt besides being a Catholic slaveholder the Catholic Church held slaves in Maryland Surratt's tavern in Surrattsville was a rendezvous for Confederate couriers smuggling intelligence and contraband back and forth between VA and MD and the family had previously been under investigation. For a good account of these details see Surratt's biography on Wikipedia and the recent book Manhunt on the search for Booth and the other assassins. Also to clarify some legal points historically the Supreme Court has deferred to the military in judging military necessity that is measures that need to be taken to overcome a belligerent enemy force. Having researched and written on this issue in my biography of Anna Ella Carroll Lincoln's legal adviser to my mind the fact that as I remember at least 2 of the assassin conspirators were former Confederate soldiers and that the nation's commanderinchief was assassinated provides sufficient grounds for a military commission trial. The 1942 Supreme Court Quirin decision on the German saboteurs upheld the military's right to try belligerent US citizens. Further especially in Missouri thousands of military commission trials tried guerrillas while civil courts still functioned. The defining criteria as Anna Ella Carroll wrote in her war powers pamphlets is the connection of defendants to the armed forces of the rebellion. For instance spies are always considered war criminals because they operate in conjunction with armed forces and behind lines out of uniform. Writs of habeas corpus are also suspended for reasons of military necessity. For instance John Merryman was a MD insurrectionist in April 1861 and arrested by federal troops for his role in trying to obstruct movement of US troops to the capital to protect it. Chief Justice Roger Taney issued a writ of habeas corpus to bring him to a civil court to be charged. The commanding officer holding Merryman refused to recognize the writ citing contrary orders from the president of the United States. Also see Wikipedia about Surratt's trial results.To my mind this is another one of the Hollywood proConfederate movies that have been prevalent since the 1940s featuring former Confederates as poor abused souls by those bad Yankees. Let us remember Southern slaveowners were the experts at abusing people and civil liberties in the Confederacy were severally abused.Finally why don't Hollywood producers produce films about Union women heroines like Anna Ella Carroll Mary Louvestre Mary Bickerdyke and Elizabeth Van Lew who lived rather than a traitor who upheld a cause that upheld slavery at its base.".

But make no mistake you won't leave the theater with a clear idea of whether Mary or her son were rightly or wrongly accused. What is made clear in this movie is the confusion that immediately followed Lincoln's assassination and the paranoia that still hung in the air in the fragile time between the end of the military conflict and the beginning of Reconstruction. Aiken's character is never 100 convinced of Mary's guilt or innocence  his fight is about the Constitution and how the Secretary of War was so determined to move on it didn't matter that rights were being trampled on in order to do so.There isn't a catchy score to move things along as you'd expect from typical period films. The scenery becomes its own character very sobering expanses of postwar Washington and the fort where Mary was held  they match the lessthancheerful mood of the time.As for the accuracy of the several events depicted to form the backdrop of the larger story  all done well.

	schema:headline " James McAvoy shines in otherwise standard fare.";
	schema:reviewBody "For almost a decade now James McAvoy has been rising the ranks of the acting elite by giving reliable performances as varied as he is reliable. He's gone from a soldier trying to survive for his love to a bonafide action star to a charismatic young man caught between two passionate bickering lovers. Through it all he has remained consistent and always managed to make a huge impression even when starring opposite big names like Forest Whitaker and Helen Mirren. Here in The Conspirator he takes on another role that wouldn't seem instantly appropriate for him that of a Civil Warera lawyer and makes it entirely his own and manages to amaze. He brings his own unique charm and charisma to the role but never plays it too light when the big dramatic court scenes come around he can hold his own against a strong veteran like Danny Huston. He's powerful resilient and absolutely commands your attention. If anything this film is even more proof that McAvoy is one of the finest actors of his generation.The rest of the film however doesn't play with as much gusto as McAvoy's performance does. He stands as the lawyer for Mary Surratt the lone female charged in the trial for those who conspired in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It's a story that I certainly was familiar with but not fully aware of all the intricate details. As a piece of historical work director Robert Redford and writer James D. Solomon play it out pretty well giving us important facts and remaining historically accurate while still making it quite exciting at times. The scenes outside of the courtroom leave a bit to be desired and a lot of the supporting characters are pretty thin stereotypes for your usual courtroom drama but overall this talented cast manages to keep you compelled throughout. McAvoy steals the show but Robin Wright definitely impresses as Surratt a woman who knows more than she lets on and Wright has some very excellent scenes later in the film. Evan Rachel Wood also manages to shine in a few scenes as Surratt's daughter who has to suffer the sight of watching her mother stand trial for this horrible crime.For the most part it's pretty standard fare but it does it all in a pretty skilled way. Nothing manages to impress too much aside from McAvoy but there aren't any major detractors either. I suppose my one big complaint comes in the form of Redford himself. The men conducting the trial and prosecuting Surratt are definitely men who are more out for revenge than they are legitimate justice. They are out to bend the rules in their favor to get the result what they want. Redford however makes them too villainous to the point of making it hard to believe them as actual people. These people existed and were real human beings but Redford turns them more into caricature villains out to hang an innocent woman. Within the film it definitely makes you frustrated along with McAvoy's character and it makes you emotional and angry but it's all a little heavyhanded. Aside from that though there isn't too much going against the film but there also isn't a lot to make it anything worthy of a large amount of praise. It does it's job well but it's job is relatively standard.".

I assumed that there would be historical inaccuracies and the whole question of whether or not Mary Surratt was involved would be a matter of debate as it has been for the past 146 years.But I didn't expect so many.Any movie or book for that matter about the Lincoln assassination which does not draw information from Michael Kaufman andor Laurie Verge should be considered lacking. Mrs. Surratt was told of her execution the night prior to it July 17 1865 and had clerical counsel the night through. She very rarely lifted her veil in the courtroom mostly just to be identified and during the trial was moved to a better cell just off of the courtroom. There is no record of her having to wear either the manacles or the ball  chain shown.As for the others Fredrick Aiken is a composite of two attorneys under Reverdy Johnson. Lewis PowellPainePayne was considered almost a giant tall muscular and Booth's killing machine not the wimpy guy shown in the movie. And the prisoners pounding their chains during the one scene? They knew that could have gotten them shot right then and there  it simply didn't happen and yet the audience cheered at the theater  how sad.The acting was superb despite the script and the use of locations really helped people understand what Washington DC looked like at the time of the Civil War. If someone is looking for a movie concerning the Civil War and doesn't really care about what really happened this is their movie. One doesn't have to know a lot about the assassination to know that too many scenes are just inaccurate. But yes the acting deserves a few stars.".

	schema:headline " Some odd casting choices and a midsection slump mar an otherwise compelling and entirely relevant courtroom thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The Conspirator follows the aftermath of assassination of Abraham Lincoln as eight people are put on trial to be charged with the murder. One of the suspects is Mary Surratt Robyn Wright who admits that she boarded John Wilkes Booth in her home where he and his men may have been planning the assassination. Her son John Johnny Simmons is also somehow involved with the conspiracy too but he managed to escape before he could be captured. Aiding Mary's case is Senator Reverdy Johnson Tom Wilkinson. He does not believe that she should be left as the fall person that the court is making her out to be. Pulling the strings of the court is Edwin Stanton Kevin Kline a politician who is intent on using the case to manipulate both the North and the South. Johnson hires Frederick Aiken James McAvoy a Civil War veteran and lawyer who has returned home to his wife Sarah Alexis Bledel and is initially reluctant to take on the case assuming Mary is already guilty. But facing off against his opposite attorney Joseph Holt Danny Huston Aiken realises the increasing necessity of bringing John into the trial to prove Mary's innocence. He contacts Mary's daughter Anna Evan Rachel Wood for help. Some odd casting choices and a midsection slump mar an otherwise compelling and entirely relevant courtroom thriller. Director Robert Redford has chosen an untold aspect of the Lincoln assassination certainly one I was not familiar with. Though it may seem like a distinctly American story the film holds a universal power that almost anyone could respond to. Redford's timing is precise. He's made a thriller that's not much interested in the 'whodunit' but the moral ambiguity surrounding courtroom show trials. Early in the film Johnson argues that Mary has been held extensively without conviction so that the court could arrange its case predetermining her fate. In trying to justify the court's outlandish decisions like this Holt's says to Aiken in times of war the law falls silent. He fires back It shouldn't. And the court scenes are intercut with Stanton justifying the sentencing as a fear campaign that will satisfy the North's vengeance and scare the South. The story is complex not because of whether Mary is guilty or not it's never been discovered whether she really did conspire with Booth but because of the reluctance of the American court system to give Surratt a fair trial. All historical films must find a contemporary relevancy and there's a powerful universal subtext here about the way governments confuse vengeance and justice. It's impossible not to look at this film and think of the way that both the US and Australian governments have responded to terrorism in recent years through mistreatment of political prisoners and terrorism laws preventing basic human rights without proper justification. As a piece of entertainment The Conspirator is a competently made thriller too. It's been beautifully photographed by Redford and his cinematographer Newtown Thomas Sigel. The detail around the sets and the costumes and the muted colour scheme are impeccable. The night scenes are particularly handsome decorated by shadows and lit by the burning wicks of candles. But some of this authenticity is undone by some peculiar casting choices. Casting British actors in a distinctly American period is at first very distracting. Tom Wilkinson is fine with what he does but a less recognisable American actor would have been more immersive. McAvoy seems like an odd choice too but he shows his class and maturity as an actor. He's passionate and charismatic in this film as a man who is understandably skeptical about a Southerner but gradually builds to a determined if futile cause. Robyn Wright and Evan Rachel Wood bring great emotion to their work as Southerners realising rather ironically the difficulty of sacrificing one person like John for the greater good. Disappointingly Justin Long is miscast and completely out of place with a fake moustache and Alexis Bledel can only do so much with an unresolved subplot about Aiken's home life. The pace of the film also sags around the midpoint as the finer and details of the case become muddy. But the surprising and moving climax ensures that an appropriate amount of feeling and emotion is restored into many of these characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "What an opening! Mike's truck goes careening down a mountain road before pinballing through town. It's not only a riveting effect but establishes Mike Ford as an honest workingman when he turns over his proceeds to the injured Jeff Buchanan. Too bad he meets up with spider woman Paula Carter who spins a greedy web around the well meaning patsy. As Paula Carter is a powerful presence. She's got a way of acting that shows a lot of eyeball that's kind of scary. Actually I think she's too strong making her switch to the laidback Mike not very believable. Their chemistry never really gels the way Paula's does with Steve Sullivan. Unfortunately that's a lack that undercuts the script's central twist.Still it's a solid noir thanks to the classic elements of the screenplay. Ford makes an interesting lowkey fall guy. Not too many mining engineers turn up in noir which I guess accounts for his occasional spiffy suits that look more like uptown Manhattan than temporary truck driver. Still he's basically the classic working stiff looking for a job. Too bad he sees Paula's wellturned ankle first. Anyway director Wallace films in journeyman style except for that one inspired moment after the crash when Paula does a sharp gasping intake. It's a brief cameo shot whose only purpose is to connect Paula's sexuality with violence. For 1947 that's daring and Carter brings it off memorably. I guess it just goes to show how less can imply so much more in the imaginationa lesson contemporary film seems to have forgotten.The movie may not be front rank noir but it does have its moments.".

As beautiful slender and accomplished a Broadway performer as Janis Carter was I thought her acting was  well awful is the only word for it. This is a Lizabeth ScottAnn Sheridan type of role  smoky mysterious ambiguous as to motive. Carter had none of these shadings offering instead wooden line delivery with nothing going on underneath. A better actress would have made this a much stronger film.The plot to me anyway was very predictable in part due to the casting. As for the denouement there was no explanation as to how it all came together i.e. there were holes.Ford and Edgar Buchanan who plays a miner hoping to get a loan from Barry Sullivan's bank are very good in their roles. Sullivan is fine but he has a nonshowy part. A stronger female lead and a little more developed script at the end would have helped Framed immensely.".

Janis Carter plays the least appealing femme fatale I've ever seen in a film noir. In any lineup of great ladies of film noir her name has never come up. Here she's plotting with her lover a married banker Barry Sullivan to fake his death retrieve the money he's embezzled and head off to happier climes. But they need a patsy with no ties to substitute for the banker. And that's where Ford a mining engineer looking for work comes in. We're supposed to believe Ms. Carter can entice Ford but he never displays anything but rank hostility in her presence. When he finally kisses her it's more of a physical assault than an act of lust. When it comes to carrying out the deathfaking part they enact a scene straight out of DOUBLE INDEMNITY. The plan they adopt is so poorly thought out that even the most cursory police investigation would see through it. Ford at least is punchy and irritable throughout a side of him I've never quite seen before. He glares with the best of them and passes out drunk a couple of times. He's nice to Edgar Buchanan though. And who wouldn't be? As silly as the proceedings get it's never too predictable and moves at a fast clip throughout. This is lowend film noir a far cry from James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler but still worth recording off TCM and watching once. Barry Sullivan whose centennial is tomorrow August 29 plays a solid citizen with a corrupt core a long way from the rugged western heroes he'd portray ten years later e.g. FORTY GUNS but closer to the antagonists he'd specialize in playing on TV dramas in the 1960s and '70s.".

	schema:reviewBody "A runaway truck without brakes that barrels down a mountain road and into a small town provides an exciting start to a film constructed on an intriguing premise. However if only Framed had been able to maintain the initial momentum and build upon the underlying idea a classic might have emerged. Handsome Glenn Ford of the thick dark eyebrows is behind the wheel of that truck and as Michael Lambert he is quickly arrested and hauled into court when his truck reaches a stop and he is discovered to have an expired drivers' license. Either dazed by the wild ride or congenitally naive Ford fails to notice that the sultry blonde bar waitress who bails him out pays for his hotel room and leaves him spending money has an expensive coiffure pricey dyed hair and a chic wardrobe far beyond the means of someone living on tips. If he overlooked those clues her cozy apartment and her casual job resignation should have tipped him off. However the collegeeducated mining engineer is easily taken in by the obvious wiles of Paula Craig played by Janis Carter in a role that cries out for a Barbara Stanwyck. Carter is as unconvincing in the part as is Ford's keen interest in her.The screenplay by Ben Maddow adapted from a story by Jack Patrick reveals that Craig's obvious comeon masks intentions to enlist him as a fall guy for the plot she is hatching with boyfriend Barry Sullivan. The mix of dumb nice guy evil seductress money sex and murder have produced some classic films but unfortunately Framed falls short. The mediocre production is nicely photographed in black and white by Burnett Guffey but Richard Wallace's direction after a great start falters.The film's disappointment however does not lay with star Glenn Ford. Always an affable likable actor Ford is engaging in the central role even if his initial gullibility is hard to swallow. Seeking employment Ford befriends a colorful local miner Edgar Buchanan who strikes pay dirt and offers him a job which complicates the plans Carter and Sullivan have laid. Veteran character actor Buchanan is always fun and he and Ford make the film worthwhile. However the lines and situations are often trite Sullivan is only passable in his role and Carter is the big void at the film's center. If the audience can quickly see through Paula's character and grasp her intent during her first few moments on screen the credibility of Ford's tough guy character unravels. While the skill depth and sex appeal of a Barbara Stanwyck would have elevated Framed several notches even she may not have been able to make it a classic. However for fans of Glenn Ford the film is a must see.".

Carter is as unconvincing in the part as is Ford's keen interest in her.The screenplay by Ben Maddow adapted from a story by Jack Patrick reveals that Craig's obvious comeon masks intentions to enlist him as a fall guy for the plot she is hatching with boyfriend Barry Sullivan. The mix of dumb nice guy evil seductress money sex and murder have produced some classic films but unfortunately Framed falls short. The mediocre production is nicely photographed in black and white by Burnett Guffey but Richard Wallace's direction after a great start falters.The film's disappointment however does not lay with star Glenn Ford. Always an affable likable actor Ford is engaging in the central role even if his initial gullibility is hard to swallow. Seeking employment Ford befriends a colorful local miner Edgar Buchanan who strikes pay dirt and offers him a job which complicates the plans Carter and Sullivan have laid. Veteran character actor Buchanan is always fun and he and Ford make the film worthwhile. However the lines and situations are often trite Sullivan is only passable in his role and Carter is the big void at the film's center. If the audience can quickly see through Paula's character and grasp her intent during her first few moments on screen the credibility of Ford's tough guy character unravels. While the skill depth and sex appeal of a Barbara Stanwyck would have elevated Framed several notches even she may not have been able to make it a classic. However for fans of Glenn Ford the film is a must see.";

Rani looks cute  I always enjoy Govinda but this was one that I snoozed through and felt that I might have enjoyed my snooze better without the film playing in the background.See it if you must and if you are an avid RaniGovinds fan  but expect nothing. A silly silly film.";

	schema:headline " Viva el Rey! and Viva Ann Margret too!...";
	schema:reviewBody "I love this film!  Actually every time that I see it I like it more.  I'm biased of course being an Elvis fan hey isn't everyone?...if you're not you should give it a try but it's still an entertaining way to spend a while.  The film's not based on the strongest storyline ever created and it relies on the chemistry between foxy mamacita Ann Margret and the King himself and that's more than enough.  The two had some intense offscreen things going on too and perhaps that helps the movie.  Both Elvis and Ann Margret look great and they trade lines perfectly.  Elvis is more engaged in this film than he had been in any since 1961 and the result's one that he could have been proud of.  The shame is that the glossy musical formula than began with 1960's GI Blues became an endless rerun throughout Elvis' '60s Hollywood career but Viva Las Vegas is perhaps the highlight of these musicals.  Perhaps it's no coincidence that this film has less singing than the ones before and after the songs all fitting well within the plot. The songs are also among the strongest of Elvis' '60s soundtrack offerings  pretty much all of them are great tunes.  This was most definitely not the case even in earlier films and would progressively become less the norm in subsequent years.  The cinematography is also firstrate as are lighting and transitions  all of the things that add up to 'production value.' Lush colors and effective use of scenery  natural and manmade  included. This is obvious right from the opening credits and is stunningly apparent in the musical numbers.  It really looks like a lot of thought went into how the songs were staged lit and filmed and that alone is a departure from Elvis' norm.  Even most of the other of the better '60s films just stick Elvis up there singing while they roll film.  Not a lot of imagination very evident in that approach.  Check out the great presentation work on songs like C'mon Everybody and What'd I Say as well as the classic Viva Las Vegas talentcontest scene and the perfectlyexecuted I Need Somebody To Lean On scene in which onscreen Elvis is doubletracked with a melancholy innervoice Elvis.  Great stuff.The film's  to me  probably the most entertaining and enjoyable of any of Elvis' '60s musicals.  In that category I include most of the films that Elvis shot during the '60s except for the two dramas of 1960 Flaming Star being a particularly excellent film the two songsparse movies of 1961 Kid Galahad and the great Follow That Dream and some of the late '60s movies that included only one or a few token songs and had stronger storylines Live A Little Love A Little Stay Away Joe Charro! The Trouble With Girls and Change Of Habit.  Actually Viva Las Vegas is even more enjoyable than most of these ones too.Among the supporting actors are Cesare Danova a beatniky Nicky Blair and William Demarest Uncle Charlie from My Three Sons! all of whom do a great job.  Sharp eyes might also catch Terri Garr especially in the C'mon Everybody scene though she's in at least one or two others in the film. Red West Elvis' bodyguard he also wrote a song  If You Think I Don't Need You  used in this film is an extra in the scene that included a bunch of Texas rowdies.  Lance Le Gault a blues singer and Elvis' double in '60s films inadvertently seen in Kissin' Cousins and on full display as a tambourineplayer in Elvis' sensational leatherclad 1968 'comeback' shows...he was also Colonel Decker on TV's The A Team plays a waiter who ironically enough is mistaken for Elvis by Ann Margret's character.But yeah when it comes down to it this is a film that succeeds primarily on the strengths of its male and female leads.  Some great work by supporting actors doesn't hurt but Elvis seems inspired to do a good job of acting  not the walkthrough that was becoming increasingly tempting in the face of uninspiring and mediocre storylines and production staff and accountants who didn't care about quality as long as the film was completed on time and on budget to result in the predictable crazy profits that Elvis movies generated in the first half of the '60s.  The scene with Elvis waiting on the Count and Rusty exploits Elvis' comedic talents and was a nice touch. I'm surprised really that the pairing of Elvis and Ann Margret was never attempted again.  They could've done Grease in '68!The film also accomplishes its travelogue role and both it and the title song have become inextricably linked with that desert city.  For those of us who have only visited Vegas in more recent years and to those who remember it as it was in the summer of 1963 this film is a handy time capsule to the Vegas of yore.  It was a kick for me to see Elvis and Ann Margret at the Sahara's camel statues because I had my picture taken there atop one of the camels back in the '80s without realizing that it had such a direct Elvis connection.  Cool!All in all if you haven't yet seen this film you might just enjoy it. It's not going to change your life then again...who knows? and it's not Citizen Kane it's a lot more fun though but it's a classic of its kind.  Scratch that  it's just a classic.  Unfortunately a couple of months after wrapping Viva Las Vegas Elvis began production of Kissin' Cousins a film from producer Sam Katzman King of the Quickies that was as cheap and nasty as they come and that showed the way to even greater profit but at what cost?.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Viva Las Vegas' is not a good film. It is however a great musical and a very entertaining film. This entertainment value should be the only reason to see this. Granted there is no other reason to watch any Elvis movie with the possible exception of 'King Creole'. Alongside the magnificent and earlyfire film 'Jailhouse Rock' you won't find a more entertaining film starring the King.Clearly that has nothing to do with the screenplay by Sally Benson which best line would have to be AnnMargret's entrance 'My car whistles' and Elvis' reply 'Can't blame it'. If that is the 'wittiest' line of your movie you've got a problem. There's no originality no wit no character development or even creation to start with no story.THE SONGS One of the most consistent soundtracks for ELvis films mostly hits next to none misses. Highlight is the title song which hasn't lost one ounce of its excitement in the last 40 years. The duet 'The Lady Loves Me' with AnnMargret isn't far behind. Elvis didn't duet often and this is his best one. Actually the lyrics of the song seem far more clever and funny than the whole screenplay. AnnMargret's a good singer underrated certainly and her solo numbers 'Appreciation' suffers from bad composing not from bad singing. Elvis is on high form on the rocker 'C'mom everybody'.THE DANCING The University of Nevada bit is the centerpiece here as far as dancing goes and it's a joy to watch. Good choreography and Elvis is seen with the excitement and pleasure he had in the fifties and seemingly lost. AnnMargret arguably outdances and upstages him here which shouldn't be seen as disrespectful to him but merely as a compliment to her. THE ACTING Without fleshed out characters written you can't have them acted. Elvis was not a bad actor and even if he did appear unnatural and stiff in other films he seems quite energetic and talented here. AnnMargret's a better actress natural and talented.THE DIRECTION Sidney knows how to film musicals he was one of the best of the genre so no complaints here at all. I like the race at the end which may even be called 'exciting' at times.THE COSTAR Without any doubt this is the reason for the film's success both in entertainment and financially. AnnMargret in her fourth movie is quite simply put great. She can sing dance act and I guess there's no explanation needed on how she looks. In her prime and she's in it here she was Hollywood's most attractive actress  face and bodywise but with enough talent to move way beyond starletstatus. Her costumes are great take special notice of her blacktightsredsweater wear in the Nevada university number. There's a typical amount of bad 60s makeup in the otherwise great 'What'd I say' routine and hairdo but that's not too much of a problem.THE CHEMISTRY Another point that sets Viva Las Vegas apart from for example Speedway with Nancy Sinatra is the onscreen chemistry between Elvis and AnnM. Love affair or not these are simply two attractive people liking each other and making the romance in the film really believable. They both seem like they had one hell of a good time.THE STORY What story? Race car driver wants to win both the race and the girl. He succeeds in both. Wow.TO SUM IT UP Of all Elvis movies of the 1960s this is the best. The soundtrack is unbeatable the King himself never again seemed to have so much fun and in AnnMargret there's not only his most attractive but also best costar.".

When AnnMargret appeared on Larry King last year King kept bringing up Elvis but she wasn't about to talk about him. They were certainly a hot couple and if they were crazy about each other which reportedly they were who can blame them? There is absolutely nothing special about the story but the movie has some delightful musical numbers including the title song  which has become part of the popular culture as it personifies everything Vegas.Colonel Parker wasn't happy about Viva Las Vegas because he felt that AnnMargret was getting too many closeups in an Elvis Presley film. But without her sexy presence the film would have lacked a lot of its energy. Elvis was unhappy making this kind of movie and I imagine he was more willing to go to work with AnnMargret on the set. It's fun to see them so young and beautiful and having fun.".

Elvis was truly at the top of his game filming this movie. I only wish some of the later movies were as good. Sure this movie has its cheesy parts but what Elvis movie doesn't. My four year old son likes to watch the ending race sequence over and over again. I wonder who wins the Las Vegas Grand Prix?? I can't say enough about the vivacious Ann Margaret. Elvis himself was smitten for her in real life and I can't blame him. She matches Elvis song for song and dance for dance. At the time of filming she was referred to as the female Elvis. Deservingly so I might add. If only Elvis and Ann had made some more movies together.".

	schema:reviewBody "Other than some of Elvis' more serious earlier films such as King Creole and Jailhouse Rock this is really one of his better efforts. The reasons are many but I will explore some of them here.First musically speaking it's pretty solid. It's probably Elvis' best film from a musical standpoint in the 1960s. Highlights include Elvis performing Ray Charles' What'd I Say Come on Everybody and If You Think I Don't Need You by his friend Red West. AnnMargret receives an unusual amount of songs for an Elvis costar totally 2 solo songs and 1 duet the memorable and relatively highly integrated The Lady Loves Me..... one of the few moments when an Elvis film feels like a real musical. And of course one can't forget the rousing title song which Elvis performs several times in the film as well.The supporting cast is the usual group of stalwart character actors. Cesare Danova is suitably suave and smooth as Elvis' rival for AnnMargret an Italian racer. Veteran actor William Demarest appears as AnnMargret's father a friendly and energetic senior citizen who wants to help Elvis work on cars and hang out with the boys. Nicky Blair is amusing as Elvis' main sidekick.As to the film's story of course it's all very inconsequential but well done. AnnMargret makes a big impression with her first appearance especially on the big screen. The audience is drawn in by the device of Mancini and Lucky's search for her in the nightclubs of Vegas. The plot is just enough for the purpose it needs to serve in this lightweight entertainment basically it's the old race car film plot of the girlfriend who doesn't approve of racing but for some reason decides just in time for the big race that she needs to stand by her man and cheer very loudly from the sidelines in this case from a helicopter.An allaround solid piece of entertainment and an admirable product of the fading days of Hollywood's glamor days.".

Given how powerful the result was in VIVA LAS VEGAS it's a shame they didn't try to tailor more fullblown Hollywood movie musicals for him. He worked with Nancy Sinatra in SPEEDWAY but aside from one song written for her by Lee Hazlewood she wasn't given much to do musically in the film and doesn't even share a duet with Elvis. What would an Elvis teamup with Julie Andrews have been like? Or Shirley MacLaine? Or dare I say it Doris Day? And why not younger 1960s musical stars like Petula Clark or Diana Ross? Or even Annette Funicello. The possibilities are tantalizing. Instead they kept putting him with attractive but nonmusical costars in lightweight romantic comedies with occasional songs with titles like GIRL HAPPY DOUBLE TROUBLE CLAMBAKE TICKLE ME and EASY COME EASY GO that just don't compare with VIVA LAS VEGAS. At least in ROUSTABOUT he had a formidable female costar in Barbara Stanwyck. She didn't sing or dance but she sure acted up a storm. And her chemistry with Elvis was far more evident than any he might have had with the starlets who populated all his fluffy throwaway comedies with music.".

At least in ROUSTABOUT he had a formidable female costar in Barbara Stanwyck. She didn't sing or dance but she sure acted up a storm. And her chemistry with Elvis was far more evident than any he might have had with the starlets who populated all his fluffy throwaway comedies with music.";

	schema:reviewBody "Elvis was before me or at least I felt like he was. I was part of that group of kids who discovered rock music when the Beatles landed. So even though Elvis was still on the scene and having hits I tended to think of him in the same way I thought of Frank Sinatra or Bing Crosby. Previous generation's music old hat pass. And aside from the occasional single that caught my ear and made me think hmm not bad that's pretty much how my perception stayed until he died. Then I thought I'd give him a second chance. So I took a crash course in Elvis. Went out and bought a bunch of his albums from the earliest to 'Moody Blue.' Even watched a bunch of his movies which I wouldn't have been caught dead doing before. Not surprisingly perhaps I found a lot to like. My own quirky tastes led me to enjoy his sixties music especially the singles from the films more than his earlier and supposedly 'purer' songs. And one of the things I found that I liked most about Elvis was his attitude he didn't take himself seriously at all. A lot of highminded music and film critics thought he was goofy but guess what? So did he. And he was a movie star for over a decade. Maybe an Elvis expert can tell me some day why he kept churning out essentially Bmovies year after year when he should have issuing classic rock albums and standing at the pinnacle of popular music. Did he think he could do both or was doing both? Or maybe it gets back to that 'attitude' thing again that he just didn't give a damn. So then 'Viva Las Vegas.' Probably the quintessential sixties Elvis flick. As with all of his vehicles the plot doesn't bear close scrutiny but in this case he's a race car driver who's trying to raise money to fix his race car so he winds up in Las Vegas and fools around with AnnMargret. Makes sense to me. Thanks to some reliable old movie hands like director George Sidney and a VERY energetic AnnMargret 'Viva Las Vegas' is a cut above Elvis' other films from the period. The energy level is high and the musical numbers are very entertainingly staged. In fact if I were to pick a single sequence in any of the movies to illustrate Elvis' appeal it would be the setpiece given 'C'mon Everybody.' It is so great and so goofy it sums up everything there is to love about Elvis in a little over two minutes. He is the epitome of cool his dance moves elegantly effortless and supremely silly at the same time. It really is as though he doesn't even have to try once the music's on Elvis is on and you can't take your eyes off him no matter how hard AnnMargret tries to provide distraction. As he struts slinks and stomps across the stage singing those immortal lyricsAin't nothing wrong with longhair music Like Brahms Beethoven and Bach But I was raised with a guitar in my hand And I was born to rock!you just KNOW you're watching the King of Rock 'n Roll. Elvis Presley's films exist outside the world of the sixties as most remember them there are no real hippies and no attempts at psychedelia. In the party scenes where Elvis inevitably gets up and sings the men look like insurance salesmen and the women all seem to be refugees from Hefner's Playboy Mansion. They didn't come across as 'hip' even at the time. But 'Viva Las Vegas' infuses the insular Elvis formula with jolts of starpowered electricity and its own kind of rock and roll energy propelling it above the rest and reminding us why that peculiarly American rock icon Elvis Presley still occupies a unique place in our culture heart and soul.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was nearing the end of my first year in college when 'Viva Las Vegas' hit theaters in the springtime of 1964. It is interesting that it was released in Sweden AnnMargret Olsson's birthplace months before it was released in the USA. The story line is very thin it exists only to tie together a series of musical numbers by the two stars. And that is the only reason to see this movie to appreciate Elvis when he was still young 28 and slender but already in his 15th movie and AnnMargret at 22 just out of college and in her 4th movie. AnnMargret in her prime was arguably the most beautiful and sexy in a girlnextdoor way star of the 20th century. That she has stood by her invalid husband for so many years shows also what a genuine person she is. She will remain one of my alltime favorites.SPOILERS follow in the rest of my comments. Elvis plays 'Lucky' a race car driver hoping to get into the Las Vegas grand prix but he needs to buy a new motor first. He meets 'Rusty' AnnMargret who comes to the shop 'I'd like you to check my motor it whistles' while wearing the cutest tiny white shorts imaginable in 1964. It is romance at first sight but she plays hard to get. Turns out she is the pool manager for a local motel teaches kids to swim and dive and also teaches dance at the local U of N branch. At the end of their first musical number together she pushes him off the high dive into the water and loses his bankroll. Unable to even pay his room not to mention the new motor he is forced to be a waiter at the motel where he keeps around Rusty. On a date Rusty and Lucky ride motorcycles sightsee in a helicopter piloted by Lucky go water skiing but she has doubts about falling for a race driver likely to crack up and get killed. In the end her dad buys the motor for Lucky he wins the very cheesy car race 9 hours all over the countryside and no pit stops? No police guarding intersections? No barriers in downtown LV?? then we see Rusty and Lucky getting married. Story 2 Elvis and AnnMargret 14 both on a 10point scale!!".

All she wants is a home with a little tree in front and yet she understands that the race is Lucky's dream so she finally supports him in it. It's a happily everafter movie....a simple plot but they both carry it off so great since they're both really good actors and you get the feeling throughout the movie that they really did like each other in real life which I've heard they did. Altogether it's a cute movie and wellworth watching.The songs in it are really great too.".

Song are great dances numbers great cast is very good and it IS probably the best musical film that Presley ever made! He and AnnMargaret was very wise never to appear again in a film.

Margret's sexuality balances Elvis well. It makes me wonder just how good some of his other movies might have been if the studios could have paired him with better costars.This is one of Elvis's most iconic films. The title song is a classic and still used today whenever a movie or TV show takes place in Vegas. Viva Las Vegas is a great musical showcase for two of the most electrifying performers of their day as well as an entertaining look back at a far more innocent time.";

	schema:reviewBody "In what was unfortunately a rather rare occasion for Presley a nearperfect blend of setting director cast and songs was whipped into the confection that is Viva Las Vegas. Too often he or better his chief handler Col. Tom Parker settled for subpar projects that were hastily done on limited budgets and with lessthanstellar costars. Sometimes the ingredients came up on the plus side and a decent film was the result as is the case here. Presley plays a guitarplaying race car driver in Vegas to win money for a badlyneeded motor. He scrapes together the money only to lose it in a tete a tete with Margret the swim instructor at his hotel. Thus he becomes a waiter trying to reearn the money in time for the big race while competitor for both the race and for Margret Danova walks a fine line between friend and foe alternately trying to recruit Presley or dispose of him. Margret in the meantime has plans of her own to win the big talent show so that her father Demarest can buy the boat he's always wanted. Presley goes headtohead with her in the show and headtohead with Danova on the road in between singing and playing in the Las Vegas sun. Presley does a good job in the film blessed with several great songs including the rousing title tune and with a costar who was his equal in many ways. Margret far from being a piece of furniture like so many other soso Presley girls holds her own against the King and even steals the spotlight from him more than once. When Margret dances it's hard to look at anything else! Some of her songs are silly especially the one in which she laments having to share Presley with a car but she more than makes up for it with some wild and woolly moves on the dance floor. Presley and Margret display a clear affinity for one another bringing out each others charms nicely. Danova has a fairly thankless role actually but tries to inject some interest into it. Demarest is given even less to do and much of that is pretty lame. He has to talk to a potted tree in one cringeinducing moment. L.A. restaurateur Blair plays Presley's excitable sidekick to no significant advantage. The film opens with an indispensable series of shots of 1964 Las Vegas. A lot has changed out there since this was made over four decades ago and it's great to have a record of the way it used to look. Jack Carter and Leslie Uggams are shown as a double bill on one of the signs. Hoover Dam also gets a shoutout. Amidst the engaging musical numbers and the dancing are some truly corny bits of humor but it's all in fun as the film was never meant to be anything but mindless entertainment. For such a light film the climactic car race is actually fairly horrific featuring some downright nasty crashes that likely led to death for the characters depicted! No one seems to mind much though as long as Presley crosses the finish line. One thing lacking in this film is the costumes. Don Feld seems to have had trouble properly fitting his stars. Presley's clothes lack the clean lines and expert tailoring that Edith Head always saw to note the jacket he wears in the talent show which looks like it was pulled off a high schooler in the audience and pants that don't fit attractively around the waist. Margret's clothes are nearly all either too big or too small her pink party dress is really loose in the arms and bodice while her later pink skirt is digging into her waist. Also her swimwear is rarely flattering and in some cases is just plain ugly what is she wearing on that date?! Oddly she never looks better in the film than when she's gyrating around in a red sweater and a pair of black tights her hair flailing all over the place. Later she dances in a club but her hair is shellacked to the point of immobility. In any case it's fluff but it's fun fluff and is a fully agreeable timekiller.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw this film for the 2nd time after a very long gap. The DVD print was very sharp and that always helps. CKNG is a landmark Hindi film for 2 reasons 1 It is the only Hindi film which starred all 3 Kumar brothers real family name Ganguly. 2 It paired the 2 most beautiful actresses of all time in the history of Hindi cinemaVeena real name Tajour Sultana  Madhubala real name Mumtaz Jehan Dehlavi note that this pairing was as adults. Madhubala did appear as a child actress in a 1946 film in which Veena starred. With all due consideration that old time actress Veena was in disheveled makeup for most all of her scenes Veena's stunning beauty still managed to break through. Only at the last scene of this wacky comedy do the viewers get to see Veena all neat and prim. Even so it is apparent that the filmmakers did not go all out to showcase Veena's full beauty via the most suitable makeup and hairstyle befitting her. Film director Satyen Bose must have been well aware of the Marx Brothers the Three Stooges and the forgotten Ritz Brothers when he directed this fare. As crazy and talented as Kishore Kumar was on screen there were generations of Indian filmgoers who for the life of them could never understand how the gorgeous Madhubala ever married him of all the people in the world. It was like gorgeous Ava Gardner marrying Mickey Rooney in the early 1940s...Truly jawdropping. Of the 3 brothers only Ashok Kumar looked somewhat like a matine idol in his youth. Let's face the facts Anoop and Kishore looked like cartoons...And on occasion acted like cartoons. But for this film it was right on the money. Speaking of money this film was the 2nd highest grossing Hindi film of 1958. Where this film fell short is in the backdrop of the romance of Ashok's Brijmohan and Veena's Kamini. That was a very promising subplot which certainly should have been given a far superior treatment than it was. The same can be said of the romantic subplot of Anoop's Jagmohan and Sahira's Sheela. Veteran screen great K. N. Singh provides a powerful menacing presence in this movie as the main heavy. Singh was reunited in this film with his HUMAYUN costars Ashok Kumar  Veena the 1945 Mehboob Khan epic. Singh was even more menacing here than he was in that historical drama. This movie most certainly had the potential of being an all time classic Hindi film comedy but ended up falling short of it. Nevertheless it is a film that must be viewed at least once by fans of Hindi films.".

Singh was reunited in this film with his HUMAYUN costars Ashok Kumar  Veena the 1945 Mehboob Khan epic. Singh was even more menacing here than he was in that historical drama. This movie most certainly had the potential of being an all time classic Hindi film comedy but ended up falling short of it. Nevertheless it is a film that must be viewed at least once by fans of Hindi films.";

	schema:reviewBody "I need not repeat what very aptly the 3 above reviewers BirdoberoiManoj Agrawal  Headley Lamar wrote great reviews. I will write something to add a zing to it. The movie is funny and added a lot by super acting of Madhubala. The dialogues by G. Moonis and Ramesh Pant create excellent situation. S. D. Burman arranged the music very beautifully to the lyrics of Majrooh Sultanpuri. All 3 brothers were good in their roles but the movie would not have been the biggest box office hit of 1958 without Madhubala. If you remove 5 following references the movie would have been outright failure just as Kishore wanted it to be a FLOP so he could take losses and reduce the taxes he owed to Govt. but Fate had other plans! 1. Rain soaked Madhubala's visit to Mohan Garage at midnight a 10 or more minutes of her being drenched in wet clothes. 2. Kishore's dream while asleep in Madhubala's car and singing 5 Rupaiya 3. Kishore wakes up and finds way in to Madhubala's bedroom she is asleep in night suit then the funny scuffle that follows excellent natural acting by Madhubala. 4.Madhubala taking Kishore out for picnic and they sing Haal kaisa hai janab 5. Madhubala stalling the villain and singing Ruk jao na ji. Point in case.It is quintessentially her performance that brought such monumental success to the movie. Just a note if you don't know it contrary to the movie story where Madhubala likes MannuKishorein reality during the shooting our Kishore da fell head over heels for Madhubala and it is said he even threatened to commit suicide if she won't marry him even though he was already married so eccentric was our Kishore da. The chemistry between the two in the movie is incredible where he plays naive yet likes her company. It is a classic movie and even though in Black  white but will never get old. A very clean movie a delight for next 10 generations to come.".

Story is pretty simple and theme is concentrated quite good. It's like a 'commedy of less errors' but it will keep your humor nerves fresh and healthy. The actors are pretty good and have acted really good. Actress Madhubala may not be remembered for this movie but who cares? Such storyline expects even less of what she had acted. Again three brothers in the film shown were brothers in real life too. This makes the chemistry even more strong and hence character development is much good. The only problem comes in front of a patron is the movie duration which is overly ling of almost 165 minutes. But if you can manage your mind stay stable with every little comedy scene at regular intervals you are through with the movie and that too with a good time. When Bollywood was making too emotional films such comedy movies were keen to take movie fans enjoy their interest. Enjoyable flick with family for one time sure.".

	schema:headline " Shah Rukh's shining moment!";
	schema:reviewBody "Chalte Chalte Walk Along' is a mainstream Bollywood romance that goes one better. Instead of leaving you at the altar to assume that they lived happily ever after' Chalte Chalte takes you inside the marriage after Boy meets Girl Boy wins Girl to experience Man faces the realities of life with Woman.Start with Raj Shah Rukh Khan a middle class guy who owns a small transport company. Raj is messy impulsive quick tempered a guy who acts in haste and repents at leisure. One day he bumps into Priya Rani Mukerjee a beautiful sophisticated upperclass fashion designer born in Greece and raised in luxury. Priya is organized and efficient passionate but always proper. Also a bit of a snob she assumes Raj is merely a truck driver and snubs him accordingly.Love blossoms but the road to happiness is never smooth in Bollywood Priya becomes engaged to her childhood friend Sameer a wealthy businessman from Priya's world of money and privilege. Raj not wanting to spend the rest of his life regretting if only' follows Priya to Greece to convince her that he not Sameer is the man of her dreams. Not so amazingly he manages to succeed.Your typical Bolly romance would be running the end credits about now but we're just at the interval. The rest of the film switches from sun and sea drenched  beauty of Greece to the mundane colors of Mumbai and Raj's messy apartment. Now daily life intrudes and Raj is left trying to keep the grand promises he so easily made when Priya was a prize to be obtained.Chalte Chalte provides a mature look into a marriage not of two movie stars but of  Mr. and Mrs. Anybody. The charm or the drawback depending on how you view it is that the film has no real plot no villains no heros. Just real people doing the best they can with what they have and with whom they've chosen. The problems Raj and Priya face are problems that all married people the world over face every day disapproving inlaws money problems personality clashes and on and on. The film works best for me on its most mundane level arguments over wet towels on the bed shoes on the floor appointments missed arguments about anything and everything and then the making up the kissing and cooing and apologies before starting another round.Most of the performances in Chalte are solid. The supporting players including Satish Shah and Lilette Dubay are wonderful and though a handful of newcomers intrude on the flow of the film from time to time their presence helps develop the story and provide narration and a bit of comic relief. The usually shrill and obnoxious Johnny Lever shows some welcome restraint this time and creates an endearingly poignant character who helps tell the story in yet another way.Rani Mukerjee in my opinion one of India's best actresses is stunning both in appearance and in her acting. She exudes a warmth a naturalness and a realness that makes you want to be her best friend or her lover. With her exotic amber eyes and husky voice she is spellbinding in all her scenes an intriguing mixture of sexy sophistication and little girl charm rolled into one.But this movie belongs to Shah Rukh Khan and no mistake. Coming after the opulent success of Devdas and the larger than life Asoka Raj is Everyman a regular guy with money problems wife problems ego problems problems problems problems. Khan is brilliant and totally believable as a middle class business owner struggling to keep up with everyday life.  Usually prone to bursts of hammy overacting in Chalte Chalte he is restrained and controlled in every scene. Even in those moments when Raj is rampaging over his wife's wellintentioned betrayal or on his knees humiliating himself in a crowded airport in front of Priya's snooty relatives begging her not to leave him Khan never goes over the top in his acting. Gone is the bratty charmer of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge this Raj is a mature sensitive lover and a bumbling husband willing in the end to sacrifice even his male Indian pride for his love. Shah Rukh Khan has a definite gift for creating complex characters who don't fall easily into goodguy badguy categories and Chalte Chalte's Raj is one of those characters. The story has a definite and intentional beentheredonethat feel but Khan is the reason to watch it all one more time.There are those who say the movie has no ending no resolution and at first viewing I was one of them. But on second viewing I came away feeling that both Raj and Priya had in fact learned important lessons about each other and themselves. Priya coming from the upper classes does not at first understand the inner demons Raj has to grapple with knowing he is from a lower class and that however successful he might become to Priya's snobbish Anna Aunty he will never be more than a truck driver. Raj has to learn to put aside his ego if he wishes to remain with Priya and respect her feelings and attachments even though they are uncomfortable for him. In the end they both realize that life goes on you do your best and forgive each other's flaws and mistakes and love will get you through. Chalte Chalte.The music of Chalte Chalte is a good mix. There are a couple of catchy tunes that will grab you immediately a couple of ballads that might have to grow on you and a couple of poignant numbers that I found to be hauntingly evocative during the sadder moments of the film. At times the background score does become a bit loud and intrusive but on the whole I found it to be quite beautiful. The choreography was nice if not overly exuberant perhaps due to Khan's highly publicized back problems the cinematography is gorgeous and there are some dialogues and scenes that will stay with you long after the film has ended.There are a couple of scenes that I would have trimmed most notably the climax which starts out very movingly but then lags a bit because of length and the fact that the entire cast are in danger of drowning in glycerine. But Chalte Chalte is a thoughtful offering that will leave you pondering after the closing credits.".

	onyx:emotionText "Chalte Chalte Walk Along' is a mainstream Bollywood romance that goes one better. Instead of leaving you at the altar to assume that they lived happily ever after' Chalte Chalte takes you inside the marriage after Boy meets Girl Boy wins Girl to experience Man faces the realities of life with Woman.Start with Raj Shah Rukh Khan a middle class guy who owns a small transport company. Raj is messy impulsive quick tempered a guy who acts in haste and repents at leisure. One day he bumps into Priya Rani Mukerjee a beautiful sophisticated upperclass fashion designer born in Greece and raised in luxury. Priya is organized and efficient passionate but always proper. Also a bit of a snob she assumes Raj is merely a truck driver and snubs him accordingly.Love blossoms but the road to happiness is never smooth in Bollywood Priya becomes engaged to her childhood friend Sameer a wealthy businessman from Priya's world of money and privilege. Raj not wanting to spend the rest of his life regretting if only' follows Priya to Greece to convince her that he not Sameer is the man of her dreams. Not so amazingly he manages to succeed.Your typical Bolly romance would be running the end credits about now but we're just at the interval. The rest of the film switches from sun and sea drenched  beauty of Greece to the mundane colors of Mumbai and Raj's messy apartment. Now daily life intrudes and Raj is left trying to keep the grand promises he so easily made when Priya was a prize to be obtained.Chalte Chalte provides a mature look into a marriage not of two movie stars but of  Mr. and Mrs. Anybody. The charm or the drawback depending on how you view it is that the film has no real plot no villains no heros. Just real people doing the best they can with what they have and with whom they've chosen. The problems Raj and Priya face are problems that all married people the world over face every day disapproving inlaws money problems personality clashes and on and on. The film works best for me on its most mundane level arguments over wet towels on the bed shoes on the floor appointments missed arguments about anything and everything and then the making up the kissing and cooing and apologies before starting another round.Most of the performances in Chalte are solid. The supporting players including Satish Shah and Lilette Dubay are wonderful and though a handful of newcomers intrude on the flow of the film from time to time their presence helps develop the story and provide narration and a bit of comic relief. The usually shrill and obnoxious Johnny Lever shows some welcome restraint this time and creates an endearingly poignant character who helps tell the story in yet another way.Rani Mukerjee in my opinion one of India's best actresses is stunning both in appearance and in her acting. She exudes a warmth a naturalness and a realness that makes you want to be her best friend or her lover. With her exotic amber eyes and husky voice she is spellbinding in all her scenes an intriguing mixture of sexy sophistication and little girl charm rolled into one.But this movie belongs to Shah Rukh Khan and no mistake. Coming after the opulent success of Devdas and the larger than life Asoka Raj is Everyman a regular guy with money problems wife problems ego problems problems problems problems. Khan is brilliant and totally believable as a middle class business owner struggling to keep up with everyday life.  Usually prone to bursts of hammy overacting in Chalte Chalte he is restrained and controlled in every scene. Even in those moments when Raj is rampaging over his wife's wellintentioned betrayal or on his knees humiliating himself in a crowded airport in front of Priya's snooty relatives begging her not to leave him Khan never goes over the top in his acting.

And the same happened with Chalte Chalte  it's definitely one of my favorites now right up there with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and DDLJ if not better.I really love the SRKRani jodi. They both gave great performances and looked really convincing and sweet as a couple. I was so rooting for Raj and Priya to be happy and together in this film that the viewing turned into a very emotional experience for me which I didn't expect at all having read some rather lukewarm reviews.Rani looks absolutely stunning well as usual and very feminine. Shah Rukh oozes charm and charisma in a really complex role. I personally just loved his character  with all his flaws and insecurities. Together they are just way too cute. I liked how realistic and unpretentious this film was liked the drama in the second half loved the music and all the songs. They are all outstanding. Overall I think it was a very well made film that really endeared itself to my heart. Not one boring scene except for the very beginning  I really thought that subplot could have been done away with and Johnny Lever was great  hilarious in most scenes in an unusual role serious and adding to the drama in others.I'm just grateful that this film exists.".

They loved each other very much and were faithful to each other but it appeared that there were personality conflicts and family class differences between them because Priya was from a upper class family and Raj was from a middle class family. According to Priya's family Sameer was the ideal husband for pry but Priya chose Raj as her husband.Priya's aunt interfered in Priya's and Raj's marriage. She did not approve Priya's new friends whom she had met through Raj. She also did not approve Priya's life style and believed Priya was not leading a life style that her family had dreamed and had hoped for her.Raj was positively proud of his hard work and his accomplishments as a business man. Knowing that how Priya's family felt about him he felt inferior when he was around Priya's family especially aroungd Aunt Anna and Sameer as Sameer was the person Priya's parents had chosen for her as an ideal husband.Priya did not compliment Raj in a party that was hosted by Sameer although she complimented Sameer. Feeling inferior and insecure Raj had to ask a waiter about his suit and Watch while Priya was dancing with Sameer.At home Priya refused to eat dinner after Raj had complimented her cooking. She also refused to hug him after he had brought her flowers and vegetables and had washed the dishes after coming home working all day while Priya was a home maker.Raj ran into financial difficulties with his business. He did not approach his father asking for help. He did not go to her relatives or friends asking for help. Priya did not approach her father for help. She did not go to her relatives and friends either. She went to Smaeer asking for help. He gave her 2.5 million rupees as a favior. Priya falsified to Raj about where she received the funds. When Raj had found out about from whom she got the money from the hell broke loose. Later Sameer made it look like only a loan.Although Priya had admitted to Sameer it was wrong for her to accept money from Sameer she never appolagized to Raj for accepting the money.No one in the world is perfect. There are no perfect marriages in the whole world. Raj took all the blames. He fell on his keens and publicly appoligized to Priya Aunt Anna and Sameer for every problems in their marriage.Raj is a hard worker family type of person he loved Priya very very much and was a faithful husband to her.After considering the type of person Raj is and if some like Raj was to be my husband I would have eaten my dinner with him. I would have greeted him at the door with a hug or kiss when he had arrived with vegetables and flowers. I would not have nagged him every night about petty things until he had exploded. As a home maker I would have put away his shoes and would have hung up his jacket after he had returned home from a hard day of work. I would have appoligized for being a nagging wife.

	schema:reviewBody "I quite like this film. It seems superficially like Saathiya but is also quite different. Shahrukh plays a self made small time transport business owner and is a very down to earth character. He meets a rich high society girl played by Rani and falls for her. He misplaces her and then after much searching finds her only to be told she is marrying an old friend in Greece. So off to Greece we go and by the end of the trip she is convinced she loves this man  she never did profess to love her childhood friend. They marry and then the story takes us into an inside look at the marriage between two opposites. Sparks fly fights are followed by reconciliations until there is an irreconcilable misunderstanding over money and a major rift occurs. She goes off to her family and he is left to pine... There is an inevitable happy ending but do things resolve themselves as expected? Not really and this is where I find Chalte Chalte most endearing. It is quite usual to show reformed characters ideal solutions in Hindi cinema. Chalte Chalte tells us that in relationships one must accept one's partner for what he or she is and not expect that they will magically be altered or reformed to fit our idealized version.I found SRK's portrayal of Raj the transport biz owner very authentic. His romancing Priya Rani was sweet and never very over the top  yes I even liked the hokey feel of Gumshuda and Suno Na Suno Na was divine in sound and picturization. The same old romantic dude? Perhaps but much more vulnerable and real this time around. I liked his drunk act his trashing the apartment. The one OTT moment was at the airport. Rani was fabulous as Priya stunning in looks and in her conflicts with Raj. This movie was when I first felt that she was a serious actress. Taube Tumahre yeh Ishare  that was one sweet love ballad. Lillette Dubey was a little OTT but I like her so that was no big deal.The music was good and Prem Nagariya reminded me so much of Aisa Des hai mera Veer Zaara  but it came before!! Overall  I gave Chalte Chalte an 8 because I liked the story the music the acting and most of all the reality that it is hard for human beings to change what is their true nature.".

Secondly the flashback technique is used very intelligently not merely for the sake of breaking the linear order of events but to release the desired information in well calculated bits and pieces inserted at the most appropriate places. Thirdly the minor characters are so fully developed and so painstakingly dealt with that it reminds you of the great masters of characterisation in the Russian classics. It's a common observation in the Bollywood movies that the hero's friends or the heroine's female friends never match them in personality performance or screen presence. The reason being twofold you can not financially afford to hire a good actor for a minor role and big stars are not available for minor roles anyway. The producer of Chalte Chalte however has manage to tackle this problem very successfully. He has hired a whole bunch of fresh faces...God knows from where?...and made them do exactly what was required. For the first time perhaps the status of a hero's minor friend has risen above an extra boy.Finally I should pay tribute to Johny Leaver who in his mellow role of a failed lover has busted his own cliche of a jabbering clown.".

The landscapes also especially the one in Europe. The story is simple but I think it was the intention of the producer to produce something which relates the reality.I give 710 to this movie especially for the songs and for the landscapes which take us miles away at least during 3 hours so we forget our problems and daily life to enter in the world of 2 different kind of lovers which 2 opposite personalities.To watch more than one time because really enjoyable songs musics and landscapes!".

	schema:reviewBody "Note there are some spoilers in this review.  I have tried to highlight these where applicable.It's not like I hadn't been interested but I still didn't really know what to expect when I was 'challenged' by a friend to go and see for myself why she was so crazy about all things Bollywood.  Ok so I expected colour and dancing and spectacular music but what else?  Would I miss the subtleties? Undoubtedly.  But if that were the case would it still be possible to enjoy the film as an 'outsider'?  Well I'm here to tell you that indeed you can. Indeed we did!Like I said I have little to compare the film with in respect of other Bollywood films  not being part of the hindiscenti so to speak  but let's just say that if the film had ended after its upbeat first hour and a half its innocence and its charm and some halfway decent marketing would surely have made it a serious  well in truth more a cheeky and chirpy  contender for the sort of mantle that has in the past been too easily wrapped around the likes of the entirely average Bridget Jones' Diary  that is to say the feelgood movie of the year.  Imagine that if you can a Bollywood film as the mainstream movie hit of the year!  But it could have been so.  Instead the film continued for another seventy or so minutes getting progressively darker and deeper.  But don't get me wrong I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy the rest of the film  I did it's just that that wasn't what I was describing before.  No snipping the film at the hour and a half mark would have cost us the brilliantly acted and scripted argument scenes.spoiler It would have robbed us of the pathos of the scene where the impressionable young girl accidentally uncovers the fact that all is not rosy in the RajPriya home.  But most of all it would have deprived us of the incredibly touching faceoff at the airport and the final denouement. end spoilerOverall then as a first foray into the filmi fraternity it was an overwhelmingly positive and encouraging experience.  In short we both loved it.Ok so my wife had the added attraction of the staggeringly smooth Mr Shah Rukh Khan  about whom my BollyDolly friend regularly and expansively salivates but then truth be told Rani Mukherjee wasn't exactly lacking in attractive powers either.  a very handsome couple indeed.  But I have to admit that it's Shah Rukh Khan who steals the show.  Hell this bloke is blessed with a tongue crafted from the purest silver a charm so potent it should be classified as a weapon of mass destruction and licensed for use against politicians tabloid journalists cynics and coldhearted curmudgeons the world over to make the world a far far better place. I mean there was one scene spoiler coming... where Khan's Raj was telling Mukherjee's Priya all the things he would do for her and how much he wanted her to be happy  all the while flashing that cheeky crease of the face trick  where I think even a redblooded male such as myself would have almost succumbed to marry the royallylarynxed Raj!  He's THAT good! endspoilerSo as if that's not enough what else was it that made me love this film? Well it's the unpretentiousness.  There's an innocence a simplicity which made it seem fresh.  No tricks. No flashiness.  Just a simple but intriguing story well told.  Even though at times it seemed to veer wildly between the kitsch and the deadly deadly serious and was sometimes hammed up to the extreme it still left you caring passionately about these characters to an extent that I for one only usually experience when watching real classics like Life Is Beautiful. But having already confessed how close I was to succumbing to Raj's charms I see no reason to feel any shame in admitting that there were nearly tears in my partner's!! eyes on not one occasion but several!It sounds corny I know  though not half as corny as some of the translated song lyrics man what's that all about!  but this film will make you laugh it'll make you cry it'll make you smile and it'll make you grimace.  Sometimes it'll even do it all in the same scene  watch that shoe Raj! I'm still smiling about the beauty and sheer joy of Raj and Priya's trip through the countryside  like a hip Sound Of Music.  I loved the whole She's Missing song sorry don't know the correct title and accompanying routine.  Raj's tomfoolery  and although he played the buffoon when it counted he sure knew how to snare that girl!  Then there's the playfulness of the scenes when they are in Greece together. spoiler The bit where the girl in the bowling alley bursts into tears the hilarious scene with the policeman who played a great role akin to a Shakespearian fool Raj's telephone call with an irate customer  how could you NOT love this film? endspoiler Then there were the fits of giggles from the blokes in the seats behind us one even slapping the back of  the seats in front of him unable as he was to contain his glee at the sheer audacity of the script.I could go on for hours and I probably will as someone once said but why not let Chalte Chalte put the joy back in for you?And if the moral of our tale for although I'm told there often is one who am I to say is that the course of true love doesn't always run smoothly but that the rough parts of the trip perhaps serve to make you appreciate the smoother ones even more then you could say that's just like Chalte Chalte and even life itself isn't it?".

The main theme of the film is the second half where after marriage both couple have regular fights which lead to separation. Shahrukh Khan is One of the Best Actors of Bollywood delivering a amazing role. Rani Mukherjee is the Best Actress of Bollywood. This movie is an example of the kind of superb actress she is. Originally Aishwarya Rai was suppose to play her part Thank god she didn't. I don't think Aish has good acting skills enough to play a challenging role like Rani has played. Rani has given us Hit Movies with amazing acting in the past. Yuva Hum Tum Chori chori and Black are some of her Best work. Rani is a very charming Beautiful Actress and looking at her interviews she appears to be very Smart and Confident. I enjoyed this movie very much Rani looked very sexy in the song Tauba. Recommended to all viewers.".

But the direction of this movie is really bad it could have been better. I am pointing out some mistakes.The story starts when Raj Sharukh and Priya Rani meet with a freak accident. Raj invites Priya to accompany her from Mahabaleshwar to Mumbai. They start their journey when Raj acts totally 'dehati' someone from a village this should have been done if required after some time of their travel. Then the traffic police sequence was good and subsequent sequences were nice until Raj meets Priya in Mumbai and tells her he looking for her for 20 days  this is way too impractical  how can he obstruct traffic for so much time. Then he follows Priya to Greece for her engagement. In the Plane when it was announced that flight would be delayed Raj's excitement came after a moment it should have come instantaneously. The car ride from Macanese to Athens should have been prolonged and it should not be 1012 hours drive but around 2024 hours drive any truck driver can drive 1012 hours easily. When they were married their love should have been shown a little more not petty fights all the time. Another blunder in the direction was when Raj tries to stop Priya from going back to Athens this scene was more of a comedy than an emotional scene. The biggest mistake was to end the film with a directional error here when Raj enters his house and takes off his shoes he hears a voice of Priya telling him not to do so but it should have been when he drops his shoes he should have remembered Priya and then place his hoes properly in its place then they should have met with love.I would rate this film 5 on a scale of 10.".

The way their relationship developed was touching and for the first time I didn't cringe after the fact that the hero run's off to woo his love before she gets married to someone else. In Every scene he looked cool and fresh in his pale browns and muddy jeans which was a change from most of the outrageous yellow shirt that they wear with an awful orange jacket.Rani was beautiful throughout the movie she wore clothes that had made me realise that my wardrobe needed updating her makeup did she even wear any? It looked subtle and not too over the top. Her performance was outstanding heartwarming I loved her every scenes it made me want to fast forward the next scenes until she was on screen thank god for me and my DVD player she was on the screen as much as Shahrukh The whole movie was a great achievement and I was glad to see that the film didn't end with a big happy ending it ended with what was building a crack in their marriage an argument.I'm glad I purchased the film on DVD as well as its soundtrack it was one of my few but best buys!".

	schema:reviewBody "After hearing that this movie is similar to 'Saathiya' i never had much expectations from it...also the promos never helped! However after watching it i was quite pleased with the film. Especially after the boring movies that are coming out lately! It was a similar story to 'saathiya' but it was treated in a completely different way. I thought the husbandwife arguments were more realistic in this movie than saathiya. The story really flowed well and the scene where Shahrukh drops Rani off to her home in Greece is a classic. It is so romantic and emotional. Overall i think the performances were excellent. Shahrukh khan really stole the show and he proved with this movie why he is no.1 The film is really worth watching and i assure you that you will not be dissapointed.".

The cinematography is breathtaking with foreign locations. Storywise it's refreshing to see realist love stories that goes beyond theguygetshisgirl sequence which most of the movies end with.

So Rani is in her native domain so to speak and she is even getting good at these roles depicting a newly married with better expectations and duelling to get it. The fast dialog helps to forefront the couple that have time to fight over mundane things that hard working couple would not have time for. The truck driver character fits Sharukh like a Glove he is more believable than a Lover caught between two women Devdas. He has flair for few things like when he erupts unexpectedly like a volcano than the emotional pleadings. A good story could be told well without innately intrusive comics and foreign locations which have become integral part of the Hindi Movies these days. Some of the best movies like MrMrs Iyer Guide did not have foreign locations or innately intrusive comics. This paranoia that is prevailing among the Filmmakers that the audience is starved for a comedy interludes has to stop. Other than few flaws I enjoyed this movie and one of the few movies I sincerely feel that Sharukh Khan has given his true potential instead of his head shaking histrionics that makes his audience shriek but does nothing to the coffers in the box office nor the audience whose choice and aesthetics is changing and it is changing for the better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Trucks great honking big ones gaudily painted and festooned with tinselly decorations feature prominently in Chalte Chalte' the new film from Shah Rukh Khan's production company Dreamz Unlimited.  The hero Raj Shah Rukh Khan as proprietor of a transportation company owns a fleet of trucks. For sport he meets the leading lady while cruising around in one and perhaps to prove his commonman credentials he drives one himself on occasion even dressed in a lungikurta ensemble to get the look completely right.  For added authenticity he accessorizes with a tinny cassette recorder that plays a song from that other truckdriver film Gadar'. Unfortunately trucks become a metaphor for the film itself with its lumbering unsubtlety and ponderous plot turns.Taking a page out of Miss Piggy's Guide to Living' Raj has a number of remarkably homelylooking friends in her selfhelp tome the Porcine One advises To look glamorous at the dinner table surround yourself with ugly dining companions.'  These friends recount to a newcomer to the group how Raj and Priya Rani Mukherjee met cute and how he proceeded to woo her. The flashbacks show us Raj in aforementioned truck and lungikurta meeting Priya on the highway.  This first encounter adhering to Hindi film convention is a prickly one but the subsequent ones lead to mutual attraction and considerable singing of duets.Priya is a promising fashion designer she is also foreignbased so that she and Raj can sing romantic songs in Greece.  Hindi films are on the constant lookout for new locations to amuse the jaded eye of the NRI NonResident Indian viewer and Greece is definitely a first in songsinging locations. The Karan Johar film K3G' took us to the Pyramids this one almost makes it to the Parthenon!  Hindi film crews should be departing soon for Namibia Outer Mongolia and Vanuatu in this ongoing quest for new locales for song sequences but I digress.Priya has come to India to stage a pioneering fashion show which involves backlit young women clad in diaphanous robes a nod to Priya's Greek' heritage carrying flaming torches.  India apparently has never heard of the ancient Greeks for Priya immediately becomes the toast of Mumbai formerly Bombay for her innovative fashion design.  Anyway Priya makes a detour by truck of course and gets a guided trip of scenic rural India from Raj. Upon their return to Mumbai Rajthanks to an overzealous washermancannot read Priya's phone number that he had scribbled on a postit note and the film veers precariously close to Serendipity' territory.  In that Hollywood film the romantic leads spend years not being able to track each other down and consequentially almost marry the wrong people.  Hindi film heroes are made of sterner stuff however within days Raj recruits what seems to be the entire ablebodied population of Mumbai including a kindly traffic cop a benevolent postman and citizenry of other sundry occupations to locate Priya over the course of a single wellchoreographed song.Having made it abundantly clear that he is in love with her Raj suffers a setback when Priya tells him she has to fly back to Athens to get engaged to her childhood chum and fellow blueblood Sameer.  Of course Raj follows her and gets to sing songs in Greece though mercifully not in Greek.Then the film crosses over into Saathiya' terrain and we witness struggling squabbling young marrieds yaddayaddayadda.  I wanted so much to like this film Shah Rukh said somewhere that he wanted this film to be a complete departure from those of the Devdas' ilk which is indeed a laudable aspiration.  And after seeing Saathiya' I am an avowed Rani Mukherjee fan and walked into this film willing myself to like it.  But the writing and the direction is so hackneyed that even proficient performers like Shah Rukh and Rani have trouble bringing Raj and Priya to life. Priya looks stunning she wears gorgeous clothes exotic makeup even sheds exquisite tears but remains an inert mannequin nonethelessthe stereotypical Miss Neeta or Miss Geeta an interchangeable heroine of Hindi movies.  Likewise Shah Rukh strives manfully to rescue the disasterbound truck that is this film but ultimately doesn't succeed.  Filmgoers are an extraordinarily tolerant bunch and will happily suspend disbelief to swallow a good tale but filmmakers have the responsibility to give them some slight incentive to do so.What can I say of the supporting cast?  Lilette Dubey who was so wonderful in Monsoon Wedding' Zubeida' and even in the pretty awful GadarEk Prem Katha' the last onethird of Gadar.' was completely wretched! has little to do as Priya's uppitysocialite aunt Annamaasi.  She has snobbery down pat and looks supremely put upon when she has to pay a visit to Priya and Raj's downmarket digs.  So much middleclass squalor is an affront to her delicate patrician sensibilities and she looks mightily troubled on the verge of collapse at being surrounded by tradespeople and noisy neighbors.The motley crew that constitutes Raj's social circle shows up from time to time but no one registers other than the compassionate traffic cop who like God manages to be everywhere all the time.  Oh yes there is even a gay character who minces around in a couple of scenes.  It would be very sad if Hindi films go the way of Hollywood and include homosexual characters for no reason other than comic relief or to reiterate tired stereotypes. Jayshree T. turns up too as Raj's overly madeup Gujarati nextdoor neighbor but has misplaced her zing.  In the seventies and eighties overly madeup then as well Ms. T. was a feisty supporting player and danseuse. She and her dancer older sister Meena T. appeared together in numerous films spinning and pirouetting diligently in clockwise and counterclockwise directions.  Satish Shah plays her husband here and is a looming benign presence.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the next film Shah Rukh Khan produces will get it right.  Full marks for trying and keep up the good fight!".

Unfortunately trucks become a metaphor for the film itself with its lumbering unsubtlety and ponderous plot turns.Taking a page out of Miss Piggy's Guide to Living' Raj has a number of remarkably homelylooking friends in her selfhelp tome the Porcine One advises To look glamorous at the dinner table surround yourself with ugly dining companions.'  These friends recount to a newcomer to the group how Raj and Priya Rani Mukherjee met cute and how he proceeded to woo her. The flashbacks show us Raj in aforementioned truck and lungikurta meeting Priya on the highway.  This first encounter adhering to Hindi film convention is a prickly one but the subsequent ones lead to mutual attraction and considerable singing of duets.Priya is a promising fashion designer she is also foreignbased so that she and Raj can sing romantic songs in Greece.  Hindi films are on the constant lookout for new locations to amuse the jaded eye of the NRI NonResident Indian viewer and Greece is definitely a first in songsinging locations. The Karan Johar film K3G' took us to the Pyramids this one almost makes it to the Parthenon!  Hindi film crews should be departing soon for Namibia Outer Mongolia and Vanuatu in this ongoing quest for new locales for song sequences but I digress.Priya has come to India to stage a pioneering fashion show which involves backlit young women clad in diaphanous robes a nod to Priya's Greek' heritage carrying flaming torches.  India apparently has never heard of the ancient Greeks for Priya immediately becomes the toast of Mumbai formerly Bombay for her innovative fashion design.  Anyway Priya makes a detour by truck of course and gets a guided trip of scenic rural India from Raj. Upon their return to Mumbai Rajthanks to an overzealous washermancannot read Priya's phone number that he had scribbled on a postit note and the film veers precariously close to Serendipity' territory.  In that Hollywood film the romantic leads spend years not being able to track each other down and consequentially almost marry the wrong people.  Hindi film heroes are made of sterner stuff however within days Raj recruits what seems to be the entire ablebodied population of Mumbai including a kindly traffic cop a benevolent postman and citizenry of other sundry occupations to locate Priya over the course of a single wellchoreographed song.Having made it abundantly clear that he is in love with her Raj suffers a setback when Priya tells him she has to fly back to Athens to get engaged to her childhood chum and fellow blueblood Sameer.  Of course Raj follows her and gets to sing songs in Greece though mercifully not in Greek.Then the film crosses over into Saathiya' terrain and we witness struggling squabbling young marrieds yaddayaddayadda.  I wanted so much to like this film Shah Rukh said somewhere that he wanted this film to be a complete departure from those of the Devdas' ilk which is indeed a laudable aspiration.  And after seeing Saathiya' I am an avowed Rani Mukherjee fan and walked into this film willing myself to like it.  But the writing and the direction is so hackneyed that even proficient performers like Shah Rukh and Rani have trouble bringing Raj and Priya to life. Priya looks stunning she wears gorgeous clothes exotic makeup even sheds exquisite tears but remains an inert mannequin nonethelessthe stereotypical Miss Neeta or Miss Geeta an interchangeable heroine of Hindi movies.  Likewise Shah Rukh strives manfully to rescue the disasterbound truck that is this film but ultimately doesn't succeed.  Filmgoers are an extraordinarily tolerant bunch and will happily suspend disbelief to swallow a good tale but filmmakers have the responsibility to give them some slight incentive to do so.What can I say of the supporting cast?  Lilette Dubey who was so wonderful in Monsoon Wedding' Zubeida' and even in the pretty awful GadarEk Prem Katha' the last onethird of Gadar.' was completely wretched! has little to do as Priya's uppitysocialite aunt Annamaasi.  She has snobbery down pat and looks supremely put upon when she has to pay a visit to Priya and Raj's downmarket digs.  So much middleclass squalor is an affront to her delicate patrician sensibilities and she looks mightily troubled on the verge of collapse at being surrounded by tradespeople and noisy neighbors.The motley crew that constitutes Raj's social circle shows up from time to time but no one registers other than the compassionate traffic cop who like God manages to be everywhere all the time.  Oh yes there is even a gay character who minces around in a couple of scenes.  It would be very sad if Hindi films go the way of Hollywood and include homosexual characters for no reason other than comic relief or to reiterate tired stereotypes. Jayshree T. turns up too as Raj's overly madeup Gujarati nextdoor neighbor but has misplaced her zing.  In the seventies and eighties overly madeup then as well Ms. T. was a feisty supporting player and danseuse. She and her dancer older sister Meena T. appeared together in numerous films spinning and pirouetting diligently in clockwise and counterclockwise directions.  Satish Shah plays her husband here and is a looming benign presence.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the next film Shah Rukh Khan produces will get it right.  Full marks for trying and keep up the good fight!";

	schema:reviewBody "Paramount's THE TURNING POINT is unfortunately a forgotten movie. A reasonably good crime thriller the film has suffered probably because of its unavailability in any format. It cannot be found even on VHS and its TV screenings are few and far between. Why this should be is anybody's guess for it is nicely written by Warren Duff and has a sterling cast in William Holden Edmond O'Brien Alexis smith and Ed Begley. Produced for the studio in 1952 by Irving Asher it comes from a story Storm In The City by Horace McCoy. Crisply photographed in black and white by Lionel Linden it was given a nice noirish style by director William Dieterle. Like Robert Wise's The Captive City made the same year the picture is heavily influenced by the Kefauver Crime Hearings in the U.S. senate in 1950 and 1951 set up to investigate organized crime and its cross border activities.Newly appointed crime commissioner John Conroy Edmond O'Brien is determined to crack down on the crooked syndicate that is holding the city to ransom with its extortion racket and other illegal enterprises. With the help of his police detective father Matt Conroy an excellent Tom Tully he intends to eliminate the hoodlum element controlled by syndicate boss the ruthless Eichelberger Ed Begley. But to his surprise he finds his father is reluctant to get involved. Investigative reporter and John Conroy's boyhood friend Jerry McKibbon William Holden is suspicious at Matt's reticence in helping out his son and follows him. He is shocked to discover he does business and has dealings with the syndicate. He is now undecided on just how to tell his friend that his father is no more than a crooked cop. To further complicate matters he begins having an affair with John's secretary and girlfriend the attractive Amanda Waycross Alexis Smith. The picture comes to a nailbiting finish when an out of town hit man Neville Brand comes gunning for McKibbon an exciting sequence at a boxing match so as to prevent him from reporting anymore about the activities of the mob in his newspaper.The acting is splendid from the entire cast. William Holden in the wake of his brilliant performances in the unforgettable Sunset Boulevard and his fine railroad cop in the excellent Union Station gives his usual well polished performance this time as a hard bitten newspaper reporter. Excellent too is Edmond O'Brien as the commissioner. O'Brien was an actor who was never known to give a bad performance and doesn't disappoint here. Supplying the romance is the attractive Alexis Smith an actress who for years was buried in nothing roles at Warner Brothers here comes out of her shell to give a nice portrayal of a woman torn between two men. The following year she would steal the acting honours from all around her in RKO's neat little thriller Split Second.There is no original music in the picture which is something of a disappointment. All that is heard are bits and pieces culled from unused music of Victor Young and Miklos Rozsa and conducted and supervised by Irvin Talbot. However the music score not withstanding the picture doesn't suffer because of it and it remains a good solid crime thriller. Now where is Olive Films to give us the DVD?".

He's the son of veteran police detective Tom Tully and he asks his father to help him in his investigation.

This crime syndicate has its hooks in pretty deep and watching the film you see why they are always one step ahead of the investigating commission. The Turning Point fits right in with Bill Holden's post Sunset Boulevard tough and cynical image. That would reach its apogee when next year Holden would win an Oscar for the ultimate cynic in Stalag 17.The rest of the cast performs well in roles that fit them admirably. Some you will remember are Neville Brand as an out of town torpedo who has few words but an aura of menace Carolyn Jones in her film debut as a Virginia Hill type witness who performs on stand the way Judy Holliday did in the House UnAmerican Activities Committee as the dumb moll. But the performance that really stands out is that of Adele Longmire who is the wife of another torpedo who was doublecrossed and killed after a hit he performed. She is really a standout in her scenes as a frightened witness trying to flee the mob.The Turning Point is a good noir drama that holds up very well today and is even relevant with some of the big name prosecutions of more recent vintage.".

The film is headlined by William Holden Edmond O'Brien Ed Begley and Alexis Smith. It features a crackling good screenplay by Warren Duff taken from the book by Horace McCoy.A government commission comes to town to look into mob activities. The main focus of the investigation is local mob boss Ed Begley. In charge of the commission is Edmond O'Brien. His aide is Alexis Smith. William Holden plays the big city newsman who thinks the commission is really a waste of time and money. He is also a longtime friend of O'Brien.O'Brien dives in trying to get the goods on mobster Begley and his main henchmen Ted de Corsia and Danny Dayton. Someone keeps tipping off the mob to what O'Brien and the Police are up to. O'Brien's chief investigator happens to be his father Police Detective Tom Tully. The problem here is that Tully is also on Begley's payroll.Newspaperman Holden knows about Tully being on the take and confronts him on the matter. Holden gives him time to switch teams or he will need to tell O'Brien about what his father really is. Tully decides to do the right thing and inform on the mob. The mob quickly figures this out and sets up a hit on Tully. They have a low level thug Tony Barr ambush Tully and kill him. The mob then bumps off Barr to tie off any loose ends.This does not sit well with Holden who now throws in with O'Brien to help. He writes a series of attack articles highlighting the mob types' criminal activity. Needless to say the mob is not in the least amused. They call in an out of town hitman Neville Brand to deal with Holden.There is a wellstaged shoot out at a local boxing arena with Holden and Brand both getting the big adis. By now witnesses have started to pop up against the mob. The whole house of cards comes crashing down with Begley and his bunch going for a long holiday on the State's dime.The entire cast and crew shine in this excellent production. One time Oscar nominated director William Dieterle does good work on this one. He keeps a firm hand on notorious scene stealer's like de Corsia and O'Brien not letting them go too far over the top. His other film noir include DARK CITY ROPE OF SAND and THE ACCUSED.Three time nominated and one time Oscar winner Lionel Lindon handles the cinematography duties. His film work includes THE BLUE DAHLIA ALIAS NICK BEAL QUICKSAND THE SUN SETS AT DAWN HELL'S ISLAND THE BIG CAPER and the SCARLET HOUR.Look close and you will see Russell Johnson and Carolyn Jones in early unbilled roles.The screenplay was by noir veteran Warren Duff. He did the story or screenplays for THE FALLEN SPARROW CHICAGO DEADLINE A DANGEROUS PROFESSION APPOINTMENT WITH DANGER and MAKE HASTE TO LIVE.This film features some of the best use of Los Angeles' Bunker Hill area I've seen in any production. I really love seeing these long gone areas of the City of Angels.".

You see a curious position for Holden hot off of Sunset Blvd. in a somewhat secondary role because he might be the leading hunk but O'Brien is the leading man.A good film without that special something to lift it up but without a flaw either in any usual sense.

But The Turning Point does its best and the location shooting is one of its most admirable features. Prominent use is made of the twoblock long funicular railway that runs up from Pond Street meaning Hill and Olive Streets in L.A. The incline is lined on both sides with inexpensive clapboard housing that suggests working class and some scenes are shot in the doorways and apartments. It's all gone now railway included to make way for some bland and pitiless redevelopment in 1968. Everything in Los Angeles gives way to redevelopment when the property becomes valuable enough. Stores proudly announce Serving The Public Since 2012! Chinatown gave us a picture postcard view of Los Angeles in 1937 and made the place look limitlessly livable.At any rate cynical reporter William Holden and idealistic anticrime crusader Edmund O'Brien both grew up in the same neighborhood of Central City or whatever Los Angeles is called here. So did Ted de Corsia a thug as usual but not without principles for a change. O'Brien is anxious to shut down the crooked gangster who runs the city Ed Begley. I don't want to give away the entire plot but I guess I can say that Alexis Smith is the girl friend with the striking eyes especially for a Canadian who is O'Brien's girl friend but finds herself falling for the hardbitten reporter. She doesn't have much else to do and is chiefly there to add some romantic drama to the story and to demonstrate that both Holden and O'Brien are heterosexual.Overall it's rather routine but there are some interesting twists the corruption reaches into O'Brien's own family and some nicely done scenes. Aside from the hiding shooting and general mishigas on the funicular railway the scene in which O'Brien rushes to the hospital after his friend Holden has been shot is understated. In a movie that was as corrupt as Central City we'd expect O'Brien to dash into the hospital's reception room only to be stopped by a doctor in white. How  how is he? O'Brien would stutter. I'm afraid we were too late the doc replies sadly but philosophically. I won't describe how this familiar scene is handled here but it's better than you might think.Another memorable incident is the arrest of Ed Begley who plays a much more delicate slime ball here than he did in Twelve Angry Men. He pitches a few sliders here. He's sitting at a table playing cards with his gang under a single light bulb in what looks like a basement. Police sirens wail. The goons knock over their chairs as they run away but Begley sits still staring at his cards. A policeman's hand holding a pistol slowly enters the frame from the right. Begley slams down his hand gets to his feet in a dignified way looks at the cop finishes off his drink and exits towards the police. The scene isn't masterful but William Dieterle has lifted it out of the ordinary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Copyright 1 November 1952 by Paramount Pictures Corp. New York opening at the Globe 15 November 1952. U.S. release November 1952. U.K. release 1 December 1952. Australian release 21 November 1952. Sydney opening at the Prince Edward 21 November 1952 ran 3 weeks. 7797 feet. 86 minutes.SYNOPSIS John Conroy an honest aggressive lawyer and politician is head of a special committee investigating organized crime in a large Midwestern city. His friend investigative reporter Jerry McKibbon is shocked to discover that Conroy's father Matt was once a policeman on the syndicate payroll but McKibbon decides not to tell Conroy about his father. As the committee puts pressure on the syndicate chieftain Eichelberger the gangsters decide that Matt Conroy must be killed.NOTES Although the film was only moderately successful in America and England it proved to have an astonishing second wind in Australia which made it one of Paramount's top moneyearners of the 1950s. The initial Sydney season at the plush Prince Edward cinema had to be pulled for the preset engagement of The Greatest Show On Earth. On moveover to the downtown Lyric a second release grind house the film attracted such consistent turnaway business it became Paramount's best sleeper of the decade being constantly revived and recirculated. Prints of the film were never idle and even the frontofhouse lobby card posters eventually wore out. The Lyric itself represented the film by popular demand no less than seven or eight times.COMMENT Turning Point is a crime drama that was totally underrated by halfasleep professional critics except in Australia. Written by Warren Duff and Horace McCoy it was photographed and directed in an imaginative film noir style that made most effective use of its natural urban locations in Los Angeles.

Australian release 21 November 1952. Sydney opening at the Prince Edward 21 November 1952 ran 3 weeks. 7797 feet. 86 minutes.SYNOPSIS John Conroy an honest aggressive lawyer and politician is head of a special committee investigating organized crime in a large Midwestern city. His friend investigative reporter Jerry McKibbon is shocked to discover that Conroy's father Matt was once a policeman on the syndicate payroll but McKibbon decides not to tell Conroy about his father. As the committee puts pressure on the syndicate chieftain Eichelberger the gangsters decide that Matt Conroy must be killed.NOTES Although the film was only moderately successful in America and England it proved to have an astonishing second wind in Australia which made it one of Paramount's top moneyearners of the 1950s. The initial Sydney season at the plush Prince Edward cinema had to be pulled for the preset engagement of The Greatest Show On Earth. On moveover to the downtown Lyric a second release grind house the film attracted such consistent turnaway business it became Paramount's best sleeper of the decade being constantly revived and recirculated. Prints of the film were never idle and even the frontofhouse lobby card posters eventually wore out. The Lyric itself represented the film by popular demand no less than seven or eight times.COMMENT Turning Point is a crime drama that was totally underrated by halfasleep professional critics except in Australia. Written by Warren Duff and Horace McCoy it was photographed and directed in an imaginative film noir style that made most effective use of its natural urban locations in Los Angeles. Realistic sound is used to augment some tingling action sequences handled with superb control of crowds and effects. In some ways the story parallels The Enforcer 1951 but Dieterle's direction is beholden to noone.

A simple enough film it draws the viewer deeper and deeper into a Japanese schoolboy's masochistic obssession and the slow steady conversion of a girl into the sadistic mistress that he needs.Yet the film is not about sex or lust. It is about a passion so deep that it defines one's being. The boy is blessed with that rare honesty  he will not deny himself his passion. He risks exposure humiliation hatred and worst of all the loss of the one he loves just to live his way. It makes one feel inadequate when one considers how much we willingly censor our own desires and passions just to 'fit in'. There are moments of exquisite pain in this film when you can hear hearts shattering and from these come some of the film's most beautiful moments as well. His seemingly endless devotion to her her traumatic attempt to rationalize his desire  these are extremes that perhaps each of us have tasted to a lesser degree at some point in our lives. Here watch them played out to the maximum. If his love is to be called perverse then let it be so for maybe love is too great to be normal to intense to be sane. Performances are riveting from the two leads. Sensitive sharp and burning with unspoken emotion. The two are infinitely desirable because they are so passionate so afire. Sensuality and sexuality are redefined and if you are neither sadistic or masochistic at the start of the film you will long to be one or the other or maybe both by the end.".

This includes licking the sweat off of her feet listening to her having sex with a friend and even jumping over a waterfall. Based on a manga Japanese comic book by Masahiko Kikumi the film is not about kinky sex but about adolescents involved in a love so deep it completely distorts their sense of perspective. Shiota's wry observational camera captures a marginal but valid aspect of the adolescent experience as profoundly as Van Sant's Elephant captured the high school milieu that led to guns and violence.Takuya and Satsuki are shy students at the same high school and belong to the Kendo club a sport involving two single combatants who wear padded gear then try to beat each other with either end of a padded stick. Satsuki is a top player and a most soughtafter companion. Backed by the soft guitar melodies of Shinsuke Honda the two friends begin dating and everything seems normal until she discovers that he is more interested in sniffing her underwear photographing articles of her clothing and making audio tapes of her going to the bathroom than in having sex. When Takuya puts a twist on the meaning of puppy love and tells her he wants to be like her obedient dog she calls him a pervert and begins spending more time with another classmate Uematsu Tadashi Kusano Kitahara.With a fast turnaround that seems a bit out of character Satsuki soon discovers that she finds pleasure in playing the dominating role and begins ordering the compliant Takuya around asking him to do more and more outlandish things. The two feed off of each other however and continue a relationship of domination and submission with Takuya willing to go to degrading lengths to gain Satsuki's approval. In recent years a number of theorists have suggested that sadomasochism can be a healthy form of sexual arousal among consenting individuals. While there may be a core of truth to this this film is not a good example. There is a strong element of selfdestruction and lack of selfrespect in the behavior of the two lovers and Satsuki admits she has thought of suicide.Although I'm not sure what the director had in mind in making this film Moonlight Whispers touched me deeply and even when I was repulsed by the behavior of the characters I felt a deep compassion for their pain. There is no trace of exploitation in Shiota's film and while mental health experts might frown the relationship feels organic to the characters and not pathological. The director makes no judgments showing only the lengths people with low selfesteem will go to feel wanted and needed. I was reminded of the words of author Georges Bernanos when he wrote How easy it is to hate oneself. True grace is to forget. Yet if pride could die in us the supreme grace would be to love oneself in all simplicity. What this brilliant and disturbing film says to me more than anything else is that we cannot truly love another human being unless we learn to love ourselves.".

	schema:reviewBody "In it's simplest form this movie is about a boy and a girl who fall in love. While that could make a good movie this one throws in a realistic problem. The boy gets off on masochism. While many viewers may find this scary it is a realistic and common fetish. I for one thinks it is quite exciting. But as erotic as some people might find it that's not what the movie deals with. It deals with the psychological impact of that realization. The girl does not know how to handle that aspect of the relationship and the boy finds himself 'desturbed and perverted' Problems arise and both try to come to terms with the situation in different ways.Whitout going too much of the story away I want to make clear this is NOT a pornographic movie. It tries to address certain more exotic aspects of sexuality in a normal nonjudgmental way. It shows us what could happen in a relationship when one or both parties has a fetish. It also shows us that having a fetish does not mean that the love for oneanother is different than any other relationship. Just the way someone expresses it or experiences it is different.All in all a very honest and heartwarming movie.".

The boy gets off on masochism. While many viewers may find this scary it is a realistic and common fetish. I for one thinks it is quite exciting. But as erotic as some people might find it that's not what the movie deals with. It deals with the psychological impact of that realization. The girl does not know how to handle that aspect of the relationship and the boy finds himself 'desturbed and perverted' Problems arise and both try to come to terms with the situation in different ways.Whitout going too much of the story away I want to make clear this is NOT a pornographic movie. It tries to address certain more exotic aspects of sexuality in a normal nonjudgmental way. It shows us what could happen in a relationship when one or both parties has a fetish. It also shows us that having a fetish does not mean that the love for oneanother is different than any other relationship. Just the way someone expresses it or experiences it is different.All in all a very honest and heartwarming movie.";

I admire how the director treats the subject so maturely and the manner in which the young woman confronts her boyfriend's desire to be her dog. For those of you that actively participate in certain fetish lifestyles this movie is a can'tmiss. And for those of you who don't you will enjoy the complex relationship between the young man and woman and the manner in which they learn to hurdle the obstacles that stand in the way of their love. BDSM is not just about dragon women in black leather cracking whips and the men who willingly submit. This movie truly captures the subtleties of BDSM and explores deep into the psychology of the characters to find out why they desire to act out their fantasies in such an uncommon manner. Enjoy.".

I even went to a local high school and took pictures of a martial arts training of local youth in southern Japan.The only thing missing from my trip was the basic content of this film  its story.This is a coming of age story with a tinge of Japanese politeness and tradition in social introduction just skewed by a few years in time backwards to the American experience  perhaps into the 60's when sex during high school was the daring thing to do and then talk or brag about.As a coming of age story the script and acting maintains a balance of innocence and exploration as the theme dances around sadomasochism in an increasing eddy that entraps the next experience.The beauty of this film is its innocence and its honesty in portraying the boundaries of sexual experience and an obsession that can bind innocence into something more permanent outside of those first sexual experiences and beginnings.It is not a fearful film to watch but simply a difficult film to describe without creating fear in its next potential viewer.  As the film ends there is still an essence of innocence and beauty and love between the boy and girl.".

Takuya smitten by the beautiful girl joins the kendo club in order to get closer to the one he loves even becoming her personal workout partner a role in which he suffers several smacks upside the head with a practice sword. However it seems that Takuya's affection will remain unreciprocated because Takuya considers the longhaired Satsuki out of his reach. Yet when Takuya's best friend asks him to give Satsuki a love letter a letter he had used on another girl a short time before Satsuki lets her disappoint be known that she would have preferred to have received a letter from Takuya.Elated by these words Takuya begins his relationship with the girl of his dreams. They spend their days riding together on Takuya's bike and playing video games. However one day when Takuya stays home from school because of a cold Satsuki visits him and they sleep together for the first time. While this is Satsuki's first sexual experience with Takuya Takuya has found a number of ways to be intimate with Satsuki without her being present. After discovering that his locker key could also open Satsuki's Takuya indulged his desires by smelling Satsuki's gym shorts and collecting other odds and ends such as used chapstick and tissues. Takuya also has a number of clandestine photos of Satsuki and even goes as far as to record an audio tape of his girlfriend urinating.Takuya of course keeps all of this a secret from his girlfriend but after discovering one of her socks under Takuya's sheets Satsuki discovers Takuya's other memorabilia as well. Totally freaked out by the experience Satsuki does her best to avoid Takuya but he pursues her recently. In order to make Takuya jealous Satsuki begins dating Uematsu the former couple's senior classman in the kendo club however instead of ceasing his pursuit Takuya continues to follow Satsuki and tells her that he wants to be her dog and that he will do anything for her. Scared of Takuya's ways at first Satsuki eventually enjoys tormenting the young man her favorite method being to hide Takuya away sometimes with his hands tied behind his back where he can watch her make love with Uematsu. This wicked game continues throughout the film.Taking the mundane high school love drama and giving it a fetishized edge Shiota's film explores the developing sexuality of two young people who do not fit the average or what is perceived to be average mold of young love. There are some quite tender moments such as Takuya's and Satsuki's first sexual encounter but the most fascinating aspect of the film is Satsuki's discovery of her own sexuality. Desiring to have a normal relationship Satsuki's discovery that she is a bit of a sadist disturbs her. Numerous times throughout the film such as when she forces Takuya to lick the sweat of her body she literally breaks down in varying degrees. An interesting film but definitely not one for family movie night hehe.".

After they have sex for the first time she finds out that he is really in love with her because not because of her but because of the smell of her feet and the noise her pee makes when she excretes !. But does she break up with him? No she just decides to let him give her foot a slimy slurp and listen to her as she carries out her extremely slutty appointments with her normal boyfriends. This leads to a hugely bizarre ending that not only SPOILERS gives new meaning to the expression go jump off a bridge but leaves room for a sequel! Not that I wouldn't watch it I would. But this movie is strange because these two have some really strange connection but carry it out in a completely different way. Think Secretary Japanese style and not nearly as extreme. I recommend this film for a few watches as you do care for the characters and situations at hand but don't go in expecting gore or laughs or something normal for that matter.810".

And don't take me wrong it's subtle but it's also extremely powerful. it's just that everything arises from character development and interaction and not from gimmicks.The plot is well thought out and the acting was pretty good. I just wish the director had explored Takuya's reasons and motives a little more and also a bit more focus on Satsuki's inner conflict Her enjoying the sm games but at the same time feeling it's wrong. Still it's a good film and probably worth checking if you like Asian cinema.710".

Its more the process through which this film navigated itself all the way to its conclusion that gave me the creeps ........so its up to you now if you wanna read on..........VERY VERY MILD SPOILERS Come to think of it....Moonlight Whisper might count as one of the most emotionally unnerving films I have ever seen...SM SM SM......oops did I say that out loud? So people it may be helpful to think of it as an SM flick that's somewhat different from Secretary. Unlike the sugar coated Maggie G starring flick MW lets you taste the sweet then the bitter and depending on your moral threshold the excruciatingly horrid. Its like a teenage romance drama gone completely offkilter. But do not be misled by my take. There were very few scenes of outright grotesqueries to offend anyone's visual sensibilities. The alllure of this flick is actually its scary ease is making one uncomfortable without any gratuituous sexploitation. Like Battle Royale this film skimmed on the edge of taboo because it explored the realms of SM albeit in its lighter shade of fetishistic perversity and what nots with younger protagonists. Do I want to critique on the questionable psyche of the Japanese culture? I don't think so.Back to the movie This time round though in contrast to Secretary its the girl that's the master and the boy her sick puppy. In the beginning it all looked innocent enough cleverly packaged like a sweet almost childfriendly flick. But by the time you realised what you got yourself into its too late. For not much happened in the first quarter of the movie to suggest we would be watching a film with such mired emotional moral complexity. The Japanese do seem to possess this uncanny urgeand ability to genre confuse its audience don't they? But I liked it. Especially those matching eye patches Don't ask. So will you like it?

Killer Kid resolving a weapons smuggling issue and he attempts to bring peace and order the revolutionaries who are intent on killing the soldiers responsible for Mexican slaughters . The film is dedicated to the Mexican people . Offbeat Spaghetti Western that follows the Sergio LeoneSergio Corbucci wake  but it is also proceeded in American models . It is an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the tough protagonists Steffen and Fernando Sancho and the enemies as the heartless Ken Wood and his hoodlums . As well as enjoyable appearance of the beauty Luisa Baratto as Santos' niece . The highlights of the film are the bloody slaughter at the Mexican village and the violent finale confronting at the mountains . The film blends noisy action  shootouts  violence  blood  and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . Stars Anthony Steffen as an American officer who is actually an agent pretending to help Mexicans  Anthony is well remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados  but in his day  from the mid'60s to the early '70s  Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre  at the time cheap B movies now revered cult classics . The handsome  Italianborn  actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome  Antonio Luiz De Teff Von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica . From there  Steffen began acting in swordandsandal epics later moving onto the Western genre where he found his niche . Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood  however  Steffen never became a top international boxoffice attraction . He played as a ManWithnoName a lot of Spaghettis as Gentleman Killer Garringo Apocalypse Joe Stranger in Paso Bravo  The last Tomahawk.

This film belongs to the numerous group of flicks that are set during the Mexican revolution  called Zapata Western  like are the Italians  Duck you sucker The mercenary Tetepa Los Compaeros What am I doing in middle of the revolution and the American ones  The wild bunch and The professionals. There are many fine technicians and nice assistants as the professional cameraman Sandro Mancori who makes an excellent photography with barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun shot on location in outskirts of Rome and El Lacio as well as in Cinecitta studios and Elios studios . The musician Berto Pisano creates a catching soundtrack and well conducted and in Ennio Morricone style . This Western Alla'Italiana was well directed by Leopoldo Savona .

	schema:reviewBody "KILLER KID is a well shot but rather dull spaghetti western with a muddled storyline that doesn't really go anywhere and action scenes which while passing the time don't really amount to much. The story as a whole feels more than a little repetitive and disjointed.Genre regular Anthony Steffen plays an outlaw who's being hunted by cruel and vindictive American soldiers eager to thwart a group of Mexican revolutionaries. Steffen is suspected of colluding with the enemy but his actual persona is more complex and he becomes involved in a murky narrative involving the gungho rebels beautiful women and the completely ruthless soldiers hunting for the enemy.Steffen is an acceptable lead but I thought that Fernando Sancho really overacted in this movie spoiling his character somewhat. Despite a plentitude of action scenes KILLER KID never really grips or involves the viewer and I was personally left waiting for it to end so I could do something more interesting.".

Some 400 'spaghetti westerns' were made between roughly 1964 and 1978 with many never making international release. That said the genre contained some fine films in their own right despite the somewhat derogatory term applied to these films. Killer Kid came reasonably early in the cycle and was not one of the better examples.A man Anthony Steffen assumed to be famous outlaw Killer Kid is actually an American agent pretending to help Mexican Revolutionaries in order to save himself and in the meantime ensure that arms destined for the Mexican government don't get there. Or at least that's what I could make of the plot in this confusing boring spaghetti western which really has nothing new to add to the genre. In the end Steffen's potential love is killed and he decides to join the revolution permanently.".
