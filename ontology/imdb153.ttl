The four officers and six enlisted men of the Memphis Belle  a B17 bomber so nicknamed for the girlfriend of its stern and stoic captain Dennis Dearborn  will soon start their twentyfifth mission having completed their previous twentyfour successfully with nary an incident while fewer and fewer other planes are coming back from their missions at all. If they complete their next mission successfully they will be the first Army Air Corps B17 Crew to complete their tour of duty. Visiting communications officer Lt. Col. Bruce Derringer wants to publicize and highly tout their accomplishment even before it happens as a long term good news campaign at a time when there is little good news to report. Derringer's plan is against the wishes of the base commander Col. Craig Harriman who would prefer to treat the ten as any of his other hard working men. The previous success of the Memphis Belle is despite the disparate natures ...";

	schema:headline " A Worthy Addition to the Corpus of War Films";
	schema:reviewBody "The traditional patriotic World War 2 film was popular in both America and Britain throughout the fifties and sixties long after the war itself was over. In the late seventies eighties and early nineties however it went into something of a decline in both countries. In Britain this was connected to a decline in the British cinema itself which only occasionally had the financial resources and selfconfidence to make pictures on a large scale. The best British war film of the period was 'Hope and Glory' which concentrated on the Home Front rather than on actual combat.In America the decline of the war film probably had more to do with postVietnam syndrome which led to patriotic sentiment and the military being viewed for a time with some suspicion. There were a few disguised war films such as 'Top Gun' which had modern American fighter pilots battling an unidentified enemy in a fictitious war or the 'Star Wars' trilogy which even if George Lucas disliked the analogy was widely seen as either World War Two or the Cold War translated into outer space. Genuine war films however were few and far between although there were a number of exceptions and TCM recently broadcast two of these as part of the DDay sixtieth anniversary celebrations 'The Big Red One' from 1980 and 'Memphis Belle' from ten years later. Of these two 'Memphis Belle' is closer in style and in spirit to the traditional war film. Like many other war films it follows the fortunes of a small tightlyknit group of fighting men. The group in this case is the crew of an American B17 bomber based in England in 1943 the producer David Puttnam originally wanted to make the film about a RAF Lancaster bomber but no British studio was interested and Hollywood has never taken much interest in the British war effort. The crew of the 'Memphis Belle' have already flown twentyfour successful missions one more and they will have completed their tour of duty the first American crew to do so and will be able to return home. The name 'Memphis Belle' was taken from that of the first aircraft which completed twentyfive missions in real life.The film follows the men on their twentyfifth mission an attack on the German city of Bremen. The raid is a difficult one the bombers meet strong opposition from German fighters and antiaircraft gunners the plane is damaged and one of the crew is seriously injured. This leads to a tense finale which leaves the audience wondering whether the crew will be able to make it back to base. The main glory of the film lies in its exciting depictions of aerial combat among the best ever filmed although those in 'The Battle of Britain' made over twenty years earlier are also excellent. As in that film the combat sequences in 'Memphis Belle' were achieved by the use of real aircraft and models rather than by computergenerated special effects. We are introduced to each of the crew each of whom is presented as a distinct and different personality Dennis the conscientious pilot and captain the depressive Phil Val the medical student who pretends to be far more knowledgeable than he really is the poetic intellectual Danny and so on. Trying to make each crew member an individual character in his own right was perhaps a mistake as this meant that there are too many actors in leading roles for the viewer to concentrate on. The crewmen all emerge as halfformed characters with no fullyformed ones it might have been better to concentrate on say four or five crew members and to tell their stories fully with the others only playing supporting roles. The film touches on the moral dilemmas of the bombing campaign rather more than earlier films on this subject might have done. Rather than take the risk of hitting a nearby school Dennis insists on flying round thereby increasing the risk of his aircraft being shot down until he has a clear view of the intended target a German aircraft factory. There is also a subplot involving a rather unpleasant Air Force officer who is eager to exploit the Memphis Belle and her crew for propaganda purposes and his clashes with the base commander who finds this distasteful and who is more concerned about the heavy casualties his unit is suffering.These elements aside there is little in the film that could not also be found in earlier films about the World War Two bombing campaign such as 'The Dambusters' or '633 Squadron'. That does not however necessarily mean that the film is anachronistic as some have complained. Fashions in filmmaking may come and go but this cannot alter the fact that the Second World War provides innumerable examples of heroism and drama which are capable of being made the subject of a good film. That was as true in 1990 as it was in 1950 or 1960 and remains true even today. I myself found 'Memphis Belle' to be both exciting and at times moving a fine tribute to the men whose bravery inspired it and a worthy addition to the corpus of war films. 810".

Having flown 24 bombing missions over Nazi occupied Europe since it's first bombing run on November 7 1942 over the city of Brest France this if successful it's 25th bombing run would be the planes and crews ticket out of WWII.It had been determined by the US general staff that 25 bombing and combat missions over Europe were the limit that a bomber crew in order to keep casualties down can take before they start to fall apart from the stress and cease to be effective. The crew of the Memphis Belle are the first to almost reach that goal 25 successful bombing missions. The unbelievably ferocious German resistance from it vaunted Luftwaffa and ground antiaircraft batteries over the skies of Europe cost the USAAF and RAF some 35000 planes fighters and bombers and their crews over 150000 airmen during the bombing of Germany and German controlled Europe from 1942 to 1945. Thats just how savage and bitter the fighting was for air supremacy over that wartorn continent. Stirring story with fine performances from the Memphis Belle's Captain Dennis Dearborn Matthew Modine on down. As the legendary bomber weathers wave after wave of deadly German ME 109 Messershmitt fighter planes from the sky and massive and murderous German AK AK antiaircraft fire from the ground. As the Memphis Belle flies over Bremen and drops it's bomb payload and then limps back to England. With it's crew battered and bloody but safe and alive to be the first bomber crew to survive 25 missions over German controlled Europe. The spectacular air combat photography was the best I've ever seen in a war movie and the cast was on par with the Memphis Belle with no one outshining the others but all equal up to their task just like the famed bomber was.Back on the ground there was another drama played out with officer Col. Harriman David Strathaim who sent out the Memphis Belle and the other 23 B17's of his bomber squadron on their mission over Bremen Germany. Col. Harriman didn't go along with Col. Derringer John Lithgow the US public relation officer who seemed too eager to reward the Memphis Belle crew with honors and glory even before they successfully finished their 25th mission. Not realizing that he was making the bombers crew and Col. Harriman very nervous with his not understanding how dangerous their mission was and even possibly jinxing them. Tense and terrific the movie has already become a war classic without the false heroics that was so common in war movies made during WWII by Hollywood in order to boost the US morale at home and on the battlefield. The crew of the Memphis Belle were just as normal and scared as anyone of us would be if we were in the same situation that they were in. But it was that very fear that brought the best in strength and courage out of them and made them the hero's that they eventually became.".

I've seen some comments by people that it was unrealistic for a 21year old Matthew Modine's Dennis Dearborn character to be the pilot. The real Belle pilot Robert K. Morgan was only 24 when they began flying missions in late 1942. Some of the movie's dialogue actually was said by crew during the Belle's missions.

Think about that whole image listen to the music score cherish the action from a fresh perspective. TRY to put yourself in their shoes.Then watch the film again";

This movie  Memphis Belle  reaches deep into the human Psyche and rekindles a plethora of war time conflicts. The actors chosen for this masterpiece are incredible as they superbly resurrect the dangerous era of the courageous men and their historic aircraft. Matthew Modine plays Capt. Dennis Dearborn a stern commander who exhibits a tough veiner but is inwardly aware and concern with every man in his crew. Tate Donovan is Lt. Sinclair anxious to experience bravery as a necessary element to achieve fame. However when the war touches him he realizes it's not as glorious as he imagined. Eric Stoltz D.B. Sweeney Billy Zane Sean Astin Harry Connick Jr. Reed Diamond Courtney Gains and Neil Giuntoli play the crew. Rounding out the cast adding prestige and enhancing the overall story are David Strathairn and John Lithgow. Together this superior ensemble and the dramatic talent of the special effects specialists allowed the 'Belle' to rise center stage and display its last wartime flight. The result is nothing short of extraordinary. Behind the men and their plane is the memory of the thousands of brave airmen who gave their lives for their country. In short their sacrifice becomes the lasting monument which continues to this day as a lasting tribute to our freedom. A great film which is sure to become a military Classic. Highly recommended! ".

	schema:reviewBody "Memphis Belle is an amazing movie that has an amazing cast where each man fits his character perfectly as you are thrown back into May 17 1943 as the crew of the Memphis Belle has completed 24 missions and is about to become the first crew of the Eighth Airfore to complete its 25th and final bombing mission over Bremen to bomb a factory.The movie accurately depicts a mission of a B17 bomber and all the treacheries the crew of 10 men must face while in the sky. From take off and grouping for formation to the flight across the channel the movie builds excitement as the men head into enemy skies where they will have to face multiple attacks from ME109 Messershmitt fighters as well as brutal barrages of flak anti aircraftattacks all while trying to maneuver through the skies to make it over the target and drop its payload of bombs. At that point only half the battle is done the plane crew of 10 and all other bombers in the formation must struggle to make it back to their bases and land safely in England to live to fight another day or if they are lucky enough such as the crew of the Memphis Belle they will complete their tour of duty 25 missions and return home to their families or continue on and complete more tours.The movie really gives the viewer a great understanding for how the American airmen fought bravely over enemy skies of Germany during the daylight bombing raids during WWII.This movie is by far my favorite movie. I was introduced to this movie one year after it came out in theaters. I was only 5 years old but I already had a growing fascination for the war and especially for the B17s because of my grandfather. My dad knew about the movie because local actor Eric Stoltz lives here in Santa Barbara so he gave me the movie in hopes of fulfilling my ever growing curiosities of B17s.".

Sweeney Reed Diamond Courntey Gains Neil Giuntoli and John Lithgow all give amazing performances in this true story.Even my Dad who sleeps through every movie we watch no matter how enthralling stayed awake and watched this. Allbeit the second time I popped this in the DVD player but nevertheless hello.I would give this movie 20 stars if I could. It was one of the best war movies I'd seen in a long time. Plus being a teenage girl I loved seeing all the boys in Uniform. Oh my God don't get me started.When my mom asked me if I was ready to send it back to Netflix I said no and kept it a pretty good long while. But when we finally did send it back I cried yes I cried because I had fallen in love with this movie. I'd watch it everyday if I could. I have yet to buy it yet but trust me I'll find a way.If you have had family that was in WWII my grandfather was then this movie will have an impact on you. It did on me. I found my self thinking that my grandpa was young like that right around that time. This film was set in 1942 and that means that my grandfather had yet to marry my grandmother but he was in his prime. My mom and I both thought that.But you don't have to like war movies to love Memphis Belle. Because it's not really like a war movie. It's about the close relationship of these ten soldiers and how they work together to stay alive in the worst of a situation. I mean they're not having to eat rats to stay alive which my grandfather had to do in occupied France or anything.The first time you see Memphis Belle anywhere to rent or to buy grab it and take it home with you. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! Take my word on that.Missy".

	schema:reviewBody "I was glad to finally see a World War II movie that wasn't situated on the ground but in the air. Don't get me wrong I'm still an absolute fan of the 'infantry and tank' war movies but from time to time I want to see something new something different. And let's be honest there just doesn't seem to be any interest from Hollywood for the air fights over Europe or Asia in WWII. I only know of two other movies of this kind and that is Battle of Britain made in 1969 WWII and The Blue Max from 1966 WWI.The Memphis Belle is a B17 bomber that is about to fly its 25th and final mission. After this mission the crew of ten men will have fulfilled its tour of duty and will finally be able to go home. Since they would be the first crew to finish all 25 missions in the 8th Airforce plans are made to celebrate their coming home party even before they have taken off. But before there can be any party they first have to fly their final mission to one of the worst targets imaginable. They will have to fly over German territory all the way to the heavily defended Bremen where they will have to bomb an airplane factory in the middle of a residential area. All the men know that chances are little that they will ever return alive and that one little mistake will cost the lives of many innocent civilians...In the beginning I didn't like this movie all that much and there were a couple of reasons for that. One is the in my opinion badly casted John Lithgow. His role as Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Derringer just didn't fit in properly. It felt like he didn't take his role very serious although I'm convinced that it also had something to do with the script. Perhaps noone had payed enough attention to the development of his role... And there were a couple more problems to be found in this movie. Take for instance the crew. The voiceover in the beginning says it too There just has to be a virgin a wise guy a cool guy... in every flight crew. That was so stereotypical that it bothered me. The last thing that didn't really do it for me  although it wasn't as bad as my two other points of criticism  was the entire day before their mission. I just had the feeling that they should have kept it shorter. I'm not saying that they had to skip that part completely but I was waiting for the part in which all the flying and the action would take place.Still I don't want you to think that this isn't a good movie. Once they are in that bomber the stereotypes seemed to melt away like snow for the sun. They started to act as a team instead of being a bunch of individuals that didn't seem to fit in. From that moment on I was truly captivated by this movie. Also the fact that they show so many flight and fight sequences including some realtime footage is wonderful. I know I just love to watch those old Messerschmits B17's... flying and that already was enough for me to like this movie. But than again who else would watch such a movie than the people who are interested in that part of the war? Not that many I suppose.As a conclusion I would like to say that I liked this movie for many reasons but the best one must have been the acting once they were in that confined space of the airplane. All they had to work with was the interaction between them their enemies and their plane and they sure did a wonderful job from that moment on. So despite the fact that I didn't like the first part of the movie all that much I must say that the second part made me decide to give it a very good final rating. I give this movie a well deserved 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "For people of my generation childhood afternoons were often composed of spending Sunday afternoons watching Second World War movies where English speaking heroes gave stupid Germans a lesson in biting off more than they could chew . This gave a a somewhat erroneous view of history for the baby boomer generation . Americans were bullet proof apart from the one bloke who was engaged to get married who'd always snuff it in the final reel  the entire British military would be composed of John Mills and that other bloke while the Germans were invariably stupid and lousy shots . For my own part I became an aficionado of military history and redeemed myself by studying the war and came to the conclusion that Nazi Germany  A regime that waged war as ruthlessly and effectively as it murdered undesirables  was defeated by  British courage  American money and Soviet blood  in the words of Winston Churchill . Watching MEMPHIS BELLE I'm reminded how old fashioned everything is Somewhat typically for a film that was made in Britain by a British production team and a British director it's financed by American money and therefore is made for an American market so revolves around an American aircrew flying a B17 . Fair enough but couldn't the characters have mentioned that WW2 was a joint operation ? Watching this you'll be left thinking America was fighting alone . There's even a scene where the only British male character  a farmer  needs rescued by the American airforce As for the cast they're almost unknown at the time . John Lithgow would be a recognisable face as would perhaps Matthew Modine . Some of the cast would become well known but this leads to a problem when the crew of the aircraft take their places . It's difficult to tell who is manning which position in the plane and you do feel perhaps that a better known cast would have improved things . Not to the point of A BRIDGE TOO FAR or THE LONGEST DAY type star vehicle  but enough to make you perhaps care a bit more for characters that end up faceless The crew are on their 25th and final mission over Europe which means if they survive the flight they can go home . Being their final mission means all sorts of artistic license is involved to keep the audience on tenterhooks . Despite being a relatively close target in Bremen their fighter escort of P51 Mustangs have to turn back to base for no other reason than it makes the bomber crews situation more perilous even though in reality a P51 can indeed provide escort to Bremen and back again . Everything else that can go wrong does indeed go wrong but perhaps the most ridiculous scene is where Captain Dearborn misses the target and decides to lead the bomber wing towards a second run because he fears hitting a school . Would it be too callous to state allied aircrews wouldn't have been too bothered about bombing a school ? After all the children in a school would be working in a German factory contributing to the Nazi war machine in a couple of years anyway . All this makes MEMPHIS BELLE a little bit overdone with western allies being goodies and Germans being faceless enemies In conclusion MEMPHIS BELLE is a technically competent war film but not much else . It does show the courage involved by bomber crews during the second world war but also feels incredibly old fashioned . So much so that you'd have no problem believing that the screenplay was written while the war was still being waged".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie on video round about 1991 when I was about seven years old or so. I enjoyed it then because it had airplanes in it and there was nothing particularly offensive or difficult for a seven year old boy to understand.Watching it again some nineteen years later I'm struck by the exact same things. It's a very familyfriendly war movie earnestly trying to show us the difficult lives of American bomber pilots in Europe in 1943. The cast of characters come out of a guidebook for writing war movies complete with The Religious One There's always a religious one says John Lithgow's character The Scared One The GoodLuck Charm The Smartass and The Captain. The screenplay hits all the familiar notes the crew pulling together for one last mission overcoming obstacles bonding as a surrogate family.The actors all do a good job. Reed Diamond Sean Astin Matthew Modine and Eric Stoltz are the most noteworthy and how young they all were in 1990! plus Lithgow and David Strathairn on the ground. Modine is almost funny as the straightlaced pilot who seems uncomfortably aware of just how boring he really is. Stoltz stands out in the thankless role of the allaround nice guy who gets wounded.The flying scenes are exceptional. Real B17s were filmed at real wartime airfields and there's a barebones authenticity about a lot of it. The scenes inside the Memphis Belle where most of the movie takes place do an excellent job of showing you how cramped cold and noisy a place like that could be. Not to mention dangerous the action scenes when German fighters attack the bombers flick by at a very fast pace which must be something like what the bomber crews experienced. All this of course has been cleaned up for movie audiences real bomber crews would never have taken off their oxygen masks or engaged in the lengthy conversations and horseplay featured in the film.So it's a sincere and generally harmless movie saturated in nostalgia motivated by a desire to pay tribute to its subjects. That leads it into clichd territory leaving me with the feeling that the producers dusted off a screenplay dating to the 1950s only adding a few lines here and there for modern audiences. Not entirely a bad thing mind you but not all that it could have been. Notable however is the total absence of the sort of flagwaving patriotism we've come to expect from period war films there's nary an American flag in sight and the film is dedicated to all the pilots and aircrews who lost their lives in the war  not just the Allies.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you haven't already seen Memphis Belle go ahead and watch it before reading this review it's reasonably entertaining and I don't want to spoil it for you with my comments. Spoiler alertI have watched Memphis Belle several times over the years and it looks weaker each time. When it came out on VHS I gave a copy to a friend who was a longtime pilot and he didn't think much of it. And I see from the review by Author ianlouisiana from United Kingdom someone who was there in England at the time that the acting just doesn't match the way people behaved back then. My first thought on my latest viewing is that she is right and almost everyone was overacting presumably at the insistence of the director Michael CatonJones. Most of the performances are corny even sadly John Lithgow's. But there is a deeper problem All of the crew except the pilot behave like they were 12 years old. This is not how people behaved back then and certainly not in the military during World War 2. Back then graduating from high school was more like graduating from college is today people were far more mature because they had to be  they had to find a job and in the Depression. Being in the military aged you fast during WWII. Just look at the documentaries from the war. My guess is it added 10 years to your age in maturity. Plus being in a flight crew was special duty which I assume required extra maturity given the danger responsibility and price of the airplane. I can't imagine the Army allowing such infantile whiners into a B17 or that they would still be so immature after 24 missions. Putting an embarrassing sign on the back of your buddy and other meanspirited horseplay during a mission over Nazi Germany is hard to imagine in real life. If this were pure fiction and you wanted to give it a MASH touch of absurd humor that's a director's right. But this was based on a true story and a remarkable one so the acting and script should have been more realistic. The movie's strength is giving a sense of the danger in a bombing run over Germany. but there are plenty of movies that do that and better. Of course one of the best air battle movie is The Battle of Britain and it's companion BBC documentary. I admire period movies that get the sense of the time right. It's not just about avoiding anachronistic items but of getting the feel the mood the character of the period. Visually Memphis Belle gets it. In other respects the movie comes close but doesn't quite succeed in transporting you back in time to 1943. The childish acting and silly gimmicks like the fellow going on and on about opening a national hamburger franchise get in the way. You feel that what they know about WWII was based on watching some WWII era B movies. An example of a movie that did succeed in recreating the war and time totally was Das Boot. It too was based on a true story written by the embedded journalist. Another is Yanks. In 1990 when Memphis Belle was made there were enough people still alive from that time to tell those involved what it was really like plus there was the original documentary. But I guess that's not the sort of movie they really wanted to make. Too bad. It could have been a classic.As a side note I am saddened by the persistently antiAmerican sentiment expressed by so many reviewers over virtually any American war movie that does not costar their country. One states that despite a British director etc. Fair enough but couldn't the characters have mentioned that WW2 was a joint operation ? Watching this you'll be left thinking America was fighting alone. I can assure you Theo Robertson from Isle Of Bute Scotland that while we are a nation of drooling dolts and imbeciles no American is so stupid as to think the U.S. fought WWII alone. We know Britain fought too and bravely. We even know who your wartime leaders were Prime Minister Sherlock Holmes followed by Colonel Blimp. Anyone who gets their history exclusively from the movies is a fool so they are beyond help. But even if they did they would not be this misinformed. All they would have to do is watch Patton to know about Britain's valuable contribution in Africa! Just kidding. And then there's A Bridge Too Far from MGM if you want costar billing and that other Bridge movie. Look Britain America and William Wyler made Mrs. Minniver and without even once mentioning LendLease so get off our backs!!!Have a nice day.".

Not to be mean but you don't know what you're talking about mate.As an Australian note in case you've lived under a ROCK for the last 60 years Australians fought in WWII as well including my own grandfather I feel indescribable gratitude towards those brave men and women who stood up for all of us. Without them the nation of Australia would not exist today because Australia would have been conquered by Japan and would be a very different country today.It doesn't take much internet surfing or reading yes i still actually go to the library to find out that the incidents portrayed in this film did actually take place just not all on the same mission and not all happened to the Belle herself. FYI the Belle's real last mission was not to Bremen it was to a target in France and the mission went without a hitch textbookperfect not really something worthy of a movie...quite boring actually despite it's significance to the crew. Yes some stuff was made up...but all in all Catherine Wyler William Wyler's daughter has done a fairly exceptional job of telling all the stories she wanted to tell. She said her father or grandfather one or the other it's been a while told her heaps of stories about heaps of bomber crews and she wanted to tell them all but settled on a few very dramatic ones she thought would work well for this film and they do.Technically give the film a break...they did a great job of making 6 real B17's look like 150. Without CGI this was a lot harder to do than it seems.I give war films the benefit of the doubt when it comes to things like dialoguerealism etc simply because drum roll I WAS NOT THERE therefore I don't know sht and so I don't try to pretend that I do. My grandfather never said much about his time in North Africa and Crete during WWII except that I always got the impression he tried to REMEMBER his friends that were there with him and to FORGET everything else all the horrible things he saw and did. Things he HAD to see and HAD to do at the time. This film shows very well the camaraderie that my late grandfather held so dear.But...by all means keep bashing this film...I don't mind its low rating because I have it on DVD so what anyone else thinks of it is kinda irrelevant to me and the naysayer comments are oh so entertaining. Like the one Robert J Maxwell that raves about the dog in this film...man I had to rack my brain to even remember the dog but this reviewer seems to feel the dog has a pivotal role in the film and ruined his enjoyment of it...whoah dude...you need to calm down man!

This was a true event in a war where a new crew's life expectancy was six missions.

The producers have done a great job showing that this was a war of mostly boys and very young men who if they survive to grow up will grow up much too quickly. And those airplanes! Yes I know that there were only five real ones and that most were not the correct model but let's face it when there are so few left of the thousands built you take what you can get and be happy for it. It is very good to see even those five flying together again.But then there is the dialogue. I'm afraid I found it a little turgid at times and the attitudes and language somewhat anachronistic. I have war vets in my family and none of them admit to speaking like that! Well they could be lying... In any case it is a movie adaptation and one should make allowances.The big disappointment for me however was that they took a very dramatic historical story and trivialized it with some very shallow characterizations and fictitious situations pertaining to the famous last flight. Okay again I understand that it is a feature movie and not a documentary recreation but really wasn't the true story dramatic enough? Ultimately it a silly movie that stands as a mundane bit of film making and not a particularly good war film at that.Enjoy this movie if you like but if you want the real drama not to mention the real story of the last flight of the Memphis Belle have a look at William Wyler's superb riveting documentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an exceedingly dull film and is an insult to the men who fought on the real Memphis Bell. If you read the trivia you know that none of these reallife hero's are depicted in the film. They must not have been exciting enough so Hollywood made up someone that they thought would be more interesting.There are two moments in this film that really sum the movie up. The first comes five minutes into the film when a damaged B17 is landing with one landing gear down. We see a long sequence of the plane scooting around then another sequence where the footage they shot just wasn't long enough. Then the plane erupts into a massive fireball this in spite of the fact that it is a returning plane with no fuel or bombs and probably very little remaining ammunition. This made a statement that fact and realism were not meant to be elements of this film in spite of the idea that this is supposed to be a true story.The other moment comes 30 minutes later. The crew is ready to go but gets a weather delay. After we hear everyone comment on this one of the crew makes the statement why don't get just get on with it. I REALLY had to agree. This movie has so much filler in it and drags forever before we finally get to the only actual plot element the final mission. Even then the filmmakers felt a need to drag out every moment as long as possible. This is the single most boring war film I have ever seen.They could have completely removed John Lithgow from the film considerably improving it. The long buildup to the flight could have been cut. We would have less than an hour of film but it would have been a bit less dull.".

There is minimal reference to the story of Memphis Belle in relation to the bigger picture ie World War II. The characters introduced as fearless cocky airmen remain underdeveloped throughout the film and it's little surprise that they return home as American heroes. While mindful of the contribution by Americans in the war to keep this country free this film captures none of the fear or tension of flying a bomber on WWII. The characters are cardboard cutout and the plot twists are as obvious as a B52. If you are looking for a clean Hollywood introduction to WW11 this is your film. If however you are over 12 years old and are looking for a more authentic and terrifying war movie seek out Das Boot. A Uboat yes and a German crew but a masterclass in war filmmaking.".

	schema:headline " The perfect movie for anyone who hates Dragonball Z";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching DBE i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire Dragonball series. The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.For one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the bullies is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy like they are in the anime but just like slow motion fire.I could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire backstory of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask Why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for? This is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.As a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls.".

	schema:reviewBody "For manga and anime fans around the world the story of Dragonball has to be at the top or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved mangaanime stories ever written. There is already an existing live action Dragonball movie called Dragonball The Magic Begins httpwww.imdb.comtitlett0122050 made in Taiwan back in 1989. That movie tried really hard to stay as close as possible to the original story of Dragonball as written by Akira Toriyama but it ended up being more of a comedy. The entire story also only went up to the Pilaf storyline which was way before the first Piccolo appearance. This movie although aged and not exactly a direct interpretation of the Dragonball story was still appreciated by most fans due to the comedic entertainment value.Now another live action Dragonball movie has come called Dragonball Evolution. When the first few pictures of this movie appeared on the internet a lot of the fans already predicted that the movie would turn out horrible because the characters don't look like themselves. The characters were heavily changed and westernized too much especially Piccolo the main villain who didn't look like the one from the manga and anime. Fast forward to a few weeks before the latest Dragonball movie was released a trailer was leaked on the internet. That trailer spelled the certain doom of the movie to the fans of the show. Most of the comments described the movie as Not Dragonball but another action movie.This writer was fortunate enough to be invited to a private screening of the movie and boy was I surprised! I was already expecting the movie to be bad and not a real Dragonball but what I witnessed was something much more horrible! Granted that the movie was really different but the way the movie progressed the introduction of characters the fight scenes oh wow you'd think it was a movie created by elementary kids who had no idea what Dragonball was about except for the Kamehameha move and the 7 dragon balls just with the financial backing of a millionaire. Everything seemed rushed in the movie and characters would just pop out of nowhere and decide to join together to beat Piccolo. The love angle in the story seemed forced as well everybody was simply out of character. Goku's a powerful but lame school boy Chi Chi's a martial art school girl who can't even open her own locker Master Roshi's some crazy dude living in the city at least he still wears a Hawaiian shirt and seems a little perverted Bulma became Lara Croft and Rambo combined in another body with a bizarre voice Mai originally one of Pilaf's hilarious henchmen in the manga became a cold blooded shapeshifting killer Yamcha became a weird cross between a desert bandit who can't fight and a hobo with unwashed hair and Piccolo became a weird vampire whose outfit seems to be inspired by the Matrix. I think only Grandpa Gohan was close enough to the original character except for the way he exits the movie early on.The fight scenes were lame. Dragonball was about epic sized battles that could not be contained in one location. Characters would get punched through mountains cities would be destroyed the earth would rumble and split up due to the massive forces of the fighters. In this movie everything seemed so lame. Even the Kamehameha attack was used to light some candles! Talk about total weakening!The only good things about the movie were the special effects although the energy blasts seemed very weak.My advise is if you're going to pay to watch this movie DON'T DO IT. Listen to what almost everybody has been saying because they're right the movie is worse than what you currently have in mind!".

I love his Final Destination series but I think James is NOT the right person to direct this million plus dollars franchise. Why James is hired to direct this movie in the first place? It is a big mistakes. Like having Ang Lee directing the Hulk. Hiring an Asian to direct an Asian animation epic doesn't mean the movie will turn out great. The director must have a vision of the given materials. The entire outcome is a disaster and disappointment. It is understandable that the film isn't exactly the same as the original comic but the characters and the plot just suck as a film on its own. From observing the promotion materials of Dragonball it seems that Fox doesn't want to do this movie at all. The posters suck and the trailers suck. The studio spends a lot of money on making Marvels and DC comics into movies look how successful those films had become. The studios should pay more respect and faith in Asian materials. To me this whole thing isn't making any sense at all because there are established fans across the globe and Dragonball comic and cartoon itself has last more than TWO decades. This is why I think 20th Century Fox was putting money into this project initially. Everyone is looking forward to see a Hollywood version of Dragonball. Soon as I saw the first teaser I knew I shouldn't put up in any hope into this movie. Even though I went to see the movie without any expectation the movie still suck! Despite the led down of the Dragonball fans it creates negative impulses to those who is new to Dragonball.Dragonball is a hot cult in Asia and it hits the western market because of the stylistic action and fight sequences. However the martial arts choreography in this movie is another led down. Not to mention the screenplay the production design of this film is not consistence at all. Wardrobes props to makeup nothing fits together! Not only nothing in this film resembles the original DB it is a disgrace. No wonder they use the word Evolution. But when they say evolution I don't expect the studio turns something respectable like Dragonball into rubbish. I've seen a live action version of Dragonball shot by the Malaysian years ago. Although it is an exact duplicate of the animation. But the movie is far better than Dragonball Evolution. A lot of us are looking for a remake of this movie.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Dragonball Evolution";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood plundering Japanese pop culture isn't something new. From Americanizing television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman and adapting famed characters from Japanese film games and manga to frequent disastrous effect it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series because the assumption is that the builtin fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.You have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though being either foolhardy or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie and live in the hopes of producing a sequel or to generate a franchise i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll. But what they successfully do is to supersummarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga making it extremely simplistic in poor lazyman standards in adaptation.For the uninitiated the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about like myself the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive only that they look more Caucasian and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to someone forgot to insist that in the contract? That's all you're gonna get. Period.As far as filmmaking and storytelling techniques go you can see clich after clich being thrown at you with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical knowitall like in Kung Pu Panda and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi Jamie Chung. Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo an instant shooin as one of the worst cinematic villains ever! and his temporary sidekick Mai Eriko Tamura who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship in the form of irritating techwizard Bulma Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon mercenary Yum Cha Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T and Chow YunFat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.Speaking of time or the lack thereof everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun OK so I made that up everything moves at so fast a pace that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One which was of course bland and bad opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slowmo technique and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action in the dark coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.And the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise they look really cheap and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well I may get flak from her fans and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow YunFat's star status could save this and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.This is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously despite having to see 6 halfballs contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters being continuously flashed on screen thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe where's that malfunction when you need one? Totally bland and really uninteresting I would suggest sticking to the manga instead.".

From Americanizing television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman and adapting famed characters from Japanese film games and manga to frequent disastrous effect it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series because the assumption is that the builtin fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.You have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though being either foolhardy or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie and live in the hopes of producing a sequel or to generate a franchise i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll. But what they successfully do is to supersummarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga making it extremely simplistic in poor lazyman standards in adaptation.For the uninitiated the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about like myself the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive only that they look more Caucasian and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to someone forgot to insist that in the contract? That's all you're gonna get. Period.As far as filmmaking and storytelling techniques go you can see clich after clich being thrown at you with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical knowitall like in Kung Pu Panda and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi Jamie Chung. Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo an instant shooin as one of the worst cinematic villains ever! and his temporary sidekick Mai Eriko Tamura who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship in the form of irritating techwizard Bulma Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon mercenary Yum Cha Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T and Chow YunFat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.Speaking of time or the lack thereof everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun OK so I made that up everything moves at so fast a pace that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One which was of course bland and bad opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slowmo technique and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action in the dark coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.And the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise they look really cheap and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well I may get flak from her fans and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow YunFat's star status could save this and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.This is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously despite having to see 6 halfballs contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters being continuously flashed on screen thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe where's that malfunction when you need one? Totally bland and really uninteresting I would suggest sticking to the manga instead.";

	schema:reviewBody "The entire assembly of the film crew and casting is WRONG excluding the catering and the grip and electric guys. Asia has the first priority to watch such a bad film done by JAMES WONG. Why is he still getting work from Hollywood anyway? The One was badly done and James is just the worse director ever I tell ya he is walking on thin ice in the film industry. He has absolutely no vision of this film. Who hired him anyway? This film is so amateur done that it looks like student film. I can't believe 20th Century Fox distribute a student film worldwide. Btw did they just put Stehpen Chow's name as the producer as a marketing strategy for Asia? The film ended with a hint of a sequel and if it does it will most likely end up reshooting the entire film remember of The Hulk. King Piccolo lacks of drive for him to destroy the world. Plot is flat character drives are lame. Dialogs are stereotype. Ben Ramsey did a poor job as a screenwriter he is lack of experience to write such an epic movie.Casting God damn it wrong cast dude! Carla Hool please go back home and do some home work first! Who hired the casting department? I recall the same casting director did the Forbidden Kingdom also cast this movie  Popping AuYeung. She sucks! Did such a bad job casting in Forbbiden Kingdom and in Dragon Ball. I wonder why is she still surviving in the industry at all. Jamie Chung tries too hard to be cute and she is ugly. Master Mutaito is a black guy? Emmy Rossum was great in The Day After Tomorrow but not in this movie. I can assure you that it's not really her fault James just doesn't know what he was doing. Eriko Tamura as Mai is just a redundant character the wardrobe department tries very hard to dress her up sexy while she is not. By the way her boobs didn't override her bad acting and ugliness. She must have missed Acting 101 class. Visual Effect At some point of the movie when Guko turns into a gorilla the visual effect was so poorly done that it looks some what like Rubber Chicken. Did they slip in few shots done by stop motion? The face of Gozoru looks like it was done in After Effects it doesn't look like 3D at all!! First scene of the film Goku was training with Gohan the matte painting of the house was so badly done that it looks 2D cardboard stand in the background. Blue  Green screen spill was all over color correction sucks. Visual effect was done much like fresh grad student level. Hollywood have done so much super hero movies in the recent years and I think the producers just hire the wrong bunch to do such a visual effects intensive film. I believe that Fox knew this film wouldn't go anywhere so they cut budget from hiring the good guys to work on this film!!!Art Design  Production Design My recommendation is to get Stephen Scott Simon Lamont and the bunch who did Hellboy to work on DragonBall. The original DragonBall story heavily involves with aliens and action and I believe that they are the right group of guys to do this film. Their creature designs and makeup fits in this category. Piccolo looks like alien from Mars one of those Mars Attack films from the 60s. Costumn in the entire film doesn't match the theme at all looks like they shop wardrobe from WalMart. The story will be more interesting if it were to take place more into the future like in the movie Minority Report. The location of Master Roshi's house is totally mismatch to the surrounding backdrop. The matte painting of the city lights and buildings doesn't fit into the picture at all. It is like cut and paste without considering the style time and place between Roshi's house and the city backdrop.Stunts  Action Choreography Poorly done dude! One of the marketing factor of Dragonball is the fighting style and its creative art of fighting sequence. Whatever James did it looks worse than Street Fighter done by Steven De Souza back in 1994. Yeah Van Damme could've star in this Dragonball movie. The ki effect is all over the placethe establish shots of the fight covered up by ki effect and I couldn't even locate the characters on the screen. They add to much vapor on the ki effect.Conclusion If you want to have endless conversation with your friends about how bad this film is then go watch it. I believe that Hollywood is running out of idea and beginning to tackle Asia stories. But studio got to have more faith in selling these stories with huge fans around the world Dragonball Akira and whatnot. If you cut back the budget it will end up with a disaster like what James Wong did with this movie! Consider Matrix Wachowski Bros did a total ripe off from a Japanese Animation Ghost in the Shell. Look what they can achieve with the budget they've got. Of course skills is also a factor and they have better vision than James as well.Please reshoot this FILM!!! I can assure you that all the fans worldwide is looking forward to a reshoot with different Above the Line and casts".

Who in the right mind would cast Chow Yun Fatt as Roshi and a Caucasian as Goku???? But in the end i gave it a chance and i told myself Hey let's have some campy fun and not try to think too much. As soon as the movie starts and the first line uttered by Gohan i wanted to leave the cinema hall. In fact after 15 minutes i wanted the movie to end!!! 90 minutes was just too long. I felt as though it was 3 hours.i'm not trying to be a hater but the problem is that this movie is just too fcked up. It looked like an amateur movie made by a new director. The dialogues were stupid the acting was horrendous and the plot was terrible. There was no character development at all and they try to make the fight scenes look cool with the slow motion but it's god damn lame. and the jokes fall flat. worse part was the way they try to work out a love story between Bulma and Yamcha within 15 minutes of knowing each other.The Kame Hame Ha scene turned into a cheesy high school love story. I was twitching the moment i heard the lines being uttered by Goku to Chi Chi while he was training his Kame Hame Ha. In fact i twitched every time a line is being uttered by the actors and actresses.The Climax was downright disappointing with the gigantic monkey you see in the comics look like a guy wearing a rubber gorilla suit. The special effects throughout the movie looked like as though it was from a cheap telemovie. and the Dragon at the end was so laughable that it looked like the Dragon from a rice advertisement in Malaysia.My final say don't watch this film ever! Not even on rental. not worth your time. If i was to give a rating i would give it a negative but IMDb doesn't allow me to do that.".

They should never have made it if it was going to be so lack lustred. It could have been done with a comedy element which would have saved it but no. They even try to throw in romance but you have only seen the characters for an hour so who cares. Why so many inconsistencies from the original anime series? For example Roshi does not live on an island. All these little details could have been included with another hour of film time. No one wants to watch an 88 minute film nowadays. Its just not value for money. Some may think that 1 out of 10 is harsh but when they made such a hash of what could have been another Transformers its all it deserves.".

It is a mockery. A sheer insult to all those whom cherish Dragonball deep within their hearts and souls.Why does this videotape recording I absolutely refuse to deem it 'film' status fail to such a devastating degree? It does not capture any of the charm wit excitement humor or badassery to be found in its source material. James Wong has simply taken the title characters and... errm hairstyles and has furtively stapled them to the bloody forehead of a poorly scripted heavily underdeveloped movie about collecting seven golden balls that when gathered will summon a flying dragon who will grant you one magical wish! How fantastically whimsical!Who cares.There is nothing compelling about this film. It's painstakingly difficult to care about any character in this film and that goes for Goku as well. Right from the getgo you bare witness to a horribly underwhelming fight session between Goku and his Asian? grandfather Gohan who carries a bizarrely flawless American accent.. go figure. The reason I imply confusion behind Gohan's Asian ethnicity is that his grandson Goku is well... nevermind. It isn't even worth getting into the casting for this movie made no sense. No consistency whatsoever. Disgusting.The dialogue is cheesy and executed improperly in every way conceivable. You want cheesy dialogue done right? Go watch the Wachowski brothers' Speed Racer released last year truly a masterpiece as far as anime adaptations are concerned. What is improper about it you inquire? It causes you to cringe without the ability to hold back. Every single word muttered is a bleak reflection on each actor's terrific inability to act in any way shape or form.Speaking of form.. Don't even expect half a thrill from this movie's excuse for action sequences. These actors cannot fight under any set of circumstances. The wirework is so blatant and poorly imposed that I swear to have caught eye of a couple unedited out wires left in some of the more acrobatic scenes.Really? Come on Hollywood. Come on Fox.These sort of mistakes became a thing of the past DECADES prior. If a movie based on the almighty Dragonball franchise is going to suck this severely OUTSIDE of the fight sequences at LEAST refine those few scenes Dragonball's saving graces so to speak into something worthy of admission price. Get a couple professional choreographers on the set to help out if you don't mind. what a strange and unusual concept huh!? I've said it before and I'll say it again if this entire project had been up to the legendary Stephen Chow we could have had a sheer masterpiece on our hands. refer to Kung Fu Hustle what I believe to be the most faithfully Dragonballesque live action movie ever made I shall continue no further. This movie does not deserve any longer of a review. In fact slice this eloquently written verdict in half and it would still be far too flattering in length.I feel that if FOX wishes to maintain any credibility they have left with their audiences they will hold back on dumping this atrocious landfill upon the United States' precious array of cinemas. Of course we know this is not realistic.It's nice to dream.".

Directed by James Wong the film was released a month early in Asia and even watching the leaked version is even a waste of time. I watched the leaked version and even then I wanted my money back.So pretty much we see Goku on his 18th birthday and he gets the dragonball. At school he fantasizes about Chi Chi eating strawberries in science class WTF??? opens every locker with his powers and a whole bunch of other crap. At Chi Chi's party he fights with these random guys and gets in when Piccolo who looks like a potato destroys Goku's house and kills his Grandfather and this leads Goku on some quest to get all 7 dragonballs.This movie is a pure suckfest from beginning to end. Watch as Goku fantasizes about Chi Chi eating strawberries! Gawk at the lame performances from such lame stars as Justin Chatwin who is ESPECIALLY bad ChowYun Fat and others! Laugh out loud at the bad dialog! Cringe at the cringeinducing special effects! Watch as the writers get characters wrong! Or don't. Just spare yourself really.Apparently the official American version has 22 extra minutes of footage. But at this point I don't care because this movie is already enough torture. What are the going to add? A BulmaGoku sex scene? A scene where Goku masturbates with that Chi Chi fantasy in his head? A scene where Piccolo turns into a woman and gives birth to a ninja turtle??? A whole subplot involving Piccolo and a sex change operation? With that said please don't watch this movie. If you have to so desperately watch it just watch the bootleg version.".

And whoever read it or perhaps watched the animated version or both perfectly well knows that Dragon Ball Dragon Ball Zand even GT which I personally don't consider as a DB franchise are all preaching the SAME messages from the day DB Manga came out till the end of the GT.

It still dares to bear that title and use those names while ultimately contradicting to DB and therefore ITS AN ULTIMATE INSULT FOR MANY OF US AND ITS DESTROYING AND RAPING OUR BELOVED DRAGON BALL! How is it so much destroying it? and how is it the absolute opposite of it? you might ask...though I really think its ultra obvious well here is howThat brilliant artstyle of Toryiama Akira automatically falls into water by the Live Action idea alonesorry to those who actually like the idea itself but I personally dislike it.Story messages and the overall point of DB not that its totally missed but its like I said  ALMOST LITERALLY OPPOSITE OF THE DB WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE! And here are only several examples from the trailers synopsis and leaked videos that I've seenread so farGoku does not remind by any possible aspect visualaudiopersonalitywise of Goku we all know and love...not by any possible law of physics nor any other law or logic. Goku I am not ready for this!?!?!?!?! Goku goes to high school!?!?!? Goku is stealing the girlfriend of some high school Carry Fuller guy... and vice versa...!?!??!?! Goku is wearing the trendy clothes instead of his martial arts GI'sThe first note stands for ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE! AS WELL AS THIS WHOLE MOVIE DOES NOT EVEN REMIND OF THE ORIGINAL DRAGON BALL! if you exclude the title names and Dragon Balls.Now if you have a healthy logic you will understand why we feel that much insulted by this atrocity.Therefore IN MY OPINION if you fallow the simple logic its obvious and clear as a day that ANYONE who supports this AWFUL DISGRACEFUL AND BLASPHEMOUS PIECE OF EXPLOITATION AND CHILDHOOD RAPE is automatically NOT a DB fan AT ALL to me. You can try to prove your fandom with your action figures wallpapers and all the materialistic stuff but I don't care! that is NOT the measurement of fandom to me but WHAT IT IS a perfect filter of fandom to me is a state towards something that RAPES the DBTHIS MOVIE and IF YOU FAIL AT IT nothing else matters to me! that's all I need thats a perfect proof that you never was a DB fan in the first place or you WAS but somehow this materialistic world of today spoiled you and eat your brainwhich AGAIN contradicts to what DB preaches!.Therefore we even formed the protest site and petition and are currently focused on stopping the sequels and ANY FURTHER FRANCHISE based on this AWFUL ABOMINATION!Thank you very much for reading! and I hope that in the end all the pure and brave efforts will not go in vain and will pay off somehow and someday just as every evil deed will have its price!  that's what DB learned us through all these years anyways! haha!

You can try to prove your fandom with your action figures wallpapers and all the materialistic stuff but I don't care! that is NOT the measurement of fandom to me but WHAT IT IS a perfect filter of fandom to me is a state towards something that RAPES the DBTHIS MOVIE and IF YOU FAIL AT IT nothing else matters to me! that's all I need thats a perfect proof that you never was a DB fan in the first place or you WAS but somehow this materialistic world of today spoiled you and eat your brainwhich AGAIN contradicts to what DB preaches!.Therefore we even formed the protest site and petition and are currently focused on stopping the sequels and ANY FURTHER FRANCHISE based on this AWFUL ABOMINATION!Thank you very much for reading! and I hope that in the end all the pure and brave efforts will not go in vain and will pay off somehow and someday just as every evil deed will have its price!  that's what DB learned us through all these years anyways! haha! DKami bless ya! P";

	schema:headline " 10 Reasons Why you shouldn't watch this movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not bad it's awful. The acting is mediocre at best. The direction is bad the special effects are not very good. You would think that a movie with a big budget would have at least have good special effects but alas this is not the case. The thing that really bothers me is that this movie had some potential but unfortunately the bad casting the overall plot the dialogue and the acting just weren't there. Here's ten reasons why you shouldn't watch this movie 1. Bad casting  I don't know who thought it was a good idea casting Justin Chatwin as Goku or Emmy Rossum as Bulma. I think Emmy is a great actress but she is definitely not the right choice to play Bulma.2. Dubious setting  Where does this story take place. It's like some urbandesert place. The setting is way off and they never do tell you where the story is taking place.3. Bad acting  I have nothing against Justin Chatwin but it wasn't even like he was trying to act. The only one that I think did a tolerable job was James Masters and even he wasn't performing to the best of his abilities.4. BAD special effects  Okay the special effects in this flick where laughable and completely not believable. I dare anyone to keep a straight face when Goku transforms into Oozaru. There were people giggling behind me giggling...Need I say more.5. It's PG  Now there is nothing wrong with PG movies but when the original material is violent outrageous and bloody there's definitely something wrong. They took everything that was cool about Dragonball and erased it. They tried to make the movie so family friendly that it lost everything that made it Dragonball.6. Bad adaptation  They got the casting wrong the characters are all wrong the actors don't act like their counterparts. The costumes are wrong. Where's Bulma's blue hair? Where's Yamcha's scar? Nowhere near this movie that's where.7. The direction is all wrong  Did anyone really think that James Wong was ready to undertake a project this big? Now I'm not dissing James Wong as a director I'm just saying that clearly he wasn't ready to direct and helm a big budget blockbuster.8. Godawful script  A script determines whether a movie is gonna be gold or whether is gonna be trash. The dialogue is gag worthy it's cheesy stereotypical and downright lame. Some of the films important plot elements aren't fully explained and the storyline is all over the place.9. Score  The score is actually tolerable but it just doesn't fit the storyline or the mood of the characters.10. Too short  I found the film's length to be too short. Why because there's too much information being cramped in. It's only 84 minutes long which is not good for a film with so much complex story plot points. The film's length might be why it falls short.I can only conclude that this film is not worth spending ten dollars. If you're still curious go ahead watch it but know that not only are you wasting money but valuable time as well.".

	schema:headline " World War II from the European View";
	schema:reviewBody "Writer and Director John Duigan has added to his cinematic stature with this recent film about the interrelated responses of three countries  England France Spain  to the early phases of WW II and in doing so gives some inadvertent insight into how the continent was so endangered by the little known bad boy Hitler in the years leading up to the horror of a second World War.The title seems very appropriate  taken from the quip of 'Head in the clouds Feet on the ground'  as the lead character Gilda a radiantly beautiful Charlize Theron seems to float above all of the reality of warring struggles in 1933 focusing her life on paramours expensive clothes and 'dangerous liaisons' with a varied assortment of men all the while keeping a firm stance on needs of her strangely disjointed life. Indeed the opening of the film finds Gilda in need of shelter from a night's fling with a Cambridge lover and she knocks on the door of a poor struggling Irish student Guy Stuart Townsend thus beginning a lasting affair that coasts through the entire story.Guy eventually follows Gilda to Paris where she is a popular photographer living with her gallerist but also living with her lesbian lover Mia Penelope Cruz. Gilda Guy and Mia become a triptych and it is only the impact of the rise of fascism in Spain Mia's home that separates the mnage a trois idealistic Guy and compassionate Mia are off to fight Franco while Gilda is left behind to admit to the encroaching threat of Nazis in France and enter into her own version of involvement.How these three weather the war and resolve their varied degrees of complicity provides the film's finale. The cast is strong the settings are gorgeous in all three countries as captured by cinematographer Paul Sarossy and the musical score by Terry Frewer introduces a potential talent for film composition while borrowing heavily from French cabaret songs symphonic music by Edward Elgar and pieces of Francis Poulenc. But the overall reason for enjoying this rather long film is the interplay of Theron Townsend and Cruz in a variety of richly sensuous vignettes. Well worth watching. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "Writer and Director John Duigan has added to his cinematic stature with this recent film about the interrelated responses of three countries  England France Spain  to the early phases of WW II and in doing so gives some inadvertent insight into how the continent was so endangered by the little known bad boy Hitler in the years leading up to the horror of a second World War.The title seems very appropriate  taken from the quip of 'Head in the clouds Feet on the ground'  as the lead character Gilda a radiantly beautiful Charlize Theron seems to float above all of the reality of warring struggles in 1933 focusing her life on paramours expensive clothes and 'dangerous liaisons' with a varied assortment of men all the while keeping a firm stance on needs of her strangely disjointed life. Indeed the opening of the film finds Gilda in need of shelter from a night's fling with a Cambridge lover and she knocks on the door of a poor struggling Irish student Guy Stuart Townsend thus beginning a lasting affair that coasts through the entire story.Guy eventually follows Gilda to Paris where she is a popular photographer living with her gallerist but also living with her lesbian lover Mia Penelope Cruz. Gilda Guy and Mia become a triptych and it is only the impact of the rise of fascism in Spain Mia's home that separates the mnage a trois idealistic Guy and compassionate Mia are off to fight Franco while Gilda is left behind to admit to the encroaching threat of Nazis in France and enter into her own version of involvement.How these three weather the war and resolve their varied degrees of complicity provides the film's finale. The cast is strong the settings are gorgeous in all three countries as captured by cinematographer Paul Sarossy and the musical score by Terry Frewer introduces a potential talent for film composition while borrowing heavily from French cabaret songs symphonic music by Edward Elgar and pieces of Francis Poulenc. But the overall reason for enjoying this rather long film is the interplay of Theron Townsend and Cruz in a variety of richly sensuous vignettes. Well worth watching. Grady Harp";

	schema:reviewBody "Given the wonderful quality of Head In The Clouds I don't know how I never heard of it until I stumbled over it on the Netflix web page and decided to rent it.This is a major movie. It is an emotionally powerful movie. It has a huge scope both in time and space historical accuracy an excellent and at times complex script outstanding performances by all concerned great direction and superb cinematography. I loved it and I cried at the end.Charlize Theron was fantastic as Gilda. I have known people such as the character she played and she had it just right. With her body language she told us she was rich talented cynical very loyal to her real friends and in the end so very brave. Her voice is such that sometimes I think she is channeling Theresa Russell.Stuart Townsend played his part of a quiet underclass Belfast Irishman Guy perfectly. Some reviewers were disappointed that his performance wasn't stronger. Hey Rambo wouldn't have survived long as a British operative in Nazi occupied Paris. Townsend triumphs in subtlety and his character narrates some of the story.Penelope Cruz was perfect as Mia who had been physically injured by Fascists in Spain when they came to take her brother away presumably to be executed given that the time immediately preceded the Spanish Civil War of the 1930's.Thomas Kretschmann is brilliant as Frans Bietrich the personification of Nazi evil educated urbane thoughtful and completely ruthless when torturing and murdering.The repartee among the three friends Gilda Mia and Guy during the prewar period is very realistic. I've participated in similar conversations. There are several back referencing jokes. You have to pay attention. In addition we see the best presentation of a three way sexual relationship I've ever seen on film. These three people love each other and this is beautifully communicated.World War II was a cataclysm that shook the world. The free peoples were fighting for the life of their civilizations against what was one of the most evil regimes to ever exist through all of history the German Third Reich. The story starts well before WWII and we are shown the good life of a wealthy young woman and her friends in Paris. We are then taken to the Spanish Civil War and on into WWII. The things portrayed in this movie HAPPENED although maybe not exactly as in the story shown however similar things are well documented as occurring during WWII. If one doesn't have much knowledge of the history of that period the story may seem far fetched. It isn't. For all I know the story is factual even though there is the usual statement at the end about it all being fiction.More about Kretschmann Toward the end of the movie there is a scene in which his character is supervising the torture of a young woman member of the French Resistance. The torturers are using the near drowning method waterboarding is what the CIA calls it today. He is seated with his back to his underlings and gives the order to immerse her then plays with a loose thread on his shirt cuff while timing the immersion. He fiddles with his cuff links. He is clearly bored. Just another day at the office. When he decides she isn't going to talk he gives the order to put her under and and never orders her to be raised. I have heard it phrased The banality of evil. Kretschmann and Duigan bring it off to perfection.This is a must see movie. It will stick with you. Parts of it will come back to haunt you for at least several days. As I said before this is powerful stuff.".

Duigan wrote a heroin who was assertive headstrong and outspoken.

Yet when a few brief words informing the French patriots of her position as a British spy and providing them with the sources necessary to confirm that information would have saved her life the screenwriter would have us believe she sat mute and accepted the coup de gras silently.

It wanted to be epic it wanted to be about friends and it wanted to be an antiwar movie and on top of that it wanted to be about WWII and the underground work. I wanted to like this movie and while it's not impossible to watch it is slow and plodding some times. This is a movie that really could have hit the audience hard but it just kind of laid there instead.We go through a long long development of the relationship between the two main characters Charlize Theron and Stuart Townsend. This could have been story enough but no we have to follow them over a 10 or 15 year period and go all the way through WWII. Early on we are introduced to Penelope Cruz who is a good friend to Theron's character. And from this we kind of slip into a pseudothreeway that never fully develops. Then there is the Spanish Civil War that Cruz's character feels she must partake in as well as Townsend. Again this could have been an interesting story all on its own. Finally we get into WWII and it drags on and on and I started to lose interest in the characters and the story. It's all just too much of a BIG story and at the same time not enough of a story to really hold our interest. The actors were okay though sometimes I felt like Theron was just reading her lines. Townsend for the most part fits the role but other times he comes across as too modern for the time period. There are a few twists and turns here that keep the viewer interested but overall its not as good as it could have been. A shorter version about one of the many story lines could make this a really really good film.".

This is an Unusual high rank by my standards yet I do think this one deserves it.A movie that portrays the life of 2 young people and a lot of others surrounding them. World war 2 is coming at the start and ends with the movie. A romantic setting. This movie is classified as Drama Romance War and it really had me scared when I put it on. I'm not the type for those things apart let alone compressed together in about two hours.I was surprised. Very pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be a thrilling life story filled with Eros I should have known when I saw the R rating.. and adventure. It didn't fall into the usual overly sweet scenes that leave you with a sugar mouth no water can ever remedy. Instead it kept up a flirtatious pace all along with dramatic events to eventually come to the bittersweet picture this turned out to be. Another part I cant deny loving was the end. I wont say anything more about it but it was a good end to the movie. And I'll leave it at that I never realized that Charlize Theron was that attractive and the team with Penelope Cruz forgive me any mistakes in spelling or names was a match made in heaven. No complaints about Stuart Townsend either. ... This is beginning to sound a bit too positive but .. Yeah well I'm not going to look for negative stuff just to have it in.In the end this movie left me with a feeling I like. Not the typical heartbleed I get from those Sugarbom Romantic flicks and not the sad feeling a drama usually burdens me with either. A pleasant feeling. pleasant doesn't mean happy mind you It has me missing my girlfriend although she s only gone for the day. And gives me an ever stronger feeling that I love her than I usually have. This movie really did give me a Pleasant feeling!  maybe bittersweet is the exact description for it.Anyhow i'm really glad I saw this one and it deserves a Nine. well in my humble opinion it does ".

The film follows the ebb and flow of the trio's relationships from their good times before the Spanish civil war through their bad times during WWII.

Maylon follows her to 1930s Paris where she is a professional photographer and where she lives with a Spanishborn nurse named Mia Penlope Cruz. Maylon and Bess cohabitate and work together. Inflamed by the injustice of the fascist Falange in the Spanish War Mia and Maylon leave Paris to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Maylon eventually returns to Paris he later fights in World War II and he constantly longs for Bess.Somewhere someone commented that this film could have had the tagline How world events can mess with your love life. That pretty much sums it up. Maylon wants to be with Bess but the great struggle against fascism keeps derailing their relationship. Frankly the script is ridiculous. In fact the whole storyline is completely overdone and melodramatic. It seems very contrived. It is as if the screenwriter wanted to tell an epic dramatic love story against the political events of Europe 19341944 but this film doesn't have the heft. It's no Dr. Zhivago. Additionally the acting is fairly awful and overdramatic. I can't believe that two Oscarworthy actresses needed to act in a movie as absurd as this one. There is nothing subtle about the script that would befit their great acting talents. After seeing this film on cable television I was so disappointed that I was moved to write the foregoing comment. I would recommend avoiding this film.".

It all started in 1933 in Cambridge University where they met each other for the first time. Though they were together just for one night. But it was kind of love at first sight and along the movie they will be together and separated for many times. It's their destiny However to their love one more soul will be joined. Her name is Mia Penelope Cruz. For a part of the movie they will be a love triangle but then the war separated themYou need to have some acknowledgment about the European's history of the 30's and 40's and about the wars of that period to understand the movie's pace and the plot's background. You need that to follow this movie and understand its settings and the behaviors of the mains characters. Just understanding the ideals which are related to the social conflicts and wars of that period we can follow their actions and attitudes and also the betrayalsThe pace is a bit confusing because the story passes between 1933 and 1944 and along this period of time we watch several scenes in different times and places. The plot is always jumping in time and space It turns out a bit confusing because if we watch one 5 minutes' scene in 1933 then suddenly it quickly moves to one year later. Then we watch one more couples of scenes in 1936 and it quickly moves to 1940 for example. The same happens with the settings. If one scene is in England sooner the other will be in Paris The costumes and the scenario's production are excellent which makes this movie a good one if we relate it to the history's genre. However the plot disappointed me a little bit not only because it's a bit confusing but especially because it was too different from what I expected. I think I was expecting a different and also deeper love triangle story. Something more intense about the three characters and not that this love triangle was just a part of the storymovie as it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has wonderful possibility but never transfers the scope romance and moral depth the writers and producers so clearly believe it has to the audience. Although it spans more than a decade the film shows us no metamorphosis in the characters even Theron's Gilda is still the same hedonist Townsend's Guy remains a lovestruck quiet and principled student and Mia  well her fate arrives halfway through the film so such an assertion may be cheating  but she's still the foil for both of them and yet such a straightforward mixture of both characters. Despite the occasionally wooden acting mostly gratuitous sex and clichd plot twists this lack of character is precisely what makes the film selfdefeating. There are some lovely touches the inclusion of the Spanish civil war in the plot when to modern audiences it is overshadowed by WWII the treatment of Gilda by the ordinary French civilians and particularly the ending but the dialogue and the actions of Gilda and occasionally Guy just subvert every positive. This is especially prevalent as the overlong film draws to a close. I note that several previous reviews mention the ending it is obvious that the writers wanted to show the darker side of the liberation and how this turned those who actively hated the occupation against almost everyone else but the mechanism of having Gilda  a Resistance agent well known to SISMI5  executed doesn't work  it's one coincidence too many. The final problem with the film turns out to be its one redeeming feature Thomas Kretschmann. He quietly munches up all available scenery as the saying goes in every second he's even slightly in view of the camera. This wonderfully understated acting see other reviews for details as well as the most interesting and complex character by far simply outshines the leads. It made me highly frustrated that Gilda didn't just ignore the drippy idealist and run off to Germany with the HauptsturmfuhrerMajor. That refusal really underscores that she doesn't change at all patriotism is fun and exciting only when she is in minimal danger ultimately just another rush in her Epicurean life. In summary just fastforward until Guy arrives in Paris. The director finally wakes up and uses clever camerawork and morethandecent actors. Hopefully you will too.".

And I also can enjoy movies that may fail at being superb but are so big on atmosphere that they become sort of guilty pleasures. ExampleOriginal Sin which I just watched for the second time the same day I saw this for the first time. But Head in the clouds lacked a lot. Besides the things mentioned it really wasn't very enjoyable either. It was sort of like watching a movie that had all the right ingredients but I don't know it just did not hook me in.There were so many short quick scenes so many over the top happenings so much that didn't make senselike the endingwhy DIDN'T she just explain who she really was?. And just like some movies try so hard for laughs if their comedies this one was trying so so hard for the audience to believe in Theron and Townsend's characters so that it could be this tragic love story. The tragic ending seemed completely unnecessary.It seemed almost everythingthe sex the romance etcwas there for effect. Then again I am not a big fan of war movies so all the violence started getting to me too. However I WILL say that the movie's biggest positive was it's ability to show the brutality of war. I am giving it a rating of 5 for that alone because that was done well.Maybe if the movie had just been a war movie or just been a romance or just been a movie about friendships it would have been better. The acting was great I think and I will comment on Townsend who I thought was very very good and interestingly I thought both Theron and Townsend both had more chemistry with Penelope Cruz then with each other. And speaking of Cruzthis was the best I have ever seen her.I could see why some people would like this but I didn't really care for this. My vote's 5 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "After all these years I remember the hubbub when this was released in '66 I was thrilled to finally see DEAR JOHN a great Swedish film which proved to be the date movie of its day here in America. And I also discovered why it has fallen into obscurity.Writerdirector LarsMagnus Lindgren a very talented  versatile filmmaker brought impressive technique to telling a simple tale of a wanderlust sailor and a singleparent waitress who fall in love. Nowadays there would have to be a hook some fantastic or deus ex machina gimmickry to keep the audience's attention as in the string of dreadful Nicholas Sparks soggyromance adaptations including coincidentally a new film called DEAR JOHN.But Lindgren wisely keeps it simple natural believable and moving his only trick being a very complicated time structure of flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks. There's method in this approach as the film's final two twists take on a depth thanks to the careful foreshadowing playing off and around the film's title implication of a farewell note.Casting is in no small measure the secret of Lindgren's success here. Jarl Kulle is the 30something hero quite different from his archly played Bergman roles of the period like THE DEVIL'S EYE and ALL THESE WOMEN. Because they're Bergman works though among his least favored I used to see them all the time but DEAR JOHN remained elusive all these years.Kulle's sailor has a Billy Budd hairstyle which immediately gives Kulle the necessary youthful appearance. He seems selfcentered and one of the guys for the early part of the film leading the audience to believe he's only out for a sexual conquest to tell all his pals about. This adds wonderful panache when the tables seem to be turned in later reels all leading to an evenhanded and satisfying romantic conclusion.As the leading lady we don't have a blonde bombshell but instead the very ordinary but lovely Christina Schollin who reminded me strongly of America's Mary Stuart Masterson they even have the same toothy smile.

	onyx:emotionText "After all these years I remember the hubbub when this was released in '66 I was thrilled to finally see DEAR JOHN a great Swedish film which proved to be the date movie of its day here in America. And I also discovered why it has fallen into obscurity.Writerdirector LarsMagnus Lindgren a very talented  versatile filmmaker brought impressive technique to telling a simple tale of a wanderlust sailor and a singleparent waitress who fall in love. Nowadays there would have to be a hook some fantastic or deus ex machina gimmickry to keep the audience's attention as in the string of dreadful Nicholas Sparks soggyromance adaptations including coincidentally a new film called DEAR JOHN.But Lindgren wisely keeps it simple natural believable and moving his only trick being a very complicated time structure of flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks. There's method in this approach as the film's final two twists take on a depth thanks to the careful foreshadowing playing off and around the film's title implication of a farewell note.Casting is in no small measure the secret of Lindgren's success here. Jarl Kulle is the 30something hero quite different from his archly played Bergman roles of the period like THE DEVIL'S EYE and ALL THESE WOMEN. Because they're Bergman works though among his least favored I used to see them all the time but DEAR JOHN remained elusive all these years.Kulle's sailor has a Billy Budd hairstyle which immediately gives Kulle the necessary youthful appearance. He seems selfcentered and one of the guys for the early part of the film leading the audience to believe he's only out for a sexual conquest to tell all his pals about. This adds wonderful panache when the tables seem to be turned in later reels all leading to an evenhanded and satisfying romantic conclusion.As the leading lady we don't have a blonde bombshell but instead the very ordinary but lovely Christina Schollin who reminded me strongly of America's Mary Stuart Masterson they even have the same toothy smile.

	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while a film comes down the pike that is so refreshing so rich you'd swear it was inspired by some immortal spirit who condescended to take human form in order to share her perspective with us.  Smoke is one such film.Although there's nothing particularly special about each of several main characters seemingly picked at random off of a New York street corner they come off as noble even heroic in spite of the fact that their collective problems amount to nothing more than the usual garden variety.  The main character for example Auggie Wren played by Harvey Keitel is a tobacconist around whose shop the main characters revolve.  He has an unusual habit  every morning at the same time of the day he photographs the same street corner and puts the pictures together in a series of albums.  It's timelapse photography on an enormous scale.  He can't explain why he does it.  He just needs to do it.  And it's a really marvelous device for delivering the movie's main theme  everything that matters all the meaning in the world that can be condensed from holy books and vows and catechisms and poems is right there before us.

There's a great line in the movie about how Sir Walter Raleigh measured the weight of smoke.  He took a cigar weighed it smoked it and weighed the ash.  The difference between the cigar and the ash was the weight of the smoke.  Although he new nothing of the chemistry of combustion he did the best that he could based upon what he knew.  Likewise Smoke is a movie about people with limited knowledge and perspective.  Their assumptions are often wrong  but they do the best that they can.

	onyx:emotionText "Every once in a while a film comes down the pike that is so refreshing so rich you'd swear it was inspired by some immortal spirit who condescended to take human form in order to share her perspective with us.  Smoke is one such film.Although there's nothing particularly special about each of several main characters seemingly picked at random off of a New York street corner they come off as noble even heroic in spite of the fact that their collective problems amount to nothing more than the usual garden variety.  The main character for example Auggie Wren played by Harvey Keitel is a tobacconist around whose shop the main characters revolve.  He has an unusual habit  every morning at the same time of the day he photographs the same street corner and puts the pictures together in a series of albums.  It's timelapse photography on an enormous scale.  He can't explain why he does it.  He just needs to do it.  And it's a really marvelous device for delivering the movie's main theme  everything that matters all the meaning in the world that can be condensed from holy books and vows and catechisms and poems is right there before us.  We just need to have the eyes to see it.  The things we tend to dismiss as prosaic out of familiarity emerge from the pages of his album as special wonderful enchanted.

Its one of those rare movies that it has to be felt. If you dont feel it then you are missing the whole point. SMOKE is one of those rare movies which we dont know how to recommend this to our friends because its so original and simple that there is nothing to describe. Anything we might say it only will give the illusion this is an shallow or boring movie. SMOKE is not an adventure not a drama not a comedy not a cops movie not an action movie so what its about ?!! Its about life. But in a real way and surprisingly not boring.This movie is very similar to Luc Bessons  Le Gran Bleu The Big Blue. The story it has nothing to do with it but its a movie to also be felt.This is an actors movie and they all do an incredible job. Sometimes they make us want to go to New York and go talk with them. Then we remember that they are not real and we wished they were. Harvey Keitel and William Hurt are perfect in their characters and its a joy to watch them act. The movie could be only both of them talking to to each other that it would still be a great and not boring movie.This is a very well writen acted and directed script and we dont find many of this everyday. And it has a fantastic soundtrack also that fits perfectly in the story. The final scenes with a Tom Waits song are realy poetic. The music almost becomes a character in the movie.Beautiful beautiful movie. Unmissable !By the way if you can watch the sequel also because its as good as the original. Its called Blue in the face. Dont miss it.SMOKE is a magnificent movie.".

The strength of the movie lies in the relationship between two characters the novelist Paul Benjamin and the owner of the smoke shop Auggie Wren. While it appears that they have had a superficial relationship for some time the relationship deepens when Auggie shows Paul his photograph collection. The culmination is the conversation they have over lunch when Auggie tells Paul his Christmas story. This is a movie with interesting subplots as well and superb acting. I particularly like the song which plays at the end  it's a moving tune which perfectly fits the mood of the story.".

When bad weather forces the plane to head back to New York the sleepy princess is left in the care of pilot Edward O'Rourke who takes her to his apartment to spend the night. When she comes to the next day she finds a note left by O'Rourke asking her to meet him after work. The princess decides to find out what she's been missing and sneaks off to him. To keep her identity a secret she tells O'Rourke that she's a poor waif sent from Europe to work as a maid in San Francisco.

Most of the royalty in exile settled in the United Kingdom during war time but some actually did make it here. In fact Olivia's father the king is in London as the story goes.And this is a Cinderella story in reverse with the boy from Brooklyn meeting wooing and winning a princess. Cummings is an airline pilot scheduled to go in the Army Air Corps who meets princess DeHavilland on a flight that gets canceled back to New York. A slight overdose of sleeping pills leaves her in his unwanted hands. The unwanted part changes soon enough as it does in all films of this type.The ironic thing is while some royalty did make it back to their countries a lot were dispossessed permanently by those other totalitarian occupiers from the East after World War II. They didn't exactly live in the diminished circumstances that Olivia was heading for. Some of Charles Coburn's concerns as her uncle are quite real.Princess O'Rourke is a charming comedy though dated by its topical wartime references.

And I guess I can even respect propaganda when it's done with panache and sincerity.Norman Krasna's screenplay is the real star. Watching the film I was constantly amazed at how the dialog sparkled how the situations never worked out in quite the way I expected how the characters always seemed just a little warmer and more human than they might have in many similar films of this era.The cast is excellent as well consisting entirely of Hollywood stalwarts every one of them at their most endearing. Jack Carson Charles Coburn and Jane Wyman are all great of course. But Olivia De Havilland is also perfectly cast lovable on one hand regal on the other... yet without that slightly simpering quality that made her less likable in say The Adventures of Robin Hood or Gone With the Wind. Robert Cummings was a fine comedic actor who is not wellremembered today perhaps because he was less multidimensional than someone like James Stewart but he's used to excellent advantage here. He's not just portraying the perfect everyman Yank he IS that perhaps mythical person the Guy From Brooklyn. And yes the perfect wartime Yank who's just got to join up and be in the biggest fight of all time and the most important. Just as Bogart had to go be a hero at the end of Casablanca. These wartime films earn much of their charm by being unashamedly part of their times.But ultimately it's the little touches that raise this film far above the ordinary. The extended gag with the multiple sleeping pills the silly little bits with the president's dog... These don't distract from the warmth of the film they add to it.Perhaps we undervalue a film like Princess O'Rourke simply because the material and the style are so familiar. We need to step back and admire the Hollywood dreamfactory at its finest working to a certain format yet also bringing together the talented individuals who could make that format sing.I'll take a wonderfullyexecuted formula film like Princess O'Rourke any day over selfconsciously brilliant films that forget the basics of how to entertain.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is after all 1943 so you've got to expect a little propaganda from a film even if it is a comedy called Princess O'Rourke starring Olivia de Havilland Robert Cummings Jack Carson and Jane Wyman. DeHavilland is a princess visiting in New York en route by plane to San Francisco to escape from boredom. Before she leaves she gets a sleeping pill from her uncle's secretary Gladys Cooper but when it doesn't work immediately she gets another one from the flight attendant one from the copilot Jack Carson and finally two from the pilot Eddie Robert Cummings. Then she can sleep. Unfortunately the plane has to turn around and return to New York and the princess can't be awakened. Eddie takes her to his place to sleep it off  all very chaste of course  and the two fall in love.Olivia de Havilland is very beautiful and was one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Alas she didn't always get a chance to show it. But she is certainly lovely as a young woman torn between loyalty and love. Her sleeping pill scene and the scene where her uncle discusses a possible American suitor with her are wonderful and demonstrate her impeccable timing. Jack Carson and Jane Wyman are delightful as Eddie's friends and Cummings gives an energetic performance as Eddie. In the film Eddie's birth date is given as 1914 Cummings was actually born in 1908 and was around 33 when the movie was made though released in 1943 the film was made over a year earlier. He retained his youthful appearance well past the 1950s during which time he played a swinging bachelor in his television series. Charles Coburn provides excellent support and Gladys Cooper is totally wasted in a role that she must have been assigned for some contractual reason.Princess O'Rourke enters the realm of whimsy when the President and his little dog Fala as Roosevelt referred to his buddy take a hand in the romance. The dog playing Fala is excellent! One interesting bit of trivia It's rare to see a film released 63 years ago in which two of the stars are still alive in fact it's rare to see a film released 63 years ago in which even one star is alive but at this writing both de Havilland and Wyman are still with us. So is Princess O'Rourke. It's light and enjoyable.".

Yet there is something believable about this hokum because the film possesses a calmness and dignity in large part due to the presence of Miss de Havilland. Robert Cummings as the leading man is both romantic and comic while Charles Coburn and Jane Wyman deliver strong supporting performances. The film's strongest asset though is the writing. The basic premise seems to cover all sorts of angles and suggests that love and politics intersect but do not necessarily mix.

	schema:reviewBody "I almost gave this film a 7 since despite the film's many deficiencies it is so much fun. My advice is try to look past the silly excesses and improbabilities and you'll find a film that is both charming and a modern fairy tale.Olivia De Havilland plays a princess staying in America during WWII. It seems that her own country was overrun by the Nazis and she is waiting out the war in the US. While I am a HUGE HUGE fan of Miss De Havilland I must say that her part in the film wasn't all that compellingshe played an overly stiff character. However this was made up for by the bubbly performances of Jane Wyman Jack Carson Charles Coburn and especially Bob Cummings.Olivia is constantly watched by her uncle as well as keepers from the State Department and she has many official duties that seem to bore her. As a result of a desire to see Americans as they really are she leaves her hotel and eventually bumps into Wyman Carson and Cummings. They mistake her for a penniless refugee and take her under their wing. While it is pretty predictable she and Cummings fall in love and decide to marryeven though Cummings has no idea she is a rich princess. When he does find out you'd think the movie was about finished but this isn't the case. There's still about 20 to 30 minutes left in the film. Despite my assuming her uncle Coburn would be against the marriage he is thrilledespecially since Cummings' family seems chock full of boys and fertility doesn't seem to be a problem! But other problems do develop and are eventually worked out thanks to the help of FDR and his dog Fala! Yes I am NOT kidding!! An adorable Scottie plays Fala the world famous dog of President Roosevelt and while this is almost embarrassingly ridiculous it's also pretty cute. My advice is to watch this film but just tun off your brain during the final portion of the filmit's so unbelievable and schmaltzy that your head will explode unless you can force yourself to cope with this!".

In Western Europe most of the monarchs fled the onslaught of the Nazi Blitzkrieg the most notable exceptions being the rulers of Denmark and Belgium. But it is instructive to remember what happened to them. The King of Denmarck remained defiant of the Nazis if basically powerless and even to his immortal glory purposely wore a Jewish star on his royal tunic when the Nazis began imposing their antiSemitic policies on the Danish Jewish population. On the other hand King Leopold III of Belgium did not show a finer spirit though he always insisted he did the right thing. Leopold willingly surrendered to the Germans and cooperated with them. His reason for this was to protect his people. This of course did not include the Jewish population in Belgium. After the war the Allies were not very happy with Leopold as they were with the Danish King. Neither were the Belgians most of whom compared Leopold's cowardice their view with his father Albert's heroic defense of Belgium in World War I that made King Albert one of the great heroes of his time. In 1951 Leopold had to abdicate in favor of his son Bauduin I. Leopold died in 1973 never recovering any popularity with his people.Eastern Europe was similar some monarchs proving heroic even to the point of death. King Boris of Bulgaria had to make a devil's pact with the Nazis in the face of Soviet aggression. But he refused to agree with the transportation of Jews Bulgaria's population agreed with Boris  90 percent of the Jewish population of Bulgaria survived World War II the highest in all Europe among occupied countries. In 1943 he again refused and died in some sudden unexpected way while flying home from a meeting with Hitler. To this day poison or some other odd murder devise depressurizing the cabin of Boris's plane has been suggested may have killed him. The nation threw out the Coburg family as royal family when the Russians set up their puppet Communist regime. But when the Communists were finally overturned the Coburgs were welcomed back. The monarchy wasn't restored but the current head of the house was elected Prime Minister for awhile.Most of those monarchs who fled settled in England or the U.S. or Canada for the duration. The only one who was able to return to his throne during the war was Haile Selassie of Ethiopia as the British kicked the Italians out of that country. After the war the luckiest of the monarchs was Hirohito of Japan. Although there is still controversy about how deeply involved in the aggressions of the 1930s and 1940s he was the title of one study THE IMPERIAL CONSPIRACY tells that suspicion he was smart enough to know when to throw in the towel in the face of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was able to show to General Douglas MacArthur that he could be a damned good constitutional monarch. That's why Japan still has a royal family.Only a handful of movies deal with the flight of the royals to Allied but nonCommunist lands. The most notable ones are WHERE'S THERE HOPE wherein Bob Hope is an unknown heir to a Balkan throne who has to be protected by Signe Hasso and this film PRINCESS O'ROURKE. Written by Norman Krasna the screenplay won him an Oscar it tells of how one of the heirs to the throne of an invaded kingdom Olivia De Haviland is mistaken for a maid by an American Air Force pilot Bob Cummings and how he and she slowly fall in love. The comedy works here as the story is built to show the socalled superiority of the equality of Americans at least Caucasian Christian Americans over old world aristocrats and outofdate monarchies. There are some lovely bits in it. Charles Coburn plays De Haviland's uncle a crusty old snob. But while initially opposed to the union he begins changing his mind when he realizes that Cummings comes from a family of breeders he has five brothers and his father had seven or some such set of numbers. Smiling and acting like he is considering purchasing a brood mare for breeding purposes he keeps repeating those figures like they are a mantra. It is only when Cummings refuses the idea of his kids losing their American character and citizenship that Coburn's harsher snobbery returns.The film is famous also for the appearance in his only movie role of F.D.R.'s little dog Fala as himself. The final sequences in the film were filmed at the White House actually quite an achievement for any studio in wartime. The best moment is at the end when Cummings upon leaving with his bride after a secret White House marriage tips an aide watching at the door. We never see the face of the aide in question but I imagine afterward he roared with laughter while having a cigarette and possibly one of his own martinis.".

The usual Warner stalwarts in Jack Carson and Jane Wyman had familiar roles which I am sure they could have played with their eyes shut but it was so disappointing to see that wonderful actress Gladys Cooper in a five minute role as a secretary and insulting to someone of her class. Charles Coburn was a good foil for the comings and goings of the lead characters. Somehow one gets the feeling that this film and a few others like it would have been the reasons for Miss de Havilland going on suspension so often at Warner Brothers.".

	schema:headline " War time comedy on the American home front";
	schema:reviewBody "Two buddies are making their last runs as commercial pilots before going into the Army Air Corps in this 1943 comedy romance. Robert Cummings plays Eddie O'Rourke and Jack Carson plays Dave Campbell. But Eddie's future is drastically altered when a woman passenger Mary Williams boards their plane heading for California. She is Princess Maria from some undisclosed European country who is traveling incognito. Olivia de Havilland plays MariaMary who happily takes sleeping pills from several people to be able to sleep on her flight from New York.But bad weather at all points ahead soon forces the plane to return to New York. Only her royal guardian Maria's uncle Holman doesn't know about this until later. Charles Coburn plays Holman with his usual wit and frequently dry humor. Eddie takes charge of the sleepy drugged Mary and tries to locate her family to no avail. Finally he calls Dave and his wife Jean played by Jane Wyman who go to his apartment where Jean puts Mary to bed.From there the fun continues as Uncle Holman is joined by the U.S. State Department and police in trying to locate the missing princess. They think she has been kidnapped.This is a light fun film with a very farfetched plot the displaced royalty in America during the war. The cast all are very good and it has some interesting little insights of history. I noticed that one of the shooting locations was the White House at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. And that dog that we see! Could it be President Roosevelt's own Scottish Terrier Fala? According to sources including Wikipedia Fala was played in this film by a standin pooch named Whiskers.Many movies about World War II have shown the preparedness at home in England and some American home front films have shown women taking up jobs in industry. But I don't recall any film before this that showed emergency training and support by women in the U.S. I don't know if the women's support group here was real or fictitious but a couple funny lines came at its expense. When Eddie suggests they go see the sights together Jean says she can't until later because it's her day to work with the women's volunteer group. Dave says She's a major lieutenant. Eddie says A major lieutenant? There's no such thing. Dave says There is in her crew. Everybody's something. Mrs. Maloney is a double sergeant general colonel second class.Another plus in this film is a look inside an early 1940s commercial aircraft that had sleeping berths. People today may find it hard to believe but before deregulation of the airline industry in the late 1970s airlines used to offer many amenities on board. My first flight was in 1962 but I had never seen a plane with sleeping berths. The one the boys are flying in this film seems more like a Pullman railroad car inside the cabin. Pullman sleeping cars were a thing of the past by the late 1960s but a number of older films have scenes that show us what they looked like.Bob Cummings actually served in the Army Air Force during WW II. He joined in November 1942 and served as a flight instructor. While this film came out in late October 1943 that was a year after it had been made. Cummings was taught to fly while in high school in Joplin MO by his godfather Orville Wright. Wright and his brother Wilbur were the first men to build and successfully fly a plane  in 1903 at Kitty Hawk NC.Cummings gave high school friends rides in his plane. When the U.S. government began licensing flight instructors Bob Cummings was issued the very first flight instructor certificate. Besides his flying credentials Cummings had a very colorful background in acting. He successfully imitated an upper crust Englishman to gain stage roles in England and on Broadway. He later portrayed a rich Texan to get a start in films in Hollywood. In the 1930s he reverted to his real name and had a successful career in comedy drama and mystery films and on radio and TV shows through the 1950s.Cummings isn't remembered much today but he was well known and liked for his talent in the mid20th century. He never became a super star but played in some memorable films and with top performers of the day. He began using methamphetamines in the mid1950s and his addiction hurt his career from then on and contributed to two divorces. He died of kidney failure and pneumonia at age 80 in 1990.This film is light entertainment with some fine movie stars of the time. It's a fun film fit for the whole family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Writer Norman Krasna had received three Academy Award nominations for his original stories or screenplays most recently for The Devil and Miss Jones 1941 by the time he tried his hand at directing his first film this one. Since he only directed two more films in his career once in 1950 and again in 1956 one might assume that he preferred writing.For this romantic comedy Krasna finally earned his only Oscar on his last nomination for an Original Screenplay. His creative story about an incognito princess out of her native country who meets and falls in love with a commoner predates by 10 years the better known classic Roman Holiday 1953 its three different writers would share Oscar nominations and Academy Awards for their similar story and screenplay.Olivia de Havilland plays Princess Maria who lives with her Uncle Holman Charles Coburn in exile because of World War II in New York City. Count Peter Curt Bois wants to marry her but she doesn't love him even though Holman expresses concern about their country's succession e.g. she needs a male offspring an heir. However he's also concerned about his niece's well being so he sends her to San Francisco under an assumed name Mary Williams to improve her state of mind andor broaden her horizons. Because of bad weather and too many sleeping pills to combat her fear of flying she ends up back in New York in the apartment of the plane's pilot Eddie O'Rourke Robert Cummings. It's not what you think she was passed out and he was chivalrous not lecherous. He assumes she's a war refugee and she doesn't enlighten him. Instead they begin dating during which she meets his married friends Jean  Dave Campbell Jane Wyman  Jack Carson who naturally quarrel a bit providing additional comic relief.When Holman finds out about Maria's beau he has an agent investigate the pilot and is delighted to learn that Eddie is from a large family of boys as was Eddie's father. Things get rather complicated diplomatically at this point. The princess is willing and able to marry a commoner provided that he'll renounce his U.S. citizenship which is of course a showstopper for him. It's all resolved in a rather cute if incredible way with Harry Davenport as the Supreme Court judge who performs the ceremony at the White House the President FDR and his dog.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I sat down to watch this film I frankly wasn't in the mood for a comedy. And I wasn't always impressed with Olivia de Havilland in comedies although I felt she was one of best actresses of her generation. However this turned out to be quite a pleasant romantic comedy.De Havilland and Bob Cummings had some fine chemistry on screen and I've long felt that Cummings has been unfairly forgotten despite some very fine performances in films such as Hitchcock's Sabateur and the fine comedy The Devil And Miss Jones. Cummings plays an airline pilot here who falls in love with a woman he doesn't realize is a princess. Of course Cummings ruined his film reputation when he moved to television and  in the mid1950s  got into amphetamines.There's a good supporting cast here as well. Charles Coburn is one of the best of the character actors although I can't say this is his best role. Jack Carson is the best friend Jane Wyman the best female friend Harry Davenport as a Supreme Court Judge Gladys Cooper as a governess and secretary and Minor Watson as a diplomat. Unfortunately the film is so focused on De Havilland and Cummings that the supporting actors don't get as much screen time as they deserve.The one real criticism is the running gag early in the film about sleeping pills. It is important to the story but it went on too long.However all things considered this is a pleasant and entertaining film. It's a light comedy and not the heavy duty drama in which de Havilland excelled and it's a great film for Cummings. It's worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Princess O'Rourke the story of a temporarily exiled princess living in New York is pretty indicative of the romantic comedy genre of the time  Boy meets girl under zany circumstances in this case Olivia de Havilland is a frightened airline passenger and Robert Cummings is her pilot they very quickly fall in love and she withholds the fact that she is royalty until the end when mayhem ensues.  Formulaic?  Definitely.  But de Havilland is so engaging that you refrain from rolling your eyes more than if it were many other actresses and Robert Cummings is a charming leading man.The supporting characters of note include Charles Coburn who seems to play the curmudgeonly uncle' more often than not  this is the second time I've seen him play uncle to de Havilland Jack Carson of Mildred Pierce fame as Cummings' best friend and a really sourfaced Jane Wyman as Carson's wife.  Princess O'Rourke isn't a wellknown film or even a great film but it certainly has its charm.  My recommendation is to watch this film if it comes around on cable but it is average enough to not make it worthwhile to actively seek out.Shelly".

The scene where he tells Eddie to get out is just great.The picture just proves over and over that wealth and status can't bring you happiness.The oddball meeting between the Princess and Eddie provides for so much fun here. Rounding out the cast is Jane Wyman and Jack Carson as the married friends of Eddie.The scene where Mary Olivia is willing to do anything for the war effort was quite humorous. She is better than any princess the woman is no snob. Eddie shows his mettle when he refuses to give up his American citizenship by marrying a foreign princess.

	schema:reviewBody "IMDb reviews are not infallible but they are usually reasonably reliable. Not so in this case. This movie is a combination of two popular contemporary themes the princess who is mistaken for a commoner or vice versa and the hasty wartime marriage. Both are treated much better in every such movie I can think of. The themes have lost their appeal and relevance and what we are left with is a very dull movie with a lame script and boring actors. Numerous reviews say this film is not just humorous but hilarious. I didn't laugh once. Didn't even smile.Olivia de Havilland of course I exempt from the boring category. As ever she is sweet charming endearing and thoroughly delightful. But opposite her is a blank space called Bob Cummings who is superficial and puerile. How could anyone think that a character far less intelligent and educated than she could be a good match? His moment of trying to be masterful with de Havilland makes him look childishly badtempered and the scene in which he struggles with correct terminology makes it embarrassingly obvious how dumb he is. It is also embarrassing that for much of the movie de Havilland is led to believe that while she was unconscious he undressed her and saw her naked. This is not funnyit is leering and distasteful. It is also out of character for de Havilland to become friendly then romantic with someone who would do this. There are other foolishly unrealistic bits for the sake of a laughwhen she gets out of bed for instance wearing Cummings's pajamas she nearly trips as she has on pj's that look big enough for someone eight feet tall.It's also bizarre that de Havilland desperate to sleep takes five sleeping pills. Later she is given two more. For heaven's sake who doesn't know that taking several sleeping pills means you risk not waking up at all? Certainly not someone as sensible and educated as she is.The other main male part is filled by Charles Coburn. When given amusing lines and when there is not too much of him as in Heaven Can Wait or The Lady Eve he can be amusingly rakish or crooked. Here as the soul of propriety and with nothing funny to say he is just a boring blowhardand hardly easy on the eye. Gladys Cooper is insulted by the role given herthis eminent and distinguished lady has only a few lines to say none of them at all interesting.On the plus side the movie has Jack Carson and Jane Wyman each very appealing they make a very cute couple. But their parts are also too small and pretty feeble. And Jane Wyman isn't herself yet. I kept wondering when she was going to put in an appearance before I realised she was the actress with the long blonde curly hair. Very disconcerting.It's hard to get a dog wrong but the makers of this movie could not even manage a nice Scotch terrier to impersonate President Roosevelt's dog Fala. This one has very prominent teeth and in closeups he looks rather alarming. I wouldn't trust him around my ankles.While some flagwaving propaganda is understandable in a wartime movie the filmmakers go too far when they present Bob Cummings with this dilemma He can marry a doll like Olivia de Havilland and have 150000 spending money a year think what that would be today! if he gives up his American citizenship. I wonder how many men in the audience would immediately and vehemently turn that down!I originally was drawn to this movie because I thought it was based on the Damon Runyon story of the same title about a female hack driver and her horse named Goldberg. THAT is a really good story it is really funny I laughed out loud at the end and a smaller and more profitable investment of your time than this piece of junk.".

	schema:reviewBody "As others have noted this 1943 film bears more than a passing resemblance to William Wyler's 1953 film Roman Holiday which turned its leading actress Audrey Hepburn into an Oscarwinning overnight star. Roman Holiday is considered a classic of the romantic comedy genre but its predecessor Princess O'Rourke has been forgotten with the exception of occasional showings on TCM.The plot lonely unhappy Princess Maria a lovely Olivia De Havilland is on an American public relations tour during the midst of WWII while her exiled family remains in the UK. Her uncle Charles Coburn gruffly supervises her every minute. Frustrated and bored with her structured schedule and her very limited social circle Maria sees herself as a caged bird. That all changes when she plans to travel to the west coast and due to series of misunderstandings is drugged with a host of sleeping pills. As a result she passes out on her plane's pilot Eddie O'Rourke Bob Cummings who has no idea who she is due to her traveling incognito. She wakes to find herself in Eddie's bed and even wearing his pajamas! Intrigued by what occurred the previous night because she can't recall Maria agrees to go out on a date with Eddie and his two married friends Jack Carson and Jane Wyman. Maria keeps her true identity secret while romantic sparks fly with Eddie who feeling the pinch of time with his about to join the service and feeling sorry for this poor refugee recklessly asks her to marry him?!?! Of course Maria knows she can't marry an American commoner but there is the possibility that wartime contingencies could make an exception.If you've ever seen Roman Holiday then a lot of the above plot synopsis should sound familiar. Everything from the lonely princess to the inadvertent drugging to the meeting by chance the handsome young American to her waking in his bed wearing his pajamas to keeping her identity secret while enjoying a typical date to the princess knowing her obligations prevent her from following her heart appeared to have been taken from this film and imported to Roman Holiday. However Norman Krasna who wrote Princess O'Rourke and received an Oscar for that script is not credited for Roman Holiday. Nor is there any evidence of a lawsuit being initiated for copyright infringement even though it appears it would have been a slamdunk case.Roman Holiday is a superior film. Princess O'Rourke is even fluffier than that romantic film. It also bogs down with WWII propaganda and really loses its way with its unbelievable happy ending. It appears the creators of Roman Holiday recognized the stuff that worked but also were smart enough to ditch the stuff that didn't. Roman Holiday's bittersweet ending is one of the big reasons it's remembered as a classic but Princess O'Rourke couldn't resist giving its WWII audience a cheap smile at the end which is probably a big reason why it's forgotten.".

	schema:headline " overhyped for it's antiamerican military commentary which it isn't...";
	schema:reviewBody "Some films just suffer from bad luck and Buffalo Soldiers' is one of them. Not that the movie is all that bad nor all that terrific it just deals with a subject that Americans might not be comfortable about today a lessthanglowing depiction of the American military.The film made its debut at the Toronto Film Festival three days before Sept 11 2001 under great fanfare. It was billed as being a dark satirical look at the military but after the attacks on 911 its future was buried. Now almost two years later Buffalo Soldiers' is finally being released but it's not clear that the climate will be any more accommodating.The movie starts by presenting a criminal subculture operating among U.S. soldiers stationed in West Germany just before the fall of the Berlin wall. The satirical billing is merely a backdrop for the film and it does present just about everyone rather hyperbolically. Joaquin Phoenix plays Ray Elwood a la Radar O'Reilly from MASH. He is the company clerk for a U.S. supply base making most decisions for his oblivious colonel to rubber stamp. Like Milo Minderbinder from Catch22 he goes about his normal routine of making money and duping the system but in this case Elwood is a smalltime drug dealer who sometimes dabbles in black market booty. Things turn on him quickly when he happens across some heavy weaponry and his plan for unloading the equipment puts him way over his head getting him into far more trouble than what he can handle as the lightweight and inexperienced paperpusher that he is. By the time the plot line is established the backdrop of satire is abandoned witty observations undone and philosophical quips erased.Indeed the true essence of the film lies beyond the plot but it doesn't go as far as it tagline philosophy Where there is peace the warlike man attacks himself.' a quote from Nietzsche whose keen observation was the original inspiration for the film. At most Buffalo Soldiers' depicts how people behave when they get in over their heads and only a dash of commentary on anything military or philosophical.As for the controversy around American soldiers doing bad things it would be a stretch to feel this is commentary on the good ol' US of A. Only those looking to pick a fight would find any form of offense or unpatriotic flavor to this film. Still all one has to do is suggest the notion and people will simply adopt that view anyway regardless of what's on screen. Ironically that's the movie's fault not the public's. If the movie were better at delivering a more profound message  one that it clearly wanted to make  or if the story line were multidimensional rather than a straightforward crime caper people would easily overlook its superficial qualities. To be sure Joaquin Phoenix does an excellent job at portraying a frat boy who doesn't take the army seriously and who learns the ropes the hard way just before he gets busted down to hell.In the end Buffalo Solders' is entertaining has a splash of romance and is certainly a good enough movie in its own right but is not the cynical antiwar antipatriotic movie that people will be told it is. Oddly the film's perception may be disproportionately diminished and reviewed poorly because of the attention it's getting but it doesn't deserve undue praise either.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without an enemy to fight an army will fight itself or find its own enemies. In the tradition of Sergeant Bilko the Phil Silvers TV show not Steve Martin's ghastly remake Buffalo Soldiers shows what happens when soldiers with nothing to do but wait for war begin to think for themselves and exploit the system. In place of Bilko's poker games and lottery scams Ray Elwood opts for black marketeering drug dealing and gun running. However the characters portrayed by Phil Silvers and Joaquin Phoenix respectively do have a lot in common. The tone of Buffalo Soldiers is much darker than that of Sergeant Bilko but the film and TV series share the same absurd yet plausible vision. There are no chimpanzee conscripts like Private Harry Speakup in this movie but there ARE characters who have clearly risen well above the level of their own incompetence. Ed Harris' Colonel Berman is a pathetic example of the uniformed timeserved bureaucrat someone you could almost feel sorry for until you realise that one day he may have to lead men into combat. Counterbalancing the Bilkoesquire vibe created by Elwood's wheelerdealing is his nemesis Scott Glenn's steely Sergeant Lee. Glenn clearly relishes his role in this movie and is very convincing as the model soldier with a true heart of darkness.Joaquin Phoenix gives Elwood an understated charisma as he leads his troops from behind rarely lifting the lid on the fear and frustration that simmers within him as the events he sets in motion go out of control.To say that this film is antimilitary is unfair as it contains portrayals of decent honest and professional soldiers as well as the scammers pimps and dopeheads that the plot focuses on. It is a film about human beings with all their failings in uniform not soldiers. Buffalo Soldiers is anticomplacency antiindoctrination and anticorruption which is probably why its release was postponed after the September 11th terrorist outrage of 2001. In the light of recent despicable acts by a small group of US soldiers in Iraq's Abu Graib prison this film seems eerily prescient. Without an enemy to fight in open combat what happens to the aggression and contempt for that enemy that military training fosters? Ignore the negative comments and give this underrated film a chance. It was titled Army Go Home in Germany where the film is set echoing the feelings of German citizens who lived near foreign troops sent to defend them against Communism. The Beetlecrushing sequence an absurdly comic high point of the film is based on actual incidents involving bored intoxicated British and American troops on manoeuvres armed to the teeth and waiting for a war that never came.".

Why they waited two years before releasing this superb movie in the UK is anyone's guess  although it may have had something to do with its total lack of respect for the U.S. Army. I'm not sure this would have went down too well in the aftermath of 911. Regardless Buffalo Soldiers is an absolute gem. It is nasty intelligent and hilarious. It is critical of American values specifically capitalism in the 80s and it takes no prisoners. This is an outsider's perspective on the American occupation of West Germany in 1989 Jordan is Australian and as a result he brings an Australian aesthetic to his work. But it is also a tender film that is structured around a touching central romance between Elwood and Robyn. I love their scenes in the pool it is such a warm intimate location  a perfect setting for the heart of an otherwise deeply cynical film. Jordan is a director of considerable talent and Buffalo Soldiers is magnificent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ray Elwood is a soldier stationed on a base in West Germany.  With no war to fight the men become bored but Elwood has enough going on the side to keep him busy whether selling off excess cleaning supplies or dealing drugs. When he lands two trucks worth of weapons he thinks his day has come however at the same time a tough new officer Sergeant Lee is stationed on the base with the aim of cleaning it up  starting with Elwood dealings.Of course we all know that this film practically vanished after 911 suddenly America didn't want anything that seemed to be attacking America or the dedicated American soldier.  This was unfortunate as the film isn't as blatantly antiwar or antiAmerican as I had been led to believe.  Rather it is a dark comedy that looks at the reality of army life during peacetime. In fairness though it does show the soldiers out for cash high on drugs and certainly not fitting the image that made Time magazine pick the American soldier' as man of the year for 2003.The basic plot makes MASH look like some sort of kids game  where HawkEye made drink in his tent Elwood cooks coke and deals in stolen weapons. The story works quite well although some of it didn't totally work and some of the characters and action didn't really make sense.  It was amusing without being laugh out loud funny although this wasn't so much of a problem as I certainly didn't expect it to be an out and out comedy.  The drama works better than the comedy and it is for this reason it is a better attack on the ideal of the military.  The upper levels of the military also take a knock being shown as focused on rank climbing rather than keeping a sharp military machine well oiled!The cast is good on the whole  both on paper and on the screen.  Phoenix leads the film really well and delivers a likeable character that is still abhorrent enough to be seen as an attack rather than a spoof.  Harris is OK but he only has a small role and it doesn't totally fit in with the main narrative very well  likewise McGovern.  Pacquin is pretty cool but her character was a bit of a mystery to me but Glenn is well cast and he is able to deliver the goods in a borderline nuts character only problem with his performance was that I didn't totally understand his character's aims by the end of the film.  Both Leon and Pena were good in support and Dean Stockwell has an OK cameo.Overall this was a good film despite the fact that it had a plot that was a little weakened by the side issues and characters who aren't totally clear in terms of what they're all about.  Aside from this the film is pretty entertaining and is actually quite matter of fact in it's portrayal of military life rather than being scathing  coming from Northern Ireland I have seen all sorts of stuff done by squaddies and am well aware of how true this can be!  But to label it antiAmerican is just plain daft!".

	schema:headline " A story so funny it has to be true...";
	schema:reviewBody "Well in reality I suspect the story behind Buffalo Soldiers has picked up a bit of embellishment along the way from modern folklore to big screen but that's hardly surprising. What is surprising is that such a basic story can be turned into such a funny film. It's not so much haha funny as it is just ironic funny. Indeed the story about one woman screaming protests about the socalled antiAmerican sentiment of the film and flinging a bottle at the screen tells me that some people still expect their comedy to be spoonfed to them.If anything this film reads like a celebration of the things that the citizens of Western societies take for granted. With soldiers situated far from home and having nothing better to do than play games of indoor gridiron at times it's a small wonder that soldiers turn to drug abuse or other such illegal activity in order to stave off boredom. Stir craziness is a problem in any army during peacetime although one can't help but wonder if we're not being shown a rather extreme example here.The basis of this black comedy is in the solid performances of the principal cast. Joaquin Phoenix shows once again that he has a great talent while Ed Harris and Scott Glenn do an admirable job of playing the straight arrows. But it is another moderated littlegirllost type of performance from the everwonderful Anna Paquin that at least kept this viewer engaged. This woman could make a ninety minute film in which she reads the telephone book and I'd probably enjoy it.The corruption shown in this film is hardly surprising given how little soldiers seem to be paid in comparison to the stress they endure. If there is indeed any truth to the depicitions of drug abuse then it's not surprising anymore that employers are currently employing random drug testing. Dr. Strangelove couldn't get more spoton about how the human element of the military is generally its undoing. After one memorable sequence involving drugged tank drivers I'll never be able to catch sight of an army vehicle without getting the urge to run away screaming.I gave Buffalo Soldiers an eight out of ten. Under normal circumstances I would have given it a seven but it has Anna Paquin in it and any film with Anna Paquin in it can earn a bonus point. If you like your comedy without obvious prompts of when you're meant to laugh then you can't go wrong with Buffalo Soldiers.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well in reality I suspect the story behind Buffalo Soldiers has picked up a bit of embellishment along the way from modern folklore to big screen but that's hardly surprising. What is surprising is that such a basic story can be turned into such a funny film. It's not so much haha funny as it is just ironic funny. Indeed the story about one woman screaming protests about the socalled antiAmerican sentiment of the film and flinging a bottle at the screen tells me that some people still expect their comedy to be spoonfed to them.If anything this film reads like a celebration of the things that the citizens of Western societies take for granted. With soldiers situated far from home and having nothing better to do than play games of indoor gridiron at times it's a small wonder that soldiers turn to drug abuse or other such illegal activity in order to stave off boredom. Stir craziness is a problem in any army during peacetime although one can't help but wonder if we're not being shown a rather extreme example here.The basis of this black comedy is in the solid performances of the principal cast. Joaquin Phoenix shows once again that he has a great talent while Ed Harris and Scott Glenn do an admirable job of playing the straight arrows. But it is another moderated littlegirllost type of performance from the everwonderful Anna Paquin that at least kept this viewer engaged.

It tells the story of a group of American soldiers so thoroughly bored that they kill time by smuggling drugs drinking booze and fighting each other. It kinda reminds me of my father's stories of his short yet turbulent time in the army. He keeps on telling about all the wrong things they did to have a bit of fun in their forced presence in these days. The movie doesn't really have a grand message to deliver to its audience but it is most definitely good for a few laughs.

	schema:headline " Interesting picture with an excellent interpretation by Joaquin Phoenix and surrounded by a highly capable support cast";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie deals with an US corporal Joaquin Phoenix whose slogan is steal all that you can steal . He has moneymaking plans for every occasion in the United States headquarter located in Germany during George Bush Sr time . His superior Colonel Ed Harris looks the other way until a new and veteran sergeant Scott Glenn turns up  but the corporal falls in love with his daughter Anna Paquin and the sergeant seeks vengeance . The film is a ferocious and hilarious military critical  it's an antiarmy and antiwarprotest blackcomedy which follows exploits of a woolly and wild US unit  being based on the 1993 novel by Robert O'Connor . Ironical recycling of the classic 1950s Television comedy series which was interpreted by Phil Silvers and Sgt. Bilko film by Jonathan Lynn with Steve Martin . Movie characters are utterly negatives  they are mean  greedy  villains or nuts and aren't politically corrects . Spectacular images when appear the tanks  these American tanks featured in the film are actually modified German L1 Leopards . The forest where the tank drives through was planted just for this movie on a green field in front of a real forest  though he tanks were not allowed to drive through the real forest . Here Joaquin Phoenix plays a topnotch farceur and he is assembled by a perfect support casting such as Leon  Harris  Gabriel Mann  Dean Stockwell and Elizabeth McGovern . The picture obtained moderated success  giving a new meaning on the word 'irreverence' and really fierce criticism to Army institution . None relation to the film with same title Buffalo soldiers 1997 directed by Charles Haid with Danny Glover about postcivil war black cavalry corps . The motion picture was well directed Gregor Jordan . Rating  Good . Well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Who knows where they got the title from? Buffalo soldiers was supposed to have been a nickname given to AfricanAmerican cavalrymen by Indians after the Civil War because the soldiers wore buffalo robes. I'd like to see that etymology documented but never mind. I can't figure out why this picture was given such a title.But there's a lot about this picture I can't figure out. Ostensibly it's about intrigue within a group of criminal bootleggers operating in Germany in the U. S. Army. And it starts off rather well. Joaquin Phoenix the battalion clerk is into moving materials illegally on and off base  floor cleaner out drugs in and weapons out. Phoenix is one mean and heartless E4. He cooks Turkish morphine down to heroin and sells it to the other enlisted men. A tank crew stoned are too befogged to understand orders on maneuvers and they drive their tank around the city streets and mow down a gas station which shortly blows up before finally and accidentally finding that they've rejoined their unit whose commander compliments them. It's certainly a different view of how the caissons go rolling along than the one we're used to.Yet already there is a sense of disquiet  not just about the story that is unfolding on screen but about the movie and its assumptions. The runaway tank episode is played for laughs  as if this were MASH or an Abbott and Costello movie. But when the gas stations blows two innocent soldiers die horribly.One private OD's on a cocktail of a dozen different drugs. The commander of the supply unit Ed Harris in a touching performance reads the report and can only say Gee! Where did he GET all this stuff? The stuff includes LSD although by 1989 the year in which the film is set LSD would have elicited only puzzled frowns among dopers. And poor Harris is made to play a full colonel one step away from generalhood but is so lacking in military presence in common sense that he apologizes to Phoenix after yelling at him a little. Ha ha ha. He's never shown as anything but a nincompoop.Phoenix with his Rollex watches and Mercedes Benz's runs into a little problem when a new top sergeant appears  Scott Glenn  an actor who is invariably good. Come to think of it he was Astronaut Carpenter while Ed Harris was Astronaut Glenn in The Right Stuff. This new top sergeant is a real tough mother. He plays by the book. He infiltrates Phoenix's gang and ultimately destroys it. There is a subplot involving a romance between Phoenix and the top's daughter Anna Paquin which doesn't serve much of a useful purpose. I do want to mention Dean Stockwell though. He only has a minute or two of screen time but he can be an extremely engaging actor as he is here.The movie falls completely apart at the end  shootouts in steamy warehouses exploding fireballs bodies falling in slow motion out of windows  you can fill in the rest. I lost track of who was shooting whom because it was impossible to care about any of the characters. There is also a subplot about Phoenix having promised a shipment of arms to some kind of antiSoviet revolutionary which gets lost somewhere along the way.Well okay. What's the movie trying to tell us. In Peace the warlike man makes war against himself observes Phoenix in voiceover. I guess I don't have much of a problem with that except that I don't see how it applies to this film. A better epigram would be The military sucks. Colonel Ed Harris is a nice guy who belongs in Napa growing grapes. Joaquin Phoenix is a shifty selfish maniac who betrays the people who trust him and who survives the fireballs to be awarded decorations. What was he decorated for? The movie doesn't tell us. The medals are just there to make the army look stupid. Another general brags at length about his being related to THE general Marshall. The lawabiding young lieutenant the only truly straight guy is an undercover operative within the gang and is killed while trying to carry out his duties. Scott Glenn who seems to operate a little beyond the edge but still a moralist confesses in the last few minutes that he just LOVED Vietnam and that he did everything there that Phoenix is doing here and a lot worse. Then why is he so antagonistic to Phoenix? At the end Phoenix recovers from wounds and takes his decorations to Hawaii where his new commander is a clone of Ed Harris. Phoenix has found another perfect venue for his criminal career.Actually it's the kind of story that might have been thought up by some literary type who was drafted and absolutely HATED his twoyear hitch in Germany. Revenge is sweet as they say.".

Ed Harris was solid as his commanding officer who is a bit washed up. Scott Glenn is very good in his role as the top sergeant at the station another great performance from this underrated actor. Elizabeth McGovern was also impressive as Col. Berman's Harris wife. I also liked Anna Paquin who gave only an average performance in one of my favorite films the 25th hour she is better here as Sgt Lee Glenn's daughter. THe film in general is very well written one of the best screenplays of this day and age and the direction fits i like army films like this because of my own personal politics and i thought it was done very well. 910".

What was even better was that this dragging of your emotions wasn't something that followed the action on screen and let me explain that.For example when Ray Elwood Joaquin Phoenix is going out with Robyn Lee Anna Paquin and you clearly see them beginning to fall for each other what you don't feel is excitement joy or happiness. What you feel is impending dread and fear as in the sidelines you know that her father will not be happy.It's that feeling that continues throughout the movie building slowly from when you see Elwood and Sergeant Lee Scott Glenn first meet you know something is building up and things are going to go dreadfully wrong. This is something that you are taught in the movie early on and it builds up to the incredible crescendo.The characters are wonderfully rich and varied. The bored and disillusioned Elwood through to the naive and hapless Colonel Berman played wonderfully by Ed Harris. The performances are excellent from all and you can hardly single out any one member of the cast for better praise especially since the characters are all so different.On story you just can't fault it. There are so many Oh my god moments which are incredibly distressing or alarming and yet so messed up you can't help but think they might actually be reality.

	schema:reviewBody "A previous reviewer said that the photography and scenes were dull but I found them dark to match the theme and the humor in the movie. The music in turn was a bit sinister but also had a comical bounce to it to reflect the noconsequences attitude of the characters doing the dastardly deeds and the joy in which warloving Sgt. Robert E. Lee inflicted the consequences of their schemes upon them.I don't think the movie portrayed any kind of ongoing corruption in the military. It was a portrayal of a particular incident at the end of the Cold War and the human nature of warlike men who without a war will create one amongst themselves to combat the boredom. In the film the war is between Ray Elwood Phoenix a man who joined the army to avoid prison time for stealing a car and Sgt. Robert E. Lee am very fitting name who took three tours of Vietnam and knows and enjoys the realities of war. Lee can't stand the type of soldier that Elwood is a soldier with no regard for the army and a smart ass attitude. It's in Lee's blood to be a warlike man somethings his colleagues Marshall and Berman trying to prove embarrassingly via their pathetic stories about their supposed lineage.Although the message is dark the film always maintains a somewhat lighthearted view of the situation as we see at the end after Elwood's heroine manufacturing operation literally blows up beneath his feet. He almost dies and falls five stories he has a noted fear of heights and nightmares about falling yet at the end after being awarded a Purple Heart irony anyone? he is transferred to Hawaii where he picks up right where he left off pulling his schemes broken leg smirk and all.I enjoyed it and definitely recommend it for those who like dark comedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Phoenix heads a group of soldiers in West Germany in 1989 who do little else than steal deal drugs and try to get rich selling stuff on the black market. Problems arise as nononsense Glenn turns up at their base and starts to enforce a stricter regime.I really fail to see the point of this film. It doesn't work as a satire as it doesn't take a stand for anything. It just shows a bunch of guys behaving badly  sure they're in the US army but so what? It's not like it hasn't been done before with more subtlety and intelligence. It can' be called a black comedy either since it lacks any humour and is just dark and unpleasant. The most fitting description is some kind of overthetop drama as experienced while high on dope. Check out Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for a similar viewing.But the biggest problem is that Buffalo Soldiers is so unpleasant. There are no heroes or even sympathetic characters in the entire film. I just hated these guys and that makes it hard to recommend a film. The story goes everywhere chopped up into small incoherent pieces. The ending is a real copout like the filmmakers realised they didn't have a clue what the film was about or how to tie everything up.The film has got one saving grace though. Ed Harris is simply fantastic in a rather small and underused part as a failed Colonel. He felt real as opposed to the cardboard cartoon characters he has to interact with. His few minutes in the film is the only thing worth seeing it for. 210".

	schema:headline " Blacker than black but funny as hell!";
	schema:reviewBody "So you're going to the cinema to see a movie that's been shelved since 2001 because of the catastrophe at the twin towers. It's been very quietly hyped as EDGY and A BLACK COMEDY. All in all the only reason you're going is because you think Joaquin Phoenix Ed Harris and Scott Glenn are all good actors and you're pretty bored that day. Expectations are low. You've never heard of the director the film as has been said was delayed for reasons of patriotism it's set in the 80's and it sounds like yet another tired rehash of Catch 22 and M.A.S.H.And then you come out a couple of hours later after one of the most brilliantly funny satirical films you've seen for years! Put simply Buffalo Soldiers is an incredibly funny black comedy with altogether excellent acting dialogue scripting pacing and a near perfect blending together of the humorous and dramatic sides of the film. Whereas most genre blenders from actioncomedy to black comedy seem to take the two halves as separate events the first half usually funny with the second both much more sober and containing all of the action Buffalo Soldiers keeps the pace constant between the two.Set on a US army base in West Germany during the latter stages of the 1980's we quickly learn that life for a grunt in the Cold War is about as much fun as watching toxic paint dry... it's both uninteresting and deadly. Phoenix's Ray Elwood is our antiheroic narrator for this journey into the horrendous dullness of the edgy peace of the Cold War. A boy forced into a man's army as an alternative to prison Elwood quickly realised that he'd made a big mistake but couldn't undo it. He's in the army for his full term.Fortunately outside of the tiresome monotony of army life there is money to be made in the German black market particularly if you inveigle yourself into a position of trust as battalion clerk with your incompetent altogether too nice boss allocating the entire running of his section of the base to you. Elwood wheels and deals his way to a Mercedes Benz leather jackets and numerous other perks through a potent mixture of the selling of legitimate goods on the German black market and the cooking read distillation and purification of heroin dealt out by the US Military Police to their soldiers at night.All this is established and running by the start of the film and provides much of the comedy. Ed Harris' useless Colonel Berman is a hysterical example of bureaucratic incompetence a relic from World War 2 ill suited to peace keeping duties in the Cold War. Elwood runs rings around his superior who is blissfully unaware of what is going on.However the new top first sergeant of your unit Scott Glenn is not quite so clueless. Glenn's Sergeant Lee is a Vietnam veteran with all the wit knowledge and will to mess up Elwood's plans in the most terminal of ways. Lee's arrival coincides with Elwood discovering a stash of weapons that could set him up monetarily for life. But will Elwood be able to find a buyer sell the weapons and get his money with Lee snooping around? To further add to his problems Elwood decides to take up with Sgt Lee's daughter a fantastically feisty Anna Pacquin showing there's a lot more to her than Rogue's girlish naivety. Elwood's poor career move provides plenty of laughs romance and drama not least because you can entirely sympathise with Elwood's attraction particularly as the spectacular boredom that is his everyday existence cries out for a young kindred spirit like Robyn Lee.Anyhow this powder keg of a situation inevitably leads to massive conflict violence and disaster on all sides. The details are fascinating but are best viewed in the film. As for the rest of the cast Liz McGovern is on terrifically waspish form as Col Berman's wife Leon Robinson and Michael Pena do well in roles that must've read as Elwood's lapdogs numbers 1 and 2 Dean Stockwell turns up briefly as a wonderfully acidic General and Gabriel Mann perhaps best known for his quiet but essential role in the two Jason Bourne films is excellent as the clueless new recruit Private Knoll.This film has moments of rolling in the isles humour a love interest with genuine chemistry dramatic buildup and climaxes throughout and strong performances from all. It is definitely worth seeing although is not recommended for those with a weak stomach aversion to drug use or beliefs in America's army. It was this last the depiction of the good old American boys as drug dealing low lives that caused the films delay. However don't think that it is not worth watching because of that. In fact the motivation of all the characters and their desperation to survive the horrendous boredom of modern army life is what makes this film so powerful and well worth seeing. In my opinion particularly with the current situation in Iraq it is essential to remind ourselves that soldiers are trained to fight wars. In Buffalo Soldiers we see that when this objective isn't realised all that machoism and psychological motivation has no answer to boredom. With nothing but drill and exercises to occupy them rather than battles and war these troops in Germany stagnate and fall apart becoming a useless impotent machine that turns on itself in its frustration. Nowadays we have peace keeping missions in for example Iraq to occupy our soldiers where they are once again being faced with a situation they weren't trained for. We can only hope that the powers that be in the US army have seen films like Buffalo Soldiers and have anticipated similar occurrences in Iraq.".

Its an interesting change to see him equally adept playing a Vietnam veteran who has done things a lot worse than the drug paddling and arms deals by our antihero.Anna Paquin plays the role of lovely princess with a despot father. Other than adorning the screen with her sweet charm however she does not have much to do. In fact its quite a pity that since The Piano the grown Paquin has not had a really important role although she has done well in Finding Forrester Almost Famous and the Xmen movies. Bottom line?

So if being a total waste was the most they could accomplish on their off hours then they are truly unworthy. This film is totally degenerate and stupid to boot despite it's hip Euro appeal and it's A list actors. If you care anything about decency and a positive message about people in films avoid it!".

	schema:headline " Excellent movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "The story about soldiers in a midst of a peacetime really proves to be an excellent example of a darkly humorous crime story.The story is set in 1989 on the American Army base. It is a period of stagnation in army there is no one to fight with and soldiers try to spend their free time by all ways and means they prefer.The main character is an ingenious clerk Ray Elwood Joaquin Phoenix gorgeous simply gorgeous who tries to get profit from everything that is available in the base. His problems start when the new top sergeant Robert Lee played extremely well by Scott Glenn who appears to be a Vietnam veteran prevents poor Ray from making an important deal and tries to make his life hell and even worse when he finds out about close relationship between Ray and sergeant's daughter.The screenplay is based on the novel written by Robert Connor. Undeniably the modish antimilitary skit pure black army humor breathtaking story about cynical misadventures of dashing Yankees in the Western Germany when the soldiers have their heads in the clouds of homemade heroine  all that makes the movie incredibly good. Equally good are professionally filmed closeups and long shots.Another remarkable feature of the movie is the soundtrack. De la Soul performance suits incredibly well.In spite of the success of the movie in Europe in the US the first showing was in the wrong time  in 8th of September 2001. After the 11th of September it was furtively shown only in 24 cinemas and was a boxoffice disaster.The most remarkable character in the movie is beyond doubts Ray Elwood. He is a very contradictory character he is at the same time cynic and in despair fable and strong enjoying life and losing his face tormented by discrepancies. The lead is portrayed awesomely by Joaquin Phoenix. Ed Harris as usually shows very enjoyable highclass performance. Also I like the performance by Gabriel Mann it is a minor role though quite noticeable. I do not like Anna Paquin in this role she unnaturally has tried to be intense and alluring.On the whole the movie being at the same time funny serious and sad is perfect and it is worth watching at least because of the outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix in one of his best roles.".

He removes the restraint of plot and just goes balls out nuts with his usual philosophical angst and endless worship of beautiful dames. Oddly enough without the fetters of convention to me it was actually less pretentious or indulgent I think people like to call it and a lot easier to understand and empathize with. One thing that I've always found absurd and ironically what this film dwells on is the complaints by fans and critics that he should go back to making comedies. Woody cannot not make a funny movie. If he's in it and he's talking I'm laughing. Especially back in this era when his jokes were so fresh. So make no mistake this film is loaded with comedy. Finally I liked his choice of women in this. Charlotte Rampling is what I suppose the word breathtaking was originally meant to describe. If you arent touched by the final scenes with her you got issues.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that Stardust Memories does not get the credit that it truly deserves. Everyone has such distaste for this film because they thought that this was an autobiography and it was Woody's attack on his fanscritics. Woody himself has said many times that this is not the case but even if it were I believe that the fanscritics deserve to be lowered down a peg. After all Woody's interpretation of his fans via Fellini's style of awkward and hilarious faces is valid. Fans and critics alike should never have verbally abused him so much after the release of Interiors 1978. Why should directors be typecasted? Let him have his freedom! After all Interiors wasn't such a bad movie. It was different but not bad. Stardust Memories has also been accused of Woody's most selfindulgent film but this is an outrage. All of Woody's films have something to do with his personal life but if he had casted someone like John Cusack as Sandy Bates then everyone would have stopped complaining about it's selfindulgence and start understanding how much of a creative genius Woody Allen is. Overall Stardust Memories will be one of his films that lasts but only time will tell.".

Beyond its philosophic concerns though this is also an incredibly funny film. There are more genuinely funny moments within this serious film than in many of Allen's earlier pure comedies. It skewers the movie industry the moviegoing public Allen's own earlier work Allen's present insecurities surprise! and a number of other targets.

	schema:headline " Imperfect but it's still one of Woody's smartest scripts with other incentives...";
	schema:reviewBody "...and in Sandy Bates the lead of his satire on celebrity loves and his usual themes of turmoil over life and death is a sense that Woody Allen is doing one of two things or both perhaps taking from his own life and thinly disguising characters and situations or using his own public image in film's culture to look through the looking glass slightly at some of his popular themes. This is not to say that the film is one of his very best. I could see what Allen was doing for example with the scenes and instances of tipping the hat to Fellini and his masterwork 8 12 the two films share that common thread of an artist in an overall funk of bittersweet memories and creative confusion. But while Fellini made his film out of a burning need to reveal all of his love for cinema out of his angsts after La Dolce Vita Allen's track record shows that he's near incapable of waiting around too long to make a film he's averaged nearly a film a year in 37 years up till 2003 so much of what comes forth in Stardust Memories isn't as much autobiographical as it is told through a character filtered with and not with himself. In short a lot of the 8 12 dues were my least favorite parts in the movie though I did like the quick Supermantype mementos.But does that make Stardust Memories a failure pretentious? Not to my point of view once Allen starts the story rolling and he gets his charactersactors into the gist of the film it goes along like most other Allen films involving phobias fears loves women and sophisticated sense of varied parody. There are moments that Allen's standup act is injected into the mix or a scene that could've been a chapter from one of his books but mostly the audience gets the sense of his OWN love of cinema via Sandy Bates. Bates is another one of those Woody characters that seems all the more impressively formed and executed since it feels like the Woody we know but Bates is just a little more on the edge of satire viewing into his own selfdoubts and trying to see if there can be any hope or meaning to it all or if he can tell funny jokes. The script contains some of the most memorable moments of Allen's career in oneliners there are a few from the fans and autographhounds that stick out and in having a natural flow close to a type of poetry in the conversations and dialog in the film. Even if one doesn't laugh it definitely shows the work of a wonderful writer at the peak of his game. His direction is also intrinsically interesting especially how he uses the unique dark and evoking cinematography by the great Gordon Willis and the unusual editing stylizing by Susan Morse though once again some of these editing tricks are to Fellini's credit. And the performances work well enough for the material more often than not with Charlotte Rampling as Dorrie Bates' wonderfully stressed exgirlfriend MarieChristine Barrault as Isobel an old friend who left her husband for him Jessica Harper as Daisy whom he falls head over heels for while she and her professorboyfriend are at the Stardust attending Bates' appearances and Tony Roberts who had a worthy supporting role in Annie Hall pops up here as well.I can recommend Stardust Memories for Woody Allen's main fan base as it gives those who love his early films and his films that have more mature subject matter a bit of a delightful challenge. I don't know if I could recommend it however as the very first film someone could see if the person wants to start of his films. There is an amusing quality to it that could give nonWoody fans a second thought about the filmmaker's work but it's hard to say. It's not an altogether easy film to watch or is it a masterwork like Manhattan. By the end of it nevertheless my time was not the least wasted I knew I saw some ingenious scenes and jokes here and there and there was a subtlety to it that has me liking it and responding more to it on repeat viewings. Is it homage? Sure but it's a blend of homage or as Roberts says ripping it off and a personal nearly original style and it ends up on a repeat viewing a major work. 9.510".

	schema:headline " A kaleidoscopic masterpiece of absurd humour abstract thought cinema and nostalgia";
	schema:reviewBody "Funny moving imaginative bold intelligent surreal nostalgic and beautiful Stardust Memories 1980 is one of Allen's greatest films if not THE greatest. At its most simple level the film is a merciless satire on the film industry on the notion of celebrity and on Allen's public persona as he here essays the role of a standup comedian turned filmmaker wrestling with a number of weighty personal issues including the death of a close friend the breakup of a relationship and the beginning of an affair  all the while trying desperately to reconcile the need for personal success in relation to artistic expression. It is without question one of the filmmaker's most radical and imaginative works released at the peak of his powers featuring a great deal of wit warmth and human emotion alongside irreverent moments of personal homage silliness and surrealism.The film opens on a train as a ticking clock fills the soundtrack. Allen's character Sandy Bates sits helpless in the carriage surrounded by ugly depressed looking people who stare back at him with dead eyes. As he looks out of the window he sees another carriage this time filled with beautiful revelling sophisticates all cheering and waving. Sandy tries desperately to convince the conductor to let him off the train so that he can switch carriages but his pleas fall on deaf ears. As he tries frantically to signal to the other train a beautiful woman kisses the glass and laughs as Sandy's train pulls away from the station. The next shot shows the ugly depressed people from the train wandering through a garbage dump recalling elements of The Seventh Seal 1957 and One Plus One 1968 before the film reaches the end of the reel and we realise that what we are seeing is a film within a film. The sequence works on a number of levels  firstly as an extended homage to Fellini's 8  1963 establishing the theme of filmmaking and the games within the narrative etc. Secondly it is a comment on the nature of the character and on life itself with none of the characters satisfied with the situations that they're in and always wanting something more. Lastly the scene establishes the tone of the film being every bit as stark surreal and enigmatic as anything by Bergman Fellini Godard etc  with the comment on mortality on artist expression and on the journey of life  but is also incredibly funny.Unlike later films of Allen that were more mature and more serious intone than the early funny ones like for example Crimes and Misdemeanours 1988 or Husbands and Wives 1992 Stardust Memory is a film rich in absurd humour imagination fun and frivolity whilst also containing some of Allen's most moving and intelligent ideas. I'd liken it to a combination of the aforementioned 8  and elements of the Coen Brothers' last definitive film The Man Who Wasn't There 2001 which would seem to have taken influence from certain elements depicted here. As a comment on the struggle of the filmmaker and the argument of art over commerce Allen is entirely ruthless turning the backroom nature of film production into a leering Fellinilike circus of stupidity banality and contempt for the audience. At one point Allen's character is being berated by the studio heads for turning in a film that is pretentious selfindulgent and unfunny while carefully positioned in front of the famous Eddie Adams photograph of the execution of Vietcong prisoner Nguyn Vn Lm creating a tragic echo of that later scene which foreshadowed the murder of John Lennon.It also shows the absurdity of filmmaking and the pressure for Sandy to return to former glories and produce work simply to satisfy the masses. Although Allen claims that there are no elements of autobiography in his work I think he is wrong. Even if does it unconsciously without thinking it's impossible to see Stardust Memories and not see it as a comment on the critical and commercial failure of his earlier film Interiors 1978. With that particular project Allen was able to turn to the massive success of Annie Hall 1977 into producing a more sombre and serious film with heavy references to both Bergman and Chekhov. The film was a critical failure and led into the production of Manhattan 1979 one of Allen's most celebrated and iconic films but one that he apparently wanted to have destroyed. Many of these personal issues can be seen in the character of Sandy who is struggling through life like the rest of us and yet is expected to entertain. At one point he argues that it's impossible to be funny with so much sadness in the world whilst simultaneously creating a film that is very funny as well as somewhat moving. The second element of the film deals with the memory of Sandy's troubled relationship with tortured manic depressive Dorrie. The relationship is sensitively handled and brilliantly performed by Charlotte Rampling who conveys the fears desired dread and anxiety of this character on a path to selfdestruction.In the final act of the film the walls between life and death fact and fiction fantasy and memory all come tumbling down as Allen creates a kaleidoscope of elements all reoccurring from previous sequences in the film. The colourful characters all chosen for their often unique physical features that are further distorted by the skewed black and white cinematography of Gordon Willis also adds to the film's somewhat stark and surreal approach which is filled with imaginative visual composition intelligent production and location design elements of wild fantasy and abstract absurdist humour. By the end of the film we no longer know if what we've experienced is real literal or a theoretical film within a film but we know the experience has been a unique one.".

	schema:headline " Woody Allen's MidLife Crisis THE MOVIE";
	schema:reviewBody "It's no secret that Woody Allen tends to make his films somewhat autobiographical of his own life and personal experiences but Stardust Memories takes it to the next level. It is basically a complete reflection of Allen's state of mind in 1980. The movie is about a film director named Sandy Bates who is starting to have anxiety about what he is doing for a living and starts to question its purpose. He goes into a retrospective recluse about his previous work and begins to recall all the things that influence his love of film. I wasn't alive in 1980 and I didn't know Woody Allen in 1980 but if you can't call this autobiographical to the extreme I don't know what you can.Stardust Memories is an odd film because it really has no storyline. It is told in an anecdotal narrative style as Bates recalls different moments in his life as new moments arise and influence him. He considers all the different oddities that inspired him to make the popular films he's made. There are a lot of different women in Bates' life and they all have various amounts of influence on him as a filmmaker and the whole film is told through these stories about women he's encountered or loved in the past. After a while you start to think what is the point of all this? The film doesn't seem to be going anywhere after a while and it all boils down to just a lot of retrospect and internal conflict more than anything else. It feels as though Woody Allen made this film for himself rather than anybody else. And there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that but to the viewer it's not very appealing.One of the biggest issues with this film is that Woody Allen's character Sandy Bates isn't likable. He's a complete narcissist and is completely full of himself. He doesn't necessarily convey it outwardly dramatically but he has a constant aura of egotistical jerk that is impossible to really connect with. He feels detached from the world and it makes it difficult to relate to his conflict but that really just goes back to the fact that this is a film for Woody not a film for the audience. And that's a paradox that just doesn't work with me and it only made me feel like this film was a waste of time.Artistically this film doesn't have a whole lot going for it either. It has your typical Woody Allen nuances but not to the level that some of his other great films have. It doesn't stick to one specific style and its thoughts seem a little scattered. It is shot in black and white which was interesting but eventually got to the point where it served no purpose. Visually there was nothing in this film that gave me that fascination or 'wow' reaction that Allen's films typically incite in me. There are undoubtedly some well designed moments of the film with shots that made me nod my head in appreciation but it doesn't have that consistent visual style that other Woody Allen films have.Allen was 45 years old when he made this film. I think you could definitely call it his midlife crisis movie. All of the thoughts that were whizzing around in Allen's mind at that point in his neurotic life are conveyed and put into a script through Stardust Memories. For Allen I'm sure this film was a huge success that probably helped him sort through his life and allow his mind to clamber out of that jumbled crisis it was going through. But for me as the viewer I didn't get much of anything out of this film. Allen's intentions were clear but the movie felt like a waste of time.".

	schema:headline " Certainly one of the most autobiographical films from the Woodman";
	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen likes his privacy.  He rarely gives any access to the media or his audience yet he's aware they exist and once in a while he makes a movie like Stardust Memories where he speaks to them.  Following the maturing success of Annie Hall and Manhattan Woody decided to address the segment of fans who were clamoring for his early funny films.  As filmmaker Sandy Bates Woody attends a film festival in his honor where he reflects back on his cinematic career and love life the latter of which concentrates on two French women.  As usual Woody claimed years after that this film was not autobiographical.  It's probable that some details in the story were constructed or exaggerated for dramatic effect.  Still with Woody's evident evolving as an artist coupled with references to his own life studying magic as a child the numerous fans praising his early funny films it's clear that some of these thoughts mirror Woody's real life.  These innerreservations may not be as incendiary as the ones presented in the wonderfully blistering Deconstructing Harry but they are genuinely honest  and resentful.There are two types of Woody Allen films his New York films and his experimental Europeaninfluenced films perhaps a third style would be when he blends the two together.  Stardust Memories would definitely qualify as one of his experimental European films.  Despite the lush blackandwhite photography of Manhattan cinematographer Gordon Willis and the allaround nuanced performances most certainly Jessica Harper and Helen Hanft above all others this is a strange journey the viewer takes in the film.  What transpires is essentially a film within a film within another film but Woody rolls it out wonderfully especially the ending or rather the endingwithinanendingwithinanending.  Given the usual intelligence and intellectualism in Woody's films criticizing the audience may seem offputting but he should be allowed to once in a while.  Sandy is a relatively normal person whose fame and success breeds hangerson and freeloaders.  Critics are rightfully portrayed here as selfserving media whores a critic asks a cutting question that implies plagiarizing Vincent Price and then gives a I'vegothimnow wink and Sandy's fans are seen as selfish inarticulate leeches Would you sign my left breast?  I love your films sir you have such a degenerate mind!.  It is not lost on Woody for a moment that Stardust Memories may be criticized as the work of a narcissist documenting his personal pain and fobbing it off as art so he has someone say so within the first ten minutes of the film.  Smart move!What is so strange about this film are the facial features of several characters.  Many of the critics and audience members appear with elongated beards pudgy noses raised eyebrows and oversized glasses.  It always makes me curious when I see the film whether Woody is implying that he only remembers the strangelooking people in his audience or if he sees all of them in a skewered manner.  In a way I hope I never learn which is the truth I enjoy the mystery of it and it's always a good sign when a movie raises questions.  The QA sequences the discussion with the aliens and Sandy's crashing of a Scifi convention are absolutely genius.  This is definitely a film for the more hardcore Woody fans but I think it remains of of his most essential and so does he.".

He's a very successful filmmaker and is hounded by autograph seekers wherever he goes. While at a film festival honoring his work Bates reflects on his life and relationships and also what direction to take his career into. The studio hates his new film and want it changed. Sound familiar? It should. Charlotte Rampling plays Dorrie who is Bates girlfriend and MarieChristine Barrault is a woman that Bates has always been in love with and she has just left her husband and taken the kids with her. You can't argue the fact that this is self indulgent as a lot of the critics of this film have complained about. But its suppose to be. I was a little annoyed at some of the turns that the film took and I never really understood the whole UFO watcher segment. Allen does a good job of showing the problems of being a celebrity like the never ending autograph hounds that pop in every situation when he's trying to say something important to someone. It also shows his frustration at the studios who complain that he's not funny enough and want to take control of his own film. But these points are made early and then the rest of the film gets at times repetitive. Yes we know you don't want to make funny movies anymore because your depressed at the world. One of the fun things about this film is Spotting the star. Daniel Stern Amy Wright Anne DeSalvo Brent Spiner Cynthia Gibb and Sharon Stone makes her film debut as the party woman on the train. Not nearly as bad as some have been saying and it does reflect on Woody's conscience. Over the years this film is probably more interesting than when it first came out. Still a must for Allen fans and I think others will have to take their chances on this reflective film.".

The scenes are beautifully framed full of color and contrast. All I felt that was missing was a control pad between my fingers and the freedom to take the character around the village to search for hidden treasure. If the movie leaves you scratching your head a little at the end you are not alone. However I suspect that it implies that a sequel is in the works and I am in favor for that.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ong Bak 2";
	schema:reviewBody "There's no doubt I've been a fan of movies starring Tony Jaa with the likes of Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong being showcases for the Muay Thai brand of martial arts and I fondly remember those hard hitting action sequences that left me gaping as well as the numerous replays just to drum it through to you that it's all Jaa and it's all as incredible as can be. And who can forget the latter film with that amazing single take where Jaa had to pound his way from the bottom of a building right to the top? Ong Bak 2 is a film fans like myself have been waiting for despite it being marred by some really strange controversy which also included Jaa walking off the set and disappearing from production. But everything's been sorted I guess for the film to be completed and finally released.While it's rocking the box office in Thailand I wonder whether it's because of the controversies that had piqued everyone's interest or it's because the long break of 3 years had made everyone salivate at Jaa's long awaited return to the big screen. I wonder because while there are numerous moments in the film that I thoroughly enjoyed I felt that it fell short too on other areas that had left me shifting in my seat especially during the first hour. And the biggest culprit of it all would be the ending. Tony Jaa wrote this story and credit to him too in trying to weave together some semblance of a worthy story instead of the more obvious and easier whackfest end to end. But the ending was somewhat of a cop out and a disappointment as it leads potentially and very directly to a third movie to resolve the issues the storyline had left hanging. It could have easily stretched it to say 20 minutes more to get everything settled but I guess there were grander plans to the tale that needed another movie to tell. One only wishes that it does get made sooner rather than later and without the production woes that plagued this one.So Ong Bak 2 is actually half a movie and given that it's a totally new story to begin with I thought it would make better sense in retitling it rather than to have a misnomer that it's a sequel. After all the setting is now back in 15th century Thailand with totally new characters with Jaa playing Tien a man of royal lineage who's trying to avenge the death of his parents and entire household under the hands of rival warlords and a masked man who delivered the killing blow to his dad. The first half of the movie had him learn from a band of bandits called the Garuda Wing Cliff where a number of highly skilled exponents teach him all there is to know about their respective fields. I remembered having read somewhere that there's supposed to be some fusion of dance and martial arts which didn't transpire in this film as far as I can tell the danceaction sequence here doesn't make the cut so it might be left for the next movie instead.Compared to the other Tony Jaa movies you can see that the production values here have been ramped up tremendously.Techniques have also matured and gone are the repetitive playbacks. But that doesn't mean you're going to lose out because like any selfrespecting martial arts film the camera stays still when it should be and at a sane distance away to capture all the action comfortably and the editing doesn't cut in and mess up the sequence. While the filmmaker in Tony Jaa would have matured with this outing he codirected this his maturity as a martial artist on film is now without a doubt. We only get flashes of his Muay Thai when it calls for some close combat involving elbows and knees right smack in the kisser otherwise we see Jaa as a more complete martial arts practitioner with the employment of a vast array of weapons from swords to threesectionstaffs and a host of recognizable kungfu moves one which also pays homage to the Drunken Fists and I applaud Jaa's rendition of it too. As for the revered elephant you know it's never far behind and there's one thrilling battle atop the large mammal with Dance Chupong no less albeit hidden behind a mask.Ong Bak 2 picked up very slowly and spent significant time developing the back story of Jaa's Tien. And unfortunately I do admit unabashedly that I was waiting for action sequence one after another and those in the same boat will have to be patient. For action junkies your appetite will only be satiated in the last act of the film where it's vintage Jaa as he dishes out punishment and receives much of the same in return. I detested the ending which wrapped everything up so conveniently I don't buy the Karma bit or left subplots such as the romantic angle as something to be dwelled upon later though I believe romance never really was an issue at all in Jaa's movies leaving doors wide open for another film.Perhaps I should reserve my judgement of it until the next movie completes the story? So at this moment we can still enjoy what Tony Jaa has prepared for action fans worldwide  a showcase that he's not just all about Muay Thai but a bona fide action hero who's the real deal crafting a myriad of incredible fight sequences that would still leave your mouth gaping wide open.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1431 the Kingdom of Ayutthayan conquers the territory of Sukhothai expanding their lands to East. The noble Lord Siha Decho is betrayed by his Captain Rajasena and is murdered together with his wife. However their son Tien is saved by one loyal soldier and left alone in the woods. Later he is captured by slave traders but he is rescued by Chernang the leader of a group of thieves from Garuda Wing. He learns martial arts and arms and becomes a leader of the thieves but he leaves the gang seeking revenge against Rajasena. Ong Bak 2 is a good epic with a nonoriginal storyline but a magnificent choreography of fights and art direction. The plot is predictable but very entertaining supported by the ability of Tony Jaa in martial arts and the conclusion seems to be the beginning of an unnecessary sequel. My vote is eight.Title Brazil OngBak 2".

	schema:headline " A completely different beast than Jaa's earlier work";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone going in expecting action at the same level of ONG BAK or TOM YUM GOONG aka THE PROTECTOR will be somewhat disappointed. This is a whole different kind of movie really. Rarely does Tony Jaa show off the flips that made him famous. The first hour has a few fights here and there but for the most part they are short but very brutal. Tony does do lots of different styles in here and my favorite part from this first hour is when he tests himself against three different guys a swordsman a kung fu man and a muay thai brawler.The last 20 minutes is where a majority of the action is and it is pretty insane. Jaa takes on about 30 ninjas and whoops some major ass here. The scenes are very very bloody as well. And of course they have to have the scene where an elephant saves the day. Dan Chupong's role is very small but a great part. He is dressed like a crow and kaws just like one. He has a very impressive stunt where he flips onto Tony who is laid out on the elephant's tusks and hits him right in the chest with his knees.All that said I think it is a very well made film. It has incredible production values and the level of detail is fantastic. Jaa is 20 times more talented as a director than Prachya Pinkaew. He knows how to build the mood and shoots everything in an almost sinister light. As a film it is much more accomplished than ONG BAK and TOM YUM GOONG. But I know people will definitely be disappointed in the amount of action especially after a 3 year wait. Oh also it does end with a cliffhanger that sets up a third film. I hope we don't have to wait another 3 years!".

	schema:headline " Extremely Authentic and Superbly Entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "As much as I enjoyed the original Ong Bak 2003 there were moments that felt like it was attempting to mimic bigbudget action movies from other parts of the world e.g. the motorbike chase which was kinda lame. The script was also a bit bland in places. Still a great action flick but it left some room for improvement.Enter Ong Bak 2 which improves upon its predecessor in every conceivable way. The most obvious enhancements are the cinematography and set designs which are phenomenal. The highlight sequence in this regard must be the night time dance which emphasizes golden architecture and beautiful clothing that reminds one of the striking visuals that are showcased in Zhang Yimou's films. All is not so clean however because the environments add a significant amount of authenticity with an unending assault of gritty dirty primal village imagery amidst the forests of Thailand. One simply cannot overstate the spectacular images presented herein and many reviewers seem to have undervalued the amazing cultural contributions that Ong Bak 2 has to offer because nonThai viewers will be transported to an unfamiliar world that not only exhibits rough geographical locations but an equally rough and incredibly diverse band of bizarre threatening characters that are attentiongrabbing for virtually every second they're on screen e.g. the whitehaired mystic the pirates the darkskinned wrestler the crow man etc.. When all is said and done this film genuinely captures Thai culture from start to finish with no pandering to foreign influence outside of some martial arts styles.And that my dear friends is the crux of why Ong Bak 2 so very easily surpasses its predecessor. Many of the nonaction scenes are riveting and interesting to watch which is something one cannot say about Ong Bak or even the brilliant Tom Yum Goong for that matter which successfully used an absurd quantity of superbly executed action sequences to overpower any and all deficiencies that nest inbetween the beatings. This is not to say that the script of Ong Bak 2 is far better than Jaa's previous movies because the conclusion is in desperate need for a direct sequel that wraps up the fates of the surviving antagonists as well as the lead protagonist. Nevertheless the visuals character interactions and primary conflicts provide constant entertainment on a minute by minute basis. This movie doesn't even need action to sustain interest and if that's not a glaring sign that Tony Jaa has already surpassed Bruce Lee as a cinematic entertainer then nothing is.It is somewhat surprising to read some of the negative reviews that bash the storyline to bits without resorting to any specific observations whatsoever. It might be useful to provide some details as to why you think the story is so atrociously bad because I can't see all that much to complain about other than the imperfect ending. While true that Ong Bak 2 is more concerned with portraying character interaction than a traditional storyline the events depicted are coherent. Either way there are a ton of memorable scenes. Take the opening segments in the alligator pit where the pirate throws the young protagonist a knife to see if he can survive on his own instead of the pirate simply saving him. It's a great scene that adequately establishes a mutual respect between the characters as well as the raw potential of the lead protagonist.I can't believe I've written this much without delving into the martial arts choreography which is excellent. Is it as good as Tom Yum Goong in terms of quantity and precise movements? Probably not  but then again Tom Yum Goong is virtually impossible to top in that regard. However Ong Bak 2 does provide an impressive assortment of styles that are seamlessly integrated into the action. Jaa's character doesn't randomly switch between attack styles like some other reviewers have erroneously asserted. On the contrary his transition from one fighting technique to the next is triggered by the availability of particular weapons as well as the attack strategies of his opponents. For example if you ever find yourself near a threesectioned staff while fighting a number of enemies it might make sense to use it to your advantage.It's really nice to see that Jaa so capably expands into new realms and implements modifications to his strengths as a physical performer to yield refreshing nonrepetitive movies that are easily distinguishable from one another. I'll take this guy's movies over a lot of the big budget garbage currently coming out of China those historical epics are just awful and I hope that he continues to make Thai films exclusively in the near future. Although I do admit that a project with a capable Hong Kong costar like Wu Jing or Donnie Yen would definitely get my blood pumping.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tony Jaa is back in his first directorial effort codirecting to be more specific and the man delivers everything you would expect from a solid martial arts flick and then some more. The spiritual sequel to Ong Bak is quite an ambitious film showing a wide diversity of fighting styles using ancient thai history as the background. Jaa has certainly done his homework because the movie has a strong old school HK vibe but with a crude and gritty look. The plot is pretty much your standard martial artsshaw bros 101 premise hero takes revenge of his fallen comradesfamily and so on he begins as a weak victim to transform into a kickass machine. Nothing that any respectable MA movie aficionado haven't seen before but the movie does it right and believable enough to engage the viewer. Not a complex story but the motivations of the characters are convincing enough to move things on.The fight sequences are effective never repetitive and quite intense. I mean if you can't enjoy a movie that has everything from crocodile fights to ninjas samurais elephants people fighting like crows and leopards a guy that throws daggers and another guy that uses explosives then you might want to report back to mother ship because the goods of this planet are just too much for you. The abrupt ending while anticlimatic doesn't kill the mood of the film.Far better from what anyone could expect no idea why this go trashed by some people. Is no classic but it's a perfectly decent time waster. Which is more from what it can be say about other movies stuffing multiplexes these days.".

Tony Jaa is one of the most talented most gifted martial artist in the entire planet the best since Bruce Lee or the young Jackie Chan. When I saw the Ong bak 2003 I was literally went nuts. The fighting scenes were more then awesome that was something new something that you didn't see every day. Then came the Protector. More and even better action more fury and more fun. Okay.  I wondered  How can they top this? I mean you saw Tony Jaa kickin' ass and kickin' more ass what's next? Go back to the golden ages of martial art flicks and see how an instant classic movie done. Now you have Tony Jaa as a director and a star. The movie takes years and years ago and it's about a young martial artist. The camera work is superb the soundtrack is fantastic and the most important thing the fighting scenes are absolutely nuts! I mean damn great! If you saw all of the Bruce Leefilms and Jet Li's entire filmography you still didn't see anything like this before. There are sword fights fights with bare hands and elbows and there are kicks punches cuts THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING! The final fight scene is just EPIC you will cheer and scream and you want to see it again. You will have a geekgasm my friend!".

Tony Jaa is one of the most talented most gifted martial artist in the entire planet the best since Bruce Lee or the young Jackie Chan. When I saw the Ong bak 2003 I was literally went nuts. The fighting scenes were more then awesome that was something new something that you didn't see every day. Then came the Protector. More and even better action more fury and more fun. Okay.  I wondered  How can they top this? I mean you saw Tony Jaa kickin' ass and kickin' more ass what's next? Go back to the golden ages of martial art flicks and see how an instant classic movie done. Now you have Tony Jaa as a director and a star. The movie takes years and years ago and it's about a young martial artist. The camera work is superb the soundtrack is fantastic and the most important thing the fighting scenes are absolutely nuts! I mean damn great! If you saw all of the Bruce Leefilms and Jet Li's entire filmography you still didn't see anything like this before. There are sword fights fights with bare hands and elbows and there are kicks punches cuts THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING! The final fight scene is just EPIC you will cheer and scream and you want to see it again. You will have a geekgasm my friend!";

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be blunt this movie left me upset an unfulfilled. The action sequences were amazing and showed off all of Tony Jaa's phenomenal skills in both weapons and acrobatics. However over directing bad pacing a meandering story and over production destroyed this movie. I realize that this is Tony Jaa's first directing job and he had a lot of pressure to turn out a good product but that doesn't mean that basic directing should be thrown out. Every scene in the movie was too dramatic and too over the top. What made Ong Bak 1 so great was its simple story line and directing. The predecessor felt more raw and real. Ong Bak 2 has neither elements and what you get is a jumbled mess that overloads your senses to the point of boredom. Half way through the movie I got tired of seeing water droplets and different zoom levels. It hurt to watch after a while because the directing took away from enjoying the fight sequences.Bad writing and pacing are hallmarks of Thai movies and this was no different. Ong Bak 1 had a very simple story line of a man just trying to get back a relic. In the process he makes friends who change and develop with him. In the end there's a triumphant ending and we all go home happy. In this movie the story is so unorganized you don't know what's going on. Long scenes are spent to develop characters but nothing is ever resolved. They spent 1015 minutes developing the female lead only to conclude it with some eye contact and him running off. Nothing is resolved and plot holes are a plenty. The ending spoiler alert is him just dying. After 90 minutes of fighting he just dies and we are taught a lesson about how not to let revenge consume us. That's it. The ending scene is a 20 spectacle on par with Tony Jaa's spiral stair sequence scene from The Protector. However this just randomly ends with him getting killed. The story and ending left me upset and unfulfilled. Tony Jaa again tried to do too much and ended up with too little.The production in this movie is epic. There are costumes settings and sequences that are a feast for the eyes. They also cost a lot of money and were completely unneeded. I know that Tony Jaa wanted to show off the splendor of Thai culture but a lot of the extravagant scenes did not add to the story and were a waste. The production in this movie easily explains on why this movie ran out of money so many times. Did they really need fake fire and CGI for a grand palace? No they didn't they needed a coherent story line. Simply put they should have spent money on other things besides sets and costumes maybe something like a complete movie.Many of us watch these movies for the martial arts and action sequences. So how good were they? It was honestly a mixed bag. His over directing really takes away from this experience. The directing didn't allow me to enjoy his acrobatic leaps and kicks which is the fun of action movies. Tony Jaa's vision was to create a movie that combines martial arts from around the world to create an ultimate fighter. The way they present the scenes make all the different styles distinct. Tiang explicitly switches from one style to another and every time he does the directing makes it apparent. As a result the action feels very forced. Tony Jaa although very good at his new styles he seems very uncomfortable when using different styles that are not Muay Thai. The best action sequences and the times he feels the most comfortable are when he is using Muay Thai. As a martial artist who has studied martial arts from around the world also I combine these different arts into my own style. As a result what I do feels natural to me and looks natural in the way I fight. In separating all the fighting styles it took away from showing off Tony Jaa's true skill made the movie feel a little forced. They are all still amazing sequences and he a great martial artist but it could have been better with a different approach.All in all Ong Bak 2 was a disappointment for me. The bad story and horrible pacing sequences of stories and action were not connected most of the time leaving you just annoyed really did this movie in for me. Furthermore over directing and over production made things worse by creating an over budget uncompleted movie. The action sequences although entertaining lacked the tension and drive of his previous movies. They felt like scenes that were there just to keep the movie going and the character had no really purpose in doing them. I can only hope that Tony Jaa's next endeavor goes back to basics and makes something good again. If you read down below it's a summary of the rest of the movie that was cut. You'll see scenes from the trailer that didn't make it in the movie namely him in the white outfit. Read it if you want to understand what Tony Jaa's entire vision was. This could have been a better movie if it had been entirely shot but not that much better. Either way this movie is going to make a lot of money and a lot of people will see it. He'll still be rich and famous so I really can't feel all that bad for the.".

This is not so if you pay attention. Others might think that listening to the Thai language it annoying and so on. I disagree it is a very unique sounding language and I tend to watch it with English Subtitles although I'm sure you can just change the Audio to English or some other language which suits you better.This is a highly anticipated sequel to an AMAZING movie. But don't expect the plot to mesh or be in any way similar to the 1st.SEE ALSO ONG BAK The Thai Warrior.

	schema:reviewBody "The best thing that can be said about OngBak 2 The Beginning is that it never repeats itself even though it has plenty of chances to with plenty of bonecrunching and dazzling repeated jumpkicks to the head. This film marks the directorial debut of the recent Thai sensation Tony Jaa sharing a codirecting credit with his mentor Panna Rittikrai who made his big splash on the international martial arts circuit in 2005 with the breakout success of OngBak The Thai Warrior 2003.But don't let this film's title fool you. OngBak 2 The Beginning has nothing to do with OngBak The Thai Warrior except the fact that the two films share part of the same name. Instead Beginning is a prequel of sorts to its predecessor and its somewhat ambiguous ending will provide some hint of continuity between the two films. Other than that the two films have nothing to do with each other.The big story here of course is Tony Jaa. The man can do incredible things with his body incredible things that hurt me just thinking about them. True to all of his previous efforts there's no wirework or computergenerated imagery to aid in the impossible bonecrunching stunts. It's all oldfashioned guys jumping around and hurting each other like they do this stuff for a living which they do.Unlike his previous efforts however OngBak 2 The Beginning has a story however disjointed and surreal it is with a little bit of Asian mysticism thrown in for good measure but it is a story. Set in feudal Thailand all the previous films had contemporary settings Tien Jaa was a young child when he saw his parents murdered by a traitorous warlord and his personal army of soldiers and hired killers. Sold into slavery but saved by a clan of piratesguerrilla fighters he is then trained in the ways of many different forms of martial arts and weapon styles from all over Asia. Later as a young man he sets out on his own personal quest of vengeance against the corrupt warlord that orphaned him.Really OngBak 2 The Beginning is not a bad film at all just an uneven one. I'm mainly referring to the film's story which often switches between the past and the present and can become somewhat confusing. But this is a martial arts movie so a good story can be viewed by some as being inconsequential to the fights. The film has many phenomenal action setpieces that really make expert use of Jaa's penchant for crushingbreaking bones acrobatic stuntwork and mastery of many different fighting styles. It's all brutal stuff but there's something extremely graceful and beautiful about it it's almost like watching a martial arts ballet if there ever was such a thing. The film also makes excellent use of its ancient Thailand setting in a nutshell this is Jaa's bestlooking film yet. It really takes you to an ancient place and it's really beautiful the way the imagery sticks in your mind. And with the cinematography costumes and production design it is probably one of the bestlooking martial arts movies ever made.OngBak 2 is a good entertaining martial arts action flick nothing more. The movie will have you cringing in your seat at some of things you see and hear. But it's all good fun and games.810".

	schema:headline " Technically brilliant action detracted from by poor plot and an overly serious tone that it doesn't justify";
	schema:reviewBody "Normally I would open with a plot summary when I write a review  not always but a lot of the time. With Ong Bak 2 I'm not sure I can be bothered or even that I should be because the plot here is so thin and so uninvolving that it is hardly worth the text. Essentially a child is rescued by pirates and grows up to be a great fighter robbing and killing as they do. However when memories are triggered of his past he sets out for revenge  bringing secrets out into the open. In fairness in those last two sentences I have made it sound more interesting than it actually is because I have suggested there is a flow to the narrative whereas in actuality the film is two of three stages that just suddenly move between one and the other. It is remarkably basic and in terms of plot remarkably poor. It isn't helped either by the fact that the entire film has a very serious dark tone to it  making it almost a weighty revenge tragedy. Now I have no problem with that in theory but the problem here is that it doesn't do anything to justify that tone nor does it do much to make it fit.It really needed the characters to be engaging and real for the audience to care but there are no characters to talk about. Amazingly even the main character of Tiang is poorly developed. A massive part of this is the small amount of dialogue in the film  indeed by the time you have read to the bottom of this review you will have read more words than are spoken in this film. Of course silent films could still make a plot a character so it is not the end of the world but it does hurt the film because with a weak plot and weak characters the lack of dialogue is even more telling. Fortunately the one saving grace of the film fills the vast majority of the running time  the action. Aside from the sombre moments between scenes there are plenty of great action sequences involving weapons of all types. They are impressive and quite exciting at times and the only rider I would put on that is that they are not as much fun as the action has been in some of Jaa's other films. That said it is worth seeing the film for the action alone  which when you think about it is just as well.In terms of Jaa himself one really has to wonder what he is doing with his career because if films are to be his thing moving forward then why does he appear to be going backwards in all of the aspects this involves excepting the action? In his previous films I have noted he is not very comfortable with lines and that any comic moment escapes him. Here it feels like those working with him have just given up totally and have allowed him to do little other than fight  he barely has a line in the film and any plotcharacter development stuff is done by the child playing his character while Jaa himself looks into a fire in a remembering pose. It is weird but it is part of the reason the film doesn't engage as much as I had hoped  because the main character is little other than a stunt man albeit a very good stunt man. I'm sure fans will hate me for that and not see my point but the thing is if he is going to continue making films in Thailand far less films that can perform abroad then he needs more than the impressive martial arts skills he has. He needs good vehicles he needs to work on his many weaknesses as an actor and he needs to have a supporting cast that can fill the gaps that he cannot such as in Ong Bak. At the moment Ong Bak 2 just looks like they are happy to film him fighting and leave it at that which I think is a real shame because this only makes for great action  not a great film. Although he did a good job directing the film in some regards this is probably a mistake because he cannot do anything about his own failings as a performer.Ong Bak 2 is a technically brilliant martial arts film with plenty for the weapons fan to love. However as a film it is really quite poor thanks to a thin plot little dialogue and even less in the way of characters. The action makes it worth seeing but even fans will be hoping for a bit of a better product built around this. I continue to pay out to import Jaa's films because he is great at what he does but I hope that he can improve in other areas to make better total films rather than this type of thing again.".

Yes thats not a mistake... not only was the scriptreading done as if they had 2 days to finish but the script itself was bad to begin with. The whole film just feels very cheesy because of these things.That said the action is not bad just not as good as his other more famous movies and there were other redeemable things to the movie.

Ong Bak 2 wasn't horrible like the other reviewer mentioned unless you were going into the theater thinking it was going to be Ong Bak 1 all over again. Kind of like Martial Arts meets Die Hard lol. This wasn't the case. Yes the movie is dim at times but obviously that's the way they wanted it to be for certain scenes and it certainly doesn't last long. It's got pretty good action but the story is the weakest link. It's not well thought out and maybe that's because Tony and his mentor wrote it.

	schema:reviewBody "Many a film has had it's fair share of problems but I doubt many films show that so obviously as ONG BAK 2. The comparison to the first is null and void as it is a completely different movie from ONG BAK. I suspect it only has the title so that western audiences will be interested in seeing the movie as the first was so successful. So what do we have? A period movie set many centuries before the first film and is focused around a very troubled time in Thai history where the country was at war with itself. Tony plays Teean a young nobleman who is sent away by his father to be taught traditional dance at a school while he tries to fend off an opposing army who is attempting to take over his kingdom. Sadly all isn't as it should be and his parents are betrayed killed and he is left to fend for himself. He is soon sold into slavery and when he does not cooperate with his captors he is thrown into a crocodile pit to fight for entertainment. Luckily though a band of pirates come to plunder and rescue him after witnessing his raw talent for survival. He is then taught many forms of martial arts by the pirates and displays a huge talent in different fighting styles including kung fu and weapons. I won't give too much away after that but what is clear is that as a first directorial debut Tony bit off way more than he could chew. Plot wise the film begins to go shaky at the 50 minute mark opting instead to go nuts on fighting sequences rather than tie the plot down. It soon becomes apparent that while being so into the fighting Tony pushes the plot aside and the film becomes almost illegible to understand at points. The film then began to go grossly over budget causing the production company to put pressure on Tony to get it back in line and he soon cracked. It was reported in Thailand that Tony then decided after almost destroying his friendship with choreographer and mentor Pannai to disappear in the middle of production. Some of the rumours circulated were that he joined a monastery to practice black magic doubtful and that he had retreated to a cave to pray and meditate. He returned after a short while and made a tearful apology to the Thai public on TV vowing to finish what he had started. So what was the outcome? A sumptuous period film with fantastic cinematography and visuals but a serious lack of identity. The final third act is almost non existent kidnapped by a massive over the top and spectacular action sequence. The film really needed to be wrapped up though and they managed to tack on an almost to be continued ending hoping to carry on the plot and hopefully drag back some credability that was lost in production. But I will say that this is a far cry from ong bak and tum yum goong something I wasn't expecting and it's all the better for it. Tony wows with the mixed martial arts he trained so hard to perfect for the film. He pays homage to many of his heroes like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan in some of the fight sequences including a drunken master set piece thats pretty brutal compared to Jackie's style. It lacks a lot of the acrobatics of his previous two outings but replaces them with intricate choreography and brutal weaponry. I was worried after tum yum goong that he may begin to run out of ideas and rely on previous success to sell the flick but he is clearly willing to step up to the plate and be far more ballsy than I gave him credit for. I wish they could have finished the movie properly or handed directing over to someone who had more experience because now we will have to wait for ONG BAK 3 apparently its been agreed to seek the real ending as I feel I cannot fairly review the film until then. But on the whole as long as you can forgive the shoddy plot just sit back and watch some real eye candy. The visuals and martial arts are better than any film that has come from Thailand already. I just hope this doesn't put people off of watching the third when it's released...".

	schema:reviewBody "The action is phenomenal as expected Tony Jada delivers the goods like he always has been. He takes a lot of bumps again and the stunt work is amazing though people who have seen his previous work and expect the same will be a bit disappointed there isn't much left from the former fanciness of stunts for example this time around we don't see amazing slides under sharp objects vehicles dodging through narrow alleys  breaking motorcycle helmets with a knee or jumping off exploding glass walls anymore.Instead tony Jada presents us with an huge array of different martial art forms gone are the days of straight Muay Thai action.That seems to be a let down for some fans but at the end of the day it's all about giving a good show and hell how Mr. Jaa delivers this time around.We see a vast array of Chinese Japanese and Western styles of martial arts. For an instance we get a showcase of drunken boxinga Jackie Chan homage no doubt bits of Judo Japanese sword fighting Chinese weapon styles Chinese Gung Fuvarious styles and of course Muay Thai. These are for show mind you and shouldn't be judged from point like the effectivenesswhy are those guys running into his fists all the time? It's a movie and not a K1 bout or a test of might that should be considered. But what really impressed me is the art direction every character shown is unique in its own way countless goons that run into Tony Jaa's character and get beaten come off in such diversity.We have sword wielding ninjas angry tribal men a vampire womanI am serious a fighter who is a crowman hybridwhat the hell  angry pirates shiny royal guards et cetera. You get the picture under normal circumstances this would be considered as cheesy and flamboyant but here it works they are presented with such style and flashiness you got to love em.Particularly because all these random characters are a reverence of the good old days of shaw brothers kung fu movies. Those silly characters are just fun to look at. They bring back memories of times long forgotten and I am glad that somebody has the guts to show what was necessary to make kung fu a piece of art again we loved the DRUNKEN MASTER THE ONE ARMED BOXER THE YELLOW HELL OF THE SHAOLIN and THE MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINEjust to name a few for their memorable characters. That brings me to the point the costumes are really well done nothing seemed to look cheap or cheesy that shows what can be done with such a little budgetcompared to the big studios we have in the west Hollywood should learn from that. the wigs looked a bit off from time to time but you know it wasn't terrible.now lets get to the story well don't expect much here it's not the Manchurian candidate or the firm or something in that vein. It's a fantasy martial arts action movie. the story is very basic it's a revenge story. a noble whose parents got violently murdered seeks out the culprit in order to avenge his parents and claim his rightful place on the throne. nothing fancy here though this movie is a historic fantasy movie we will get glimpses of Thai culture .I didn't expect a take on Shakespeare anyway and I sincerely hope that most people who like these kind of movies don't expect something outstanding in the dialog or story department for that matter. Of course some directors try to sugarcoat their movies with overdone dreadful artistic visuals and poorly written meta plots such as hero or house of the flying daggers don't get me wrong I like Jet Li and Tony Leung but I am not fan of this westernized martial arts movie concept. more show then face value. This movie suffers in some parts from the same concept slow mo raindrops etc. and some weird meta plots it's certainly a bit annoying though in defense of the movie it isn't nearly as overdone and distracting as in Zhang Yimou 's movies. Thus I can easily live with that.Dialogs? What dialog? Tony Jaa speaks only a very few lines in the entire movie maybe two or three i can't remember the rest consists of glares gasps war cries and grunts. The acting wasn't really terrible the actions of the character spoke for itself and I have seen far worse It wasn't so important after all.It's still miles ahead of what the infamous Chuck Norris can deliver.It's certainly different from Mr. Jaa's previous work. He also gets major credit from me because he directed it and he coordinated the stunts. A lot of Sweat and Heart invested into this flick.Of course it boils down to one thing was it an enjoyment? Totally I enjoyed almost every minute of it. some flaws and things that I personally don't likeoverdone visuals like slow motion raindrops etc. but still very enjoyable.710".

Some random kingdom is expanding and killing people in Thailand 600 odd years back. Jaa's family is massacred and he is adopted by a pirate gang who give him the mandatory weapons training so that he can go and fk everybody's ass some day. This is as unintentionally hilarious as they come. The costumes the set pieces the acting the story all fall into the category of so bad that they are good. There are flashback scenes which show the family members of Jaa being knocked off. They are howlarious and you cannot stop laughing. There is the omnipresent gratuitous violence against women. In between Jaa also becomes a sort of Robinhood against human trafficking. Ong Bak was entertaining as it had the right dose of humor and action along with a straight story line. Here there is only a dark tale of revenge which is so ineptly directed that it will cure the sleeping disorder of even the most hardened insomniacs. This is what is called Brand Dilution in marketing jargon. Ong Bak was a respectable product. They came up with this just to earn a few quick bucks. The ironical part is that they failed even in that. 1 out of 5 for this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ong Bak 2 The Beginning is not a continuation of the first film neither is it a prequel in the true sense the story takes place several hundred years ago and tells of Tien played as an adult by Tony Jaa the son of a murdered lord who becomes a powerful warrior after a clan of outlaws adopt him and teach him their combat skills.This period setting allows for a far more epic feel than the first film but the broader scope of the plot ultimately means less minutes devoted to pure bone crunching action a fact that has understandably disappointed those hoping for another relentless adrenaline fuelled juggernaut of a martial arts movie. Add the fact that Jaa's impressive Muay Thai skills are often overlooked in favour of weapons based action and it's not surprising that this film hasn't been as overwhelmingly well received as its predecessor.On a more positive note the film looks absolutely fantastic with beautiful cinematography sumptuous costumes and some truly outlandish characters and when the action does kick into top gear it is utterly breathtaking especially during the flawlessly executed bonecrunching final battle between Tien and a host of enemy warriors where we finally get to see the star delivering his trademark punishing blows with knee and elbow.In short Ong Bak 2 is a very enjoyable slice of solid action entertainmentnot quite as jawdropping as part one but then what is?7.5 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDb.".

Along their trip the couple meets some quirky characters and get into some silly situations.

I was a little bit worried about his comical talent but he pulls of rather well in this movie.

In fact the film almost borders on the weird.This film is a strange combination of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town and Being There. Errol Flynn has been raised by his tyrannical old grandmother May Robson on the confines of their vast estate which bears some resemblance to stately Wayne Manor. He's been raised like a hot house geranium given the best education the world could offer but has not had any human contact.The premise isn't as strange as it sounds because after the Lindbergh kidnapping there was concern in the ranks of the rich and famous throughout the land. May Robson seems to have anticipated this because she's raised the 20 something Flynn like this away from the world for years before. Flynn like Sellers in Being There has stayed on the grounds all his life but he's not autistic. Still certain facts of life have been omitted from his education and given Flynn's reputation which he hadn't achieved when The Perfect Specimen they make viewing of the film a bit strange. Not the fault of Warner Brothers who knew in 1937 that Errol Flynn would become synonymous with sexual prowess. Anyway the same way Jean Arthur another reporter came crashing in on Gary Cooper's life so does reporter Joan Blondell on the estate where her brother happens to be a gardener. Tyrannical old May Robson has even got a suitable wife picked out in Beverly Roberts whose a cousin but Beverly likes the gardener Dick Foran.When Flynn decides to go out in the world he borrows Foran's car who tells no one. His absence causes a panic in Robson who launches a nationwide manhunt for Flynn. Meanwhile he and Blondell are having a great old time on the road where his education about nearly everything else but social relations comes in handy. The Perfect Specimen also boasts such folks as Edward Everett Horton Allen Jenkins Hugh Herbert and Harry Davenport all in roles that are suitable to their type. Just their mention conjures up certain images and they perform right to image. The Flynn and Blondell team however was never asked for a repeat performance they never really quite mesh.The Perfect Specimen is amusing in a few places but Flynn and Blondell were better showcased in a lot better films.".

	schema:headline " She is an even more perfect specimen than he is!";
	schema:reviewBody "If I had to pick out one leading lady to hang out with and get into all sorts of zany adventures with during the 1930's it would be Joan Blondell who appeared in a ton of movies in just that decade alone often 10 in a year and usually the lead. For nearly that entire decade joining in 1930 departing sometime in 1939 she was at Warner Brother the most factory like of all movie houses and basically worked on an assembly line of films for that entire time. Unfortunately she wasn't a huge star like fellow contract players Kay Francis or later on Bette Davis but extremely well liked even if her box office was just respectable if not tremendous. For the first and only time Blondell is paired with their new king Errol Flynn whose rise to the top of the box office had just come a few years before. It is a fast moving screwball comedy that like It Happened One Night takes its stars on the road interacting with real people around the country. While It Happened One Night focused on a wealthy socialite Claudette Colbert trying to get out of a society marriage she didn't want this focuses on a chipper and polite heir to a fortune Errol Flynn deciding he wants to spend time seeing the real world running off with perky Joan Blondell who accidentally drove through his fence with him witnessing the whole thing upside down after she stands up to his imperious grandmother the delightful May Robson who keeps Flynn tied to her side against his will.Along the way Flynn becomes involved in an amateur fight after an encounter with Allen Jenkins results in him showing off his strength even though Jenkins assumes him to be some sort of dandy then enjoying along with Blondell the hospitality of the wacky Hugh Herbert. In the meantime grandmother Robson and her oh so efficient secretary Edward Everett Horton manage to piece together clues to where he is having initially thought that Blondell had kidnapped him. In the meantime Flynn's fiancee the rather dull Beverly Roberts spends time romancing Robson's ranch handyman Dick Foran who is ironically Blondell's brother. But Blondell discovering that Flynn is due to be married thanks to pressure from grandma Robson suddenly runs off and Flynn decides it is better to be married to a free spirit rather than tied down in boring society life. It is about standing up to grandma in a way which will not bring the old lady down and this leads to a very funny conclusion involving Flynn Blondell and a piece of tunnel.While there is a plot that holds the film together much of the structure is episodic in nature starting off with how Flynn manages to escape from grandma's grasp then moving to the sequence with Jenkins and his girlfriend Dennie Moore who start off as adversaries but end up pals and the strange sequence with Herbert who takes his woo woo! personality once again a bit too far. Flynn on his own when Blondell runs off gets a taste of what it is like to be the common man rather than his society moniker of The perfect specimen by working as an auto mechanic and gas station attendant. I'm not sure if Flynn and Blondell really share any chemistry but they are amusing together. Most of the character performances particularly Robson and Horton's are very good. As far as road movies go I've seen better but overall found this enjoyable with the typical Warner Brothers punch that no other studio really ever could top.".

The title will of course lead many female viewers to think of the obvious  great looks and a great bod. But who inhabits all these qualities and attributes?! Errol Flynn of course who has never been more perfectly coiffed. Many of the 1930s female viewers were probably not surprised and very heartily agreed. But here Errol is somewhat bummed that he is kept against his will during this course of learning and not able to break free and live and be wild and crazy. That is until he meets Joan Blondell who crashes in through the fence to meet him. Then they have numerous escapades together. Anyone who likes the stars will enjoy the film but moments into this one can tell this won't be as good as other films of its ilk. It boasts an impressive and colorful supporting cast with May Robson Edward Everett Hobson Dick Foran Allen Jenkins and Hugh Herbert. But here May's character is ingratiating and loud and the others while usually good don't add much pizazz to this. But Hugh Herbert who is introduced midway into the film does interject some life and speaks in rhyme. The film does get better as Errol and Joan go on the run and get more romantic and quiet moments together. The Perfect Specimen has not been seen or shown on TV in years due to legal issues but if you're determined to get yourself The Perfect Specimen a dvr copy can bought off of eBay for a minimal cost. This little undemanding film is a very pleasant and feelgood experience but tries too hard in the very beginning to grab your attention and therefore its humor feels contrived and outlandish but the leads' chemistry and good looks can get under your skin and make you ignore all the flaws. Flaws!! What flaws?! With Errol Flynn as The Perfect Specimen what more do you need?".

	schema:reviewBody "The Legend of Rita this movie's Englishlanguage title is not as hokey as it initially sounds. Legend was the term used by the East German Secret Police the Stazi for the cover stories created to disguise the identities of West German terrorists who had been secretly granted asylum in the East. The German title Die Stille nach dem Schuss literally The Stillness after Rapid Action is a German phrase that sounds fine in its original language but is too abstract for colloquial translation of a film that is among other things an effective thriller.Schuss in the original title refers to the bank robberies and killings shown at the beginning of the film and Stille to the subsequent life east of the Berlin Wall of Rita Vogt a member of a terrorist cell determined to change the world by violent action. She is a fictitious character a composite of several real people. Eleven such individuals from West Germany did in fact find refuge in the East but only on condition that they live peacefully as ordinary workers and have no contact with one another. Director Volker Schlndorff says in a lengthy audio commentary that accompanies silent images from the film on its Kino Video DVD that the episodes are authentic but the characters are somewhat fictitious. The somewhat fictitious Rita is assigned two identities during her years in East Germany. Initially she works in a textile factory and develops a passionate friendship with an East German woman. Then following her identification by another worker she is given a new legend and becomes a child care worker for a state agency. In this identity she falls in love with an engineer who has been assigned to work for five years in Moscow. They want to marry and have children but the Stazi doesn't want her going to Moscow out of fear of discovery by the Soviets. Rita violates her orders from the Stazi and reveals her identify to her lover. His astonishment and rejection make their separation easier.Things change for Rita with the fall of the Berlin Wall and approaching German reunification. She finds herself alone among her workplace associates regretting the demise of a country that however imperfectly tried to make human relationships more important than economic success. Once again she is a fugitive terrorist. Preferring tragedy to capture or a life in hiding she steals a policeman's motorcycle drives it through a border post and is shot and killed by a guard.The reason for East Germany's granting of asylum to West German terrorists is not entirely clear either in the film or in real life. The closest the film comes to an explanation occurs when the members of the Red Army cell meet with their Stazi minder for a bratwurst barbecue at a pleasant rural villa. East Germany has signed the Helsinki Convention against harboring terrorists and has no interest in supporting what Lenin called infantile Leftism. Cell members are given a choice of transportation to a third world country or remaining in East Germany. Individuals make different choices and kiss one another good bye. A Stazi executive at the barbecue suggests that a longing for lost revolutionary romanticism underlies the East Germany policy.Another aspect of the film is its portrayal of everyday life in East Germany. It does this more completely than either Good Bye Lenin 2003 or The Lives of Others 2006 although these are in many respects excellent movies. To Western eyes the results are surprising. Not everything is East Germany is drab and gray. The Stazi is ubiquitous but not omnipotent. Rita wears a sexy bikini when supervising children at a Baltic beach and no one thinks anything of it. People have a variety of opinions about many different subjects. According to Schlndorff's commentary West German viewers found the portrayal of East German life insufficiently harsh but former Easterners thought it exceptionally accurate.I seldom give movies 10 ratings but for The Legend of Rita I can find nothing that should have been done differently. Both Schlndorff and Wolfgang Kohlhaase are superb scriptwriters. Bibiana Beglau plays Rita and Martin Wuttke is Erwin Hull Rita's sympathetic Stazi minder. All of the actors are excellent. The cinematography and editing are consistently tight and competent. From what I can see the film has no weak links. I had not previously heard of it and got its DVD almost by accident from a public library. Wonderful discoveries are possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rita's story is one of the most moving films I have seen in a great long while. It reveals some of the true story of terrorism through the life of one West Germany's notorious RAF terrorists.The world is at war with itself. We live in a loveless plutocracy of materialism. Once you have understood the spiritual bankruptcy of the paradigm you cease to exist in Western society as a citizen and are horrified everyday by the venality and corruption and callousness on each side.A select few decide to do something about it. Rita is one of a group of ten in West Germany. They do what they can as long as they can with GDR East German support. Rita finally loses the vocation and wishes for a normal life  as a working class person  in GDR. They give it to her.She is happy but cannot escape her past. She loves twice as a civilian and loses everything on both occasions as a consequence of her former identity.The collapse of the wall ends any possibility of a conventional life for her. Unlike her fellow GDR citizens Rita knew the consequences of reunification and the destruction it would wreak on East German communities and lives. Her speech to her jubilant coworkers a passionate and prophetic plea. But when Rita sees another former comrade arrested she must make a run for it.The final shot is tragic and beautiful of the collapse of a motorcyle on a rainstrewn country road.The image of Rita and her struggle for a better world will stay with me for a long long time. Thank you to Wolfgang Kohlhaase and Volker Schlndorff for telling honestly a story rarely told. With the events of September 2001 it may be a decade before anyone can make such a film on this subject.The images are beautiful if relatively conventional. Much of the art house crowd to whom this movie plays in North America require more avantgarde techniques to satisfy their insatiable cravings for the recondite difficult and impenetrable. Frankly the story is better told well in the conventional language of good cinematography. The fine closeups are particularly notable.Good performances all around especially by Bibianne Beglau in the title role. Nadja Uhl is a revelation as Tatjana a beautiful selfdestructive alcoholic of uncertain sexuality but strong friendship. Jenny Schilly is excellent in the small role of Friederike Rita's comrade in arms. Harald Schrott has a fantastic intensity as the lead revolutionary Andi. One of the key personalities in the film is their Stasi handler Erwinn. Sadly most of the time Martin Wuttke's performance is too ironic by half. His Stasi sidekick is much better played by an actor whose name escapes me.".

It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality... We must strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into actual deeds into acts that serve as examples as a moving force. Action and audacity were the Red Army Faction's RAF strong suit. The Legend of Rita original German title Die Stille nach dem Schu  is set in the divided Germany of the 70s. Rita is a young fearless romantic in love with a leftwing revolutionary one Andreas 'Andi' Klein a guy who is more or less the leader of an RAF group which she is a part of. Their RAF group is armed ruthless and robs banks to fund 'the revolution'. These revolutionaries naively explain their robberies in terms of 'anti imperialist' politics  Yes out loud to customers as they clean out the capitalist bank vault and cash drawers with weapons drawn.Adrenal rush and surprise hit one in this film from start to finish.

Caution viewers you may feel a violation of your Hollywoodised sensibilities. You'll also feel the kind of careless courage these young people of the RAF had as they consciously faced death even as they reached out for a better life actuallya better life for others mostly. As many many of the New Left Rita and her fellow RAF members are motivated to take violent political action in order to assuage a deeply felt guilt about being born in First World privilege. They are more moralists than materialistsromantic poets ready to use murder as a political weapon. In the midst of all this direct violent action some of them change become more hard hearted mechanically calculating. Rita's boyfriend is one of them and when this happens love dies. Rita is a lover first and a revolutionary second. In her heart of hearts she wants to settle down have kids a husband the whole modern suburban dream albeit in a more egalitarian 'anti imperialist' society. Rita wants mutual love more than anything else and as she learns more about the duplicitous mendacity of the coldly calculating political apparatus in both the East and West she comes to the realisation that political States are always ready to opportunistically sacrifice their oft repeated propagandised moral goals and callously toss human lives on the scrapheap for political gain. As a result she grows closer to the only person who ever measured up to her romantic expectations an East German woman named Tatjana.Volker Schlndorff has directed a master portrait of a political situation a time and a place which is quickly disappearing down the 'memory hole'. Not only are the West German RAF with their Ton Stein Scherben albums and sneering hatred for bourgeois complacency critically and sympathetically examined but the 'actually existing socialism' of the DDR of that era is laid bare as well. East Germany is portrayed realistically down to the last idiosyncrasy from the near empty roads to the Radeberger Pilsner to the workers' apartments in those large multi storied college dormlike buildings in urban East Berlin. This portrait will disturb long held mainstream 'Time' magazine inspired conceptions of East Germany some would say 'with extreme prejudice'. Rest assured the film's honesty extends across both sides of the EastWest border. Far from revolutionary or socialist most of the citizens of the DDR are portrayed as being quite conservative endorsing whichever police are in charge of the political State. The point is hammered home at the end of the movie when the fall of the Wall in 1989 is portrayed a time when Rita and her audience are supposed to come to the realisation of just what die Stille nach dem Schu entails.".

	schema:headline " The Badlands of the BaaderMeinhoff gang...";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay so I was really primed to love The Legend of Rita. And yes no surprise I love this movie. Here's why First of all it's an objective film about the European left in all its shapes and sizes. Rita is a member of a radical group of German urban guerrillas somewhat based on the BaaderMeinhoff gang and somewhat based on the Hash Rebels. She kills a police officer but unlike Western mainstream cinema we still sympathize with her and identify with her struggle. She is aided by the East German Stasi who see as normal people doing a job they believe in rather than as the Stalinistic secret police we're told to believe they were. We see East Berlin as a difficult place to live. But not as the colorless endless ghetto with bread lines that books and films have also told us. It's an objective film.Second of all it's a film where the main character is a woman driven by her ideological convictions AS WELL AS her loves and desires. If Hollywood made the film unrequited love or some sort of sexual frustration would drive her. Her political convictions and dedication to leftist revolution are what give her strong character and is not her Achilles heel.The film follows Rita as a young member of a radical group in '70s Berlin.

	onyx:emotionText "Okay so I was really primed to love The Legend of Rita. And yes no surprise I love this movie. Here's why First of all it's an objective film about the European left in all its shapes and sizes. Rita is a member of a radical group of German urban guerrillas somewhat based on the BaaderMeinhoff gang and somewhat based on the Hash Rebels. She kills a police officer but unlike Western mainstream cinema we still sympathize with her and identify with her struggle. She is aided by the East German Stasi who see as normal people doing a job they believe in rather than as the Stalinistic secret police we're told to believe they were. We see East Berlin as a difficult place to live. But not as the colorless endless ghetto with bread lines that books and films have also told us. It's an objective film.Second of all it's a film where the main character is a woman driven by her ideological convictions AS WELL AS her loves and desires. If Hollywood made the film unrequited love or some sort of sexual frustration would drive her. Her political convictions and dedication to leftist revolution are what give her strong character and is not her Achilles heel.The film follows Rita as a young member of a radical group in '70s Berlin. While traveling back from Lebanon a series of events leads her to make friends with the Stasi who aid her and her companions throughout their misadventures. After killing a cop during a police chase she creates a new identity and lives a normal life in the East.From there the film follows her life and the end of the Cold War World War III.

	schema:headline " A credible film about terrorism and the Bolshevist state";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Die Stille nach dem Schuss has the problem that the audience can neither identify with the characters nor with the society. Some of the characters are German city guerrillas and thus loose cannons not much different from violent criminals. The other characters are Stasi officers the Bolshevist equivalent of the CIA. And the society is the Bolshevist dictatorship GDR which was never a very pleasant place to live in. Still my knowledge about the setting is aboveaverage. I have read the book Der Baader Meinhof Komplex by Stefan Aust 670p. which is a leading work on the subject. I even read Ulrike Meinhof und die deutschen Verhaeltnisse by Peter Bruecker which contains many fragments of the writings of Meinhof. It did not make me any wiser with regard to the ideas that motivated this European! movement. Terrorism is not exceptional but always sectarian and therefore escapes the common sense. Somehow some groups in our society experience state oppression to such an extent that in their view the situation escalates into a hidden war. It is the paradox that ordinary people like police officers become their primary target. Even in Utrecht my residence a constable was killed by a RAF member in a situation similar to the French officer from the film. In addition I have read enough about the GDR to appreciate the living conditions. In spite of the revolutionary facade the GDR society was actually more rigid than for instance the USA. In fact this region had always been the most conservative part of Germany so that the contempt for former terrorists in the film is probably authentic. The party elite consisted of oppressive bureaucrats but cherished its own terrorist past and was probably indeed sympathetic and suspicious towards western terrorists. So in general the atmosphere of the film looks credible. It is a pity that the narrative does not elaborate on Ritas scruples or perhaps the absence of them with respect to her past deeds. It may be that she represses these thoughts but we don't know. All in all she seems to enjoy herself. I don't know whether former RAF members had happy lives in the GDR. If so one of course wonders why they didn't migrate in the first place. Although the story was not a revelation to me it didn't bore me either. The scenes of GDR life the collective company holidays the community singing the droll corporate life and the stage properties Trabant Wartburg cars 60s furniture are sufficiently realistic to allow for recognition. Unfortunately the endings of the Schlondorff films that I have seen Die verlorene Ehre der K. Blum Strajk! are never a true climax and this weakness also holds for this one. The killing of Rita on a motor bike is banal and an ending without ambition except perhaps a faint attempt to restore justice. In conclusion the film has its merits in that it is credible and captivating. However I would not call it an intellectual masterpiece. I guess that Schlondorff shared my inability to sympathize with his characters and therefore could not connect with their thoughts. If you are interested in GDR life or social films consider seeing my other reviews.".

The film has an authentic feel in that it is not chockfull of clichd characters that seem to populate these types of films. Rita is a member of a radical underground group that evolved from the American Civil RightsBlack PowerAntiVietnam movements of the 1960's. Although initially begun on the college campus of Berkeley California within a decade these political and cultural movements morphed into lawless gangs which spread worldwide by the early 1970's. Their belief was that the system of Capitalism was systemically flawed and therefore the criminal and judicial system was null and void. Schlondorff highlights the idealistic tendencies of the group members and even seems to romanticize the organizations which supported them. Rita and her cohorts are nearly idealistic to a fault and harbor an unusual or misplaced admiration for The Peoples' State. It's almost a running gag in the film that no one who lives in East Germany can believe that anyone would chose to live there. Although for a variety of reasons Socialism clearly was usurped by Capitalism by the early 90's Volker Schlondorff has crafted a film that is a kind of a thoughtful advocacy for the positive aspects of a more collective political system. THE LEGEND OF RITA is a terrific film of the Thriller Genre yet perceptively makes political points without becoming a polemic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Stille nach dem Schu or The Legend of Rita is a German movie from 2000 so this one will soon have its 20th anniversary. It is among the more recent works by Oscarwinning German filmmaker Volker Schlndorff who directed this one and also wrote the script together with somewhat legendary screenplay writer Wolfgang Kohlhaase. The film runs for 100 minutes roughly and tells an entirely fictitious story about former West German terrorist and how she lives under an alias in the GDR. The upcoming reunification may have made things easier for most but not for her. I personally really wanted to like this movie here but it was very difficult to end up appreciating. The problem is not that it is a bleak one but that lead actress Bibiana Beglau was extremely underwhelming in her most known character performance. I would almost call her miscast. She was not only way too young for the role but also she added almost nothing in terms of face expressions and range to a character that offered so so much and could have turned out so memorable if it had been portrayed by a superior actress. No idea why the Berlin Film Festival and also the European Film Awards gave her some recognition. The still pretty young Nadja Uhl was better for sure but also not nomination or even awards worthy. The best performance probably still came from Martin Wuttke here who gave a commanding performance in the few couple scenes he was on. The script is not a revelation either but making a fiction film about the days of RAF Germany or the years after is something we don't see too often and Schlndorff's and Kohlhaase's experience certainly shows in terms of subtle moments but also the showy ending for example. I just really wish they could have cast another lead actress here as Beglau does not have what it needs to carry this film from start to finish as she is in basically every single scene. A negative dealbreaker for me. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Drawing parallels with real members of the RAF farleft militant group and events of the 70s and 80s in Germany Die Stille nach dem Schuss depicts the relationship between the terrorist organisation and the East German Stasi through the eyes of an individual. Rita Vogt seeks refuge in the GDR after becoming the target of a manhunt following a prison break gone wrong. Rita is shown to be unique in her unconditional love for the supposed values of her adopted homeland standing in stark contrast to her fellow citizens all of whom refuse to have the wool pulled over their eyes. The film lacks both the style and thrills of Der Baader Meinhof Komplex 2008 or any real sustained drama. Much of the time you find yourself lacking empathy for the characters and unmoved by the lack of much suspense or action. Arguably this indifference and coldness from the audience to the East is intended at times but at others there is something lacking. Just when it seems the stakes are to be raised in Rita's personal life the narrative moves on too soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like a lot of people I never bothered with this film when it came out in the cinemas because of the negative reviews that it got. Likewsie when it came to DVD it sat at the bottom end of my rental list waiting for me to want to watch it. Eventually I did and initially I thought that the reviews had been unfairly harsh because the film seemed like it was going to be a light and sparky sports period piece that captures the screwball comedies of years gone by. This is how it starts but unfortunately it is not how it continues. It is not like at some point the film suddenly gets bad it doesn't but more that it doesn't quite have the sparkle or life that the trimmings all suggest that it will.In terms of capturing the period it does a great job  or at least it does a great job of continuing the nostalgic idea of the period. It does this with a cool jazz soundtrack good costumes and the suggestion of the snappy dialogue that the screwball movies are known for. I say suggestion because of the places where the film doesn't have the zing that it needed is in the script. It does have its moments though and it is quite fun at times but mostly it feels like it is just falling short of where it should be. It has a couple of things that don't help this either. Firstly it is too long maybe not for the plot it doesn't drag per se but certainly for the light tone. Secondly the romance aspect of the plot doesn't really work which is partly down to the casting of Zellweger.Where Clooney fits the bill as a toocute by half squarejawed matine star Zellweger cannot convincingly deliver her lines in a way that works. I think of Jennifer Jason Leigh in Hudsucker Proxy  she did an impression of an actress in a screwball comedy that was pretty good and looking at that shows up how illsuited Zellweger is. I know people dislike her on principle but I am not one of them I just thought she was pretty poor here. Krasinski is good in his role even if to be frank he didn't do anything that suggested he has more than the range of characterisation that he has already shown on The Office  and that should be of concern to his people since he will soon need to breakout of that show as it cannot run forever. The supporting cast has plenty of interesting and recognisable faces who do solid work.Leatherheads is not a terrible comedy as some have suggested and it should not be criticised for being inconsequential or light. Sadly though it is not frothy sparky or fun enough to be the film that it was clearly intended to be. OK there are specific issues with aspects of the plot and some well one bit of casting but generally this bigger picture problem is what limits it to be an OK film but no better than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just yesterday my family and I were itching to go to the movie theatre. After my grandfather recommended it to us for being hilarious slapstick humour and after seeing some funny previews we decided to see Leatherheads. Leatherheads George Clooney's latest movie dives into the Roaring 20s early professional football the Chicago Tribune and fake war heroes all in about an hour and 44 minutes. As unappealing and generic as that might sound compared to the average comedy feature it was actually a quite fun movie which is to be expected coming from Clooney.The movie follows the story of the Duluth Bulldogs a professional American football team and its most wellknown player Dodge Connelly. Luck is not always on the Bulldogs' side as can be interpreted from the outcome of the first game you watch them play but trickery and cheating is. Dodge becomes infamous for cheating almost every game and leading his team to victory because of it. It was okay then though. There were no rules to American football early on and cheating was what made the game interesting. That's one of the main themes of the movie.After the introduction comes Lexie Littleton played by Rene Zellweger a quickwitted reporter for the Chicago Tribune who doesn't like her coworkers too much. After calling them dimwitted or something similar for the fortieth time Lexie is assigned by her boss to a story on Carter The Bullet Rutherford played by John Krasinski a war hero with a more than embellished story. When she is promised the assistant editor's desk if she brings back some dirt on The Bullet and exposes his fake war story Lexie sets out on quite the adventure meeting Dodge and the rest of the Bulldogs along the way.I know that all of this probably sounds generic to the average moviegoer but it's actually a quite fresh and fun movie. With any other actor and actress at the forefront at the movie it may have come off as generic and boring but Clooney and Zellweger have enough chemistry and enough quirks to make the movie fun. There are also some absolutely classic lines and scenes. It's just a fun movie. Don't expect too much depth because there really isn't any. This movie is more than enough to quench the thirst of any moviegoer who asks for nothing more than an hour and a half of simple humour and slapstick antics.The historical accuracy is there. Some scenes are featured in a speakeasy with a female AfricanAmerican jazz singer performing. Basically everything you see is typical of the time period. Actually anyone watching the movie might get a little shock when they hear that coffee is only 10 cents a cup at a diner Dodge stops at early on in the movie. However on the other hand some major plot areas are not at all historically accurate especially relating to the football commissioner since there was no football commissioner for the NFL until 1941. However this is perhaps looking too deeply into a fun casual movie.The main criticism I have of this movie is that some of the scenes just go on too long especially the punching scene which was featured in the previews. After they punch each other in the face for the tenth time and finish it off with a bad joke from The Bullet you already are hoping that one of them will bash the other's skull in by accident or something just so that the scene can end. To offset that however there were some very quick and humorous scenes like the scene in which Dodge first meets Lexie in the hotel and tries to hide his face by reading an issue of a women's magazine.Overall Leatherheads is worth it for the entertainment value. The story isn't fantastic but the acting is enough to make up for it even if you only pay attention to Dodge's witty exchanges with Lexie. If you don't go in expecting too much you will leave satisfied refreshed and entertained and that's really all the movie aimed for.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Jimmy Dodge Connelly George Clooney is the team captain of the Bulldogs in the struggling pro football league in 1925. The entire pro football league is in danger of collapsing one team at a time and his team is next. Dodge gets an idea of saving the team by recruiting a college football star who fills the college stadium with over 45000 cheering fans. With the lure of big money Dodge is able to convince Carter Rutherford John Krasinski to drop out of college and join the team. Carter is not only a star football player who can outrun his completion but he is also a national war hero of WWI who singlehandedly captured a platoon of German soldiers. Lexie Littleton Renee Zellweger is a newspaper journalist assigned to get Carter's real inside story about the capture of the German soldiers. To get the story Lexie must travel with the team and in time both Carter and Dodge fall for her. Only one will win her love as the fourth quarter comes to an end.My Comment George Clooney not only starred in this slapstick comedy he also directed it. The movie may not win any awards but it is enjoyable to watch. Since the movie took place in 1925 the writers took us back to that time and slapstick was the rule. If you let yourself go and get into the movie you will actually get the feel of that era. George is very talented but I don't think he has a flair for comedy. Renee Zellweger and George share a chemistry together that works well for this movie. You may think this is a chick flick but you would be somewhat wrong. The love angle doesn't really get going until the end. You will love the way they play pro football with very few rules especially the last game that is played in the mud. This is a cute movie and I know they had a lot of fun making it because it shows. Universal Pictures Run Time 154 Rated PG13710".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Leatherheads today despite the negative comments here at IMDb. On the whole I agree with the 'movieguy Doug' who ventured that this is a slapstick comedy that is cute and enjoyable to watch. I'd add that this is a comedic periodpiece which is pleasant and witty rather than hilarious and kneeslapping if you want to get technical. It offers excellent sets costumes and characterizations typical of the Roaring 20's when Newspapers were godlike and Radio was just unfolding.It's loosely about Pro Football in the 20's. The message is that the game was rough poorlyregulated and messy! No wonder Baseball was America's game! College players fared better with fervent fan support and welltended fields of play  but after College great players packed it up and got real jobs or switched to baseball I guess. In this story George Clooney hopes to boost the fortunes of his floundering Toledo Pro team by recruiting a college superstar and reported warhero played by John Krasinski. Rene Z. is the ace reporter dispatched to get the goods on the football hero's military service record.The film was reminiscent of the 1988 film '8 Men Out' in doing a great job of recreating the look and feel of that era. However '8 Men Out' was based upon a real life incident and a fabulous book. 'Leatherheads' was a story one IMDb contributor says George Clooney carried around in his pocket for 20 years. So I'd agree that the storytelling and comedy bits of the screenplay are lacking a bit. However George does fine as a Director and Performer  I don't buy that comedy isn't 'his thing'  he was sparkling in 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou' and 'Intolerable Cruelty' ahhhhh but those were Coen Brothers scripts which showed what George could do with a real creative team behind him. Also it looked like the cast had a hoot making this thing  to be honest if the DVD has lots of bloopers and special features that alone might induce me to pick it up in 2009.I quite enjoyed the film but then I like period pieces especially those about the Jazz Age 8 Men Out Great Gatsby and the Sting are in my Top20. Nice soundtrack by Randy Newman here too. This was witty and pleasant to watch. And PG13 comedies that are NOT about singles dating morons or kids with three dads or sperm donors the Previews at our matine today are in very short supply these days.Might add that Rene was quite charming in the manner of a glamor girl of the Jazz Age with soft blonde hair and strategic use of red lipstick to produce that perfect 'kissy' smile! Pete Gerety a veteran character player chips in with a nice spot as a new Football Commissioner. I recognized Gerety as the smoothtalking oil baron 'Lee Janus' in another Clooney project Syriana.710  canuckteachbtw The NFL really didn't get rolling as a major diversion until NFL Films made it a TV legacy in the late 60's. In the 50's it was viewed in crummy black and white with those uglyduckling 4poster goalposts.".

The legitimizing of football in the 1920's is the main plot point with Clooney's Dodge Connelly attempting to popularize it through recruiting war hero turned college football phenomenon Carter Rutherford played by Krasinski.The plot thickens when an officer who fought alongside Rutherford claims that the goldenboy's actions during the war are less than heroic. Zellweger's ambitious Lexie Littleton doggedly pursues the truth behind the tall tales all the while being pursued by the meanttobe charming football hasbeen Connelly and the bright eyed Rutherford who's reputation she is meant to dismantle. While Zellwegger looks the part of a '20's bombshell Littleton is little more than an instigating character meant to stir up rivalry and trouble.Though Littleton and Connelly's repartee is meant to mirror that of classic characters she remains a shadow of prior female protagonists and never comes fully into her own. Her wavering affections for Rutherford and Connelly do not fit into the classic feminine archetype she was meant to embody.While Clooney's smoothtalking Connelly was written with the intent of being charming his actions oftentimes appear more arrogant than anything else. He is an unabashed trickster both on and off the field but instead of coming off as an artful beguiler he instead appears dishonest and at times unworthy.Krasinski's Rutherford is by far the most charming and likable character in the film his awshucks demeanor is disarmingly enchanting. While Rutherford was built up as a rival for the aging Connelly it is difficult to perceive in what way they are meant to compete with each other. He is stuck in a lie that snowballed into epic proportions and his naivet shows when he is genuinely wounded by Littleton's betrayal.The remotely villainous CC Frazier played by Jonathan Pryce is an amusing feature of the film. His immoral approach to business and his eager desire to take advantage of the talent of others namely Rutherford shows a different and less promising side to the professionalizing of football.While the conflict between Rutherford and Connelly appears somewhat stilted the banter between the two is unequaled throughout the film. Most of the truly funny moments are between the two honoring slapstick bits made famous in early cinema.Randy Newman's swinging score is jazzy and jaunty adding light excitement and highlights the screwiest scenes. The Mention and the ignoring of prohibition also added legitimacy to the film leading to an entertaining oldfashioned police chase involving Littleton and Connelly.The football scenes were initially exciting with Connelly's dupes and playing dirty rallying the spirit of football and Rutherford's clean and direct approach offering an interesting parallel. However the final game is rather anticlimactic.What was meant to be the pivotal scene in the football game was dissatisfying and confusing using old suspensebuilding clichs to mount a weak scene. The final game was meant to be dull in order to put across Connelly's assertion that the rules of football ruin the game but nonetheless it results in disappointment.The costume designs including the oldfashioned football uniforms and Littleton's various old time dresses make one feel as if they are taking a look back into the past as does the beautiful cinematography.Leatherheads is entertaining and fun but its attempt to emulate the past genre ends up ultimately dissatisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leatherheads is a movie of laughs and feel good fun a period piece of football nostalgia that's held together by it's slapstick comedy and blended well with romance. George Clooney who stars and directs gives a good turn here yet it seems a little uncommon seeing the superstar in a period comedy piece as he's clearly a better dramatic actor still he scores some points here for his style of shooting and direction of the film.Set in the 1920's George is 'Dodge' Connelly a football player on the field and a ladies man off it and this is before the big money and rules changes that took into form for the game. Clooney's team the Duluth Bulldogs are a scrapper bunch at play yet the team is tough and gritty and off the field George's Dodge character is full of drink and has eyes for a dame. Enter Lexie LittletonRenee Zellwegerwho's an elegant and sexy snap news lady of a reporter as she's a little lady in red from her nifty wardrobe. While the Bulldogs team and other foes have gone bankrupt and many move on to other traits of work like mining and labor a plan then develops to invest in and start an organized league with the help of a famous recruit for the Bulldogs that being college ivy league stud and apparent war hero Carter RutherfordJohn Krasinski. Along the way then the film blends with plenty of slapstick laughs and comic gridiron action from strange and crazy tackles to muddy fields to catchy flirtation one liners and romance that is seen in a chastely and sexy way. And the big surprise is the truth about the apparent battlefield story is revealed.Overall this isn't a great movie but it's OK as the slapstick and laughs carry it so if your expecting a historical serious and dramatic look at the early NFL you want get it here. Though the costumes and uniforms of the classic throwback way of no face mask no chin gear nor any rules make you feel just like your back watching a 1920's era game. The chemistry between Clooney and Zellweger is good as Renee is a bright treat to watch even though the laughs are good and the scenes are fun Clooney appears out of place here in a comedy work even though his performance is good this screwball comedy scores for laughs and is flagged for drama and it's lack of focused attention on the history of the start of the NFL.".

Clooney's character Dodge Connelly heads up a team in Duluth and picks up a star college player. Eventually they end up in Chicago with Connelly on one side of the ball and the college star on the other. The birth of the modern professional football is woven into the plot. Clooney's age 46 a bit old for a football player was not covered up with makeup but integrated into his character. I think that in the movie he was 40 to 45 years old. Zellgeger as Lexie Littleton a newspaper reporter who has to find the truth behind the college star's heroic war record played her part very well too.Very good directing by Clooney. You definitely felt like you were back in the 20's. Not overdone or underdone. One of those movies you walk out at the end glad that you went.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Leatherheads' tries so hard. Tries to be light hearted. Tries to be a comedy. Tries to be a love affair. Let's see it tries to be a 'His Girl Friday' by way of 'The Sting' by way of 'It Happened One Night' by way of a dozen sports movies.

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of the negative reviews here concentrate on the historical accuracy of this film. OK it had about as much to do with the actual NFL as your average war movie has to do with an actual war or a Western has to do with the true old west. So I think we should give them an artistic license pass on that one.The problem here is the director Clooney apparently thinks that making a screwball comedy means a do stupid things b mug for the camera and c take stupid scenes full of mugging and stretch them out way too long. Screwball comedies need a fast pace not necessarily frenetic but moving briskly along at all times. Here things drag and drag and drag. After you watch this movie it will make you appreciate how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he pretty much pioneered the genre with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years you would think that directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two maybe even improved on things a bit. But no it's as if someone had watched an automobile pioneer build a Duesenberg and nearly a century later paid homage and improved on the concept by cobbling together a child's wagon with square wheels.I've enjoyed several of Clooney's movies I consider him a gifted actor. But very few actors can competently direct themselves Clint Eastwood notably took a while to get the hang of it. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The movie becomes more watchable during the very few times he is out of the frame but when he's in the picture he makes himself the centre of attention. In the fight scenes his mugging is so obnoxious you wish somebody would thump him for real.If you are making a screwball comedy and want some romance thrown in you need to develop some chemistry between the male and female leads. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of pair of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. No spark no sizzle not even a postmortem twitch. Zellweger who has also turned out some pretty good movies must have traded her botox injections for oak tannin giving a stunningly wooden performance. She might just have pulled off the tough broad in a man's world act if just once while trying to outtestosterone the guys she had looked into the camera with a little halfsmile and twinkle in her eye. But no she kept her jockstrap cinched up tight to the very end.Of course the biggest sin here is that the movie simply isn't funny. Doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. Doing stupid things very inventively like the Stooges or very athletically like Buster Keaton can be hilarious. But otherwise it's boring and well stupid. I think I got one good laugh out of the entire movie.Avoid this one. I saw it for free on cable and still wanted my money back.".

Its because TeeVee has scrambled the code replacing the way we receive events. With screwball they twist in unexpected directions sure. But it isn't just that they go haywire but that they do so a half beat before we expect. This hurts our viewing old classics as well but we make allowances.In this case some of that is handled by the setting between the world wars. But most of it is in the pacing. That's not just a matter of editing. If it were we'd have better movies. No the thing has to be composed on the film with the components of the flow all worked out ahead of time. I suppose this is usually a matter of intuition or just application of the familiar. So when it is done in an odd form like this it has to be deliberate. There aren't many actors who I credit as being even a competent director. Actually I can only think of Welles. Clooney isn't the experimenter he was and isn't interested in manipulating the narrative or staging. But he's got this notion of playing the pulse of the thing down perfectly. This is a wonderful picture and ever so much more attractive if you see how his directing circumnavigates the art of acting.This story is entirely actorcentric and yet it still works. I really like this guy. Part of the game is how he folds the game into the film. The pacing and directing of the game and the film of course. A double joke on playing by the rules and an act of misdirection. This latter is particularly clever a football play that involves a disguise and shifting sides a pack of fake lost army buddies in costume and a wartime event that revolves around mistaken identity.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Leatherheads";
	schema:reviewBody "Leatherheads takes place in the 1920's and is about a professional football player named Dodge Connolly who is also the head coach of his team. Dodge's team soon loses sponsorship and they are forced to resign. Being out of work Dodge soon reads about an up and coming war hero and college football star named Carter Rutherford who he convinces to play on the team and because of Carter's star power Dodge soon gets the team up and running again. Meanwhile a reporter named Lexie Littleton is going to be writing an article on Carter and soon Dodge meets her and falls in love with her and after first being turned off by him Lexie soon starts to like him as well but things get complicated when Lexie uncovers something for her story on Carter that could hurt him and the team and Dodge with feelings for Lexie soon has to straighten things out with his love and his team. Even though the film is called Leatherheads and most of the advertisements show the film as a sports film really the football aspect is only a backdrop to the romantic comedy part of the film that is really the main focus. The filmmakers of Leatherheads must have been big fans of the romantic screwball comedies of the 1930's and 40's and this is truly a salute and tribute to those movies. That being said Leatherheads captures everything about those films and the charm wittiness comedic performances and style that made those films so distinct. The film's look from the sets right down to the costumes look exactly like the 20's films and in capturing the mood of the 40's comedies the writers have provided a very humorous story filled with snappy and clever dialogue between the characters numerous situations that resolve themselves with a lot of comedic intelligence and first rate performances from the actors who all do their best job of capturing the comedic performances of that era. Leatherheads works so well because it appeals and does it's job so well for a couple of reasons. First off the story and writing is sharp funny and tells a very entertaining story with a great backdrop and sets from the crew and also because of the performances timing and skill of the actors delivering the lines and situations to perfection and doing the best of what they are given and what they are given is very good. Overall a classic tribute to the comedies of yesteryear done with perfection and told with a great knack for such films and delivering a very entertaining funny and classy film that I think will appeal to many people and will work on the same levels that they worked for me.".

	schema:headline " Charming and Frivolous Fun";
	schema:reviewBody "Months ago when I saw an ad for Leatherheads my first thought was How many movies can Hollywood possibly make about football?? We've had Remember the Titans We Are Marshall Friday Night Lights Rudy Radio Any Given Sunday The Longest Yard original and remake The Program Varsity Blues Jerry Maguire Hometown Legend Facing the Giants Necessary Roughness  shall I go on? Even the Marx Brothers fooled around with the sport in Horse Feathers.I've seen about half of those and they vary in entertainment quality but still did we really need another one? How many times can we see that plucky underdog team with the inept quirkridden players face insurmountable odds to pull off a nailbiting victory against a cocky wellorganized opponent of legendary status? Apparently one more With Leatherheads George Clooney creates one of the funniest comedies I've seen in years.Clooney directs himself as Dodge Connelly a profootball player in the 1920's when pro was a laughable term. In an effort to save the bankrupt sport Connelly schemes to hire college football hero Carter Rutherford John Krasinski whose game skills coupled with his story of taking out an entire German platoon by himself has made him America's poster boy.Reporter Lexie Littleton Renee Zellweger doubts Rutherford's war story and sets out to expose him. But she didn't expect Rutherford to take a liking to her. Nor did she expect Connelly to find her fascinating as well. In the end it's more than a game between Duluth and Chicago it's also a fight to the finish over who wins Littleton's affections.George Clooney directs with the same snappy panache he has on screen. From the opening ragtime drumbeat to the last drive off into the sunset the film is infused with an immensely buoyant spirit that makes the entire film a viewing pleasure.The script by Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly is funny lively and frequently clever. Sure it falls right into line with every other underdog sports story but it also manages to prove that thought and creativity can still overcome formulaic doldrums. Whiplash conversations between the feisty Connelly and the irascible Littleton had me laughing out loud and more often than any film in the past twelve months.The leading trio of Clooney Zellweger and Krasinksi are wellcast. Clooney brings back the comical timing and facial mugging that added a dash of zaniness to his roles in O Brother Where Art Thou? and Intolerable Cruelty and combines it with a suave veneer that makes him an irresistible personality. Miss Zellweger is basically her usual self. I've never been fond of her as an actress  it's either the voice or the constant pouting expression  but she certainly does no harm here. She doesn't quite nail the Rosalind Russell persona she seems to be reaching for though what she comes up with still works well against Clooney's antics.John Krasinski from last year's unforgivable License to Wed is dashing and charming as a young college athlete. He has a nice blend of both shyness and confidence and a killer smile. I have no doubt we'll be seeing much more of him on film screens in the future.The film is populated with some of today's most versatile character performers including some of Clooney's fellow Coen Brothers alumni Wayne Duvall is the Duluth manager with a constant wad of tobacco clogging every sentence he utters Stephen Root is the team's onstaff flasktoting reporter Heather Goldenhersh puts in a cameo as a ditsy flapper and the legendary Jonathan Pryce plays smarmy financier C.C. Frazier.The combined effect of all the wacky personalities which includes the entire Duluth team of misfits results in some of the best screwball comedy moments you're sure to see this decade. Oh the history of screwball comedy has seen better films to be sure but while Leatherheads may be pale when compared to the likes of Bringing Up Baby it is nonetheless a strong contender in the field. It is also far less exhausting than listening to Katherine Hepburn rattle off a thousand words a minute.The film itself looks beautiful. James Bissell's sets lit and photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel are as charming as the actors moving within them. And Randy Newman's toetapping ragtime pumps it all up that much more. The whole production evokes a vivid sense of nostalgia and very much feels like we are back in the 20's  even though they didn't have such rich colorful film stock back then.I'm not a doomsayer about our economy but there's a kind of irony in the fact that the film takes place just four years before the Great Depression. If you're finding yourself cutting back on your entertainment budget and don't want to risk ten bucks until you get a second opinion allow me to recommend Leatherheads. Of course we all have differing views on which films are worth the ten bucks but your face will pretty much have to be chiseled in stone to not crack a few smiles during the film's run. I was still smiling when I reached my car.".

In an effort to save the bankrupt sport Connelly schemes to hire college football hero Carter Rutherford John Krasinski whose game skills coupled with his story of taking out an entire German platoon by himself has made him America's poster boy.Reporter Lexie Littleton Renee Zellweger doubts Rutherford's war story and sets out to expose him. But she didn't expect Rutherford to take a liking to her. Nor did she expect Connelly to find her fascinating as well. In the end it's more than a game between Duluth and Chicago it's also a fight to the finish over who wins Littleton's affections.George Clooney directs with the same snappy panache he has on screen. From the opening ragtime drumbeat to the last drive off into the sunset the film is infused with an immensely buoyant spirit that makes the entire film a viewing pleasure.The script by Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly is funny lively and frequently clever. Sure it falls right into line with every other underdog sports story but it also manages to prove that thought and creativity can still overcome formulaic doldrums. Whiplash conversations between the feisty Connelly and the irascible Littleton had me laughing out loud and more often than any film in the past twelve months.The leading trio of Clooney Zellweger and Krasinksi are wellcast. Clooney brings back the comical timing and facial mugging that added a dash of zaniness to his roles in O Brother Where Art Thou? and Intolerable Cruelty and combines it with a suave veneer that makes him an irresistible personality. Miss Zellweger is basically her usual self. I've never been fond of her as an actress  it's either the voice or the constant pouting expression  but she certainly does no harm here. She doesn't quite nail the Rosalind Russell persona she seems to be reaching for though what she comes up with still works well against Clooney's antics.John Krasinski from last year's unforgivable License to Wed is dashing and charming as a young college athlete. He has a nice blend of both shyness and confidence and a killer smile. I have no doubt we'll be seeing much more of him on film screens in the future.The film is populated with some of today's most versatile character performers including some of Clooney's fellow Coen Brothers alumni Wayne Duvall is the Duluth manager with a constant wad of tobacco clogging every sentence he utters Stephen Root is the team's onstaff flasktoting reporter Heather Goldenhersh puts in a cameo as a ditsy flapper and the legendary Jonathan Pryce plays smarmy financier C.C. Frazier.The combined effect of all the wacky personalities which includes the entire Duluth team of misfits results in some of the best screwball comedy moments you're sure to see this decade. Oh the history of screwball comedy has seen better films to be sure but while Leatherheads may be pale when compared to the likes of Bringing Up Baby it is nonetheless a strong contender in the field. It is also far less exhausting than listening to Katherine Hepburn rattle off a thousand words a minute.The film itself looks beautiful. James Bissell's sets lit and photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel are as charming as the actors moving within them. And Randy Newman's toetapping ragtime pumps it all up that much more. The whole production evokes a vivid sense of nostalgia and very much feels like we are back in the 20's  even though they didn't have such rich colorful film stock back then.I'm not a doomsayer about our economy but there's a kind of irony in the fact that the film takes place just four years before the Great Depression. If you're finding yourself cutting back on your entertainment budget and don't want to risk ten bucks until you get a second opinion allow me to recommend Leatherheads. Of course we all have differing views on which films are worth the ten bucks but your face will pretty much have to be chiseled in stone to not crack a few smiles during the film's run. I was still smiling when I reached my car.";

	schema:headline " Leatherheads review...";
	schema:reviewBody "Leatherheads Last night I saw the MOST highly anticipated movie of the month!! Actually I've been highly anticipating this movie since nearly two years ago when it was announced in Charleston that George Clooney was scouting shooting locations for his new movie that would be starring Renee Zellweger. A few months LATER in the PRIME of my Fancy New Beeslydom I found out that John Krasinski had been cast in the movie  have been counting down the days until it was released. Clooney. Zellweger. Krasinski. 1920s costume demeanour  music. This movie could have no plot  I would love it.The movie takes place in Georgia  Chicago filmed in Boiling Springs South Carolina thankyouverymuch  is about a football player named Dodge Connolly Clooney who recruits a war herofootball star Carter Rutherford Krasinski to come  play for him. Meanwhile there are rumors circulating that Carter's big war hero story isn't entirely true  so Lexie Littleton Zellweger a sports writer is hired to go talk to him  get the full story. Lexie meets both Carter  Dodge  lots of flirting is to be had on both sides.It's a totally classic plot  I was beyond impressed with Clooney's vision for the movie. It's been a dream of mine for a long time to one day make a movie that wasn't just set in the olden days but to actually make it a replica of the films being made during that time. I am an old movie freak  if I ever get cast in a period piece I am going all out...voice coach to get the dialect of the time..watching the actresses constantly to pick up mannerisms  body language  what I LOVED about Leatherheads is that it was captured perfectly. You definitely have to go into it knowing that it's going by how movies were made in the 20s50s. There are obvious stages set  painted backdrops of cities as well as the very end when there's a motorcycle with a moving screen behind it to make it look like it's moving. The movie is in color but if you put it in black  white  put Clooney's performance up against a reel with Cary Grant or Clark Gable it would match up perfectly. Same goes for Renee Zellweger. I was the most impressed with her performance. Her voice is already small  scratchy so she has this great way of sounding like Rosalind Russell or Ava Gardner when she talks. I also thought it was totally clever of George to cast John Krasinski as Carter. He's totally attractive in an old school way  that SMILE could seriously be on toothpaste ads. He also just looks like a normal guy..the way that all men looked back then before exercising with your shirt off with sweat dripping down your abs was the main reason you were a box office draw.I just love these three actors because their egos NEVER get in the way of their performances. George Clooney has his scenes Renee has hers  John even though he's the newbie is totally allowed to shine where he needed to. There's a speakeasy bust where Dodge  Lexie dress up as police officers  get chased throughout the building...only to pretend they're suicidal so the fire department will catch them with the trampoline. Renee is completely awesome in her first scene where she's given the assignment to go after Carter. She hops onto her boss's desk  lights up a cigarette  AHHHH I just love the kitschy banter that goes on. John Krasinski is awesome in a scene where he gets totally drunk  picks a fight with George. The three of them together were so much fun to watch  the chemistry was through the roof! The ONLY qualm I had with it was that the story was all over the place. It's called Leatherheads but never really decided which plot to focus on. The love triangle? The trial regarding Carter's cover up as being a war hero? The football games? I'm not faulting Clooney because frankly he's a brilliant director  I'm THRILLED that he's taking time away from acting to do more production work. The script that he used he'd been carrying around for 8 years  was written over 20 years ago by two professional sports people. I think that after a script gets that old  goes through so many rewrites that at some point you can't look at it objectively anymore so some things fall through the cracks.Overall the movie was so much fun to watch...ESPECIALLY if you're a Turner Classic Movie junkie like me. It also goes by the rules of the time  there is only ONE kiss in the entire film..no sex..no nudity...very little language...so it's definitely a movie you can see with your whole family over the weekend. I know that sounds annoying but it was always an issue in my family growing up. My sisters  I are all 7 years apart so finding something that was appropriate for ALL of us at the same time was difficult.www.myspace.comtheportraitofalady".

I guess I mostly didn't like it because I am younger. It was just way to slow moving and never picked up. The messages were saying its okay to cheat and lie. George Clooney was just a cheater the whole movie when he played football and never changed. The whole movie had like about three laughs. The laughs they did have were small. I mostly didn't like how it took place in the 1920's. It was very real and shows you how football really started. The romance was very confusing and pretty boring. Everyone in this movie was very selfish and wanted everything for themselves. The story was pretty much not even about football. It revolved around war and other stuff. One more thing is that the whole movie was all sarcasm. So if you like sarcasm you will probably like this movie. Overall this movie was very boring and a waste of money.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clooney's third directorial outing and his followup to the Oscar nominated Good Night and Good Luck. This movie is quite a bit lighter a screwball comedy about the early days of professional football. Clooney stars as a pro football player for the Duluth Bulldogs in 1925. The sport is not very popular at this level but is insanely so at the college level. His plan to increase attendance and save the sport is to recruit football and war hero John Krasinski who plays for Princeton onto the team though college football players rarely go on to the pros. Meanwhile a reporter from Chicago played by Rene Zellweger has discovered that Krasinski's war hero story is bunk and plans to expose him. While never hilarious it's quite an enjoyable movie. Clooney I think is a more talented director than any of his three films have displayed. I think if he ever gets his hands on a great script he'll knock out a truly great film. He captures the period detail well and the photography is great. I think the film would be a whole lot better without Zellweger. I'm not necessarily a Zellweger hater but she's staggeringly awful here and drags the whole film down a notch. I like the whole fin de siecle mood. Nothing especially memorable but a good time.".

On the one hand you have a story about the early stage of Profootball to attract the guys and on the other you have one of those playful 1920's romances where the characters do and say witty things which I'm going to assume women dig. So the movie contains all the right ingredients. All that needs to happen now is the parts need to show up on the screen but oddly enough the movie underwhelms in both regards.It starts out fairly well mocking the early profootball setup before agents advertisers and John Madden took over. The most memorable shot in the entire movie is a cow watching from the sidelines as a ragtag group of men run back and forth chasing a little ball and you only get one ball per game. Dodge Connolly George Clooney is the leader of these men the Duluth Bulldog football team. He's an old man his glory days behind him but he stays in it because like most of the other men on the team these guys don't really have a lot of options and profootball pays them almost in scrap.The team is running out of money however forcing Dodge to come up with a plan to put asses in the seats or else it's over. Enter Carter Rutherford John Krasinski The Office a war hero and football star at Princeton whom Dodge pays a hefty sum of money to bring on to the Bulldogs. His star brings glamor and success to the franchise but along with all that he also brings Lexie Littleton Renee Zellweger a Chicago Tribune reporter trying to find out the real scoop on his socalled World War 1 heroism record.As a director Clooney brings a fun airy tone to the movie which almost makes up for the screenplay's near complete lack of jokes. And as an actor he does well in the role of charming clown and Zellweger supports him nicely with a spirited and quickwitted performance. The screenplay on the other hand doesn't really work at all. There was a point halfway through where I just sat back and realized this movie really wasn't going anywhere. The story tries to shoehorn in a romance a football movie a movie about rules a movie about the celebrity culture of the game a lot of oldfashioned 1920's verbal sparring and a war story that may or may not be true into the same screenplay. There are a lot of ideas here and really that's all they seem to be. Nothing really feels fleshed out.After a promising start the football scenes are few and far between until we get to the ending where you'll see one of the most uninteresting and labored football games ever committed to film. And the romance never quite connects. I don't know if it's because the movie feels so PG or if it's because there is all this other stuff constantly in its way but the movie stifles itself and unfortunately after a certain point it never recovers despite its star's best efforts.".

Well it really wasn't either although I did find it entertaining. I must not have read the description carefully enough. No matter overall it was fun but just a little too silly. I'm beginning to wonder about the discernment of some of these actors how they can play such intelligent roles for a film or two and then revert to something like this.Anyway the story is really a Roman empire one not a King Arthur story. We only see the tiein to the later in the last few minutes of the film in the epilogue. This action story is all about the last Caesar a small boy and the last legion that fought as Rome had now been taken over by the Goths. The Roman Empire had come to an end.Mixed in with that tale was the famous excalibur sword. We see the origins of that and how it eventually got into the hands of King Arthur. But once again that is only explained in the final minutes. However the sword is used by the good Roman general who protects the last Caesar from the Goths who want him imprisoned for life or killed.What made the story interesting at least for me was the chasescene type atmosphere of a small band of heroes protecting a little boy fleeing the bloodthirsty Goths until they could mount some sort of counterattack in the north in Brittania. That and the pretty computergenerated scenery and action stunts kept it interesting. However don't look for credibility in those action scenes and expect the typical politicalcorrectness of today i.e. where a woman beats up hundreds of men and the good guys of all colors prevail despite ridiculous odds.Some parts of this will leave you shaking your head in disbelief. You will feel you're watching a kids' film at times. However if you want an hourandahalf of decent escapist fare and can put your brain on hold for that time it fits the bill and will at least entertain you.".

This is a tale of legend and it tells it quite well.For those who commented on the historical inaccuracies of costumes armor etc. they are completely wrong the costumes are accurate to the late period ask a recreator we know. And yes the long sword was in use by the Roman Army for a very long time. Late Imperial cavalrylength Roman blades were around 26 to 27 inches in length as opposed to the standard legionary 22 inch Gladius.Anyway as I said in the beginning this is a film about a legend. Do you think Gladiator was a true story? Yet it swept the Oscars. It is what it is and after two viewings I still have found no fault in the story the acting or the direction. Historical fact and cinematic storytelling are to a certain degree mutually exclusive. No matter how hard you try to stick to facts when creating historical fiction in any medium be it books or film you will inevitably come across the necessity of a compromise between what can be established as fact and even there period sources of the time are questionable and what suits the story. In other words you can be accurate to a fault so to say and have a story that reads  or visualizes  like a lead balloon or you can alter the socalled facts to suit your purpose and create much more  and far more visually compelling  drama.I guess some people just need to find fault to make themselves feel superior.Possible Spoilers As for the story line... The concept of a Roman link to the Arthurian legends is not a new one. Mary Stewart's The Crystal Cave was the first book that introduced me to the concept and since I'm a Western Civilization teacher I'm fascinated by the histories and legends that have risen from what is known as the Dark Ages of Europe.All and all The Last Legion is a great film. I recommend it to any SCAdian recreator Pagan Wiccan or Dark Ages history freak.P.S. It was certainly better than King Arthur starring Clive Owen.".

Add to this the fact that the cinematographer is obsessed with midshots and 2 shots and a composer who doesn't know when to shut his orchestra up and you something that is barely movie of the week material.";

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Last Legion";
	schema:reviewBody "There are many adaptations and versions to the tale of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table with Merlin the sorcerer and of the magical sword Excalibur some versions which set it into stone while others handed out by a lady in the water. The Last Legion is essentially touting a story about the beginnings of Excalibur and how it took to the former. However it took a long route to tell this story going all the way back to 400something AD a time where Rome is in turmoil.Actually Rome is in turmoil ever since Julius Caesar got killed by friends Romans countrymen. In a time where generals scheme to usurp the throne and politicians of the Senate are corrupt as hell it's little wonder why one of the best and most loyal generals Aurelius Colin Firth gets recalled to protect the rear of the new boykinggodCaesar Romulus Augustus played by Thomas Sangster the kid in Nanny McPhee and Tristan and Isolde. Naturally the enemies spring a surprise attack and our merry men have to flee Rome and journey to Britain to regroup with the 9th Legion henceforth also known as the Last Legion bringing in tow a seer Ambrosinus Ben Kingsley and a lady warrior in Mira Aishwarya Rai.Like most medieval stories with elements of magic or involving the higher powers from Mount Olympus The Last Legion does away with the sorcery portion like what Troy and King Arthur had done opting instead to focus more on reality and what possibly could have been done without divine intervention or fantastical assistance. Thus this makes Kingsley's role a little redundant and relegates him into a fortune teller rather than an all powerful wizard despite his garb looking a lot like Gandalf's. While it could have gotten away with its material given 10 years back unfortunately the stakes in the genre have been raised and everyone's expecting a spectacle of huge armies battling in hand to hand combat with its combatants having some form of fancy killing moves. The Last Legion pales in terms of providing that level of detail and spectacle and chose instead to provide unsophisticated battle scenes or swordplay that is a tad too uninspiring. Most of the fanciful moves were reserved for Aishwarya but even that too began to become repetitive. Not even her booby trapped enhanced short sword offered anything we're never seen before.With characters you don't really care about what made it a little unbearable amongst the good guys was the totally hokey unbelievable romance between Rai and Firth's characters. It doesn't mean that having characters from the opposite sex means they find each other irresistible and want to get into each other's pants. There is absolutely zero chemistry and zero buildup. One minute they're allies the next they're admiring each other's swordplay and then the bed beckons. And if the villains justify what kind of heroes we get then it's a no brainer that they are bland and devoid of any interesting notion. World domination seems to be their only objective and both the Romans and the British using the term loosely here villains are merely caricatures. As I said while The Last Legion might have worked if it's released 10 years ago this movie can't justify it being made now. It's suitable at most for that DVD rental for a lazy afternoon but nothing more and only if you're in dire need of some or any form of entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just got done watching this movie. And I must say if you really want to see this movie save yourself an hour and a half and just watch the trailer. The trailer is really as good as this movie gets. I'm sorry I had high hopes for this movie too. I'm a big fan of medieval and roman films but this one really just falls short on everything. I would say thats its worthy of being a scifi channel original movie but I don't don't want to insult the scifi channel Seriously they have tons of aliens and monster don't tick them off. You will get eaten.This movie falls short on pretty much every account. Casting was awful. I'm a fan of Sangster he was great in Love Actually but he's not yet strong enough to be a leading man. Firth with his quirky charm should stick to romantic comedy. He's much better at fumbling through a confession of love than being an epic hero. The plot dialog acting and directing were all horrible. I kept sitting there thinking how it could have been done better only to come to the realization the best thing to do would be to throw out everything and start over from the plot outline. The sets cheap and generic. They would have done better dusting off set pieces from Ben Hur1959. Costumes were pulled from every generic BarbarianRoman stock wardrobe or Halloween store. Perhaps one of the most distracting things was the music. I think the composer is sleeping with one or more of his trumpet players because thats all we heard. Trumpets playing as they hide Trumpets sounding during the battle Trumpets here Trumpets there. Couldn't get enough of them.At best this movie is a rental to watch at home. When you're alone. In a windowless room. Don't invite your friends over they will make fun of you. I'm sorry if this sounds cruel but like the parent of a child failing kindergarten I'm simply trying to express my disappointment for a film that could have been so much better. Its just sad.".

Everything was in the right place the music actors the plot and all... No really... I just don't get why he said I mean that guy the actors were bad. They were just brilliant! Well maybe to watch this movie u gotta have a sense of humor because many scenes in it were quite funny. Ben Kingsley Colin Firth and Thomas Sangster were really good it seemed to me. Well Aishwarya Rai could of acted better probably... But anyways I reckon there are so many really bad movies and I don't think this one is just watchitonceandthenforgetit film! Besides the whole thing was real I mean the castle all the decorations they shot it on location and if you see throngs of people running on the battlefield you know this is all real! I guess u gotta appreciate it because they could of made in on computers... I mean it's such a rare thing nowadays... Speaking about the plot... Yeah maybe it's a bit naive and even silly remember this when you watch the final scene but overall it was quite dynamic and everything. Finally it was Dino De Laurentis production they've been writing the script for 6! years so do you really think they didn't notice it was crap or something? Well maybe it's not that great compared to '300' but it's good enough anyway My conclusion is you gotta watch the movie especially if you like Colin Firth Ben Kingsley or Thomas Sangster or if you like adventures. And it seemed to me it's a kind of a teen movie rather than a serous one i suppose it's for people of 1225. And one more thing to say though it's a historic movie and i really hated history at school!!! somehow i liked it and I've seen enough movies to tell a good one. Enjoy!".

Several action scenes are outstanding with spectacular battle images and thrilling fights. Unfortunately on small house screens much of the splendor will be lost.

What starts as a huge CGI filled epic goes into a weakempty story with not the best actingaction and a terrible story.The acting talents and chances of a good film as so badly wasted and in parts the film seems to not know what it wants to be.Action film Epic historic tale kids adventure and even comic farce which was a huge mistake.Its empty and totally soulless.The ending is so bad so very very bad that Myself and a friend sat stunned.lolIts such a great shame that the main star of ROME the TV series was anywhere near this film.Rome it totally superior in every way. If you want a well writtenacted and totally realistic version of Rome see ROME don't waste your time on this.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie didn't feel like it should be on the big screen more like a miniseries. The plot goes nowhere it is just so confusing seems like a huge rip off on King Arthur.I really like historical movies but if your going to make one Historical Movie then the script writers should have done some research. The entire lookand feel of this movie comes off more like a fantasy adventure the Romans don't look act or even dress like Romans nor are they even armed liked Romans. The main character carries a long sword rather than the short sword favored by roman legionnaires. The list goes on and on it is ridiculous.I waited in impatient anticipation for this movie to say i was extremely disappointed would be an understatement. The fight scenes were dull the acting more so as for colin firth as an action hero well seriously you gotta be kidding me.6 years to write this movie hahahaha thats the funniest thing i have heard in a while they should have just googled the historical facts and the story would have been much more accurate fun and bearable to watch.The potential of this movie was huge and it was all wasted terrible casting horrid script music atrocious acting dull and poor camera work all add up to a terrible movie.To be honest my recommendation is to wait for this to get to free to air television.After reading a few posts i hvae decided to add more to this post the entertainment value has nothing to do with special effects and gore it comes down to the actors making the characters believable and drawing the viewer into the story. It has nothing to do with Gore I watch horror movies for that but if your going to have fight scenes and battles do them right. As for objectives well a movies main objective is in the main to entertain my son was as confused as I was with the story he walked off halfway through and I was 5mins behind him. As a movie I say once again this movie fails on all levels it is neither entertaining educational or emotionally engaging seemed more like a pathetic effort by all involved with the making of this film.".

I decided those who hated it were bitter angry people who should lighten up and enjoy life. To those people I apologize for thinking that. You were right. This movie seems to crawl from place to place without vision or energy. It's an epic stitched together with dull talks from actors who will take their paycheck and hope they can bounce back after this. It does feel small budget. It also feels like the editor was told to put this together so families could watch it and then just decided not to try anymore. So not only does it drag but the fight scenes are more like pushing and shoving scenes. But there was a technique employed that was clever. In it we see someone throw something an axe for example we cut to another actor's reaction That's bad. I'm awake right? then see the weapon lodged in a person's body. I think they did this three times a great example of how well this was conceived.If you don't understand what makes some movies bad and others good check this out.

I knew the movie had poor ratings and did not expect much from it before entering the theatres.The story is about the blood line of Julius Ceaser  a young child Romulus Augustus Thomas Sangster whose parents are killed kingdom overthrown and he imprisoned. His personal guard Aurelius Colin Firth joins hands with a couple of his own guards and Mira Aishwarya Rai and with the help of a sorcerer Merlin Ben Kingsley rescues the child and defeats the enemies.The movie is stupid to say the least as if we are seeing some Bgrade movies of 70s. It has good sets and excellent actions but the screenplay and dialogues are a big let down. Overall the casting is very poor. Colin Firth huffs and puffs to fit the role of a warrior guard and so overacts Thomas as a child emperor. Ben Kingsley  what are you doing in this movie? As a moral guardian of the young emperor Ben Kingsley still sounds like Mahatma Gandhi when he opens his mouth and says some philosophical and thoughtful things. Aishwarya was okay. To make her look like an Indian beauty the makeup artist put layers of brown shining dusk on her face and body. She performed her role with commitment but overexpressed herself in violent actions scenes.For director Doug Lefler this was his second ambitious project and that too with historic setting. I should say that the quality of details in expensive sets and costume etc. was finely done. The action scenes were good but not up to the mark of great directors.So what was positive about this movie? I think it is a good entertainment for children and family. It does not have a heavy complicated story and gory of sex and violence  that is normally seen in such movies. It is a clean entertainer in that way.Stars 4.5 out of 10".

The Germanic 'Barbarians' are dressed in typically Hollywood mindless barbarian clothing horned helmets which didn't exist lot's of animal skins and dirt which makes it hard to see their face.

They are not intimidating at all. Only Hrothgar James Cosmo appears to be a bit normal but James Cosmo is just cool  Too bad he only got a small part in the movie even though he is the better actor for proud strong warlike types because he was mostly the reason why I wanted to see it anyway. the Heroes Ben Kingsley is doing OK. He seems to have fun although his character is a bit weird. Colin Firth's acting seems more like 13 in a dozen 'Let's get this over with' kind of thing. He is very timid and seems mostly frustrated that he has signed to do this mediocre movie. Aishwarya Rai looks pretty but she is just not an actressGood parts James Cosmo storyline is decent but ruined by the rest of the movieOverall It's a mediocre epic movie. It claims to be in the vein of 'Lord of the Rings' but can't compete by a long shot. I think the movie 'King Arthur' is even better and has a more believable explanation of the myth although there are too many inconsistencies in that one and that movie is not very spectacular.I would rate it 5 out of 10 because the sceneries and sets look decent and at times the movie looks nice but often it more looks like an unintended parody to the genre.".

Aishwarya was hot and probably the only eye candy but if it cost 5M perhaps it would all make sense.It just goes to show that any good movie requires a director that can turn the script into a moving story and get great performances but this film looked like a miniseries for abc.. just painful to watch on the big screen. i just hope Lefler doesn't take the helm of anymore movies  i honestly didn't notice one decent close up shot and i agree the costumes were on target but they still looked right off the rack as if everyone went to a halloween costume store and the sets unrealistically clean it was not Switzerland but roman and English who didn't have street cleaners every day...and all the beginning roman sets make the movie look like it was shot in the 70s  one isn't sure they ramsacked a simple temple or all of Rome.And I agree the child was horrible...esp the beginning shots on the roman statue  yikes.. i could go on and on but it is pointless..And to those that feel this movie is worth 10 bucks.. sorry but i would feel cheated even more but luckily for me it was almost free. I give it a 3 because i wanted to see lovely Aishwarya who did a great job in her fighting sequences and too bad she didn't have more lines..at least there would have been some beauty on the screen.Save your money and just watch the trailer and wait for it as a freebie and even than you'll be terribly disappointed unless you have a great sense of humor than maybe it will become a B movie cult classic  the second most expensive after Waterworld.. at least that had good action shots.".

At the other hand I enjoy sword and sable fighting  think of Erroll Flynn or the French musketeer movies. Finally the period of the late 5th century with the fall of the Western Roman Empire is highly fascinating.This movie is not an untold story. It is historically completely inaccurate something like president Bush being in charge during the Vietnam war with Franklin Delano Roosevelt being his political opponent. As examples I will only take two points. Odoaker took over power in 475 not in 460. Wulfila died around 383.Really I like retelling or even reinventing legends. But I don't like utter nonsense. Clearly 6 years was not enough yet to write a decent script. Even then if the story was told in an interesting way the directing was skillful I might have forgiven. But no. In the beginning ancient Rome was used as a background. It was unrealistic like cheap epic movies from the 50s. Ben Hur got it much better. And the story? The director hardly takes time to show the emotional struggle of a young boy being the mightiest person in the world. It better could have left out. Now it is just one of the many scenes which remain hanging in the air.Odysseus6 is completely right about the actors so I will not repeat it. I am sorry several old sword and sandal Italian Bmovies are better than this one. Every director degrading the highly talented and skilled John Hannah to a wooden amateur like this should be put on a black list. One has to pay full attention then one can pick a few moments where the actors get the chance to act  for instance the scene where Odoaker decides to keep the boy alive. I can imagine a savage barbarian behaving like that. Problem of course is that the real Odoaker already had spend several years in Rome and was not a barbarian anymore .... He was quite a popular ruler in Italy after almost 75 years of incompetent Caesars.I will just wait for someone filming Mary Stewart's Crystal Cave or a book of Rosemary Sutcliffe. These authors show that historical drama can have roots in hard facts.Surinamese TV showed the movie at midnight so alas I cannot ask my 12 years old son if he was entertained. I was hardly.".

Besides there is something more that is not so visible in her earlier films.There are a few factors that prove this movie must have been significant for Garbo as an actress and as a personthe director Victor Sjostrom a Swede famous for a popular silent THE WIND 1928 with Lilian Gish and Lars Hanson. He was the director whom Garbo highly respected. He was not that critical in her life as Mauritz Stiller but he also had an impact on her career in Hollywood. Moreover THE DIVINE WOMAN is the one and only film she made with Sjostrom.it is another this time the third movie in which Garbo plays by the side of an aforementioned Swedish actor Lars Hanson. Before she worked with him on the set of SAGA OF GOSTA BERLING 1925 by Stiller and an unforgettable FLESH AND THE DEVIL 1926 by Brown.THE DIVINE WOMAN was one of the first movies where Garbo was given a different a more ambitious role than a shy Countess Dohma in TORRENT 1926 or a vamp Elena in THE TEMPTRESS 1926. This movie though not that significant as FLESH AND THE DEVIL 1926 started a more complex portrayal of characters by Garbo and allowed her for a wider choice.It is a great pity that so little of it has survived.

The disc double disc is currently the second of the series. The first covered the bands videos from early 1970's through 1980's Flash Gordon movie soundtrack and The Game. This one takes the band from 1981's Hot Space video's through 1988's the Miracle. There will probably be a third in the series in the next 14 months which would cover Made in Heaven and Innuendo videos. Most of the tracks on this DVD were released after the bands popularity was killed by the Works I Want To Break Free video. There are a number of rare videos which unless you have the cable channel VH1 classic you won't see played again in the US. I found two that I had never seen before in Back Chat and Scandal. Even though there are no tracks from Innuendo his last album on it you can still see early signs of Freddie expressing his battle with Aids in some of the videos from the Miracle. Scandal would be the most obvious of this as its a direct attack on the British Tabloids. This disc much like the first in the series has hidden material that was not listed on the album. On the first series there was a hidden second version of Bohemian Rhapsody. On this version there is hidden live concert footage as well as the Highlander movie version of Who wants to live forever video.".

She had previously produced BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME for Phillipe Mora which married 30s newsreel and mostly Warner Bros movie footage to gramophone songs of the period...a bit like PENNIES FROM HEAVEN but as a narrative and narration free jigsaw puzzle of depression era imagery. She later produced the superb documentary on George Stevens A FILM MAKERS JOURNEY which you must see for a definitive look at this great director's career. This time round mid 70s and post THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT and just after TOMMY and its retro Brit rock success somehow the idea to have The Beatles charthit songbook narrate World War 2 via Newsreels and 40s era Fox movies must have seemed like a great cocaine boardroom fueled possibility. So the context to create this film was definite and legitimate. It opened in Australia in the same huge 70mm Cinerama screen palaces that screened big Fox pix like The Poseidon Adventure or Butch Cassidy. I saw it at The Plaza Sydney which was the 1200 seat Imax style Spanish galleon plaster palace design  home of those pix above as well as long run reserve seat roadshows like Lucky Lady and Mad Mad World. The opening salvo of Battleships Beatles and Blitzkreig in mega 6 track magnetic stereo through whopper speakers was enough to derail the subway below and send the audience to Jupiter. What followed was such a bizarre but strangely compelling visual and aural collision that it seemed so ambitious and ugly that it worked. I think there was only about 20 people at that session. It lasted a week or so and was quickly sent into storage. Even a few years later I ran it at my holiday resort cinema without even a wisp of curiosity or possibility that it might become a cult item. Probably it is a noble failure that might now be watchable for half an hour or so but like BROTHERDIME it became tiresome after 40 minutes when you realized ironically Peggy Lee style 'Is that all there is?. No story just newsreel  Beatles MTV.".

I got the soundtrack record album which had photos but really wanted the film.  I checked the film books each year but if listed at all it was as not available on tape or disc.

The combination of sacrosanct Beatles tunes and wartime stock footage didn't sound like such a good idea and when you actually saw it it turned out to be even more ridiculous than you would have guessed. The only image I still recall 20 years on is one of the famous ones Get Back being sung over German tank footage run in reverse.

Some clot in the projection booth screwed up most of the sound system leaving what appeared to be an effects channel a rear speaker producing newsreel mono and only leakage music. The result was terrible. My chums were looking at me quizzically and equating my taste in entertainment with a haemorrhoid.Happily the projectionroom clot woke up sometime around the Battle of Midway and Elton's 'Lucy in the Sky' and the rest of the film played with all six channels as intended. My reputation was saved but I still wanted to see the whole thing again properly. Alas the film was off by the next week. I'd love to see it again.But the experience has made me nervous about buying this film from specialist DVD sellers in case the sound has been mixed or cut down.

One example of this is the general plot structure of this film. The movie feels fairly jumbled and messy because there are many different perspectives in it that don't entirely mesh and the tension does not build evenly to a climax like it does in most films. That said there are also great things about unconventional movies. This movies feels like a breath of fresh air in many ways especially considering how formulaic most horror films are these days. There are some parts of this film that are fairly tropey but I think in general the movie is fairly selfaware. It audaciously avoids some of the most pernicious tropes and puts a new spin on a lot familiar setups. The film is really pretty innovating but it feels more strange than revolutionary so I guess Karthik Subbaraj didn't get it quite right. It is well made however. The acting is good especially compared to the one other Tamil movie I've seen. The cinematography is also good. Probably the best technical aspect of the film is the sound design although the soundtrack is a little spotty.".

The film is really pretty innovating but it feels more strange than revolutionary so I guess Karthik Subbaraj didn't get it quite right. It is well made however. The acting is good especially compared to the one other Tamil movie I've seen. The cinematography is also good. Probably the best technical aspect of the film is the sound design although the soundtrack is a little spotty.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is 'Pizza' which should be charged for cheating its audience with an overloaded use of 'deus ex machina'. Before I move further let me explain what the term 'deus ex machina' signifies the same way film critic Roger Ebert did while reviewing Spike Jonze's delectable 'Adaptation'  by quoting from Wikipedia the term is used for 'a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved with the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event character ability or object'. While Adaptation is able to inventively ingeniously and effectively fit this device into its plot structure Pizza leaves its audience puzzled searching for answers only to reveal after that important pieces were kept hidden from them all the while. The only purpose of its deus ex machina is for its writer director Karthik Subbaraj to show just how 'unbelievable' his twist is the problem is that the audience doesn't go 'Oh how could I miss this!' in Pizza because the film's plot never allowed them to catch it in the first place. The twist takes the film to an altogether new tangent which we couldn't have guessed at all and we are left cold I want my money back!Pizza opens with a group of ghost hunters scanning for paranormal activity in a supposedly haunted house which ends in a cliffhanger the moment their device detects a presence. That's when our lead actor switches off the television on which the 'movie' was running and we're taken to the actual setting where our lead couple is cuddled up talking about ghosts. We learn that the lady Anu is a writer of horror stories and is researching by watching a number of films and books while her guy Michael is a pizza delivery man who has his reservations about anything supernatural. While delivering a file to his boss' home Michael finds out that his boss' daughter is possibly possessed by a spirit and her father is desperately trying to cure her. This incident haunts him especially because the girl looks directly at him while possessed and screams out the name 'Nithya!' demonically. The other incident that besets him is Anu's announcement that she's pregnant but they reconcile and get married privately. One night he is found by the owner in the pizza joint covered in blood along with his colleagues who are also bruised badly. He then tells the others about his nightmarish experience at a home where he had gone to deliver pizzas. After this incident Anu goes missing and attempts to locate her also fail.The film failed to give me anything to search for and Subbaraj left missing too many things which could have made my attempts easier in finding some sense in the film. You should be able to tease your audience throughout in a manner that when they are tricked they don't feel cheated. In a great movie like M. Night Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' the twist didn't need a major clarification because we knew we were sold by it and later we could sit and think of all the subtle hints we missed during the film. In Pizza the twist fails badly and the most explicit proof for its failure is the fact that it required about five to ten minutes of clarifications in the resolution to show us how it actually worked. This time is taken in revealing things that weren't shown to us at all before and could've simplified our confusion without losing the intended twist's effectiveness.Although I commend Karthik Subbaraj's attempt of blending the genres of horror suspense comedy thriller and mystery his film Pizza fails to whet our appetite. We leave the theatre with a bad taste in our mouths. note I watched two films of Vijay Sethupathi in two days Soodhu Kavvum yesterday and Pizza today without realizing until checking his Wikipedia page that he was one and the same actor! That's some good acting!More on sashankkini.wordpress.com".

For those of us who know it primarily from the sound films with first Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald and later Fernando Lamas and Lana Turner this version will be quite interesting. Let's just say that what was put in the talkies was a lot closer to the stage production. Erich Von Stroheim who directed this film added quite a bit to the story. In fact in the end it isn't quite so merry.Most of the film is taken up with just how Mae Murray became The Merry Widow. She's an American dancer who is stranded in the remote Balkan kingdom of Monteblanco which is ruled by King George Fawcett. In line for the throne is the rakish Roy D'Arcy a Snidely Whiplash villain if there ever was one. Behind him is his cousin John Gilbert playing Prince Danilo.Murray comes to the attention of both men Gilbert actually falls for her D'Arcy would like an occasional roll in the hay but marry her? There's a third guy out there in Tully Marshall who is the wealthiest man in the kingdom and it's principal banker. He leaves and the whole place goes into receivership. Marshall's an old dude with some alternative sexual interests that Von Stroheim exploits to the fullest on screen and he'd like a young trophy wife and Murray fills the bill.She does become a wife ever so briefly and then of course the Merry Widow having had her fill of royalty. But now that she holds the Monteblanco purse strings D'Arcy has taken a renewed interest in her and maybe she just might be a suitable queen.I think you can see where this is going though Von Stroheim does tease us a bit with some possible alternatives before the film concludes. The audience of 1925 saw one lavish production that nearly broke the new MetroGoldwyn studio. We only see about half the footage he shot if that.One thing that Metro did not have to worry about was a soundtrack. The music of The Merry Widow was very familiar to the American public and it's played on the organ throughout the film. Young contract players Joan Crawford and Clark Gable are extras in the ballroom scene and good luck in spotting them. Although in the Citadel film series book on The Films Of Clark Gable there is a still from The Merry Widow where Gable is pointed out.I'm sure John Gilbert little dreamed that in six years Gable would be supplanting him as the number one leading man at MGM. But in The Merry Widow he's a stalwart and resolute Danilo and Mae Murray actually does suggest a bit of what Jeanette MacDonald's performance would be in the first sound remake.In the fate of what happens to D'Arcy's character Von Stroheim opts for some realism in terms of the European scene of the past 25 years or so before the film debuted. In fact very little of the happy tone of The Merry Widow is preserved here. The film given how Murray got her millions ought to be retitled The Trophy Widow.Still it's an interesting alternative to the normal operetta productions we're used to seeing.".

	schema:headline " Officially my second favourite Stroheim film!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Cheshire reporting from the 2004 Sydney Film Festival where Erich von Stroheim's Merry Widow was just given a resounding hurrah! It was the darling of the festival! Never have i heard such hooping and cheering. Our enjoyment of the film was no doubt enhanced by the wonderful print and live piano violin and brass accompaniment we were treated to.I know Stroheim only went to Hollywood because he wanted to inject a bit of reality into the movies  and i think he did that superbly with Greed and those pictures before it. But the thing i loved most about Foolish Wives for instance my favourite Stroheim film so far keeping in mind i'm yet to see Blind Husbands was not how natural and real its performances were though this was incredible but Stroheim's wickedly subversive sense of humour. Foolish Wives is divine black comedy  and Merry Widow continues that tradition not Stroheim's dream of realism. I can't believe Stroheim was depressed at how successful this film was because he abandoned any attempts at realism to make it.I think he achieves something better. I'm not one of these fellows who insists a picture hold a mirror up to reality to be good  if i was interested in reality i'd watch a documentary or perhaps sit on a park bench and watch the thing itself! I go to the pictures to see a different world with a reality all its own. Its why i love the work of Fellini the Coen Brothers David Lynch Wes Anderson Kubrick and Co. They give us something better than reality! I think that's what Stroheim does here and despite the fact that he didn't respect what he did I think its among his greatest achievements. For modern audiences The Merry Widow is one of the most delightful pieces of black salacious comedy available before the last twenty years along with Bunuel's priceless L'Age D'Or. Such intelligent aware humour  we all had a great laugh at the State Theatre in Sydney.John Gilbert looks marvelous on screen and MY what a fantastic actor he was. But the show is all but stolen by Roy D'Arcy as Stroheim's beloved evil cousin figure. His salacious grin is a thing to behold. He cracked the audience up throughout. Seems D'Arcy is a great unsung hero of the cinema from looking at his credits list. Perhaps a rediscovery of La Boheme and Bardleys the Magnificent might rejuvenate his memory not to mention a beautiful DVD edition of The Merry Widow... or even a VHS edition! Who are we kidding here guys! This is not only one of the most enjoyable silent films i've ever seen its just a darn tootin' good comedy!For all the talk of the boundless shots of shoes i'd heard were in this movie i was expecting it to be a twohour long shoestore commercial. Whoever went on like that about this movie including Irving Thalberg must SO not have even heard of foot fettishism. Its so obvious when you see the picture. There are probably six shots of shoes in the picture total ! and four of them are to illustrate one of the Bcharacters as a foot fetishist which is fairly obvious since he licks his lips and virtually salivates when he looks at feet! This is also ironic for this character because his feet are the location of his disability he walks with comic difficulty on two replacement feet crutches. The remaining shoe shots are part of a delightful scene involving a game of footsies which i won't spoil for you but they are most certainly justified by the narrative.Look this is the sort of film i'd love to have on a pretty DVD edition attention Kino! as part of the wonderful Erich von Stroheim Collection sitting next to my bed so i can watch it to send me off onto a nice sleep. Its the most fun of Stroheim's films but he in no way sells out in my opinion. The humour is satirical subversive let's see what i can get away with comedy  a treat!For the record i recommend to you in this order1. Foolish Wives 2. The Merry Widow when its released some time soon or at a film festival near you 3. Greed 4. The Wedding March 5. Queen Kellythe only other surviving Stroheim picture i'm yet to see is Blind Husbands and he only directed some scenes from MerryGoRound which you can see on the doco The Man You Love to Hate  they're pretty great!".

	schema:reviewBody "lierDespite this film having the same title as the 1934 Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald movie it bears no real similarity other than the characters names and title. Otherwise they really are completely unalike. I have no idea if the '34 version has anything to do with the operetta though apparently the 1925 one only has a passing similarity. John Gilbert plays a Prince in a fictional European nation. His rival is the nasty Roy D'Arcyhis cousin the Crown Prince. Both are army officers and womanizers who both fall for a pretty American Mae Murray. However she just finds them both annoying at first. However Gilbert's charms win her overand hers win him as well and he decides to marry hereven if Princes are NOT supposed to marry commoners. But on the day of their wedding Gilbert is a noshowhaving been convinced to give up the folly of marrying her. Naturally she is heartbroken and the ULTRAsuper creepy Baron Tully Marshall offers to marry her. After all he is a major foot fetishist and she has the most exquisite feet!! Ick! You'd even more icky when you see the aging Marshall who looks a bit like death warmed over! Fortunately for Murray the new husband dies on their wedding night. I say fortunate because he looked like the type who might eat or strangle her! I mean he is REAAALLY creepy!! Now this lady is now a rich Baroness and quite a welcomed member of royal society.So now that Murray is somebody what will happen? Will she once again fall for Gilbert's promises and virile ways or will she tell him to get lost? Well it sure looks like the latter as she now is cozying up to the snakelike Crown Princeas nasty piece of work he is! Plus the more Gilbert pursues her the more she puts him in his place. But when she announces her plans to marry the Crown Prince Gilbert goes nuts and attacks himwhich leads to them arranging to fight a duel. Will Gilbert survive to win the widow or will he soon be assuming room temperature? Tune in to this film and find out for yourself.The film is exceptionally well madewith gorgeous sets lovely matte paintings and lots of cool costumes. It's obvious that MGM spared no expense for this production though I was surprised that Louis B. Meyer allowed Erich von Stroheim to helm this project considering his reputation for waaay overexcess with his bazillionreeled epic Greed being pared down by an angry studio just a few years earlier. Regardless the film looked great and was quite enjoyableone of the better silents I have seen.By the way at the 127 minute mark get a load of Murray's headdressit's a riot.".

Until then the film has been a series of vaguely related scenes fading out in what becomes a predictable mannerism. Then it picks up pace.

But it called attention to itself primarily because a lot of the film should have tasted the cutting room floor. This one needed a ruthless editing. The scenes in which the king and queen pry apart the enraged cousins Gilbert and D'Arcyare hilarious however. I don't think though that they were meant as farce.".

	schema:reviewBody "The biggest problem I have with user reviews on websites like IMDb is that the reviews are usually much too positive. People seem to love everything and they seem to expect everyone else to love everything too. Positive reviews are invariably rated helpful and negative reviews are spat upon. The childish rule of If you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all has a remarkable appeal for otherwise sensible adults... it is so strange.I rarely give strongly positive reviews but The Merry Widow is such a fantastic movie that giving it a 10 is quite easy. Why is it fantastic? Well for starters John Gilbert is a revelation in this film. I've seen him in a few other silents but he is incomparable here. His eyes his expressions his movements.... it is marvelous just to watch him. Von Stroheim gives Gilbert lots of screen time to express his mental turmoil and Gilbert does so with remarkable depth and nuance for a silent film. Next the other actors are excellent in their roles. Roy D'Arcy is terrific as the mean fastidious and sly Crown Prince. Unlike most Von Stroheim villains his rather ham fisted nastiness does not become an annoying caricature  he is actually rather charming and funny with a strange mixture of grace and hunched awkwardness. Mae Murray is incandescent as the love interest  the superb cinematography makes her look gorgeous almost ethereal at times  though her acting while good isn't the best in this particular movie. Everyone else in the cast more than pulls his weight.The story too is quite wonderful. There are many twists and turns... it almost feels like an epic... and the pacing creates plenty of tension and suspense. I also noticed the editing  the shooting was quite complex and the cutting very skillful. Then there's Von Stroheim's usual opulence with respect to decor costume and all the little details that evoke oldstyle European aristocracy. But even in the midst of the opulence there's a scene shot out in an open barren field that is remarkably atmospheric and utterly simple. I could go on and on....There's really nothing to quibble with here. If possible wait to see it in a cinema with live piano accompaniment  I felt very fortunate to have had that opportunity.".

I could go on and on....There's really nothing to quibble with here. If possible wait to see it in a cinema with live piano accompaniment  I felt very fortunate to have had that opportunity.";

	schema:reviewBody "Merry Widow The 1925  out of 4 Bigbudget version of the classic stage production marked the final time MGM would work with director von Stroheim who was hired on for what was suppose to be a short film but he would take it and mold it into a 137minute epic of sorts. The story is pretty well known but it centers on an American dancer Mae Murray who gets stranded in a small town where she meets a Prince John Gilbert who quickly falls for her. The two have many troubles throughout their relationship including the King George Fawcett objecting. According to legend MGM offered von Stroheim a 10000 bonus if he could shoot this movie in a three week period. Each week he was over that the bonus would be sliced by 2000. Needless to say it ended up taking four months to shoot and MGM pocketed any bonus money that was to be given out. Apparently this film nearly brought the studio down but it turned out being a hit and the rest is history. von Stroheim certainly has a very sinister look and atmosphere running throughout the film and this is something I'm not sure would be in future versions. Since this is the first version I've seen I really can't compare it to anything but I'm sure fans of the director or silent film buffs will really eat this film up even if it isn't the masterpiece one would hope for considering the talent involved. The highlight is clearly the visual look of the film which is quite stunning from the opening shot to the final one. There are all sorts of strange camera set ups including my favorite that happens around the fiftyminute mark as Murray and Gilbert are having dinner and the director keeps the camera in a long shot with the two actors sitting at the very right of the screen nearly off camera. This is such a strange shot that it can't help but grab your attention and make you take notice. There are countless other great trick shots throughout the film and von Stroheim certainly builds a wonderful atmosphere that is quite thick and at times haunting. The performances by the two leads are very good as well with both playing off one another wonderfully. I thought the romantic aspect of the story was fully believable as both actors perfectly nail the more dramatic parts and Gilbert getting a special notice for some nice comic timing. If I had any problem with the film its the running time as I felt there could have been some trims here and there and nothing would have been lost on the story. Apparently Clark Gable and Joan Crawford are extras in the mammoth ballroom sequence but I was unable to spot them.".

The film leaves us with a number of unforgettable setpieces Assassin Charles McGraw plying his trade in a Turkish bath Ryder not being able to acknowledge his new bride for fear of blowing his cover a murder which one of the agents dares not prevent or even react to. TMen looks terrific keeps us on edge and deserves its reputation as one of the highpoints of the film noir cycle.";

They meet all kinds of criminal types of both sexes and in good noir style the tension mounts before they too become informed on.Our good guys blend well into the criminal world in their performances.

Posing as low ranked hoodlums left over from a long thought of disbanded gang the two men find themselves immersed in a dark underworld of violence and deceit. Getting in was easy coming out alive is a different matter.The first pairing of director Anthony Mann and master cinematographer John Alton TMen is tough semi documentary type film noir that manages to break free of its plot simplicity confines to become a fine movie. Beginning with a foreword delivered by a stoic Treasury official the film initially feels it's going to be standard gangstercops fare. But once our two intrepid agents go undercover and we hit the underworld Mann and Alton shift the tone and the film becomes a different beast. The psychological aspects start to dominate the narrative as both O'Keefe and Ryder cast aside their humanity to be at one with the grubby world.

The edges of the frame have become blurred.The psychological tints would mean nothing without Alton's photography it's the key element and therefore becomes essential viewing for film noir aficionados. His deep focus chiaroscuro compositions are very striking and tell us more visually than anything being said vocally.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is rather reminiscent of the excellent Alan Ladd Noir film APPOINTMENT WITH DANGER about a postal inspector infiltrating a murderous gang. In this case the undercover work is done by two Treasury agentsDennis O'Keefe and Alfred Ryder. I really liked these two as leads because despite being far from household names the acting was excellent and believable. Also true to Noir they weren't exactly handsome guysmore like a tough average man instead of the usual nonNoir heroes.O'Keefe and Ryder play undercover agents who are trying to infiltrate a gang of counterfeiters. It's dangerous work and they can't just arrest people because they have no idea who is in charge. Throughout the film tough bad guys such as Charles McGraw and unflinching but realistic violence is presentas well as an excellent level of suspense. Unlike some Noir films this one pulls no punches nor does it give way to sentimentality. This is a seldomseen but exceptional film for lovers of the genre.By the way I had one minor complain and that was the terrible narration. My score for the film because of this is knocked from an 8 to 7. When the film began a Treasury official gave an introduction that was VERY stilted and he simply couldn't read his lines well. Then throughout the film a different narrator spoke on occasion and just wasn't necessary to the filmit was a minor distraction.".

Throughout the film tough bad guys such as Charles McGraw and unflinching but realistic violence is presentas well as an excellent level of suspense. Unlike some Noir films this one pulls no punches nor does it give way to sentimentality. This is a seldomseen but exceptional film for lovers of the genre.By the way I had one minor complain and that was the terrible narration. My score for the film because of this is knocked from an 8 to 7. When the film began a Treasury official gave an introduction that was VERY stilted and he simply couldn't read his lines well. Then throughout the film a different narrator spoke on occasion and just wasn't necessary to the filmit was a minor distraction.";

Much credit must go to Charles McGraw who elevates the film to a higher level the minute he appears. Everything about this man bespeaks of film noir and here as the head torpedo he's as nasty as they come.What shoots this picture in the foot is the jumpy plot structure which is constantly filled in with unneeded voice over.

Working under assumed names they go to Detroit and pose as the only surviving members of a well known gang and are accepted by local mob boss Carlo Vantucci Anton Costa who employs them to work on his counterfeit liquor stamps racket.It soon becomes apparent that a man called The Schemer Wallace Ford is the gang's L.A. connection and O'Brien immediately leaves for L.A. to follow up this lead. His subsequent contact with The Schemer helps him to meet people at progressively higher positions in the organisation as he tries to find out the identity of the man in charge.After Genaro has joined O'Brien in L.A. the boss of the gang arrives by ship from China and O'Brien meets Diana Simpson Jane Randolph who is second in command of the organisation. She distrusts The Schemer and ruthlessly arranges to have him killed. The Schemer however had kept a written record of the gang's activities and the discovery of his notebook eventually enables the Treasury Department to ascertain all the knowledge they require to bring the gang's work to an end.The story is based on records of actual Treasury Deapartment investigations and its authenticity is emphasised by the movie's very formal introduction which is spoken by a Treasury official. The two agents are incredibly dedicated and endure tremendous hardships as they pursue their investigation. They suffer great physical violence the constant fear of being exposed as TMen and both find themselves in situations where they have to severely repress their natural feelings and reactions to events because to do otherwise would blow their cover. These men fit into their criminal roles with a level of ease and enthusiasm which suggests that their aptitude for the work might well be rooted in some darker recesses of their psychological make up than even they are able to recognise.The skillful work of director Anthony Mann and cinematographer John Alton is exemplary. The camerawork is incredibly inventive with some great low angle shots which work really well including one in which the audience see the action from floor level whilst looking up through a table lamp. The use of close ups contributes to the tension generated in some scenes and creative use of steam smoke and chiaroscuro lighting reinforce the overall atmosphere of the piece.TMen is an exciting and sometimes violent film with particularly good performances from the actors in the lead roles and some rather tense sequences in which O'Brien and Genaro find themselves in very dangerous predicaments.".

While it would probably work well enough in a pulp magazine or wherever a story like this would turn up in print it seems just about made for it though despite the presence of the real treasury department officials it's fictional the narrator who comes off like an even more deadpan version and of course less subtly satirical of the VO in the Killing disrupts the flow of the story where it could be just excellent without it. Little things pop up that could be filmed just was well finding out the clues and the details and not overrun with the hamfisted voice of authority. If it was even done in shorter bits interspersed fine. But as it is it's the only big letdown of the movie making it dated at least more than usual.And yet this doesn't detract from what should be a mustsee for those who want to immerse themselves in a creative visual style. The teamup of Mann and his DP John Alcott was a match made in shadowheaven and their collaboration brings out such a strong style that it's hard to look away. This plus the performances from Dennis O'Keefe Wallace Ford Charles McGrayw make it a firecracker of a thriller involving a story of two federal treasury agents out for a big sting with a nest of counterfeiters in Los Angeles and Detroit. When Man directs certain scenes they pop like you want one of these 'oldschool' hard boiled flicks to go. The violence actually isn't very cheap either at least for the period and it's a big bang where another director might've gone for the limp whimper. The villains are tough but like any good soldier undercover the hand is always a little slicker one step ahead. When it's at its best TMen is like the supercool grandfather to the likes of the Departed.If only for the preachiness and that stupid voice who apparently for good reason is uncredited I'd recommend it as wholeheartedly as Raw Deal. As it stands it's still very good with the kinds of doublecrosses and moments of tension i.e. the leadup to the Schemer's demise that rank with the finest the genre has. Bottom line you're bound to find one or two of the compositions in TMen right smackdab in the examples of textbook filmnoir lighting and design maximum impact of Bmovie reaching art. 8.510".

The villains are tough but like any good soldier undercover the hand is always a little slicker one step ahead. When it's at its best TMen is like the supercool grandfather to the likes of the Departed.If only for the preachiness and that stupid voice who apparently for good reason is uncredited I'd recommend it as wholeheartedly as Raw Deal. As it stands it's still very good with the kinds of doublecrosses and moments of tension i.e. the leadup to the Schemer's demise that rank with the finest the genre has. Bottom line you're bound to find one or two of the compositions in TMen right smackdab in the examples of textbook filmnoir lighting and design maximum impact of Bmovie reaching art. 8.510";

The matter of fact voiceover that sets this taut crime thriller up broadly paints the world in very distinct blacks and whites. At once we have sympathy for these TMen Treasury Men that risk life and limb to stop counterfeiters. Just imagine a film made today had the villains not responsible for nuclear terrorism child pornography or dirty bombs but rather printing funny money. It sort of gives you an idea of where our society has gone.Despite some predictable plotting TMen is a very suspenseful film that manages to ratch up the tension as it goes and the cast of b string players are uniformly great to watch and listen to. At first I feared that the DVD would be spotty but the restoration was completed by some division of Sony as opposed to some quickie praying on films whose copywrite had lapsed into the public domain. Yeah it might have been better with Dana Andrews and Richard Widmark but these players acquit themselves just fine and the John Alton camera work is often amazing the peak of which is a low angle shot of the two leads standing next to a sink. If you are not simply doing a side by side based on casting famous players this films stands up to anything being made in the genre at that time and very few of the films released in multiplexes today can match it for straight ahead suspense.".

Seemed very forced at times and definitely lacked the FoleyRosewoodTaggart chemistry that made the first two films so successful. Hector Elizondo is no replacement for John Ashton. The return of Bronson Pinchot as Serge was painful to watch.5 out of 10 based more on Eddie Murphy's performance than anything else.".

Seemed very forced at times and definitely lacked the FoleyRosewoodTaggart chemistry that made the first two films so successful. Hector Elizondo is no replacement for John Ashton. The return of Bronson Pinchot as Serge was painful to watch.5 out of 10 based more on Eddie Murphy's performance than anything else.";

	schema:reviewBody "Eddie Murphy's third outing as Detroit police detective Axel Foley who seems to have made more of a crime fighting contribution to Beverly Hills still generates some power in the series but the first two films are naturally the better ones. The film inexplicably removes the John Taggart John Ashton and Andrew Bogomil Ronny Cox characters from the series and adds a shallow new character named John Flint Hector Elizondo. Fortunately Billy Rosewood Judge Reinhold is still around and he still manages to be a perfect foil for Foley. Foley's third case in Beverly Hills is a little improbable but the action scenes help to make up for the plot which has to do with Foley matching wits with a corrupt head of security Timothy Carhart at a popular Beverly Hills amusement park called WonderWorld a creation of Paramount Parks. The park character costumes and designs are nice and colorful and Theresa Randle helps to pick things up as a potential love interest for Foley but the film doesn't give Murphy very many funny lines and that is a disappointment if one wants to label this film as a comedy. The action is as usual great but Murphy is reknowned as a comedy star and the lack of laughs here prevent this from being a perfect series. Still it's a very good series.".

Beverly Hills Cop is an actioncomedy!! See the key word here is action which means realistic gun battles and realistic plot. The first two films had cleverly placed comedy relief where it was needed while having a very serious gritty side. This lacks it SERIOUSLY! Inspector Todd wasn't grouchy enough Eddie wasn't enough of a smartass like he should and the villain is a damned joke think of Patrick American Psycho Bateman if he was a blond 90's cartoon bad guy. The only people who were marginally entertaining are Rosewood and Serge. The other amusing element is the moment when Axel disrupts a speech by Ellis DeWald the blond Al Bundy possessed by demons who act like Patrick Bateman. THAT'S IT! Of all the people in Hollywood with professional experience to direct a decent action film and BHC III picks John Landis. Why? And what in the bloody blue hell was he smoking injecting and imbibing when he was directing this insult to the entire franchise! At least the Batman franchise was good through the third movie! What's the deal with this movie being a goddamn amusement park. If it is in Disneylandtype park then make it a Die HardLethal Weapontype of fare at least. Better yet don't do it an in an amusement park! Action and Disneylandesque theme parks  1970s disaster Bmovie!Almost everything and I mean EVERYTHING is a discouraging mockery to the series. One would expect a car chase even in a bad movie to be good somewhat. Turns out in BHC 3 even the car chase at the beginning was complete and total s!t! Why couldn't the producers and director stick to terrorists and political assassins and have it end in the classic allAmerican whiteknuckle sweatyarmpit inducing style of shootoutbloodbath in the amusement park? Hey Landis! Stick to directing cheesyass videos for billiondollar diva musicians!! Sadly I hate myself for saying this but as absurd as most of Jerry Bruckhiemer's movies are this is the only franchise where his sensationalist fantasy is needed the most.".

With the help of his friend Billy Rosewood Judge Reinhold they go on a rollercoaster ride to Wonderworld to find the killer. This movie is a mixture of action and comedy with some of the best oneliners that Axel has said. Yep this movie is full of swearing like the first two but it has more violence but hey that's life.Steven E DeSouza wrote this story with the help of Eddie Murphy making rewrites and overall this made a pretty good story. The new producers on the film Robert Rehme and Mace Neufeld take over from Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and the new director the great and funny John Landis takes the helm. Sadly a few actors are missing from this movie there's no John Ashton and Ronny Cox. The movie starts a bit different to the other two movies there's no starting credits the movie just starts. But along from that the movie is very funny and is a good part in series. John Landis has put a lot of director cameo's in this movie they are George Lucas Martha Coolidge Joe Dante Peter Medak Arthur Hiller Barbet Schroeder and John Singleton. All of the cameo's from the director's are very funny and makes you wonder if they really do this sort of stuff in real life when they aren't making movies. It might have been panned by critics and people but overall its very funny and a great movie.".

I have this one on tape off the TV and it is bad because they cut out the swearing.Which would have added to the humor This Movie is not the worst film but not the best. I hope Number 4 is going to be a big hitif they make it. On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give this Movie a 5.

They were a big part of the first two. But in conclusion this was a very good movie and I enjoyed all 3 very very much and I'm a Big Eddie Murphy fan now because of these movies. I can honestly say that I was not a fan of him at all until I saw these movies. I own all 3 of these movies and if the 4th one does end up being made hopefully it will be like the first 3 and still be a rated R movie with a lot of action and comedy like these 3. I really really hope they don't bring down the rating and make this a family movie or ruin this at all. AXEL RULES!!!! Thank You MR4".

If you can take this turn towards the comedic in stride then you will enjoy Beverly Hills Cop III. For example there is the running joke that Axel goes to Wally World and when he calls Billy and tells him he's going to Wally World after he has an arrest warrant Billy is at first Axel you have to turn yourself in with policemen looking on in his police office  then  No! Wait for me! like he's going to be left out! It's lines and situations like these that make this part III so funny. And Serge's cameo is a hoot! Recommended!".

But unlike the other two movies which had a good mix of action and comedy Beverly Hills Cop III is alarmingly short on actual humour and way too violent Steven E. deSouza's script has by the numbers stamped all over it and hardly anyone seems to have his or her heart in it including the usually dependable Murphy. Hector Elizondo Judge Reinhold and John Saxon are welcome but underused. Just as Licence To Kill didn't really feel like a Bond movie so this doesn't feel like it belongs with the other two even the return of Bronson Pinchot as Serge feels arbitrary.Add a scene with an amusement ride in peril that's ruined by effects that would be easier to forgive if this movie had been made in 1974 rather than '94 throw in a poor score by Nile Rodgers that leans heavily on Harold Faltermeyer's Axel F not that fans of song soundtracks have anything to cherish here either and you have a real lifesappening loser  almost as bad as Boomerang which at least had Halle Berry.

In short this film is not a high quality movie but a very nice film to sit back relax and enjoy the humor and action. Only pity is that the dutch rental DVD is missing out a scene.

	schema:reviewBody "The faceplate reviewer goes out of his way to pan the leads Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser as being too old curmudgeonly and too fat and weepy. OK. Thanks for expressing those opinions which BTW I don't share. Yes. There's no doubt this is a sentimental flick with great emotional overtones and certainly qualifies as a three hanky job. Seeing children suffer whether they're cute charming cuddly or not is not pleasant. But the fact that there are these kinds of kids who endure the ravages of disease stemming from their own bodies is a sad reality and I would argue it takes a pretty stern person to consider these conditions unemotionally. The movie is based on a book and like any biopic a certain amount of license is taken in bringing the story to the screen. However the story is never maudlin. The script is full of sentiment but never slips down to the level of being overly sentimental. In effect it's a tale of people with various agendas driven by the desperation of a father trying to help his children from dying an early death. There is no deus ex machina here. The conflicts which impede the goal largely stem from the personal agendas of the players in the drama. Sound familiar? You bet. That's what good writing is all about and when life imitates myth it's even better. This is a good movie. Go see it. And if you do so without puddling up at the eyeballs you're made of sterner stuff than me.".

It's often difficult to objectively assess the work in a contemporary film because much of the surroundings seem common place. I can say that the sets art direction and costuming seemed to be a comfortable fit and lent it a sense of realism that I appreciated and that also happened to add to the fine production quality of the film.But as must be the case in a film of this nature the quality ultimately comes down to the efforts invested by the director and his cadre of accomplished actors. Their efforts certainly didn't disappoint me. The lion's share of the load was placed squarely on the shoulders of Brendan Fraser as John Crowley. I had a personal sense of justice on the line with how well he might do. There were several scenes that rang true to life for me his portrayal of the internally tortured desperate and determined father of two terminally ill children made me feel he did such real fathers justice. I think I can say that because I once was one myself.The other performances were excellent as well. I would have a tough time in faulting Harrison Ford as Dr. Robert Stonehill. He gave a great performance as an overworked frustrated scientist  something I can also relate to as I've been something of a scientist in my past myself. He felt real to me I've known men just like him maybe including me  I guess you'd have to ask my former colleagues how close it was.But the other performance that I was particularly taken with was that of Courtney B. Vance as Marcus Temple. His tight emotional presentation went right to my heart and hung there heavily. It felt like me I wanted to hug the man maybe cry with him. I'd love to see him receive a nomination for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Not to be left out is Keri Russell as Aileen Crowley. She gave a good performance but to me it seemed a little less emotional than mothers like this I've personally known especially my own wife. I also think they could have given her more space to reveal a character that would be more in depth but that's not her fault  maybe the screen writers? So in the final analysis I think she did a great job and certainly did nothing to diminish real mothers like her character.As one may have surmised from what I've written I may be too personally prejudiced to look at any film like this with artistic fairness. So judge me if you like you can go to a web site at httpwebpages.charter.netbruce.jones1 and click on the button labeled Belinda on the left it gives a personally biased but true story of my daughter's struggle for life. Let me know what you think ... you can also be treated to photos of the world's largest Lady Bug collection as a reward for your trip  a collection she started.The bottom line is this  by all means go see this film especially if you've been so fortunate as to never have experienced this kind of tragedy yourself. And when you do see it give some thought in the future to the fact that in this country we spend more money advertising beer than we do fighting lethal childhood diseases.".

The audience all laughed out loud at several parts and while there are some tearjerker moments when it's all said  done the movie has a feel good ending and is inspiring. I have also read the book that this movie is based on and the script writer did a nice job of translating the book into the big screen. The movie was true to the science  with a scientist on set who was personally involved in ERT research for Pompe even the equations on the boards in Stonehill's office are accurate. This has been a personal project of Ford's for years  well done. Go see it!".

	schema:headline " Not extraordinary but a good film you can enjoy at home!";
	schema:reviewBody "Scientists get all sensible  careful when they get old. Young ones like risk not afraid of new ideas. Director Tom Vaughan takes a much more serious approach in Extraordinary Measures then he did with the 2008 comedy What Happens in Vegas starring Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz. This movie which also stars two Alist actors Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser is a drama focusing on a father's effort to raise millions of dollars to help fund the research of a scientist who is trying to find a cure for Pompe disease a rare genetic disorder that two of his children have. The film is based on the book written by Geeta Anand The Cure which is based on the true story of the Crowley family. The screenplay was adapted by Oscar nominated writer Robert Nelson Jacobs Chocolat. I think that Jacobs did a pretty decent job at enlightening us about the disease and covered the scientific research well enough so that we could understand what was going on without getting bored. Vaughan could have made this a tearjerker and played with the viewers emotions but he did a great job with trying to stay true to the material and not turning this into a melodrama like My Sister's Keeper was. The film works well with strong performances from the entire cast but I still can't see why anyone would want to see this movie in the theaters because it felt more like a made for television movie although I don't think that is necessarily a bad thing. By the end of the movie I felt enlightened and respected the work of these scientists but I am also glad I waited to watch this movie at home and didn't go see it at the movies.John Crowley Brendan Fraser is a successful advertising businessman who lives with his wife Aileen Keri Russell and three children Megan Meredith Droeger Patrick Diego Velasquez and John Jr. Sam M. Hall in Portland. Megan and Patrick suffer from a genetic disorder known as the Pompe disease. The kids who suffer from this disease never make it past nine and after Megan turns eight and almost losses her life to the disease John decides it is time to take drastic and extraordinary measures. He has spent many years researching about the disease and discovers some interesting theories on enzyme treatment from a scientist located in Nebraska named Robert Stonehill Harrison Ford. After trying to contact him and not receiving any response from the Doctor John decides to travel to Nebraska and convince him to pursue his research. Stonehill is not really person oriented he has poor communication skills and has had difficulty coming up with the funds to further his research. John tells Stonehill that he will help raise the money and after hosting several fund raisers and meeting other parents who have children with the same disease such as Marcus Temple Courtney B. Vance they raise about 90 thousand dollars which is a lot less than what they needed but more than Stonehill expected him to raise. John decides to quit his job and work full time with Stonehill helping him raising the funds they need from capitalist groups. Their relationship isn't the best one and they have their disagreements but John will do whatever it takes to find a cure for his children before running out of time.The hardest decision for John was to quit his job and work full time for Stonehill away from home. The ethical dilemma was either to give up and enjoy as much time he could with his children or try to find a cure which meant he would have to spend a lot of time away from home and the results weren't guaranteed. John took the risk and decided he had to do what was in his power to try to find a cure for his children. The movie also deals with scientific objectivity and how sometimes emotions and feelings are not necessarily a bad mixture. The movie focuses on these issues and doesn't rely only on the family melodrama of dealing with the disease it tries to remain objective but at the same time inform us of the reality of this genetic disorder in children. The movie isn't a highly entertaining film but it does work as a serious drama and one you would enjoy seeing in the comfort of your home. Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser are decent in their roles although nothing we haven't seen from them in the past. Courtney B. Vance and Jared Harris have a couple of strong scenes in the supporting role. The kids are OK as well although they don't play a major role in this movie as one would expect. The movie is far from being extraordinary but it still is a decent film which I would recommend only for home viewing.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The unfortunate thing about movie trailers is that they tend to give away too much of the plot. In the quest to give the audience enough information to help them make a decision as to whether they should see a movie or not the studios tend to overdo it. In some cases so much is shown that one can practically map out in their head how the film will play out from the beginning right up until the end. Rarely even the most predictable of films can still end up surprising audiences why else would the visually astonishing Avatar continue to tear up the charts?. But most of the time these predictable films turn out to be just as paintbynumbers as their trailer suggests. Extraordinary Measures is that kind of film.John Crowley's Brendan Fraser youngest children were diagnosed with the very rare Pompe Disease and are confined to wheelchairs for their lives. The average life span for children suffering from the disease rarely goes past nine and his daughter Megan Meredith Droeger has just turned eight. Like any good parent John wants the best for his children and wants to do everything he can to save their lives. While doing research he stumbles upon the theories of one Dr. Robert Stonehill Harrison Ford who just may have come up with a potential vaccine to help combat the disease.Just from this small description and the notion that this film is Based on a True Story it can be deduced exactly what comes afterwards. Except instead of feeling like a cinematic endeavor Extraordinary Measures comes off feeling like an exhaustingly lengthy movie of the week. Events are episodic happening in sporadic order and in such a jumpy fashion that it almost feels like commercial breaks were tailor made for the film. It makes the film feel stretched out and after ten minutes I wished I could change the channel as opposed to sitting watching this drivel for almost two agonizing hours. The editing style is so amateur and so simplistic that it practically screams that it was made for television consumption.But then the whole production feels like it belongs on television. The budget of the film is clearly very low there are zero effects and the set design is modest at best. Director Tom Vaughan is a veteran TV director and the cast is filled with current or former TV actors like Keri Russell Felicity Jared Harris Fringe Alan Ruck Spin City and Courtney B. Vance FlashForward. In fact the only thing that seems to make this film need to be a theatrical experience is the star power of Fraser and Ford. Surely their involvement is not the only real reason why this film is gracing the silver screen and not the small screen right? But while the veteran TV actors look comfortable in their roles Fraser and Ford both look totally out of place in the film. They visibly look like this is not the kind of material or delivery either of them is used to.Speaking of the material you would never have expected a former Oscarnominee wrote this script. Yes the story is very sad but is there a reason to bash the audience over the head so much that they are forced to cry? It seems like writer Robert Nelson Jacobs feels the need to one up himself in each scene making the next even more of an emotional mess than the last. The episodic structure of the film makes this notion all the more awful. And while Fraser is saddled with his share of silly dialogue Ford is the one who comes out even worse. Practically every line Ford has is either a wise ass remark a wise ass comeback or something he can yell during an argument. I have not read the original book the film is based on but I imagine the real Stonehill has more personality to him than varying shades of angry. Somehow Ford's Stonehill makes even the most ridiculous of dialogue screamed by Al Pacino seem like Shakespeare in comparison.Acting wise Droeger is the only real standout in a cast that includes Indiana Jones himself. I am unsure if she is actually confined to a wheelchair a quick search suggests she is not but she plays Megan so beautifully and authentically that it seems like a bad lie to even attempt to suggest she is not. Her pain is so wonderfully conveyed that it makes the film so much better than it actually is. Diego Velazquez who plays Crowley's other diseasestricken child Patrick is not given nearly as much to do physically but he plays his character fairly well. It is just a shame that both are given dialogue that is just as silly as everyone else. The two of them practically run laps around the adult cast.Fraser is just not right for the role at all. He seems to be able to pull it off in some scenes but for the majority just seems off. But then he was not all that great in his other decidedly adult role in Crash either. Ford on the other hand simply looks like he is phoning his performance in. None of the charisma the charm or the enthusiasm we have grown to know him for is on display here. Instead it looks like a performance from a hasbeen actor who was once big in the movies but now can barely even headline a TV special.The team behind Extraordinary Measures may have had good intentions when they began production on the film but the end result just does not seem to have been worth the effort. It may tug on your heartstrings in some scenes but the rest will just seem so forced and so stale that you may find yourself searching for a remote that is not there.410.".

While doing research he stumbles upon the theories of one Dr. Robert Stonehill Harrison Ford who just may have come up with a potential vaccine to help combat the disease.Just from this small description and the notion that this film is Based on a True Story it can be deduced exactly what comes afterwards. Except instead of feeling like a cinematic endeavor Extraordinary Measures comes off feeling like an exhaustingly lengthy movie of the week. Events are episodic happening in sporadic order and in such a jumpy fashion that it almost feels like commercial breaks were tailor made for the film. It makes the film feel stretched out and after ten minutes I wished I could change the channel as opposed to sitting watching this drivel for almost two agonizing hours. The editing style is so amateur and so simplistic that it practically screams that it was made for television consumption.But then the whole production feels like it belongs on television. The budget of the film is clearly very low there are zero effects and the set design is modest at best. Director Tom Vaughan is a veteran TV director and the cast is filled with current or former TV actors like Keri Russell Felicity Jared Harris Fringe Alan Ruck Spin City and Courtney B. Vance FlashForward. In fact the only thing that seems to make this film need to be a theatrical experience is the star power of Fraser and Ford. Surely their involvement is not the only real reason why this film is gracing the silver screen and not the small screen right? But while the veteran TV actors look comfortable in their roles Fraser and Ford both look totally out of place in the film. They visibly look like this is not the kind of material or delivery either of them is used to.Speaking of the material you would never have expected a former Oscarnominee wrote this script. Yes the story is very sad but is there a reason to bash the audience over the head so much that they are forced to cry? It seems like writer Robert Nelson Jacobs feels the need to one up himself in each scene making the next even more of an emotional mess than the last. The episodic structure of the film makes this notion all the more awful. And while Fraser is saddled with his share of silly dialogue Ford is the one who comes out even worse. Practically every line Ford has is either a wise ass remark a wise ass comeback or something he can yell during an argument. I have not read the original book the film is based on but I imagine the real Stonehill has more personality to him than varying shades of angry. Somehow Ford's Stonehill makes even the most ridiculous of dialogue screamed by Al Pacino seem like Shakespeare in comparison.Acting wise Droeger is the only real standout in a cast that includes Indiana Jones himself. I am unsure if she is actually confined to a wheelchair a quick search suggests she is not but she plays Megan so beautifully and authentically that it seems like a bad lie to even attempt to suggest she is not. Her pain is so wonderfully conveyed that it makes the film so much better than it actually is. Diego Velazquez who plays Crowley's other diseasestricken child Patrick is not given nearly as much to do physically but he plays his character fairly well. It is just a shame that both are given dialogue that is just as silly as everyone else. The two of them practically run laps around the adult cast.Fraser is just not right for the role at all. He seems to be able to pull it off in some scenes but for the majority just seems off. But then he was not all that great in his other decidedly adult role in Crash either. Ford on the other hand simply looks like he is phoning his performance in. None of the charisma the charm or the enthusiasm we have grown to know him for is on display here. Instead it looks like a performance from a hasbeen actor who was once big in the movies but now can barely even headline a TV special.The team behind Extraordinary Measures may have had good intentions when they began production on the film but the end result just does not seem to have been worth the effort. It may tug on your heartstrings in some scenes but the rest will just seem so forced and so stale that you may find yourself searching for a remote that is not there.410.";

Ford practically saves the film with his quirky performance one which I found that really suits his older and more mature persona like seen in his recent indie turn Crossing Over which came out in early 2009.Too bad Frazer couldn't carry the rest of the weight of the film properly and gave a performance that seems like its more fitting to a Hallmark drama than a haunting family drama  because the characters overall story and especially Ford could've easily added up to much much more.

For my liking it all seemed quickly put together with only the actor's obvious passion for their parts making it rise above it all. The story has all the potential in the world it has the right cast but it is often padded with too much drama and a lot of dull interaction and dialog for my liking. The ending is fitting and very heartfelt but by the time it was over I had really stopped caring. Pompe disease is a sad thing for children and very heartbreaking to witness.Performances. Brendan Fraser is decent but that's it. He's effective in some scenes while looking lost in others. I enjoy a lot of his work but this performance is glaring with inconsistency. Harrison Ford is excellent in his role. His intensity and humor worked well with his part and I loved every moment he had onscreen. Keri Russell is good but her role is rather underdeveloped for my liking. Meredith Droeger is wonderful as Megan. She's likable and clearly has talent for a kid.Bottom line. It's not a worthless film but it's not as good as it could have been. It's worth a look though and it'll make you appreciate your life a little bit. Just could have done without some stuff.610".

I was interested to see it not only for that but also to see how Brendan Fraser copes with a dramatic role quite a departure for him. For the first part the critics were right to an extent and for the second part well I tell you about that later. Here's a brief summary first summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please discover something brilliantly scientific while I write the next paragraph.Advertising executive John Crowley and his wife Aileen have three children John Jr. Patrick and Megan. Unfortunately both Patrick and Megan have Pompe disease a genetic anomaly that kills most before a child's tenth birthday. As Megan nears her tenth birthday John and Aileen become more desperate. So much so that John tries to contact and eventually goes to see the scientist whose research shows the best promise Dr. Robert Stonehill. Now Stonehill is not the easiest person to get along with very focused on his work but John eventually gets him to listen. The main problem is funding but John sets up a charitable foundation to help raise money for the work. Stonehill then offers to set up a company with John to develop a cure for Pompe. So John quits his job and they set off on an uncertain path looking for funding for their new venture. A big risk for John because if he fails there is no hope for his kids.I must say that this film put me in mind of the 1992 film Lorenzo's Oil starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon. Unfortunately it's not as good as that one. It's quite well made but I found the subject matter a bit dry. There are lots of meetings with either corporate or scientific jargon that I'm sure would be beyond the understanding of most viewers. The best thing about it is Harrison Ford as Dr. Robert Stonehill it definitely improves when he's on screen. Brendan Fraser did OK as John Crowley but more of him later. Also worth a mention are Keri Russell as Aileen Crowley Meredith Droeger as Megan Crowley Diego Velazquez as Patrick Crowley and Sam M. Hall as John Crowley Jr.For a film that is supposed to be a heartwarming tale I'm afraid it missed the mark but some distance for me. Brendan Fraser was OK in the scenes with the kids and even in some of the scenes with Harrison Ford he did alright but when he had to show any real emotion I felt he struggled. Maybe it's because he's played so many comedic roles but I just wasn't convinced by him. Over all the film isn't too great but it's quite well made and Harrison Ford is pretty good but not quite good enough to save it I'm afraid Not recommended.My score 5.110".

	schema:headline " Fighting Big Pharma to save the kids";
	schema:reviewBody "'Extraordinary Measures' is based on a true story of a Big Pharma executive and venture capitalist who pushed for a cure for an inherited disease that was going to kill two of his young children. Harrison Ford isn't particularly convincing as a brilliant solitary scientist and Brendan Fraser is too soft and weepy for the venture capitalist dad. The music is soppy the images are without character and a little washed out and the story verges on movieoftheweek formulaic. But the director Tom Vaughan'What Happens in Vegas' has created a balance so that instead of being just another tearjerker medical melodrama this is a movie that teaches you something about how the world works. You get the adorable dying kids and the doting desperate parents but the drama of how a commercial lab functions may be the more exciting and interesting one and gets more screen time.Hollywood sees Harrison as a sexy old guy but he's become so locked into curmudgeonly roles he seems every bit his sixtyseven years. Fraser has retired from being a comical hunk 'Encino Man' 'George of the Jungle' to fortysomething pudginess he's a tall man with a soft face and a bit of a gut. This is in part a buddy picture about how an unlikely male couple bonds. Crusty biochemist Robert Stonehill Ford playing a composite figure tailored to his needs and midlevel BirstolMyers Squibb executive John Crowley Fraser find each other because two of Crowley's children he has an older boy who's healthy have been diagnosed with Pompe disease a rare and fatal neuromuscular disorder in which children's organs and muscles degenerate due to an inability to process glycogen. Crowley finds Stonehill in Nebraska with a brilliant theory about an enzyme cure but without the dough to get it ready for clinical trials.So Crowley leaves BirstolMyers Squibb and starts an independent research company for Stonehill. But then that isn't working fast enough so he decides to sell his company to a bigger corporation that can provide more researchers and more labs. This makes both men rich but also makes Stonehill furious he wasn't consulted. Stonehill drives a Ford truck wears Wrangler jeans and a blue blazer and carries a metal attach case yells a lot kicks people out of his lab and plays loud rock music there indifferent to his neighbors.But a more fundamental conflict for Crowley is that corporate executive Dr. Kent Webber a hardnosed and unfriendly M.D. played by Jared Harris sets up four research teams and wants them to work separately and competitively. Why not share their findings? And for Crowley despite his differences with Stonehill he's the man who's going to find the enzyme. But Crowley has to deal with the corporate hierarchy with an even scarier guy called Erich Loring Patrick Bauchau as CEO.The teams with Stonehill's approval arrive at an enzyme worthy of clinical trial. The Crowley kids Megan Meredith Droeger and Patrick Diego Velazquez are in wheel chairs now with aids to their breathing but their dad and mom Keri Russell entertain them with birthday parties and computer games and beach picnics. They live in a very large house thanks to the success of venture capital. On the beach dad gets a call from the chilly Dr. Webber sorry your kids can't be in the trial because it will be restricted to the very young. And don't fight this as a company executive you have a clear conflict of interest.How this turns out is part of the movie's climax and though the ending brings tears to your eyes if you respond to adorable tykes in hospital beds it is more about how scientists battle businessmen in the American drug system and how the tricky protocols of clinical trials work for individuals and for the society. Vaughan conveys a sense of the parents' devotion but downplays their difficulties in surviving as a couple under such stress. Poor John Jr. Sam Hall the older boy has a pretty small role to play here too.If the film is just above the generic the material is special. With its name stars and emotional story that gives a human face to drug research 'Extraordinary Measures' may have a chance of making people more aware not only of glycogen storage disease but of the conflicted apparatus that arrives at cures. The movie is based on Boston reporter Geeta Anand's book 'The Cure How a Father Raised 100 Million  And Bucked the Medical Establishment  in a Quest to Save His Children' and the story is quite recent the book came out in 2006 and the drug Myozyme for the treatment of Pompe disease became available in 2007.Don't go to 'Extraordinary Measures' looking for cinematic art. But don't be too brutal with it either. It conveys worthwhile information.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Extraordinary Measures' is based on a true story of a Big Pharma executive and venture capitalist who pushed for a cure for an inherited disease that was going to kill two of his young children. Harrison Ford isn't particularly convincing as a brilliant solitary scientist and Brendan Fraser is too soft and weepy for the venture capitalist dad. The music is soppy the images are without character and a little washed out and the story verges on movieoftheweek formulaic. But the director Tom Vaughan'What Happens in Vegas' has created a balance so that instead of being just another tearjerker medical melodrama this is a movie that teaches you something about how the world works. You get the adorable dying kids and the doting desperate parents but the drama of how a commercial lab functions may be the more exciting and interesting one and gets more screen time.Hollywood sees Harrison as a sexy old guy but he's become so locked into curmudgeonly roles he seems every bit his sixtyseven years. Fraser has retired from being a comical hunk 'Encino Man' 'George of the Jungle' to fortysomething pudginess he's a tall man with a soft face and a bit of a gut. This is in part a buddy picture about how an unlikely male couple bonds.

Harrison Ford was not given the chance to flex his muscle though. If his character had been made to have been a more dynamic and lessmisanthropic researcher the movie would have been more entertaining. I think the director and screenwriter handcuffed Harrison Ford's character a bit. I can forgive this because I know that in reality avoidant people like Dr. Stillwell do exist. I also think the audience could have benefited from a little bit more technical talk There was very little talk of exactly what they were doing in the lab. Nevertheless Extraordinary Measures is an extremely good film for those of us who appreciate being inspired by our art. Brendan has come a long way from Encino Man and with Extraordinary Measures as in the earlier Still Breathing he shows us once again that he is very good at dramatic roles.One final note It would have been nice for the screen dialogue at the end of the film to have included some background on the disease and its present numbers. More importantly we would have liked to have learned more about the present status of the enzyme transport drug How many have benefited from it? Only infants? How much money does it cost etc. A movie well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "warning possible spoilersThis is the story of a couple played by Susan Sarandon and Don Johnson high school sweethearts who made the mistake of getting married and having kids. Now 20 years later they are separated and hate each other. Their brief interactions end in one's usually Johnson's character's rude insensitive or indifferent comment followed by the other running away. After a couple of these interactions I thought now's the time when they sit down and try to work things out since they clearly still loved each other as all couples who fight constantly in the movies really love each other and were in some kind of emotional pain.  But this never happened. So the movie's plot is the constant fighting.Presumably in some attempt to revitalize their relationship I think the writer at least had the insight to realize he was boring the audience so he gives us some fresh scenery to make up for the stale plot Sarandon's character decides she want to go to the Caribbean with her hubby. She overhears him commenting on a sunbather's hooters the best he's ever seen. Of course not one for talking she instead tries to sleep with her hubby's best friend.Like a good chap he refuses but as they lie in bed hubby of course walks in and throws some furniture out of the sliding door. Still no discussion. But at least the best friend has enough emotional intelligence to suggest they sleep it off they will feel better in the morning.The next evening after hubby gives a brief speech mostly rambling but ends by saying he wants things better meaning his marital relationship. that night in their motel room wife asks hubby if he wants to see her naked. Of course he does. He tells her she's beautiful she asks but not the best you've ever seen? and gets mad when he doesn't appease her. They yell. And FINALLY in their yelling he asks her what she wants. I want us to love each other!! Well that's just great because so do I!!. And they sleep together. After all that time all they really needed was to yell a few nice words at each other. Ah movie romance! In the last scene I could bear to watch they seemed to have reverted back to childhood. They stole hubby's best friend's car it's fireengine red!! and were attempting to put it to sea when hubby asked wifie if she'd go to the dance with him. This is when I turned it off seeing no hope that it could redirect itself and still make any sense at all.So the moral of the story? Don't grow up. That only leads to complicated relationships and talking and all that nasty stuff. Sex might technically be for grownups but at least it's fun and you don't even have to talk afterwards! Maybe the writer was more clever than I gave himher credit for and the movie was really a satire on immature high schoolsweetheart marriages. One can only hope.".

In the first scenes Jeff Daniels and Don Johnson establish a rapport as two best buddies who get involved in Halloween hijinks in their small Vermont town. Instead of continuing on a course which involves more of their shenanigins it becomes obvious that this is a movie of family strife and manwoman relationships as well as best buddy relationships. That is not so bad but the movie is so unrelenting in it's pursuance of these themes that it soon bogs down until you can no longer care what happens next in the Don JohnsonSusan Sarandon and Jeff DanielsElizabeth Perkins relationships you just wish they would get involved in something else. The same mood continues right to the end  I was certain that some catastrophe would create a climactic ending that would bring the two rocky relationships to a happy ending but it wasn't to be. For this is one of those sliceoflife movies which tries to mirror everyday life and in everyday life there are few catastrophies only the unrelenting march of life. To the movie's credit though this sliceoflife approach is not all bad there is always something very comforting in a movie which successfully captures this mood. It and other movies of it's ilk make the statement This Is How It Is In America No More And No Less!. Also to lt's credit is the strong cast. Susan Sarandon is as usual in fine form and Don Johnson as her somewhat unstable mate captures the essence of the beleagured American husband. Jeff Daniels is good as the stabilizing influence to both of them although this is about all he does. Elizabeth Perkins is not up to the calibre of the other three though and her character becomes the most tiresome of them all. Justin Henry is a little bland as the teenage son tortured by the strife between his parents.".

Wenders looks at America without aggression without anger without a shred of intolerance  but with affection understanding and an appreciation for the damage done by 911.Personally I felt a tremendous amount of frustration throughout the first 23rds of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "Superb film. The digital gives the footage a nice effect. There were some great tight shots and then wide angle landscape. A lot of effort has been put into the paranoia paraphernalia of Paul and the way Wenders brings this out. I simply adored the way Wenders slotted the characters into a simple plot. I thought the character of Lana was a touch stale but since she was meant to be the pacifist missionary I'm not sure how else the part could have been played. The social conditions present in the story did tend to be a bit reductionist and instructive but far from annoying. I will agree with previous comments that it will appeal to European audiences more than American. However I would disagree that the characters would have been like that before 911. It is precisely this tragedy that launches Paul into his hyperparanoia the beginnings of which emerged after his experience in the Vietnam war. I did laugh many times at Paul's lunacy. While very different characters I enjoyed following the film through the eyes of both Lana and Paul. This film is ultimately a Wim Wenders comment on the US pre and post911. He deserves congrats for tackling the subject and admiration for the way he went about telling some sides of the story. I will prefer this film to any Moore production any day.".

A lot of effort has been put into the paranoia paraphernalia of Paul and the way Wenders brings this out. I simply adored the way Wenders slotted the characters into a simple plot. I thought the character of Lana was a touch stale but since she was meant to be the pacifist missionary I'm not sure how else the part could have been played. The social conditions present in the story did tend to be a bit reductionist and instructive but far from annoying. I will agree with previous comments that it will appeal to European audiences more than American. However I would disagree that the characters would have been like that before 911. It is precisely this tragedy that launches Paul into his hyperparanoia the beginnings of which emerged after his experience in the Vietnam war. I did laugh many times at Paul's lunacy. While very different characters I enjoyed following the film through the eyes of both Lana and Paul. This film is ultimately a Wim Wenders comment on the US pre and post911. He deserves congrats for tackling the subject and admiration for the way he went about telling some sides of the story. I will prefer this film to any Moore production any day.";

Those are the same people who joyfully analyze the music of their latest progressive rock album even months after its release.But there are exceptions among the critics who are certainly just as paranoid as Uncle Paul. There is a complaint about foreigners who have visited the States a half dozen times making critical movies about it. I guess that Wim Wenders spend sufficient time over here to be able to figure out the stereotype American. Besides we get a lot of news and facts about America and the world in the media in Europe. So unlike Americans who call World News the news about the wars of the world we actually tend to know stuff about other countries.The movie by the way is not only about 911 in my opinion but American foreign politics over decades. Uncle Paul supports this policy all the useless warfare from the very depth of his heart. He is afraid he is brainwashed. But he represents a good deal of US citizens. One could possibly even say American society. Think about this. Brainwashing starts in Elementary school Bla bla bla ... and justice for all! Man what a lie. It should say Bla bla bla ... and justice for all people who can afford justice  Whites.But that is only my opinion. However Wim Wenders is a believer when it comes to American ideas. He wants America to actually stand for for what it is supposed to stand. He is an American patriot longing for a better world led by the strongest country on earth. But led in a different way the peaceful and fearless way. Sadly enough a lot of Americans will not understand that massage because they are too stupid and brainwashed by a government Democratic and Republican alike that only longs for more wars to be able to get more tax money out of the sales of the weapon industry.I do not even share Wim Wenders' view. If it were up to me the US may blow up in its entirety and I would even give my poor little temporaryAmerican life for that. However I enjoyed the movie a lot because of reasons that were already mentioned by other people. It is worth watching.Thanks Wim!".

Wim Wenders tries to picture the reality of North America unknown for foreigners and even common Americans with homeless and alienated people living with fear angst and prejudice totally disconnected of the world instead of the land of opportunities and plenty of the American Dream shown in most of the American movies. In this regard he is very well succeeded but in my opinion I found the character of Paul absolutely exaggerated using many apparatuses and gadgets in his work. The beautiful and shining character of Michelle Williams gives the hope that the world can be a better place someday. My vote is six.Title Brazil Medo e Obsesso Fear and Obsession".

Wim Wenders tries to picture the reality of North America unknown for foreigners and even common Americans with homeless and alienated people living with fear angst and prejudice totally disconnected of the world instead of the land of opportunities and plenty of the American Dream shown in most of the American movies. In this regard he is very well succeeded but in my opinion I found the character of Paul absolutely exaggerated using many apparatuses and gadgets in his work. The beautiful and shining character of Michelle Williams gives the hope that the world can be a better place someday. My vote is six.Title Brazil Medo e Obsesso Fear and Obsession";

Most of us were probably too shocked inside our own little bubble to realize the impact these men felt when exploding planes collapsed the twin towers. But director Wim Wenders DON'T COME KNOCKING pulls it off thanks to a fairly good script and even better acting by lead actors John Diehl and Michelle Williams.Never having seen Diehl in a leading role this movie shows he's got some serious chops and can act with the best Hollywood has to offer. Equally Michelle Williams pulls off a stunningly excellent performance as the worldly but loving niece who helps Diehl discover himself all over again.The story ...Paul John Diehl is a Vietnam vet living in Los Angeles. He lives in a fantasy world all his own believing that he's helping with national security by tracking suspicious looking people with his surveillance trickedout van. He operates a camera that comes out of the van's sunroof and records activity around town.Michelle Michelle Williams BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is returning from Tel Aviv after years away from the States. Her mother passed away and she's trying to hook up with her last surviving relative in America Paul. Working at a mission for the poor she befriends many of its patrons and meets up with a withdrawn Arablooking gentleman named Hassan Shaun Taub CRASH who also happens to be one of Paul's prime suspects.Paul witnesses Hassan hauling boxes of borax and quickly learns that it is an ingredient for certain bomb materials. On high alert Paul records everything Hassan does. This brings him closer to his niece Michelle. But Hassan lives on the street and is eventually shot to death right in front of Paul making him believe that someone knocked him off for sinister reasons.Michelle is beset with grief about Hassan's death and searches for one of his family members. Eventually finding one near Death Valley she convinces Paul to drive her and the body to Hassan's brother for burial. Paul agrees in the hopes of gaining more information about who Hassan was and what he was up to.As the nexus between Paul's old Vietnam life and the new one that awaits him with Michelle begins to culminate we see him battling bad dreams of his time in Southeast Asia but being aided and comforted by Michelle and to his surprise by Hassan's death and Hassan's brother.We quickly learn that Paul went down a bad trail after the 911 attacks his mind sparking up old memories in order to protect itself. He lives in his van which is his lifeconnection to the world now. But that will change once Michelle teaches him how to trust again.The film is touching if sometimes a bit heavyhanded in the dialogue department.

Truly these folks aren't eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger. They need selfrespect selfworth dignity which you can't give a man. Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available. Less the center for hunger in America I would say it's more the center for alcoholism drugabuse mental suffering and economic devastation.

Wenders wrote this moving piece with assistance from Scott Derrickson and Michael Meredith and directs a sterling cast in an exploration of the American psyche post 911 and few writerdirectors could have keener insight into the state of mind of a country at odds with itself and the rest of the world.Lana Michelle Williams is flying back to the US after a twoyear stay on the West Bank. She is the daughter of missionaries having lived her life in Africa and other missionary fields and she is flying home after her mother's death to deliver a letter to her uncle Paul John Diehl a damaged Vietnam vet who has cut himself off from his family and the rest of life and in response to 911 his mind being obsessed with tracking Sleeper Cells to destroy terrorists in his own homemade surveillance van. Upon arriving in Los Angeles Lana is met by Henry Wendell Pierce who is a pastor who runs a mission for the homeless of Los Angeles and provides Lana with a bleak room and a job in the kitchen of the mission. Lana is full of praise for God for all things the optimistic evangelical girl who fails to recognize evil.

While Lana is warmly entertained by Youssef Paul investigates the town and finds that the Borax boxes of Hassan's business were innocent means of washing carpets imported from Pakistan. The coming together of Youssef Lana and Paul finally achieves meaning when Paul reads the letter from his sister Lana's mother who somehow manages to erase all lines of prejudice bigotry religious differences misunderstanding  finally giving breathing room to the damaged souls of the brotherhood of man the three represent.Wenders manages to bathe his story in the light of reality yet maintain an unprejudiced stance in moving his characters through their paths of revelation. The camera wanders a bit the music blends perhaps too heavily and the pieces of the puzzle don't always fit together  much like life doesn't always fall into place the way we expect. But there is much to learn from Wenders' wisdom and with the aid of perfect performances from Michelle Williams John Diehl and Wendell Pierce he has created an indelible work.

	schema:headline " Land of Plenty Film of Deficiency";
	schema:reviewBody "Land of Plenty is a thoughtprovoking film. How couldn't it be? Wenders a provocative director taking on 911 and its aftermath? Truly not to disparage Wenders a monkey with a digital camera and a placard reading Tell me about 911 could create something worth watching given the subject.In Wenders case he has made an insular film focusing on two people Lana Michelle Williams and her Uncle Paul John Diehl and the after effects of 911 upon both. Lana is a painfully naive 20 yr. old Christian who has just returned from a missionary stint in Palestine where she witnessed 911 to work in a Los Angeles mission while searching for evidence justifying vehement antiAmerican sentiment abroad. In her possession is a letter written by her recently deceased mom Paul's sister. Deliverance of the letter compels here to track down her wayward uncle the letter's addressee. Paul is in his 50s a shellshocked paranoid Vietnam vet intent on keeping this country safe from the freeroaming terrorists who are in his eyes ubiquitous within the City of Angels.Wenders draws these characters in such vivid Blue and Red colors that you would have to have your head up your butt not to see that they represent the mindset of Democrats Lana and Republicans Paul. In fact in various interviews and during a Q  A after the 33105 screening I attended Wenders asserted that this film IS a political film. Though he feels he has not made a polemical film he has. You will be hardpressed not to choose sides while watching the film. As for Wenders he leaves little doubt as to his choice true Blue.To that end one need only take into consideration Wenders' mocking presentation of Paul as a hypervigilant nut case roaming L.A. in a beatup surveillanceequipmentcrammed van in search of terrorist activity. Paul undertakes this toothless work functioning as a selfappointed renegade operative for Homeland Security who have no connection with him. Paul's right hand man Jimmy is a grungy garage mechanic whose only connections to topsecret sources are Internet search engines. They bring to mind as Beavis  Butthead with not much more at their disposal than HarriettheSpy in terms of fruitful resources. But for one scene showing Paul suffering the ill effects of postwar syndrome during a gripping nightmare Wenders shows him to be something of a lunatic rubea virtual laughing stock. Indeed most of the movie's laughs come at Paul's expense because just about every action he undertakes furthers one's opinion of him as a maligned pathetic xenophobe. No doubt if this movie finds a US distributor most patriotic Vietnam vets will express their outrage at being presented as loose cannon extremists. Wenders' presentation of Paul clearly displays his loathing for such Reds the prowar highangst flagwaving Dubbyabacking kill'emallandletGodsort'em out folk who tote and vote for the conservative line.It's a credit to John Diehl that his intense careerdefining portrayal of Paul embellishes the shallow character created by Wenders. Diehl never allows Paul to breakdown completely despite the various defeats he suffers and has suffered. You want to like him for to see him overcome his burdens. He's troubled but not entirely lacking heart.As for Michelle Williams she is godawful as Lana. Wenders wrote the part for her but one wonders if he did so just so that he could see her face on the big screen. With her bobbed black hair and perpetual doeintheheadlights countenance she brings to mind a fifthrate imitation of Audrey Tattou Amelie and the poor man's Gweneth Paltrow Scarlett Johannson Lost in Translation. For the most part she functions as eye candy. At other times she's a distraction. And in one embarrassing scenea testament to Wenders' music video work furthering my belief that he had other things in mind when he wrote the part for herwhere Lana is seen in isolation wearing headphones while bopping to a tune emanating from her MP3 you beg for someone to push her off the mission's rooftop. In short Williams fails to ACT neither adding nuance to Lana's emotions nor any inventive idiosyncrasy to Lana's physical being. Where Diehl took what he was given and ran with it like a crazed wolverine Williams was unable to enhance her character instead opting to stand around a vapid clothes horse.Wenders' presentation of his two main characters in such unmistakable hues ends up reducing Lana and Paul to onedimensional cardboard cutouts relegating them to ancillary evidence supporting his messages that mental spiritual social and political poverty are bad and that the USA's polemical political system which has reduced and divided citizens into two opposing factions sucks.The title comes from a Leonard Cohen song The Land of Plenty. Cohen's lyricsAnd I don't really know who sent meto raise my voice and sayMay the lights in the Land of PlentyShine on the truth some dayinfluence Wenders' directional choices. He employs the song strategically throughout the film right up to the very end where truncated lyrics Shine onThe Truth float in a slate gray New York skyline above Ground Zero as if skywritten by a passing plane.An epitaph? An invocation? A critique? A prayer?Probably all of the above.Despite Michelle Williams' abysmal performance the conceptual limitations inherent in the rapid creation and completion of the film and the shortcomings of Wenders' obvious onedimensional characters and biased message Land of Plenty remains a provocative film worth viewing. If for no other reason than to remind us that life ain't always pretty even here in the land of plenty. One hopes that one U.S. distributor will have the courage to pick up the film and disseminate it nationwide. If nothing else viewers will come away thinking about just how divisive our Red and Blue political system is and maybe just maybe start thinking of how to change it.".

This indicates the heavy selfcensorship American media have imposed on themselves and ... reflects John Diels character Uncle Pauls paranoia nicely. Accurately. From the book Vernon God Little to Land of Plenty American reviewers pundits and 'intellectuals' are as sensitive as an eyeball to sand towards foreign commentary and critique of their society.I downloaded this movie by accident looking for the similarly titled BBC drama In a Land of Plenty. Upon seeing that Michelle Williams was in it I decided not to delete it right away. Halfway through the pic I thought to look it up here and learned then that Wim Wenders was directing it. And now you'll expect me to say that it was one these serendipitously great finds a gem unknown a great movie. Hmmm I can't since I thought the film a tat too depressing for that.The character of Uncle Paul is all too paranoid too realistic for my taste. I really don't think that this character is grossly distorted. The greatness about this character is threefold a As a viewer you're left unsure whether he's really mentally ill or not b he's surely representative of a part of the American population hopefully not a large part but I fear yes and c he's been greatly portrayed by Diehl. I detest him as much as J.R. Ewing was detested.As Europeans we are used to think of AmericansRepublicans as the winners who despite their lack of intelligence still manage to rule the worldthe USA who are winning because they all more or less have the white picket fence thing going on. This movie shows that not all rightwingers are indeed winners that there are very sad and depressing people among them. It hits home that Po' White Trash is not a thing of the past. I mean DUDE! This guy is a sad sad figure.Of course the character of Lana is much more appealing and attractive and I watched Michelle with open mouth every time she graced the screen with her deceptively natural acting.The only criticism I have of the film is in its end dialog Paul asks why people cheered on 911. When Lana says Because they hate us it isn't made clear why the world hates America. Wenders either chickens out or loves his adopted country too much. Or maybe he does indeed see both sides. The people of the world hate America because Americans always side with the dictators and the oppressors Pinochet Videla of Argentina the Israelis and not with the Jews in WWII they denied several Jewish requests for the bombing of concentration camps Mubarak Marcos of the Philipines Apartheid etc. Aside from one time when it didn't in Kosovo Americans have always sided with torturing dictators to oppress the poor. We don't hate you because of your freedom. If we did that we all attack Sweden and Holland. Smoke out Amsterdam pun intended. We hate you because you could help us win our freedom with relative ease but you choose not do so. Because otherwise you have to pay 2 cents more on the gallon for gasoline god forbid!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I should point out from the outset that I was probably in the wrong frame of mind for a movie like this.  Today was a pretty extreme example of one of those days for me.  I sat down to watch this definitely wanting a laugh. But any movie was going to have to work extra hard to get a laugh out of me on this crappy day and this one didn't really do the job.  I should have probably gone with something simple and surefire like a Buster Keaton movie or a Woody Allen or a Monty Python.  Or maybe I should have just gone for a long bike ride.  But I watched this instead.This is one of those society comedies with a large cast of characters and various complicated goings on.  Most of the humor derives from people trying to put a normal happy face on for the benefit of society while meanwhile things are spinning out of control beneath the surface.  It reminded me a little bit of Fawlty Towers with John Cleese for some reason.  It's the same kind of humor.  You've probably seen a lot of the gags in 10000 TV sitcoms by now but I suppose this stuff was a lot fresher in 1927.  And most of it was pretty well done I'll admit.The story itself is simple but you have to pay a lot of attention to keep track of all the momenttomoment details.  And I guess that's where the movie failed for me today.  My mind kept wandering and I'd have to rewind the tape to figure out what was going on and I'd get annoyed.  I was really feeling the lack of dialogue in this one.  I watch a lot of silent films. They appeal to me for some reason I can't explain.  But this movie felt incomplete to me.  I felt it would have worked better as a talkie.  But maybe it was just the mood I was in.Anyway there were several individual scenes that I thought were brilliant and definitely made me sit up and take notice.  One was worthy of a Seinfeld episode it's a wedding scene a woman notices her husband's necktie is undone and she repeatedly nudges him and fiddles with her neck.  The husband takes no notice.  He sits there like a lump.  But another character instinctively reaches to check his tie.  This starts a chain reaction and pretty soon everyone in the church is checking their ties except for the husband who's still sitting there oblivious.  Another great scene is when the groom at the wedding imagines the angry military man back at his house vandalizing everything tossing all his possessions out the windows tearing down wallsthe film lapses into total surrealism this is Rene Clair at his visual best.  I love this scene.For now I'm going to rate this a 710.  But I'll try to catch it again some day when I'm in a better and more attentive mood and I think I'll like it a lot better.".

The last time it was on a mediocre VHS copy. This time it was on the beautifully transferred Flicker Alley DVD.This weakness surprised me the first time I saw it since I am a great fan of Clair's sound films as well as his silent short subjects but I think I have identified at least part of the problem I think Clair was directing under close supervision by someone who expected to see Labiche's play on the screen. As Clair's great films were always surrealistic clearly in a world disjoint from the one we see around us how could he be expected to to force the viewer into his own world? Even the way the characters are dressed and shot is typical of early French films  one of the DVD extras is a Zecca short from 1906 or 1908 After the Wedding and those characters were virtually dropped into Clair's picture  so at least I now understand that we are dealing with thencurrent stage conventions.Most of the movie looks as if it could have been directed by Louis Feullade it has the placidly sardonic observant camera although it lacks the air of emotional reality that Feuillade's seeminglyimprovised movies had some of the wilder parts of LES VAMPIRE look as if he realized he had written himself into a corner and there's one of his earlier movies in which the characters have to mail a letter so they take a hotair balloon to a mail box and I suddenly realized that the producer had given them a balloon and Feuillade used it because it would look cool and it was already paid for.Albert Prjean one of Clair's regulars at this point  he was magnificent in Sous les Toits de Paris  attempts the lead role with an air of depression. Unfortunately while this may be appropriate to the character given that he is watching his life unravel the flat affect of depression is not terribly interesting for the audience.It is only about twothirds of the way through that Clair asserts his authority by showing us what's going on in Prjean's mind as houses begin to fall apart. But while this revived my interest the tight plotting of Labiche's play took over again and I could see the wheels spinning neatly over the tracks of the story.Ultimately this is a superior silent version of an excellent 19th Century farce and should keep the dedicated silent enthusiast engrossed. However for the fan of Rene Clair it is a bit patchy.I watched the movie with the Alloy Orchestra's soundtrack playing  their arrangements are usually solid and supportive. If I enjoy a silent movie I usually don't consciously notice the soundtrack so the fact that I think that their politesounding orchestrations of late 19th and early 20th century program music is entirely appropriate is a bit of a putdown. It is certainly not their fault that I am familiar with one of the tunes through its use by Allen Sherman for one his comic rewrites in this case I kept hearing him singing his sardonic Lots of Luck.".

There were times when I was in sympathy with the gentleman sitting at the end of my row who intermittently let out choked snores before jerking awake.The film has its moments but overall I found it disconcertingly tedious  shots seem to be repeated and lingered upon beyond humour and for no clear reason. The opening scenes are a pretty fair sample of the pacing and style throughout as the various members of the bridal party experience problems in dressing in a sequence that feels as if it extends a good five minutes it's mildly amusing but it's mainly 'situation' comedy in which the characterisations themselves are supposed to be funny rather than anything they actually do and it goes on and on. Similarly in the finale after the plot is unravelled in what seems intended to be the end a series of half a dozen impressionistic epilogues follow one after another with no sign of when the film is ever going to stop...The mechanics of the farce depend on stock characters the endlesslyfainting lady the insanely insistent lover the stonedeaf old man. Gags that are eventually funny  e.g. the mass adjustment of ties during the civil ceremony  are built up to via enormous layering and labouring of detail. The idiom is I suspect to me a basically alien one but it's the timing that really hurts as far as entertainment goes. I don't care for slapstick but this film goes to the opposite extreme  clearly too sophisticated for my uncultured taste to handle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Un Chapeau De Paille D'Italie can be considered by this German count's standards as a transgressor silent film in spite of its classical conventionalism this particular Teutonic riddle has a Germanic and even logical explanation that will be understood by the longhaired silent youngsters around the world right now.Un Chapeau De Paille D'Italie was directed by the great but French silent director Herr Ren Clair in the silent year of 1928 after he had directed important avantgarde experimental and overall non conventional silent oeuvres such Entr'acte 1924 Paris Qui Dort 1925 Le Voyage Imaginaire 1925 or La Tour 1928 so having this in mind then the Germanic assessment mentioned before by this Herr Graf has a solid basis. Un Chapeau is a completely different and classic film in comparison with those earlier Clair films and this doesn't mean that Un Chapeau is a minor work in Herr Clair 's career on the contrary the film is a remarkable stylized and even provocative comedy.The incident of the Italian straw hat occurs just before our hero marries and leads to a series of well placed and paced episodes. The elegant and hilarious scenes depicting the troubles and crossed situations among the just married couple and their wedding guests with the adulterous couple achieve very remarkable moments. The skillful use of the camera emphasizes the rhythm depending the different scenes and includes the camera tricks and techniques that Herr Clair was so fond of. The result is a vigorous and sophisticated comedy with a irreverent undercurrent subject in the main plot a just married man must assume the complicated task of protecting an adulterer.Helping our hero in such a hazardous mission are excellent supporting actors playing peculiar characters who are involved unnoticed in this peculiar wedding and will suffer the happenings around the Italian straw hat a hilarious gallery of guests who have had the misfortune to be part of such a troublesome wedding.The film is placed at the end of the old XIX century probably in order to take advantage of the human behaviours and fashion of those old times in which the ladies wore elegant hats  those fruleins of nowadays showing their loose hair in public! Mein Gott! . There is a careful atmosphere of ancient and decadent custom  faithful characteristics after all in Herr Clair films  that suits the film perfectly. Herr Clair has directed a classic stylized and cynical silent comedy that has the same original merits of his most experimental early works.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must find his Prussian helmet in order to eat his breakfast properly.".

The elegant and hilarious scenes depicting the troubles and crossed situations among the just married couple and their wedding guests with the adulterous couple achieve very remarkable moments. The skillful use of the camera emphasizes the rhythm depending the different scenes and includes the camera tricks and techniques that Herr Clair was so fond of. The result is a vigorous and sophisticated comedy with a irreverent undercurrent subject in the main plot a just married man must assume the complicated task of protecting an adulterer.Helping our hero in such a hazardous mission are excellent supporting actors playing peculiar characters who are involved unnoticed in this peculiar wedding and will suffer the happenings around the Italian straw hat a hilarious gallery of guests who have had the misfortune to be part of such a troublesome wedding.The film is placed at the end of the old XIX century probably in order to take advantage of the human behaviours and fashion of those old times in which the ladies wore elegant hats  those fruleins of nowadays showing their loose hair in public! Mein Gott! . There is a careful atmosphere of ancient and decadent custom  faithful characteristics after all in Herr Clair films  that suits the film perfectly. Herr Clair has directed a classic stylized and cynical silent comedy that has the same original merits of his most experimental early works.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must find his Prussian helmet in order to eat his breakfast properly.";

Once again Flicker Alley has released a terrific DVDwith a nearly pristine print very rare for a silent some nice special features as well as two different sound tracks for this movie! Each time I see one of their films I marvel at the amazing care they give each releaseand it's the class of the industry.The Italian Straw Hat is film that was a bit short on plot but is still well worth seeing. This is because the director Ren Clair did a masterful job with this moviewith great camerawork and composition throughout. Unfortunately despite looking great the plot keeps me from giving the movie an even higher score. The problem is that although the story is entertaining it just had too many holestoo many situations that simply were too hard to believe and could have EASILY been resolved...but weren't.The film begins with a bridegroom traveling by horse and buggy to his wedding. On the way he gets out and his horse keeps walkingand finds a straw hat that it begins to eat! Naturally the lady who owned the hat was angry and her lover was ready to fight. The bridegroom tried to pay for it but the couple insisted he find a replacement hat. And they follow him into town and continue to insisteven moving into his apartment and threatening to destroy the place unless he get an identical hat. It turns out it's because the woman is married to a different man and doesn't want to have to explain to him what happened to the hat. But why the couple squatted for many hours in the house seemed forcedand why the bridegroom didn't just go to the police made no sense either. But it did have lots of cute and mildly funny momentseven if the story just made no sense.Overall the film is expertly filmed but inconsequential because of the writing. It's worth seeing if you love silents or if you want to see a silent that manages to have very very few intertitle cards yet tells the story very well. Otherwise there are better silents out thereeven with the great Flicker Alley package.".

Instead there are French intertitles in here. This is mostly a comedy but I cannot say I found this a particularly entertaining or engaging ones. Hardly no scene was funny in this one. Prjean Vital and Tschechowa were among the most prolific actors from France Tschechowa more from Germany around that era so they certainly brought some talent and experience. Still this did not turn out a memorable film at all. Clair is considered by many one of the finest French filmmakers in history. This film is no evidence for that theory. The whole hat story is ssimply not enough to carry this film for almost 90 minutes I have to say. Not recommended.".

Seriously did the studio even think when they tried to push this film out? I can only assume not. Critics crucified it. Audiences ignored it.

I scoffed but after he persisted I agreed.I'm glad I did.Pluto Nash was refreshingly entertaining and in no way was it the abysmal slight against cinema I had been told it was.The film centers on Pluto Nash Eddie Murphy in a fun performance his sidekick robot Bruno Randy Quaid in perhaps my favorite performance in the film and Dina Lake the astonishingly beautiful Rosario Dawson with numerous other actors in supporting roles. Nash is the owner the nightclub Club Nash on the moon some time in the future. He bought the club to save the life of a friend Jay Mohr who has since become a famous singer in a snazzy upscale part of the moon leaving Nash behind.

When Nash turns them down they destroy the place. Nash Dina and Bruno vow to discover who this Rex Carter is and stop him.And so begins this fun actioncomedyscifi feature. In all honesty the story is clich but it actually works quite well. This isn't supposed to be a revolutionary masterpiece it's meant to be a fun goodguysVSbadguysbuddymovie type film only set on the moon in the future. The characters are quite endearing and likable as well. They feel like people you'd want to hang out with.The special effects which were unfairly criticized at the time are surprisingly good considering they were from 2000 remember the film was finished but shelved for two years and the direction of Ron Underwood is quite nice. Visually the film is a treat.The cast works. Murphy Dawson and Quaid are all great in their roles and supporting characters are played very well by some big names such as Peter Boyle Pam Greir Burt Young and even a cameo by Alec Baldwin.The music is fun the editing is great the set design is exquisite the acting is generally very good the direction is fantastic the story is decent enough. I really can't say much. The craftsmanship is very competent. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination from any conceivable way you look at it. Is it a particularly strong film? No. But is it a halfway decent film with some laughs and some heart? Yes it is most definitely. I also admire the fact that this film isn't ashamed of being lighthearted and positive. A lot of films especially these days try to be dark and gritty. It's nice to see just a positive fun film.I honestly can't understand how this was so hated by critics upon release and so ignored by the general public. It's a very fun movie and I had a blast watching it. I will gladly be buying this flick sometime soon and sharing it with others so they can finally see this treat they missed out on.I give The Adventures of Pluto Nash a good 7 out of 10.

Heinlein or Phillip K. Dick feel to it sort of. The effects were neat if not ground breaking and Eddie Murphy did a credible job. Randy Quaid was funny and annoying at the same time. Also had a really funny cameo of Pam Greir as Eddie's mom. A nice solid movie. Not perfect by any means with lots of science mistakes but then Hollywood does that a lot anyway. This movie reminds me of Total Recall if I had to put a name on it.The humor was much more sophisticated than I expected and there were no Uranus jokes contrary to other reviews. If you are going to lie try a little harder.".

Perhaps not classic material as the latter but surely contains all the elements that made Bringing up Baby the unstoppable string of events it is  And Pluto Nash certainly is a nonstop romp through a fictional future. Some of the gag elements  Including Hilary Clinton's face on a 10000 dollar Bill... This film has so many details like that where you just have to accept the incredulity of it all And although gags like that were used in films like 1990's Total Recall Mars Today Newspaper rack on Mars and The 5th Element Cigarettes that are 34 butt with a small amount of tobacco the gags do not take over the scenes they just happen to be there just to add to the general insanity.Not being familiar with Director Ron Underwood other than 1990's Tremors I watched this because I had to see Eddie Murphy working with Randy Quaid who also has a great sense of comedy re 1996's Independence Day. Underwood has an impressive list of works including City Slickers and Mighty Joe Young. John Powell did the soundtrack and it smacks of some of his other films blending the pop music of the soundtrack with his strains of heavy melodic beat.Cameos by the great Pam Grier Alec Baldwin Illeana Douglas John Cleese James Rebhorn as a crook and even other classics like Burt Young and Peter Boyle... There is simply a lot of good talent in this film Rosario Dawson Joe Joe Pantoliano Jay Mohr and Luiz Guzman.I was surprised how much I enjoyed this it is classic comedy not modern comedy You don't have to think the jokes are hand delivered by Murphy and Quaid through most of the film with Quaid almost stealing the whole film and Pantoliano a close second. Eddie is simply Eddie and can make you laugh just by looking at you nobody had to work to be funny it just is. The other players toss in their bit on cue. It is simply set in a futuristic setting and due to that the gags are unique and hilarious.If only they could film on location in Little America on the moon perhaps in 2087 they will be able to do that.".

Murphy will always have scripts handed to him and he'll always be working in films but the once edgy comedian has lost his edge a long time ago. This story takes place in the future where Earth has populated the Moon and a former smuggler named Pluto Nash Murphy takes over a nightclub from a friend and Nash makes it a big success and moneymaker. A young woman and aspiring singer named Dina Lake Rosario Dawson asks for a job but all Nash gives her is the opportunity to waitress. Some mobsters have been buying up the local business's and they want Nash's club but he won't sell. So they blow the place up and try to kill him but Nash Dina and a robot named Bruno Randy Quaid escape and the mobsters try and find him. This film was directed by Ron Underwood who is usually reliable with lightweight comedy like this but this film fails from the outset. The special effects are adequate but not overly impressive. Many of the scenes are clearly filmed on a soundstage and in one shot Underwood resorts to actors being hoisted by wires for the gravity effect. Didn't they stop doing that in the 60's? And poor Randy Quaid has to play a horny and overly sensitive robot. Were we really suppose to find it amusing that he tries to get it on with other robots? But the big flaw comes from Murphy himself. This once exciting comedian use to be so reliable for edgy performances but here he plays his character totally straight. As you watch this you keep waiting for Murphy to say something witty and off the cuff but it never happens. It looks like Murphy has decided to try and be an action star or be the romantic lead. Murphy has become boring to watch and its sad to watch his films now. Pam Grier pops up as Murphy's mother but she has nothing to do. She has maybe two scenes and then she runs off Literally. This film wastes opportunities and the script has nothing new to offer. Along with Murphy's boring and drab performance this film was dead on arrival!".

This movie is fun not fantastically funny but entertaining. Kind of a cross between The Fifth Element and The Milagro Bean Field Wars. Visually big screen presence reminiscent of Total Recall.

The movie was fast had a quite cliche but a working storyline EXCELLENT sets and subtle humour here and there. This definetly ain't a comedy if that's what you're looking for but a fullscale oldskool adventure film! The theme music is kickin' and the sets and the whole movie is so colourful you'd think it was actually made in France Just watch i.e. Vidocq. It was like experiencing some mid90's computergame in a movie.I think Eddie did a good job in his role of Pluto Nash other actors were also high quality but perhaps a bit shaded by Eddie not because he acted better but because of more screen time. I love to see this movie over and over again everytime I get happy when I've watched it and everytime I feel like I've seen one of the greatest spaceadventures ever. I highly recommend if you like cool characters fast action and extremely nice sets.BTW There was a MOMO logo on the moon I'm 100 sure I saw it!".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of reviewers on this site seem to dismiss Pluto Nash because it was a box office failure. I say So what?! Did you invest money in this movie? Probably not. And yet you as viewer are treated to a I admit mediocre story but with EXCELLENT special effects. I like to think of The Adventures of Pluto Nash as a feelgood science fiction. There is no 'deep' philosophical theme going on but then again this film never pretends to be like that. It's just a film with a happy ending. Yay!Here are some things I really enjoyedLowno gravity battle. Did Star Trek ever do this? Once! Almost every SF film or series ever tries to evade lownograv battles. And yet it looks so cool! The special effect department did a wonderful job making this look realistic.Futuristic dancing. I love that! Every decade has it's own silly dances and it's so funny to look at this from an outsiders point of view. Just like watching 'jumpstyle'.John Cleese was a realistic and believable CGI character. I don't need to reminds you how awful CGI characters can turn out Jar Jar Binks!. Cleese was a floating projection of a head in a hovercar but he was memorable and quotable.The gun that goes 'WWWWHHHHhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiii' in an super high pitched tone when it locks on target.An android with a personality. Star Trek needed many seasons to establish the character of Data but Pluto Nash gives us at least one android with a genuine personality. Very nicely integrated into the story too. The music was great. I am personally not really fan of RB or rap but I loved the way the music was put into the storyThe dancing and the 'fastforward' RB music were hilariousSongs about the moonThe 'scratching' sounds during fight scenes worked out perfectlyThe upbeat RB style music was contrasted by some other types of music like Tony Francis' show and his intro song when he's wearing a kilt. Refreshingly divers. Some have said it wasn't funny enough. I think these reviewers are not getting the subtle humor of this film. If you were hoping for Police Academy jokes this might not be for you. The level of sarcasm is higher e.g. That's what I love about you. I ask you a simple question and four hours later I get a simple answer. The TWIST in the end. In retrospective it makes sense but it really comes as a surprise on the first viewing.CGI was great. The Lunar Highway scene the deserted desert area of the moon with Earth in the background the establishing shot of 'Little America' the hovercar chase... All very impressive.This film is getting a lower rating then it should get. There are enough movie references in this film for a film student to write a small paper about. There are worse films out there like A Sound of Thunder that get a higher rating than this film even though they had a comparable budget yet messed up on the story AND the CGI.".

	onyx:emotionText "A lot of reviewers on this site seem to dismiss Pluto Nash because it was a box office failure. I say So what?! Did you invest money in this movie? Probably not. And yet you as viewer are treated to a I admit mediocre story but with EXCELLENT special effects. I like to think of The Adventures of Pluto Nash as a feelgood science fiction. There is no 'deep' philosophical theme going on but then again this film never pretends to be like that. It's just a film with a happy ending. Yay!Here are some things I really enjoyedLowno gravity battle. Did Star Trek ever do this? Once! Almost every SF film or series ever tries to evade lownograv battles. And yet it looks so cool! The special effect department did a wonderful job making this look realistic.Futuristic dancing. I love that! Every decade has it's own silly dances and it's so funny to look at this from an outsiders point of view. Just like watching 'jumpstyle'.John Cleese was a realistic and believable CGI character. I don't need to reminds you how awful CGI characters can turn out Jar Jar Binks!. Cleese was a floating projection of a head in a hovercar but he was memorable and quotable.The gun that goes 'WWWWHHHHhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiii' in an super high pitched tone when it locks on target.An android with a personality. Star Trek needed many seasons to establish the character of Data but Pluto Nash gives us at least one android with a genuine personality. Very nicely integrated into the story too. The music was great. I am personally not really fan of RB or rap but I loved the way the music was put into the storyThe dancing and the 'fastforward' RB music were hilariousSongs about the moonThe 'scratching' sounds during fight scenes worked out perfectlyThe upbeat RB style music was contrasted by some other types of music like Tony Francis' show and his intro song when he's wearing a kilt. Refreshingly divers. Some have said it wasn't funny enough. I think these reviewers are not getting the subtle humor of this film. If you were hoping for Police Academy jokes this might not be for you. The level of sarcasm is higher e.g. That's what I love about you. I ask you a simple question and four hours later I get a simple answer. The TWIST in the end. In retrospective it makes sense but it really comes as a surprise on the first viewing.CGI was great. The Lunar Highway scene the deserted desert area of the moon with Earth in the background the establishing shot of 'Little America' the hovercar chase... All very impressive.This film is getting a lower rating then it should get. There are enough movie references in this film for a film student to write a small paper about. There are worse films out there like A Sound of Thunder that get a higher rating than this film even though they had a comparable budget yet messed up on the story AND the CGI.";

	schema:reviewBody "See a lot of guys giving this a one out of ten not really fair I feel. To me there are lots of worse movies in all categories. But that said  it's not a top notch movie.I've never been a fan of director Ron Underwood  he might be decent for TV but features aren't his strong side in my opinion. You'll notice best when it comes to the comedy parts the attempts I should say and the actions sequences.As for comedy the directing does nothing to enhance the seemingly weak script. Since comedy seems to be what this movie was to be about and the pace seems intended to be rather fast  maybe they should have gone for a director who could make something out of it? The action sequences are incredibly lame. It resembles grown people playing war without saying pow pow. Here the director's at a loss as well which shows in sequences as when Randy Quaid's robot character is taking out his two canons for guns. I take it this is supposed to be a cool shot but the angle of camera timing and pace makes it about as cool as when your dad hangs up his coat upon returning home from work.The budget 100 million allegedly didn't seem to be a problem and the special effects as well as the sets seem pretty well done along with a pretty nice cast even tiny subminute parts are mostly done by actors you at least recognize. This must be seen as further critique of the director since he seemed to have all the necessary tools at hand.The actors put in from a halfhearted to a decent effort. A lot of great character actors Joe Pantoliano didn't get enough space to be interesting and there is a lot of untapped comedy resource in both Jay Mohr and Eddie Murphy. Though it has to be said  Pam Grier put in what has to be her worst performance ever as the mother of Eddie Murphy's character. One you can always trust to give his spirit is Luis Guzmn and he doesn't disappoint in this one either.All in all I would say there was a weak script to start with that grew even weaker when it was handed to a director that couldn't handle the sort of comedy it was supposed to be nor the action it was supposed to contain. Probably actors underachieved especially in the comedy department due to this directing. The end result was nor a comedy nor an action  simply a bleak scifi that was one of the biggest netlosses in movie history if I got it right. My guess is that the guys at Warner Brothers probably are killing themselves for not picking a more suitable director.".

The script was brutal to put it kindly. It is kind of like what Beverly Hills Cop 7 would have been after they had started to go downhill after the first one. Murphy tries to make it humorous but there was no humour in any of the lines. They were just frustratingly moronic. It was 3's Company type action with many bugeyed looks at other characters pratfalls ludicrous plot holes and juvenile humour. There are no redeeming qualities at all in this movie apart from the set design. It is really sad that a studio would waste that kind of money 100 mil on garbage like this when the set could have been put to much better use.There are very few highlights one in particular involving John Cleese as an automated chauffeur. But that is about it. All of the cast members are wasted in this lackluster effort including Eddie Murphy himself. He has proved he can carry a film Beverly Hills Cop 48 Hours Trading Places but it has been a long time since he has appeared in anything decent. This could have been it however the director went for a 3 Stooges approach instead of a much grittier and darker 48 Hours. If this movie had any of 48 Hours grit or BHC's humour it might have been halfway decent. Instead it is nothing more than smarmy predictable dull and annoying. The fight between the Murphys at the end was very well done graphically it wasn't possible to determine exactly how they did it Murphy fights himself except of course it was the type of fight that would have been more at home in an Ernest movie. All the special effects are therefore completely wasted along with the 100 mil some studio sunk into this dog. What were they thinking? 210 I gave an additional point for the sets NOT for the movie".

	schema:reviewBody "Convoy Busters may not be the best Polizi movie ever to come out of Italy but it's certainly an above average crime romp with a great cast and more action packed stunt sequences than you can shake a stick at! The film is set up a little differently to most of the Polizi movies that I've seen as it's a movie of two halves and a lot of it takes place in settings unlike the thick urban atmosphere I've come to associate with this sort of movie namely a quiet seaside town and the rural countryside. Most of these films take influence from Dirty Harry and Convoy Buster is no different as Maurizio Merli's maverick copper has a definite Clint Eastwood vibe about him but the fact that it's a little different gives Convoy Busters a lot of credibility in my opinion. The story starts when the dead body of a young girl is found with her throat cut. Commissioner Olmi takes the case but when his violent methods leave an innocent man dead he gets transferred to a quiet coastal town. However the fact that it's quiet doesn't mean there isn't any organised crime...This is the first Polizi I've seen from director Stelvio Massi and while it doesn't rival the likes of Umberto Lenzi and Enzo G. Castellari I'm definitely interested in checking out more from him. Massi's handling is generally very good and while the plot does have a few problems certain sequences  the one in which the inspector shoots a few crooks from a helicopter in particular  are real standouts. There's plenty of action to keep the audience entertained throughout and it comes through in a steady stream. The stunts range from a very well done bar room brawl to a great sequence that sees Merli smash through a school window. The leading man puts in an excellent performance. He can look a little silly at times but generally he fits the role very well and this was more than enough to keep this Eurocrime fan happy. It has to be said that Convoy Busters doesn't work from the most imaginative of scripts but this isn't too important as Massi is more than equal to the task of making sure that what he has to work with is always entertaining as a film like this should be. Overall Convoy Busters is well worth seeing and I certainly recommend it.".

As Inspector Olmi finds out that the smuggler has bribed the judge who had to sue him he realizes that it's depressing to be such a goop cop if you ain't backed by the system.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're a fan of the Italian polizia thriller the names Stelvio Massi and Maurizio Merli should be familiar. The pair whether together or individually are responsible for some of the best this genre has to offer. They teamedup to make 1978's Convoy Busters and for the most part came up with a winner. The action is almost nonstop. It's a violent sometimes bloody ride full of chase scenes and gun battles. And the pace rarely lets up. There are few directors who did action as well as Massi. He shows his mastery of action in several setpieces in Convoy Busters with the chase scene involving the helicopter being among the best I've seen. The final slowmotion shoot out is a thing of beauty. As for Merli when he's not busy posing for the camera which he has a tendency to do too often he was a good action star. He's big and physical enough to effectively and believably pull of the role. And unless I'm terribly mistaken he did a lot of his own stunts.Watching Convoy Busters is like watching two movies in one. The plot is neatly split into halves with neither having much to do with the other. In the first half Merli is a police officer stationed in Rome. He grows increasingly tired of the violence he faces on a daily basis. He's working on a case involving a wellconnected smuggler. But because of bureaucracy and leaks within the police department his quarry gets away. Frustrated with the experience he asks for a transfer to a small sea side town where things are much quieter. Enter the second half of the movie. In his new environment the most dangerous thing Merli faces is the boredom of a town where nothing seems to happen. That is until Merli uncovers a smuggling operation in his new quiet hometown. He's soon thrust back into the violence he sought to escape.But it's this plot structure that I found to be the weakest element in Convoy Busters. The first half of the movie ends with the bad guy boarding a plane and heading off to Geneva. Unfortunately he's never mentioned again. This plot thread is never satisfactorily resolved. I would have liked it had Merli met up with him again at some point in the movie. After making an emotional investment of time I expected a payoff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cult actor Maurizio Merli or The Magnificent Moustache as I just decided to start calling him was the one and only true badass Italian copper of the 70s! Haters may refer to him as just a poor and hardly talented Franco Nero doppelganger and they may even have a point but for devoted fans of the wondrous Poliziotesschi sub genre he always remains the archetypic and charismatic symbol of raw  unorthodox police work and outrageously wild car chases. The collaborations with director Umberto Lenzi Violent Naples The Cynic The Rat and The Fist undoubtedly formed the highpoint of Merli's career but he also made a number of amusing films with Stelvio Massi of which this Convoy Busters may be the best one. Actually I don't like the international title Convoy Busters. It's meaningless and irrelevant and probably just chosen to sound reminiscent to the contemporary successful US flicks Convoy Sam S. Peckinpah and Wages of Fear William Friedkin. The original Italian title is very apt and powerful in fact especially seen over the course of the entire film. Un Poliziotto Scomodo literally translates as An Uncontrolled Cop and uncontrolled definitely describes Merli's character Commissioner Olmi. In his homestead Rome Olmi investigates the brutal murder of a young girl whose body got dumped in a river with the throat clean and surgically cut. The search as well as numerous other vile crimes leads to the rich and hugely influential politician Degan but Olmi is unable to make an arrest since he gets protection from the equally corrupted prosecutor and even Olmi's own direct superior. Frustrated that Degan gets away with literally everything right under his nose Olmi's working methods become even more unorthodox and so his superiors quickly find a good enough reason to transfer him to a quiet and practically crimeless coastal town. Here Olmi comes to rest and even finds romance but his strong police instincts uncover a wellorganized weapon trafficking network via the sea and involving local companies. Due to the abrupt transfer of Merli's character from Rome to the little village and the complementary change in tone  pacing it almost feels as if you're watching two entirely different Poliziotesschi flicks! The first part is obviously better with the traditional 'violent city' setting better action and familiar footage like Merli yelling against his supervisors or literally beating a confession out of suspects. The opening scene with the discovery of the dead girl in the water almost feels like a genuine giallo. The scenes in which Merli shoots bad guys from inside a helicopter is iconic Poliziotesschi  especially the last shot in slowmotion! The second part at the seaside is interesting as well but Merli clearly feels uncomfortable playing the sensitive guy and kissing his loveinterest. The intense climax with a hostage situation at an elementary school compensates for a lot though!".

	schema:reviewBody "While this film isn't quite as dreary as FEARLESS FUZZ which must have spent almost its entire budget coaxing Joan Collins to guest start CONVOY BUSTERS still feels too sloppy to really compete with the other much better work Maurizio Merli did for Umberto Lenzi and Marino Girolami. Stelvio Massi's films always felt like cutrate Umberto Lenzi though with a much higher emphasis on creative camera angles and slow motion so with a little Antonio Margheriti and Enzo Castellari mixed in. However his films certainly suffered from lack of money and this film is no exception.Maurizio Merli starts the movie on the tail of a ruthless killer and diamond smuggler who frustratingly slips out of his grasp. Oddly enough the movie completely switches gears and spends its second half in a sleepy seaside community when Merli gets transferred to get away from it all. This sort of thing would never be greenlit today as the nervous studio execs would demand that the villain find his comeuppance or at least have something tie in from the first half later on. No such luck.The strangeness of this film is really what sets it the most apart from Merli's other more routine late70's police outings. There's a couple great scenes in there like when Merli albeit unrealistically hunts down several crooks with a helicopter armed only with a revolver with what must be criminalseeking bullets. Things get muddled when he meets a girl the stunning Olga Karlatos and it turns into an awkward romance as everyone you me and both of them can tell he's way more into his work than her.Another memorable goofy scene highlights some miscast 30somethings as teenagers terrorizing a stadium and shooting at the whimpering owner who looks like either a bloated Sean Penn or a latecareer Zalman King. Merli shows up and administers more of his productive signature beatings but to the teens and not the owner.The main gang at the end really lacks much of a sense of menace even when they take hostages. This film really could have used better actors as henchmen but unfortunately plays its cards too soon as Nello Pazzafini and Riccardo Petrazzi only get one short scene as a pair of robbers shacked up with a sleepy hippy chick who gets delightfully shot through the wrist. More beatings ensue.Definitely a hitandmiss affair. Set your expectations low and you'll have a lot more fun than THE REBEL or FEARLESS FUZZ.".

Merli shows up and administers more of his productive signature beatings but to the teens and not the owner.The main gang at the end really lacks much of a sense of menace even when they take hostages. This film really could have used better actors as henchmen but unfortunately plays its cards too soon as Nello Pazzafini and Riccardo Petrazzi only get one short scene as a pair of robbers shacked up with a sleepy hippy chick who gets delightfully shot through the wrist. More beatings ensue.Definitely a hitandmiss affair. Set your expectations low and you'll have a lot more fun than THE REBEL or FEARLESS FUZZ.";

But he is a talented comedian and anyone who is an avid SNL fan has seen Rob perform some very funny skits.  He's not Milton Berle but he has that mindlessly funny comic energy that frequently works. Deuce Bigalow is a film almost aimed at ticking off critics.  Not all audiences will find the crude gags funny but otherspreferably those who can let go of their inhibitions for an hour and a halfwill have tons of laughs.  The subplot involving Deuce's father as a bathroom attendant is pretty cheap.  It's an obvious setup for scatological gags.  One of them involving a scene in which Deuce is having a pleasant mantoman talk with his Dad while you can hear the groans of someone in one of the stalls loudly...relieving himself made me roll with laughter.  I wouldn't call it a priceless gag but you don't always have to aim high with comedy.  If it's funny it's funny.  If you laughed you laughed.  Just like any Farrelly Brothers movie there are gags involving physical handicaps like obesity narcolepsy and Turrett's Syndrome.  However the jokes are executed in such a broad manner that no oneeven ones with any of those disordersshouldn't be offended.Naturally some will hate this movie some will like this movie some will love this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "While watching Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo' you may well find yourself laughing out loud from time to time  and hating yourself for it afterwards. For this lame brained comedy beyond being incredibly juvenile and silly in its comedic temperament also manages to be as politically incorrect as possible using as its targets the obese the handicapped and an assortment of social outcasts and misfits.  And although the ribbing is generally quite goodnatured and even affectionate at times one can't help but feel a little guilty about laughing.The formula for the film adheres very closely to the one employed by virtually all Saturday Night Live or Second City alumni in their initial forays into big screen comedies.  Once again we have the usual bumbling nerd trying to win acceptance as a cool dude' making a shambles of everything he touches yet ultimately managing to garner the respect of his peers and the love of a beautiful woman.  Rob Schneider plays the title role a professional fish tank cleaner who through a complicated series of circumstances finds himself delving into the realm of man whore' in order to earn some much needed money.  The stupidity of the premise and the situations cannot be underestimated as Schneider is put through a series of pratfalls misunderstandings and verbal slugfests that are often quite amusing almost in spite of themselves.  It takes either a certain amount of daring or a shocking degree of insensitivity or perhaps a little of both to line up a series of jokes and sight gags aimed at people who suffer from obesity Tourettes Syndrome Narcolepsy blindness and limb amputation   but this film does it.  Somehow though the film manages to treat its characters with such a genial fondness that it never seems particularly harsh or mean spirited.  Whether or not that mitigates the feeling of guilt resulting from one's laughter must finally be a matter of personal conscience I suppose.Schneider plays the lead in a nicely relaxed fashion not succumbing to the hyperbolic mugging that so many comics are prone to indulge in when faced with similar roles.  And what a pleasant surprise to encounter Marlo Thomas of all people in an uncredited cameo appearance  and still looking like a knockout in her sexy lingerie.  Deuce Bigalow' may not sit well with the easily offended or with those who prefer their comedy to be of a bit more  um shall we say  cerebral nature.  Still unabashed silliness makes for a fun time every now and then and in that spirit this film deserves to be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo is far from an original or subtle comedy but I don't think that is what the director had in mind when doing this movie. All in all it is quite a good movie even though it is a real nobrainer.Deuce Bigalow used to work as a tank cleaner in SeaWorld but got fired because he was cleaning the tanks in the nude in front of a lot of people. Since than he cleans domestic fish tanks for a living. This job brings him into contact with Antoine Laconte who works as a male escort and owns a gigantic apartment filled with all kinds of precious items. One of these is a tank full of very expensive fish.When one of the fish gets sick Deuce is asked to help and since Antoine is going to Europe for 3 weeks he has to check in on the apartment daily to look at the fish. But instead of checking in on Antoine's home Deuce takes the opportunity to move into the flat. He accidentally sets fire to the toaster and breaks the fish tank. Knowing that Antoine will kill him for that when he sees it Deuce has to make sure everything is exactly the way it was. But that will cost a lot of money... which he doesn't have. To raise enough money in that short period of time he decides to start working as a lowbudget male gigolo.As you can expect in this kind of movie he doesn't meet any normal women who want to make use of his services. It is a real freak show filled with a 500 pound woman a woman who's about 8 feet tall... The movie is full of this kind of predictable facts but when you are prepared for it it really doesn't bother. Don't expect to see a highly sofisticated movie but it isn't as bad as you might expect. One of the scenes that I really liked were the parodies on other movies like The Matrix.I would recommend this movie to everybody who doesn't mind laughing about older and predictable jokes. It's an excellent movie when you came home from a hard day at work when you are tired and looking for a good laugh without having to think too much. I reward it with a 710.".

While looking after his apartment he accidently smashes the very expensive tank. the only way to pay for a new one is to do his own stint of of being a male madame!the problem is it is at the very bottom end of the market. He rents his body to the strangest of female clients who really are the stars of the filmwith the funniest of consequences. Some of the film is a bit silly and not funny the blind woman bit of the movie is just not funny and really plays no part in the film also i think the woman with tarets syndrome could have been played by someone with a bit more personality but apart from that a veryvery funny film. 8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the commercials for this movie I was excited about seeing DEUCE BIGALWO MALE GIGOLO. Although I've never been a big Rob Schneider fan I've always liked Saturday Night Live and their alumni and I usually enjoy the movies they make. I was hoping this movie wouldn't be too similar to most Adam Sandler movies that are made. Most of them are stupider than they are funnier. I'd rather watch a movie like TOMMY BOY or THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE than WATERBOY or BILLY MADISON. So I was hoping DEUCE BIGALOW be a little more like those movies. It turns out this movie was worse than the Adam Sandler movies and I found most Sandler movies funnier.Deuce Bigalow Rob Schneider plays a pathetic unemployed fishloving tank cleaner who gets a job by a very big male prostitute named Antoine LeConte Oded Fehr to take care of his house for three weeks. When Deuce almost destroys the house he needs to make a few thousand dollars quickly. Through a guy named T.J. Eddie Griffin he is able to get a job as a gigolo but every girl he tries to give pleasure is very unusual and strange. He finally falls in love with a woman named Kate Arija Bareikis.Although it had its moments DEUCE BIGALOW MALE GIGALO didn't strike me as very funny. The story line is useless although it isn't really mean to be very important and most of the jokes that weren't used on the commercials don't work. The funniest parts of the movie were the Matrix spoofs and a few of the jokes but all of which were already used on the commercials.The acting was nothing special but not so bad. Rob Schneider does fine but again nothing special. Arija Bareikis does pretty well as Deuce's girlfriend. Oded Fehr did a pretty good job as the huge strong male hooker. Eddie Griffin and William Forsythe who plays a detective play incredibly annoying characters with notverygreat acting jobs. Norm Macdonald has a pretty good cameo as well.Story line? Give me a break. It's just Deuce going from one nutcase girl to another and falling in love with the only normal one well mostly. Some of the girls do have funny moments but not enough for me to say I recommend this movie.".

It was used in There's something about Mary and was really effective. Deuce Bigalow is a fish tank cleaner. He knows everything about every kind of fish tank fish food fish species and fish living. One day Deuce got a job cleaning an outdoor pond at a Male Gigalo's mansion. Deuce falls in to the pond and is helped out by the male gigalo himself.

Deuce then discovers that inside this man has got an 8000 fish tank with expensive and rare fish. But the most rarest is quite ill. So The Gigalo asks Deuce to watch his house and fish for 3 weeks while he is away. The gigalo warns him not to break anything or he will be dead meat. Deuce nervously agrees.While Deuce has got bread in the toaster he decides to try out the indoor exercise equipment including hanging upside down and swinging like tarzan. While deuce is upside down he realises that his toast is burning and the fire is spreading rapidly but Deuce cant get down so he swings over to the fish tank to get a grip whilst he tries to get down but yep you guessed it the tank falls over and smashes leaving the fish waterless.Deuce places all the fish into seperate containers with water and tries to think how he can make the money for the tank. While he is sleeping he can hear a girl on the answering machine asking for the male Gigalo. Deuce wakes up picks up the phone and accepts the offer. So from there on he's known as Deuce Bigalow Male Gigalo. But all he's trying to do is earn enough money to get a new tank within 3 weeks... Not an easy task.Overall I must say it has got some really funny parts but I think the script work could have been better. A solid 810".

After watching it I felt like they tried to turn this incredible and moving work of fiction into an episode of My SoCalled Life. The book this screenplay is loosely based on is so much more powerful than this bland film version. The main character was heinously miscast she brings no depth to the role whatsoever. You end up being annoyed by her instead of identifying with her in any meaningful way. And you never find out enough about the supporting cast to understand what's going on with them. In my opinion the entire point of the novel was completely missed. I was terribly disappointed.".

After watching it I felt like they tried to turn this incredible and moving work of fiction into an episode of My SoCalled Life. The book this screenplay is loosely based on is so much more powerful than this bland film version. The main character was heinously miscast she brings no depth to the role whatsoever. You end up being annoyed by her instead of identifying with her in any meaningful way. And you never find out enough about the supporting cast to understand what's going on with them. In my opinion the entire point of the novel was completely missed. I was terribly disappointed.";

Sadly the movie is studio junk. The director and screenwriter chose instead to turn this into a movie about hot highschoolers going at it and acting like groupies. Each character has been flattened out to a cutesy stereotype. For example Tara Reid was chosen to play Cybil who in the book is a lesbian rocker and very withdrawn. The movie really has no plot other than Andrea chasing around Todd as if she is an NSync groupie. I felt like I watched a two hour commercial for noxema or saw a 17 magazine come to life as a movie.If you want to watch a goofy film about over sexed teenagers rent this movie.

I mean no matter how smart she is and how wonderful people tell her she is she can't believe it and thinks sleeping with the rock star makes her somebody. But come on we've all been teenagers and we've all been selfconscious and stupid and we've all wanted to be SoandSo's girlfriendboyfriend. I liked the supporting cast and thoroughly hated Todd Sparrow as we should. I'd like to have seen more from Rebecca Summer Phoenix as she's potentially as interesting a study as Andrea if not more.

I liked it how this film was made when all these stars weren't as popular as they are now like Tara Reid and Selma Blair. The film explores Dominique Swain's character coming out of her shy shell! She goes through all these emotional changes and grows stronger because of them and you really feel she has grown up by the end of the film and she's realized know one should ever use her like Todd Sparrow did throughout the whole movie up until the finale. The movie just relaxes you and takes on Andrea's journey of selfdiscovery of herself and the movie shows you that with a comedic outlook and I really like that touch. I give this film 810 stars! You'll love it like I did!".

Swain herself not only actually physically resembles both Alicia Silverstone and Claire Danes especially with the rubydyed hair but her narration even seems to fall halfway in between Clueless' poignant perkiness and My So Called Life's dark brooding.  The hitch is that both can't possibly be done properly at the same time and Girl is shining proof of that.  This movie is so directionless and muddled that I'm kind of upset I bothered to watch it.  It attempts to tackle just about every possible teen issue it can which does not help it either.  No scene in the movie is longer than a minute and a half and not one of the million or so tangent plot lines ever becomes fully developed.  And not one of the multitude of characters is ever deveolped even enough for the audience to care about them in the least. And on top of that the movie is tremendously out of touch.  The characters are all one dimensional stereotypical representations that some studio exec thinks are what real teens are like. This whole movie feels so condensed and confused that I honestly couldn't possibly summarize the plot.  I think it has something to do with this chick having a crush but the movie goes so far off the path trying to be an extraglossy afterschool special that it completely selfdestructs.  It's not good in the beginning and it only gets more embarassing as the movie reaches its absurd conclusions which do not provide any character resolution or moral to any of the stories anyway.

The movie completely changed the story the characters and just the general feel of the book. It turned Andrea Marr into this annoying airheaded teenage girl with no depth Todd Sparrow into a cleancut pretty boy who sang boring music and Cybil into...well a Tara Reid character. The book even emphasizes the fact that Cybil is shy and that Andrea is shocked when she just wears a shirt that shows a little bit of her stomach and in the movie she's hardly wearing any clothes at all. I think I'd be less offended by the movie being like a 90 minute episode of My SoCalled Life if it didn't mention that it was based on the Blake Nelson book. But ah well. Those are just a few thoughts.".

Sean Patrick Flannery didn't pull this part off very well. He started off as the tough out of reach guy but the movie tried to evolve his character. Flannery couldn't portray the needy and in love guy. Dominique Swain started as being the shy girl. When she tried to evolve into being the cool girl I didn't buy it.

The acting is smooth the movie not too heavy to get you really depressed but still enough content to make it far above the usual teenage fare.  An underlying message in support of a new female liberalism is also what makes it a very cool movie.  Warning guys will not get this movie. Tara Reid gives a really bittersweet performance and Dominique Swain is truly funny selfdeprecating and standout a real contrast from her character in Lolita.

In addition it totally seemed like a rushed movie spending the entire time on Andrea's senior year was pretty boring especially considering that the novel was set over a period of years.   is it just me or did Cybil seem like a total bitch?  Overall this film did NOT do Blake Nelson's novel justice. However don't let that discourage you from seeing it.  Just don't get your hopes up too high for a faithful version of the book. Despite the huge departure from a lot of the story this film is still fairly entertaining. Also while Flanery seemed like an unlikely choice to me at first he really is a great Todd Sparrow.".

However it's set in present day and looks sort of out of place with what you think of teenagers now the American Pie and She's All That type movies.The other area it falls short in is that it seems to want to take what is a story of a few years in a girl's life and condense it into 1.  It seemed like if some plotlines were either cut or drawn out a little more it would have been a better movie.But all in all it was okay.  Dominique Swain forgive me if I spelled it wrong was a really good Andrea although she did look a little too much like Claire Danes.  Sean Patrick Flannery was a good Todd Sparrow although I kept seeing David Cassidy for some reason.  Tara Reid ... well I can't decide if she's a bad actress or just gets bad lines because even in this one she seems to be posing for the camera a bit too much don't see Body Shots if you know what's good for you.  I think the most worth it part was the end where they all get together for a graduation party because it was a pretty good party scene and the context was pretty hilariousAnd I have to give props to the producers for using The Smooths on the soundtrack.

Now I'm the kind of person that needs to see a movie version of a book that I've read whenever possible.  I like to see how others visualize the text and their comparisons to my own images.  So I snuggled under my covers and watched the story unfold.Girl is a well acted portrayal of a teenage girl growing up in today's society.  Although some things were different than the book I was surprised how some of the dialogue was exact. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie  even if I felt the book was better. Isn't that usually the case?In the course of watching this movie I had a very MySoCalledLife feeling about me. Maybe it was the cranberry colored hair that Andrea Dominique Swain was sporting or the voiceovers that revealed all her most intimate thoughts.   And Cybil Tara Reid to me anyway bared a striking resemblance to the character Rayanne.  Or what about the strong silent Todd Sparrow? Can we say Jordan Catalano?  The whole film definitely seemed similar.

This movie continues from the point the first one has ended Giorgio Perozzi's death and shows us the rest of the guys at his grave remembering some great jokes they have done in the past. The comedy moments that this movie offers are most of the times better than the first film and the actors seem to have the same passion and joy as several years ago. The most funny of all is Ugo Tognazzi as Conte Lello Mascetti a truly larger than life character. Maybe the best film about male friendship and along with I soliti ignoti the best Italian comedy by far!".

	schema:reviewBody "MY FRIENDS is originally a project for Italian writerdirector Pietro Germi whose untimely death in 1974 at the age of 60 leaves the film to be taken over by another maestro of the Commedia all'Italiana Mario Monicelli. The film was a whopping boxoffice success which subsequently would spawn two sequels Monicelli would be back in the saddle with ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 1982 and ALL MY FRIENDS PART 3 1985 would be outsourced to Nanni Loy. A doublebill of these two Monicelli's vehicles set in Florence MY FRIENDS has a quartet core of middleaged men Count Lello Mascetti Tognhzzi a downandout exnobleman who has squandered all his fortunes can only slum it in a tiny basement with his suicidedriven wife Alice Vukotic and their daughter which doesn't dissuade him from being smitten with an underage student Titti Dionisio who has a predilection for girls over men the second one is Giorgio Perozzi Noiret a journalist separated from his wife Laura Goodwin and is irreconcilably at adds with his prim adult son then there is Rambaldo Melandri Moschin a bachelor architect determined to find his perfect half and lastly is Guido Necchi Del Prete married with Carmen Tamantini and they own a bar which serves as their haunt. Life is anything but optimistic Pietro Germi and co.'s script conscientiously draws the milieu from reality in both Mascetti and Perozzi's cases one might easily finds company in distress and self abandonment but not these four feeding on their staunch friendship the fold never relinquish their idiosyncratic practical jokes and escapades mostly ingenious and borderline harmless counting their classic passengersslapping when a train departs and Mascetti's trademark supercazzola gibberish. And following Melandri's tireless pursuit of a married woman Donatella Karlatos an embodiment of Madonna with psychological hiccups a fifth member Professor Sassaroli Celi is introduced a renowned surgeon and the husband of Donatella who is perversely liberal about the affair and is more than happy to not stand in their way if they are really made for each other and of course they are not but Sassaroli is here to stay. One of their most detailed skits involves a pennypinching pensioner Righi Blier who is hustled into believing that the quartet belongs to a mafia mob with Sassaroli as their boss dangled by the profitable income Righi buckles down to join in their dangerous lineofwork and their adventure culminates in a selforganized gangster melee which leaves Righi in chagrin utterly sidesplitting thanks to Blier's bangup pofaced bearing. The coda of MY FRIENDS deflects to a more sombre streak  a heart attack does Peruzzi in all happens in a sudden but no grim sorrow is allowed to percolate his friends keep their comic esprit de corps alive even death cannot take it away. ALL MY FRIENDS PART 2 comes 7 years later the story continues after Peruzzi's abrupt departure the original cast returns significantly older except Del Prete who is replaced by a more prosaic looking Renzo Montagnani as Necchi only the latter is not endowed with Del Prete's dashing and devilmaycare panache. The part 2 doesn't structurally pigeonhole itself as a strict sequel owing to the huge pull of Noiret's Perozzi there are abundant flashbacks charting Perozzi and Mascetti's past stories which take place earlier than those in the first one while without ghettoizing Sassaroli out of the picture the original four becomes a quintet it conspicuously creates some anachronism for viewers with fresh memory of the first installment. Gallantly interpolating the flood of Arno in 1966 the story manages to expound on Perozzi's marriage disintegration and take a taunting spin on Melandri's another devoted courtship to a voluptuous but Godfearing young girl Noemi Giordano.Contriving an act of pulling Pisa tower back in perpendicular gatecrushing a singing contest with a risqu song a cappella in the presence of cardinals a chirpy caper involving a Spanish contortionist Da Silva their shticks never disappoint meanwhile Mascetti has his own familial problem when his slowwitted daughter is impregnated by an unknown rapist and decides to become an unwed mother. Finally a guest performance from Paolo Stoppa as Savino a Shylock to whom Mascetti is indebted he would fall prey into the quartet's pranks includes a scatological one which sublimely tips the scale and undergo several invisible operations to square off Mascetti's debts. Similarly another heart attack befalls on one of the main characters near the finish but this time to a lesser extent Tognazzi Moschin Noiret and Celi are all sterling comedians but it is Tognazzi who stands out in his more sympathetic noblemanindistress mould. Inscribing their marks as quintessential pieces of Commedia all'Italiana both films are salacious amoral and pathologically funny although the second one only logically contends to take a leaf from its predecessor's book. But essentially they are not connived as farfetched escapist fares with a shamelessly patronizing smugness their gypsyish antics are genuinely devised to imbue a positive vibe out of their quotidian misfortunes despite that they can never hit the right note of the gender politics yet what do you expect from a buddy movie?".

The 'dinner' of the title is a regular gathering at which some smug young Parisian gentlemen compete to invite the most amusingly ridiculous character as their guest. Pierre Brochant Thierry Lhermitte believes he has a sure winner in Franois Pignon played brilliantly by Jacques Villeret whose passion is the construction of intricate models from matchsticks. Ironically it is Brochant who ends up looking the fool morally if not intellectually. And it is the slightly sad but hilarious antihero Pignon who emerges as far the wiser of the two.

However things do not go as planned as during Pignot's stay in Pierre's house unbelievable things begin to happen...Villeret is simply amazing in his role as Pignon standing above everyone else in this film. This should not mean that the other performances are not good however In fact everyone does a good job despite the fact that most actors perform very short appearances.LDdC is a movie that will make you laugh but in fact it will also make you think behind the fun the film conveys a very humane and meaningful message.

Pierre Brochant Thierry Lhermitte the smug publisher thinks that he's got a winner in the tax accountant Franois Pignon Jacques Villeret sadly passed away in January 2005  great French Comedian whose performance in Robert and Robert I enjoyed very much who reproduces the famous landmarks with the matchsticks and would talk about them with never ending enthusiasm. Unfortunately for Pierre but fortunately for us the viewers he throws his back just before the dinner and has to rely to Pignon's sincere generosity. The tables are turned and look who is an idiot after all...With the modest running time of 80 minutes the Dinner Game is a delightful and very funny comedy. I would not expect anything else from Francis Veber the director of Le Jouet 1976 aka The Toy  La Chvre 1981 aka Knock On Wood Les Compres 1983 ... aka ComDads and Les Fugitifs 1986 and the writer for Le Grand blond avec une chaussure noire 1972 ... aka The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe.".

	schema:headline " a great comedy held up by two great actors";
	schema:reviewBody "Before this film was released in 1998 it was originally a play. This play was performed on stage in 1993 and had a huge success. Francis Weber felt like adapting his play he was the author for the screen and he had a good idea. The action takes place in a beautiful Parisian flat. Pierre Brochant Thierry Lhermitte lives there and each week he and his friends take part in a special dinner a dner de cons. They've got to invite someone silly and the one who has found the best dumb is the winner of the evening. Brochant has chosen Franois Pignon Jacques Villeret and before going to the dinner Brochant has invited him in his flat. Then in a few minutes everything's wrong his wife's leaving him he's got a backache he's got to face his mistress etc.... and Pignon is a bit responsible for this! There are two main types of comic in this film on one hand the comic comes from the dialogues which are very funny with a lot of successful puns. Moreover they're never vulgar. On the other hand the comic comes from the situation where Brochant is not only has he got to face Pignon but he's got to face unexpected events like the arrival of a fiscal inspector Daniel Prvost. Above all the film is worth watching for its incredible main actors Lhermitte who is the perfect hypocrite and Villeret who is full of goodwill and kindness in spite of its idiocy and its naivety in 1999 he won the Oscar for the best actor in France and he deserved it. Moreover the other actors are very well used especially Francis Huster and Daniel Prvost who are both excellent. The only weaknesses of this film are the moment where Prvost comes in Brochant's flat and then the plot is resolved very laboriously. The other moment is when Pignon is calling Mrs Brochant to tell her his real thoughts about her husband you've got a quite conventional dialogue. Nevertheless if you want to have a good time watch this comedy it's worth watching!".

However on the contrary of what a reader may think it is one of the best comedies I have ever seen and I do not recall the last time I have laughed this way. The work of Jacques Villeret as an authentic jackass with a stupid grin and trying to help Pierre is amazing. The dialogs and situations are very intelligent and hilarious. I highly recommend this film awarded with three Csar and two Lumiere Award for one of those days when the viewer is upset or stressed for a perfect relaxation. My vote is eight.Title Brazil O Jantar dos Malas The Dinner of the Jackasses".

About to leave Pignon stops when the answerphone reveals a message that Brochant's wife is leaving him.  He tries to help the situation and Brochant sort of needs him to but he can't help but make things a little worse every time.The premise of this film made it sound like it was set at the dinner party of the title and it put me of a little as I didn't like the cruel sound of it.  However the actual plot occurs in Brochant's flat but it does still have a cruel streak that is a little unpleasant.  Because Pignon is such a nice little man it is hard to see him so openly reviled and mocked by Brochant I know the plot requires it but it was done with more than a little malice and at times left a bitter taste in the mouth.  However for the majority the film is actually very funny in a slight way.  The laughs generally come from buffoonery from Pignon at Brochant's expense!The plot does turn around to be one of lessons towards the end which is good and the story does have a good message of acceptance through it. The actors do pretty well with their broad characters although they are allowed a little expansion towards the end of the film.  Lhermitte's cold hearted bastard is a little to hard and cruel without enough in the way of being judged by the film.  Villeret makes the film and perfectly makes Pignon a likeable and warm little fellow but still undeniably makes him the type of person who you would cross the road to avoid.  The beauty of this is that when Brochant learns his lesson we as the audience also learn something too.  Support roles are good but this film is mostly a doublehander which the two leads carry well.Light and funny despite the slightly cruel nature of the plot this film is well worth a watch.  The humour is very much situation based and relies on plot devices to move it on but it's quite fresh and amusing and makes for an enjoyable 90 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amazing! This word describes perfectly the simplicity and the incredible sense of humour of this movie! The plot is really too straight to follow as it is very simple Pierre and his friends do once a week a special dinner to make fun of stupid guys they meet and their absurd stories. They call it idiot's dinner. For them it's like a championship where they try to find the dumbest guy on earth! But this time Pierre can't go to the dinner because he hurt himself when he was playing golf so he must stays in his own home. However he had already invited Mr Pignon the dumb guy to the dinner and when Mr Pignon arrived Pierre's nightmare will begin! This movie is really funny because it transforms little common circumstances into hilarious sequences! For example a simple phone call is turned into a hilarious scene! I mean I cried of laughing when I was watching this movie! There are fourfive scenes that are really funny and simple at the same time. It proves that is not needed a large budget to make a great film. In fact this movie even seems to be adapted from a theatrical play. I don't know if it is or not but it seems so because of the simplicity of its setting almost all the film is shot inside Pierre's apartment.About the acting It's done a very good work especially by Jacques Villeret the actor which plays Mr Pignon's character. He's really impressive as a dumb! He's truly a world champion! It's not the first time I watched this movie I had already seen it some years ago when it was released in theatres but today when I watched it on DVD I laughed as much as I was seeing it for the very first time!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the face of Steve Carrel in The Dinner of Schmucks remake I knew they got the meaning of the word totally wrong 'cons' is not about being retarded or eccentric it's a state of mind something that doesn't strike the eyes not at first sight anyway.Con is a generic insult in France that takes a lot of meanings it either refers to a dumb or extremely naive person a socially awkward geek a dork someone so blinded by a passion that he can't realize how ridicule he is in the eyes of common people stupid is not the most faithful synonym because a 'con' can have a high I.Q but what do they all have in common they don't have the intelligence of the situation and are the target of meanspirited people who use them as foils to appear smarter and that they can easily be fooled allows society to label them as 'idiots'. This is sad but true and Veber's Diner de Cons aka The Dinner Game builds its plot on a cruel purpose with mean spirited snobs inviting idiots to elect a winner at the end of the evening and Thierry Lhermitte aka Pierre Brochant a wealthy publisher is one of these bad guys.There is a French word to describe a man like Brochant a 'salaud' a bastard if you prefer a guy eager to make fun of less smart people while the socalled Dinner Game can be seen as a tacit bullying all these dumbchasers would argue that they don't harm anyone because the purpose of the game is not to let the idiots know why they were invited. It's like 'a crime without victims'. And the players really take their hateful game seriously each participant having a sort of scout to find the right idiot either a colleague eager to express some 'new' ideas a man with strange hobbies finding a good idiot is not that an easy task. And one day Brochant receives a phone call from a friend who found a 'world champion' Jacques Villeret as Franois Pignon a civil servant working in the Minister of Treasury and building replicas of landmarks with matchsticks what a promising pedigree! Many people tend to minimize the emphasis on the word 'con' by arguing that we're all the idiots of someone. While it might be true it doesn't appear to be the message of the film where the personality traits are clearly defined. While not a plain idiot Pignon is a sweet and lovable buffoon and despite his meanness Pierre Brochant strikes as a brilliant and intelligent person. The film doesn't try to reverse roles to demonstrate the former idea and the lyrics of the opening song brilliantly deliver the message that age has nothing to do with brains when we're an idiot we're an idiot period. The genius little song from George Brassens foreshadows the inevitability of the mayhem caused by Franois Pignon directly affecting Pierre Brochant's life. And it all starts with the nice twist indeed when Brochant hurts his back while golfing and is forced to cancel his participation. After discovering how brilliantly dumb Franois Pignon is he decides to go anyway much to the reluctance of his wife who therefore leaves him.The movie takes off when Brochant is left alone incapable to move and with Pignon trying to help him to see where his wife have gone. And as soon as the movie starts the setup took a little time but for the best the film features a succession of neverending misunderstandings gaffes and remarkable displays of clumsiness that elevate The Dinner Game to a masterpiece level in the comedy of errors genre. Surprisingly the film is mostly set in Brochant's luxurious apartment conveying a sort of trapped sensation. The film is adapted from a play written by Francis Veber and the unity of time space and plot contributes to a coherent plot getting crescendo each disaster provoked by Pignon leading to a bigger disaster when he tries to make up for the first. In the progress other characters make their entrance Brochant's exfriend played by a brilliant Francis Huster Just Leblanc whose name will create one of the most hilarious cases of misunderstanding in French cinema not to mention the scenestealing performance of Daniel Prevost as Franois's friend a hardnosed tax inspector. Alexandra Van Der Noot and Catherine Frot also deserve accolades for the two female parts that will get mixed up by the poor Mr. Pignon.The casting while minimalist is enough to conduct the movie with laughs and laughs creating one of the greatest and most unanimously praised French comedies and Veber's true masterpiece. Indeed Veber's comedies often relied on the simple but efficient buddy duo with the whitefaced clown and the Auguste when the laughs mostly came from the reactions of the straight guy rather than the actions of the funny one but this time there's also a cynical yet delightful pleasure from seeing the Lhermitte character so tormented. His nightmarish journey seems deserved and it would take a lot of pains to feel sorry for him because his wife left him after all she left him because he wanted to play a humiliating game. Not a villain or an antagonist he's still a hardly redeemable character and all the laughs are mixed with the satisfaction to see him get through this pain. As he'd say to Pignon he avenged in one night all the idiots who ever participated to dinner games before and he couldn't be truer.But as usual Veber films don't take their 'seriousness' with seriousness when we know where the film is going to we're immediately surprised by a twist that gets the final spice a masterpiece of wit sophistication laughs and cynicism leading to one major conclusion  never take one's personality for granted. Indeed just because someone looks and sounds like an idiot doesn't mean that he is not one.".

Thierry Lhermitte as the wealthy Parisian snob and Jacques Villeret as the grand idiot form a wonderful team. Now I'm gonna find me an idiot.Camera Obscura  810";

The film is very cruel towards him at first. He's just a sweet naive man looking for some acceptance. He soon turns into the guest from hell as his lack of intelligence does turn into annoyance. Finally his acts bring justice upon those that would make fun of him. It's a feel good comedy that gradually builds an unexpected friendship. It's also nice to see the characters in on the joke as well. Too often comedies have their own characters ignore the hilarity around them. The dialogue is quick and witty and the film does what it can in its space and time. About to be remade with Paull Rudd and Steve Carrell the trailer for that promises to expand on the events but will the heart and humor remain intact? This is a mini French gem.".

Now Pierre must deal with this fool all the night in his apartment.A couple of months ago i watch a film of Francis Veber for the first time in a festival and i enjoy it so when i found a DVD of another film of Veber i decide to get it. I didn't know what to expect of Le Diner de cons but if i were expecting a very funny comedy with an hilarious character definitely this film was the perfect to fill my expectations. I really like this film first because it has a very original contest as the main subject that is very cruel toobut we never see the reactions of Pierre's friends about Pignon actually the entire film is in Pierre's apartment so the characters must have a lot of great lines and funny situations to keep going with the film in the same place. And that's the second thing i really like of this film the character of Pignon. This man could be a really headache to anybody who meet him making any situation a big problem. And is played in a great way by Jacques Villeret. The support characters are just fun specially Pignon's friend who loves football that scene when both are talking in the phone in probably my favourite.And the final message of the film could be the classic one actually it is but the very last scene is really great and change everything because after all he was just a complete fool.Conclusion i enjoyed a lot this filmwhich runtime is only 80 minutes and left me desires to continue checking Veber's filmography. And yes there is a good message for all the Pierres around but also another that says don't trust in fools. 9.5 out of 10".

Because Le Diner de Cons includes all the things that I like in both writers' plays. Clear dialogs nice easy links in the play that you can connect and over the top very clever jokes. Aristo and Molier used that a lot in their plays. Their characters were using the very low level comedy like falling in a stupid way and highest level of comedy black humor. Francis Veber is using his teachers' idea in a very clever way.This movie is a classic in comedy. Actors are very well performed and easy humor combines with black humor on every step. That is easy because the characters in the play already from 2 different worlds. So when ever one of them is making black humor the other one backup the viewer with easy humor. In this big chaos you finally found yourself smiling without control and you cannot stop. The writer Francis Veber carries you to the top of the hill and throws you down from the hill. Even when the movie ends you cannot stop anymore because till the last scene he still paunches you to roll down faster.I wish I could see this play at a theater one day.Well done! ".

	schema:reviewBody "BEWARE CHILDREN AT PLAY is one of those twocent Troma pickups shot in the late eighties by a small group of unknowns.  The plot concerns a series of child abductions in a small town a string of bizarre adult murders in said neighborhood and a desperate cop who turns to a psychic for answers. The story and dialogue although not stellar certainly had had some thought put into them.  The film also contained little to no nudity and the scenes of gore were few and far between.  As I watched the story unfold I kept thinking to myself how unusual it was for Troma to distribute a goreless titless humorless and generally actionless picture like this one.  But then I saw the ending. SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN NEXT PARAGRAPH! At about 85 minutes into BEWARE the movie takes a sadistic and truly unexpected turn.  Without any warning it drops from a nongraphic tale of mystery and suspense to a depraved circus of child massacre.  The lead protagonist who is trying to rescue the misled children by the way is killed from a gunshot to the head.  Various children roughly aged 4 to 12 are then shot stabbed beaten and impaled all in graphic but unrealistic detail while upbeat action music toodles on in the background. The murders are all committed by the children's own parents who are led to believe that their little bundles of joy are actually cannibalistic demons and this debauchery goes on nonstop for about ten full minutes!  Worse yet a woman is shown being raped and killed right in front of her own daughter during a scene just preceding this one.After finishing BEWARE it became clear to me that the real reason the movie was made was to show the gruesome slaughter of little kids and all the plot beforehand was merely filler so that the audience wouldn't feel guilty about rooting for the deaths of dozens of children.  After all at this point in the movie the children's deaths are supposed to be justified since they may have been involved in a murderous cult earlier on in the story.  Director Mik Cribben does his best to let the viewers know that they need not feel any remorse for enjoying the portrayals of children dying and during an interview contained on the DVD he tries to convince us that showing child murder is no worse than showing murder in general.  Uh huh.  Nice try Mik.It surprises me how little controversy this movie received especially since it was made the year an extremely controversial video game for the Atari ST was released called Schoolyard Slaughter.  I guess 1989 was a good year to kill children!".

As I watched the story unfold I kept thinking to myself how unusual it was for Troma to distribute a goreless titless humorless and generally actionless picture like this one.  But then I saw the ending. SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN NEXT PARAGRAPH! At about 85 minutes into BEWARE the movie takes a sadistic and truly unexpected turn.  Without any warning it drops from a nongraphic tale of mystery and suspense to a depraved circus of child massacre.  The lead protagonist who is trying to rescue the misled children by the way is killed from a gunshot to the head.  Various children roughly aged 4 to 12 are then shot stabbed beaten and impaled all in graphic but unrealistic detail while upbeat action music toodles on in the background. The murders are all committed by the children's own parents who are led to believe that their little bundles of joy are actually cannibalistic demons and this debauchery goes on nonstop for about ten full minutes!  Worse yet a woman is shown being raped and killed right in front of her own daughter during a scene just preceding this one.After finishing BEWARE it became clear to me that the real reason the movie was made was to show the gruesome slaughter of little kids and all the plot beforehand was merely filler so that the audience wouldn't feel guilty about rooting for the deaths of dozens of children.  After all at this point in the movie the children's deaths are supposed to be justified since they may have been involved in a murderous cult earlier on in the story.  Director Mik Cribben does his best to let the viewers know that they need not feel any remorse for enjoying the portrayals of children dying and during an interview contained on the DVD he tries to convince us that showing child murder is no worse than showing murder in general.  Uh huh.  Nice try Mik.It surprises me how little controversy this movie received especially since it was made the year an extremely controversial video game for the Atari ST was released called Schoolyard Slaughter.  I guess 1989 was a good year to kill children!";

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Cribben's cult favourite Beware Children at Play is one of the most demented films ever to be picked up by Troma. The film deserves praise for fearlessly breaking one of the last taboos in horror and most impressively doing so in an entertaining manner. Beware Children at Play really is a taste free zone. For that achievement alone the film is an absolute must see.Lloyd Kaufman's introduction to the film begins with an anecdote recounting how a preview for Beware Children at Play successfully emptied a theatre at the Cannes film festival. I'm sure the reaction would have been one of rapturous applause if the audience had seen the film in its entirety because within the context of the plot the slaughtering of the demon children really does provide great entertainment. I know that sounds abominable but when a film's plot revolves around wild cannibalistic children who believe they are characters from Beowulf I would say that just about anything goes.The film begins slowly and somewhat painfully due to the extended dialogues about cleavages I didn't even know there was a plural form of the word and supernatural phenomenon. Before too long John has joined Ross in his search for a group of missing children. These children really need a visit from Super Nanny because they spend their time cutting people in half with sickles and impaling trespassers on wooden stakes. The fact that children are depicted eating body organs would be tasteless enough for most directors but to Cribben's credit he raises the bar by throwing a rape scene and a handful of religious fanatics into the mix. The film momentarily goes astray while our incredibly stupid heroes go to the library and read Beowulf in order to get into the mind of the ringleader who believes he is the cannibalistic monster Grendel.Thankfully Beware Children at Play gets back on track for the infamous child killing marathon. This sequence is remarkable in its complete and utter shamelessness. Kiddies get decapitated stabbed shot and killed with pitchforks. It is all so very wrong but when presented in this context with the campy production values and incredibly unrealistic effects the scene comes across as a stroke of genius. However I think the picture gallery of slaughtered children on the Troma DVD is a bit foul even by my degenerate standards. That said I'm glad that Troma once again has the balls to put this kind of material out on the market.Beware Children at Play is definitely not for everyone. However fans of Troma and tastelessness in general will have a grand old time watching this shocker. I give this film full marks for having the backbone to completely smash one of cinema's biggest taboos and for being entertaining while doing so.".

THIS!!! film qualify for the title as the ultimate childslasher movie or childkill film have you ever heard this expression before? ever made. At least I will place it as no. 1 in this genre. The only other film I can think of that can match Beware Children at Play in terms of bloodshed is probably Paul Morrissey's Mixed Blood 1985.Throughout much of the film we are actually more like witnesses to a criminal investigation in child and adult disappearances than we are spectators to a horror movie but gradually the horror becomes more evident and the total bodycount in the film is something like 27 whereof 23 is children  and there are lot of ingenuity in the killings  it's NOT only guns that are used and furthermore do most of the killings take place in broad daylight. It's not a guesswhathappensinthedark film.The story is full of biblical references and allusions we are in the New Jersey Biblebelt but it also centers round the old AngloSaxon poem Beowulf or Bjowulf from which the children apparently have got the ideas for their cultish ceremonys and doings the probably best descriptions of Grendel and his doings is given in line 102114  730757 in the poem. It's funny to think of that the only to my knowledge surviving AngloSaxon poem that has its story from the time BEFORE the AngloSaxon settlements in Britain actually isn't a story about the AngloSaxon peoples but instead a story about the Danes the Geats and the Frisians  I myself have this poem in all the 3 major Danish translations from this century but it's the first time I see a film that refers to Beowulf.WARNING  DO NOT READ THIS NEXT PARAGRAF IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT REVEALING PLOT POINTS. From the title of the film and from the introduction on the videocover we are to believe that the children are the villains  and they are  but the prime villain is actually the Biblecrazy character played by the director of the film and what more is the guy we all throughout the film thought to be the hero is killed at the end by the director himself  now ain't that funny?!Actually I'm convinced that everyone including the children had a good time making this film and for most of the 20 children it has so far been an one time experience in movie making to participate in Beware Children at Play. At least it seems that only 1 of the children have been involved in movie making since.But!  Is there anything anoying by this this film? Well some might say that the religous references is a little to much others might find the violence and the killings offensive but the violence in this film is so improbable and unrealistic that you should only be able to see it from a humoristic point of view but many people unfortunately lack this sense of humor. In comparison some of the violence in a film like La classe de neige is much more disturbing and for many viewers almost unbearable to watch because its premisses is that it could be true  and in some sadly cases is true. In Funny Games 1997 the violence is even more brutal and the message of this film is that the audience in a sense is responsible for the violence in films simply because they watch these kind of films. A third kind of violence is when the violence should be perceived as either a social critic or as some kind of artistic expression and this type of violence is probably what you experience in a film like El Topo. Well if I should point 3 bad things about this film out it would be 1 the amateurish and annoying background music. 2 The very visible wires at the end of the film. 3 The difficulty of having children to play dead without breathe or swallow.  but this is only minor flaws and I won't hesitate to give the film a vote of 10 out of 10. And by the way. One child DO survive the atrocities so a sequel is possible  if anyone dares!!!".

It's funny to think of that the only to my knowledge surviving AngloSaxon poem that has its story from the time BEFORE the AngloSaxon settlements in Britain actually isn't a story about the AngloSaxon peoples but instead a story about the Danes the Geats and the Frisians  I myself have this poem in all the 3 major Danish translations from this century but it's the first time I see a film that refers to Beowulf.WARNING  DO NOT READ THIS NEXT PARAGRAF IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE ABOUT REVEALING PLOT POINTS. From the title of the film and from the introduction on the videocover we are to believe that the children are the villains  and they are  but the prime villain is actually the Biblecrazy character played by the director of the film and what more is the guy we all throughout the film thought to be the hero is killed at the end by the director himself  now ain't that funny?!Actually I'm convinced that everyone including the children had a good time making this film and for most of the 20 children it has so far been an one time experience in movie making to participate in Beware Children at Play. At least it seems that only 1 of the children have been involved in movie making since.But!  Is there anything anoying by this this film? Well some might say that the religous references is a little to much others might find the violence and the killings offensive but the violence in this film is so improbable and unrealistic that you should only be able to see it from a humoristic point of view but many people unfortunately lack this sense of humor. In comparison some of the violence in a film like La classe de neige is much more disturbing and for many viewers almost unbearable to watch because its premisses is that it could be true  and in some sadly cases is true. In Funny Games 1997 the violence is even more brutal and the message of this film is that the audience in a sense is responsible for the violence in films simply because they watch these kind of films. A third kind of violence is when the violence should be perceived as either a social critic or as some kind of artistic expression and this type of violence is probably what you experience in a film like El Topo. Well if I should point 3 bad things about this film out it would be 1 the amateurish and annoying background music. 2 The very visible wires at the end of the film. 3 The difficulty of having children to play dead without breathe or swallow.  but this is only minor flaws and I won't hesitate to give the film a vote of 10 out of 10. And by the way. One child DO survive the atrocities so a sequel is possible  if anyone dares!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Beware! Children at Play 1989 Unrated Version The film is introduced by Llyod Kaufman as having a trailer deemed so controversial in it's depiction of children killing adults that it was booed at the Cannes Film Festival and half the audience walked out. That sounds like a bad joke I heard before. What does it take to offend a French person?Or how many lightbulbs does it take to screw a French person?The opening of the film is a fatherson camping trip gone wrong. The father slowly dies after getting stuck in a bear trap and he tells his son to eat him spawning a cannibalistic cult of little children. And everything after this is screwier. The father was a professor that taught AngloSaxon poetry or as the dimwit town sheriff affectionately refers to as Angel Accent poetry and this leads his son to believe that he Glen Randell is now Grendel from the poem Beowulf. There are a variety of other bizarre explanations for the children's behavior in the convoluted plot involving the Sacrifice of Abraham's child to God amongst other things. Basically the children disappear from the town start a cult hunt adults and eat them. Sorry if this is confusing folks but I watched the film and still don't get it. This is the most I could try to understand without falling asleep.Unfortunately as interesting as the premise sounds the film is quite boring. It tried to be smart and I give it credit for that much. The SFX are good is some parts and bad in others. There are some scenes that try to make the mark but fall short. One involves the young boy cutting open his father and eating his heart. At least I think that is what it was. The editing was strange and I am pretty sure it was not a real boy doing this for legal reasons. The stomach resembled an empty flap and a hand went in and pulled out a round brown lump. The only scene that caught my attention for about 3 minutes was the slaughter scene at the end. And for the parents who secretly fantasize about killing their own kids well here you have it.There is a strange rape scene thrown in for no apparent reason. It seemed completely unnecessary and pointless. The child leader rapes a mom in front of other children including her own. That falls under the It's Just Wrong Category. And yet they somehow managed to make that boring as well.The sound quality was okay but there was goofy 80's boombox beat music at the oddest times. The film quality was decent but there are problems with the editing and continuity issues. One scene in particular is shot at night and when the camera sings back to an actor talking it is suddenly broad daylight!Favorite Quote A Bible salesman describing the Holy Bible he loves so much It is the best damn book ever! You don't need any god damn luck. You just say it is the word of God and their pocket book spreads it's cheeks and the long green pops out like puss from a pimple.DVD Extras The usual Troma fare T.I.T.

	schema:reviewBody "This was a great movie. It's underated by a lot of people. I believe that mostly every movie by TROMA is great. My all time favorite is Mother's Day it's the best horror film ever! The beginning of this film deals with a man and his son on a camping trip. The man is playing a game of Hide and Seek with the kid. And the man falls into a bear trap and dies after about 3 days. His last wish is that the kid does not starve so he tells is son Glenn to well eat him! And then the kid turns into an awful killing machine. Eating adults everywhre. And then we meet a man taking his family to visit an old army buddy who lives in the town where the children are being abducted Tromaville as said on the box. His daughter was abducted and Glenn made her his queen you could say. But I'll let you see it yourself. Let me tell you the end of this film as in Mother's Day is a horror classic not to be missed by anyone. There is a warning on the front of the box that says it should not be watched by Preagnant women or people with Heart Conditions. It's all a hoax the film isn't that scary. But it shows what I like to call 80's nostalgia. It was the end of the Slasher films. Possibly this movie could be called The Last Great Horror Film. I suggest that you go rent it first and if you like it it is available at Suncoast in the 9.99 section of the horror films. This is not the greatest horror film ever but it was made by the creator of the best horror film ever who is Charles Kaufman creator of Mother's Day. His brother Lloyd Kaufman as well as Michael Herz produce this. It's a great film and I give it a 9 12 out of 10. Highly Recommended!".

The killings done by the kids are a bit more inventive. Unfortunately they also kill of good characters. I would have given it a 4 but the ending was so stupid and only went for shock value than actually opt for a proper solution. For those who want to know The adults kill all the kids in the end because they believe the blabber of some religious moron in a rather graphic way even though they are no longer under control of their devilish leader.".

	schema:reviewBody "In comparison with the vast majority of junk Troma Studios released over the years Beware Children at Play is actually very endurable and  do I daresay it  even occasionally imaginative and entertaining junk! Personally I always had a weakness for films revolving on murderous children so maybe I was a bit more tolerant and openminded in this case but you'll also quickly notice that this film is less awful than the usual outings of Lloyd Kaufman's Studio. The subject matter is as ridiculous overthetop and offensive as usual but at least the finished product feels a lot less amateurish. The plot opens with a young boy standing guard over his daddy as he's lying trapped in a bear claw and slowly dying in agony. When he eventually passes away the bewildered boy rips open his stomach and eats the organs with a devilish smile on his face. Cut to ten years later with a family of three arriving in the same forestry area and learning that 12 children already went missing and their number increases every two months. Then the children show themselves again but the parents won't have the chance to embrace them anymore as they've formed an eerie cult of savage and flesheating monsters with as their sole mission to annihilate all adults. The concept admittedly sounds totally crazy but I can't emphasize enough that this is a superior Troma script even dragging in poetic sub plots and literature references. There also still is loads of splatter and repulsive makeup art to behold so even the diehard fans of the lousy Troma stuff won't have to feel entirely disappointed though it's hard to imagine there are people who feel disappointed upon seeing a film that is actually better than initially anticipated. The acting performances of the whole cast  the children included  are not very good but definitely Oscarworthy compared to  well  usual Troma standards. Heck there even are some admirable attempts to build up suspense and a sinister atmosphere at times so I feel almost tempted to label Beware Children at Play as a good film! Granted you'd have to be quite sick in the head to enjoy a story like this  and particularly to sit through the outrageously demented climax  but that's just an extra recommendation to all you raving bloodthirsty moviemaniacs. You know who you are!".

You're not going to find a Children of the Corn derivation with heavy religious overtones prominent references to the classic tale Beowulf and a big deal made of alliteration anywhere else. Hell when it features a quote as great as the one used for this summary you know you're in for a good time if you find this sort of thing endearing to begin with. The story begins in the past when a professor gets his luckless self stuck in a bear trap while on a camping trip with his kid and loses his mind as he slowly dies. Fast forward ten years and a rural cop Ross Carr Rich Hamilton calls upon a friend of his John DeWolfe Michael Robertson a writer who creates sensational books with titles like Unexpected Detour to help in the case of children who are going missing. Cribben is someone you may recognize if you've seen the 1981 slasher Nightmare as he had a supporting role in that movie and he also acts here as the farmer Isac Braun. He and the other cast members take themselves seriously although it's guaranteed that that's something that the viewer isn't likely to do. Some of the acting is just priceless local loudmouth Josiah Lee Kayman can be used as a prime example and the dialogue is likewise a total inane hoot as it features gems like Those guys would make The Odd Couple look like an identical pair.. Not only is Cribben's little movie fully willing to break a taboo but it treats its cast of characters as all fair game. Some people watching may find the denouement pretty predictable but it's quite amusing just the same. It's worth sitting through Beware! Children at Play just to get to the hysterical climactic action featuring wholesale slaughter. Some of the low rent gore gags are a riot especially when one victim is hacked right in half and the music score courtesy of Hershel Dwellingham may provide laughs as well. It's no surprise Troma would distribute this and anybody who enjoys Troma's own productions should find this a nice little diversion. Seven out of 10.".

One of the children in the movie could have written better lines. The gore is laughable in here. It's obviously so fake. One victim can be seen breathing after being killed. Another is stabbed obviously way to his left like underneath his arm pit. The well hyped ending is ridiculous it resembles getting together with neighbors and making a home movie and throwing in a bottle of ketchup. The background music is extremely annoying and one of those allinone keyboard machines was obviously used the kind that make drum sounds synthesizer effects etc. The music is very typical oversynthesized 80's trash. The producers should have saved their money and bought a can of ravioli for the kids instead of making this movie. 0 of 4 stars.".

	schema:headline " Verne's Columbiad  reduced in effect.";
	schema:reviewBody "After TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS it is most likely that the most popular of Jules Verne's titles the ones that most people are familiar with is his 1865 novel FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON together with it's first sequel the 1870 novel AROUND THE MOON. What fascinates everyone is that for all the errors we now know of Verne's huge cannon idea it would crush and vaporize the space travelers before they left the cannon's mouth he was on target on so many points. He felt the Americans would do it first we did  though barely It would be sent from Florida near where Cape Kennedy is located by the way Texas would be important in the project in the novel Texas wants the honor of being the site of the cannon but in reality Nasa's central space tracking center is in Houston The capsule would be bullet shaped not quite correct but look at the rockets we used The capsule would return to the earth and land in the Atlantic to be recovered by an American battleship. Nice guesswork or homework Jules! To be fair to Verne even his cannon idea was not a bad one  it was more plausible than Cyrano de Bergerac's bottles of morning dew which his poetic fancy said would lift the traveler or Poe's free flying balloon in HANS PFALL. But what is not noticed by most readers due to translations is Verne's social and political satire. He liked Americans but he recognized our bellicosity selfimage building we always did it better than anyone else and our economic and political expansionism. Verne like many Frenchmen supported Lincoln and the North in the Civil War especially after the Emancipation Proclamation. In 1887 he wrote a two volume novel NORTH AND SOUTH in which the Confederates are the villains. But he saw American enterprise as haphazard and not well planned. He was very critical of it in THE FLOATING ISLAND where greed by American millionaires destroys a remarkable artificial island. Even in his first published novel FIVE WEEKS IN A BALLOON at a philosophical moment one of the characters says that if the world ever is destroyed an American will have a hand in it.So in the novel the Baltimore Gun Club members are all leading engineers who helped the Northern cause by building better guns and cannon. Most of them are missing limbs as a result. The President of the club J.P. Barbicane in some versions his name is Impey Barbicane has his limbs. His closest associate the club's secretary J.T. Maston has most of his body but has one hook for a hand. They are the only members with in tact bodies. The club is seeking something to do with it's time after the Confederacy collapses. Barbicane suggests building the Columbiad which by the way is the cannon not the projectile to travel or communicate with the moon. The plan is barely presented when Maston suggests using the cannon instead to annex Mexico! See  Verne has our bellicosity down quite pat.Barbicane has a wartime rival one Captain Nicholl. Nicholl specialized in better and better armor. Barbicane specialized in better and better shells to pierce the armor. Nicholl will soon become the leading critic of the scheme.Verne in real life was a friend of the prominent aeronaut and photographer Nadar. Nadar became the model for the French adventurer Michel Ardan note the anagram last name for Nadar who proposes traveling in the projectile to the moon. Barbicane and Nicholl end up joining him while Maston will be in charge of carefully following their travel by powerful telescope. The flight actually had great accuracy in detailing the length of the trip four days and in showing the amazing effect of weightlessness Verne noted that by leaving the gravity field of earth this would result. The capsule never lands on the moon it couldn't because if it had it would not have been capable of getting back. Verne explains that there is a miscalculation in the calculations of the trajectory. This enables the moon to help send the capsule back to earth.NadarArdan is not in the movie. Nicholl does not become so completely involved and willing to work with Barbicane as the novel shows. George Sanders' Stuyvesant Nicholl Stuyvesant? remains hostile to Joseph Cotton's Victor Barbicane what happened to Impey up to a few minutes before the conclusion. There is no power X in the novel  no new energy source. The movie was made in the 1950s so the public had to think that Verne was thinking in terms of atomic power. Actually he never did. There is no romance between the children of Sanders and Cotton. These changes in the film help weaken the film in comparison to the novel which still reads well  try to get the translation by Walter Miller that is the best in English.This was not the only film version of the novel. The classic early film by George Melies A TRIP TO THE MOON has a period charm that makes one forget it's cardboard backgrounds and it's projectile in the eye of the man in the moon is a classic moment of cinema. And then there was the film ROCKET TO THE MOON which turned the story into an allstar comedy with Burl Ives TerryThomas Lionel Jeffries and Dennis Price.Verne was not finished with his travelers either after AROUND THE MOON. In 1889 he wrote THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE where the Gun Club decides to use the Columbiad to alter the tilt of the globe. Ardan does not reappear but Barbicane Nicholl and Marston do. It is not as good a novel as the first two.".

But if you don't have this kind of masochistic streak change the channel or go do something more interesting like watching paint dry. Despite the presence of undeniable talents like George Sanders and Joseph Cotton everything about this movie is lackluster the script manages to jettison every last bit of charm in Jules Verne's original story including his broadly satirical take on postCivilWar America and its industrial magnates. Besides the tepid romantic interest in an attempt to be more contemporary the filmmakers added another plot element in the guise of a superexplosive called Power X and then proceed to beat you over the head with the obvious parallels to atomic power and nuclear weapons. Yawn.While the sets don't achieve the stark cheesiness of say a Queen Of Outer Space they're not that great either. There's even an fx shot in which you can clearly see the armature attached to the model projectile. Shades of Robot Monster although at least there's no hand in the frame too.They also have these mildly interesting but ultimately silly props called acceleration tubes which  besides looking extremely uncomfortable for the actors  are supposed to protect them against the terrific gforce of being shot out of an enormous cannon. I think the tubes are a sort of lame homage to the deceleration sequence in Forbidden Planet. But then Nichol's daughter stows away simply by hiding in a space suit hanging from a rack. That is she endures the launch standing up and suffers no ill effects. So why did they need the tubes in the first place?I guess she was made of sterner stuff. Since the producers were also apparently too cheap to spring for the wire work involved in simulating the effects of freefall they turn Verne's cannon shell into a rocket ship with a constant 1G acceleration. But if they had rocket engines that efficient why bother with the cannon? I know the last place you're likely to encounter accurate science is in a sciencefiction film but still ... To me though the worst offense this movie commits is its appropriation of Louis and Bebe Barron's electronic tonalities from Forbidden Planet as sound effects for the spaceship. Far from lending a touch of borrowed class they're simply jarring. More than anything else it throws the sloppiness the utter shabbiness of this awful film into sharp relief.Even the similarly cheapjack Master Of The World  the last gasp of the Verne cycle that began in the 1950s  is far more entertaining than this gobbler.".

Debra Paget was in her late twenties she had lost her glow and was used up by Hollywood standards. The change to an unflattering strawberry blonde look exacerbated the problem as few actresses have ever been less suited to a light hair color. On the plus side the movie itself is a fairly accurate adaptation of Verne's story at least the book's illustrations appear to have been used as models for the rocket and the cannon. Verne's 19th century take on space travel turned out to be more accurate than most of the speculation during the first half of the 20th century. The adaptation's biggest problem was altering Verne's story by inserting a topical theme about the post WWII arms race. In Verne's 1865 novel the Baltimore Gun Club itself set about building a rocket to go to the Moon. In the adaptation a munitions manufacturer think Destination Moon concocts the scheme to demonstrate his powerful new explosive. With a lot of discussion about science weapons and peace the movie dances around the subject extensively yet never makes a coherent point about its position regarding the nuclear arms race as if simply inserting the theme is somehow sufficient. The movie is a cross between Destination Moon and Rocketship XM combining the former's good science and bad political message with the latter's dismal sets and comical special effects. The acting in all three films is equally sad. The premise has munitions manufacturer Victor Barbicane Cotton discovering an explosive Power X capable of firing a shelllike projectile to the moon. His plan is opposed for philosophicalreligious reasons by Stuyvesant Nicholl Sanders another manufacturer. Although these philosophical differences play an important part in the story they are never convincingly elaborated on which undermines the basic storyline. President Grant orders Barbicane to abandon the project because it is considered an act of war by other nations. While this is unconvincing it does serve as Barbicane's inspiration to change the project to a manned space flight. Nicholl then agrees to manufacture the ceramic coating needed for reentry and to accompany Barbicane on a flight to the moon. Paget plays Nicholl's daughter who hides inside the rocket just prior to takeoff. From the Earth to the Moon is often confused with First Men in the Moon which was made five years later. Probably because both are set in the 19th century and both feature a female stowaway played by Martha Hyer in the later film. First Men in the Moon while not a great film is superior in virtually every detail to From the Earth to the Moon. Rather ironically it was adapted from a story by H.G. Wells an early science fiction writer often compared to Verne. Movie adaptations of Verne's books were a big thing in the 1950's and early 1960's. Among the good ones were 20000 Leagues Under the Sea 1954 Around the World in 80 Days 1956 Journey to the Center of the Earth1959 Mysterious Island 1961 and Master of the World 1961. Unfortunately From the Earth to the Moon is simply not in the same league as these examples. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

I wondered who would start the thing back in motion upon reentry And the gyro scope! It reminded me of Jodie Foster in Contact where she journeys through space and time in a similar invention. The extensive use of wood puts Starship Voyager to shame and the lack of zero gravity drinking wine to celebrate take off is downright amusing.But what really made the movie work for me was the poetic language as Virginia Nicholl Debra Paget realizes they are all going to die. We could live to we are really old and die quietly in our sleep but how much better to go out as star a blazing star for all the world to see! To which Barbicane replies that if he ever gets back to Earth alive he will make sure all future voyages will include a woman for hope. How could they possibly have foreseen the catastrophic reentry into Earth's atmosphere by Space Shuttle Columbia in February 2003? Where not just one but two women Commander Laurel Clark and Dr. Kalpana Chawla joined five men in instant death. Sure the parallels to Power X and atomic warfare were already obvious in 1958 but the simplistic plot tells a whole lot more. To quote a great man 'The cause in which they died will continue.

After being forbidden from using his formula by President Ulysses S. Grant Barbicane turns to building a spaceship that will be shot to the moon by a cannon. And he needs his archrival Nicholl's help to do it.I'm perplexed as to why this one is so hated on here. At first I thought maybe it was Mystery Science Theater 3000 which is often to blame when you see an older movie on IMDb with a lot of negative reviews and a lower than deserved score. But it doesn't appear this was featured on that show. Many of the reasons given in the reviews I've read here could fit a dozen other respected scifi films from the same era. Complaining that the movie has dated special effects? Really? The only reason I don't rate it higher myself is because it's basically 100 minutes of the rivalry and reluctant partnership between these two men with nothing much in the way of scifi spectacle that you expect from a movie based on a Jules Verne novel. But those men are Joseph Cotten and George Sanders who both give charismatic performances. This wasn't challenging stuff for either actor and both have certainly done better but they do very well with what they're given here. Debra Paget with dyed blonde hair is largely wasted. Fantastic job by Morris Ankrum in his one scene as President Grant. There isn't much in the way of effects but the little bit there is has the kind of quaint charm to it that I enjoy about period scifi films. Like I said I don't get the fervent hatred of this movie. It's not one of the great scifi films from the Golden Age nor is it the best Verne adaptation brought to the screen but it's not a terrible film. It's actually quite enjoyable and a good way to pass the time. Love that final corny scene. It's a good corny in my opinion.".

Bad acting bad plot bad effects bad music horrid science. Hard to believe this was made years after The War of the Worlds and Forbidden Planet. In fact the only SF movie I can recall that was comparable in deathly dullness was Quatermass and the Pit aka Five Million Years to Earth. This was RKO Picture Corporation's last release and if it wasn't solely responsible for RKO's demise it was the final nail and a big one in RKO's coffin. What a difference from the miniseries of the same name released in 1998. Even 1964's First Men in the Moon based on a similar H.G. Wells story was far superior. That at least tried to inject a bit of fun and humor into the story here and there not to mention having good oldfashioned Ray Harryhausen special effects. If you do want to watch something based on the Jules Verne story go for Those Fantastic Flying Fools from 1967 also known as Rocket to the Moon. Similar but much better not that that's difficult. It had a better cast better writing and didn't take itself seriously.Jules Verne must have been spinning in his grave faster than the supposed astronauts here in their acceleration tubes.

The threechamber rotating centrifuge in the rocket is a unique idea it's unclear what real scientific purpose it would serve but it looks great in the movie also the neon added around the rocket engine is an intriguing touch but there's no real reason for it to be there. The script is the only real departure from the original story by Jules Verne like Wells' FIRST MEN IN THE MOON 1964 the filmmakers felt they had to add in a love interest in the story where there were none in the original novels. Otherwise very beautifully done. Cotten is good Sanders hams it up and Paget is lovely. It's interesting that Jules Verne setting his story in the year 1869 was 100 years exactly before the real historic event of the Apollo 11 Moon landing on July 20 1969 and Verne correctly selected Florida as a good place to launch rockets from. Highly recommended.".

I was ready to rip this flick a new one until I just read the trivia on IMDb and it kind of stole all my thunder so read this first before you go there lol. Anyway it starts out like a serious sci fi flick and since I'm a 30's60's sci fi fan I was getting into it. But then like the trivia part says it runs out of steam powered by power X BIG TIME! The point where this movie jumps the shark is right around the moon launch time I loved the wood paneling and shag carpet in the vessel though. The moon shot time is also when you hear the Forbidden Planet sound effects and as distinctive as they sound you immediately notice them along with the sound of someone turning a cooking timer to the point that's its really annoying. The damn trivia also stole my thunder about the boom holding the spacecraft in full view I paused and rewound that because I couldn't believe it was so blatant. This would have been a good MST3K movie to lampoon. The blonde who stows aboard Virginia is in full hormone bloom and she delivers some classic lines and moments that are just calling for an ad lib. She is in this one scene and starts saying Well if we're all going to die.... you can put your own ad lib in there mine was lets all go out with a real bang gang! She also says while they are lost in space to her heartthrob referring to when they will die Will you come to me? If you replace the word to with in I think was what she was really thinking lol. Anyway the trivia explained why this movie while never really was all that great in the beginning went totally downhill after that RKO announced they were closing down! I'm just wondering what the target audience would have been for this movie anyway it starts out to mature for kids they'd be either running all over the place or asleep and I don't see any women appeal or for that matter many guys. I guess there was a geek element in the 50's because that's the only target audience I see. Well I admit I have geeky ways to myself so they got me to watch the ad libbing I did with Virginia made the last part tolerable otherwise your not missing much. A Japanese guy in a rubber monster suit is much more fun to watch.".

My guess is that the film was finished and in the can when RKO went under and was sold to Warner Brothers to distribute. Also the fact that it was produced by Benedict Bogeaus who was a producer of B films of varying quality tells me why it did not get the budget for decent special effects.Bogeaus was not the guy for this kind of film. Take a look at his list of credits. He did several westerns with John Payne noir films with George Raft and some of them pretty good. He was out of his element doing science fiction.Verne's original novel had a bit of humor in it. But someone at RKO drained every bit of it. They even added a stowaway love interest in Debra Paget who does not make the trip in the book. She's paired opposite Don Dubbins who is scientist Joseph Cotten's assistant in creating the rocket.So instead of humor we get a lot of high falutin' claptrap coming from the mouths of Joseph Cotten and George Sanders the armaments manufacturer who is jealous of Cotten. Sanders especially looked ill at some of the dialog he was required to speak. He came across as a pouty kid and George knew it.I do wonder if Jack Warner looked at this thing before he bought it for Warner Brothers.".

The one bright spot is that you should easily recognize the electronic tonalities produced for the film FORBIDDEN PLANET at least you're reminded for a few minutes of a truly great sci fi classic and for that brief moment you can forget that you're actually watching the very worst sci fi movie ever produced.

The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesn't love himself. He tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue. Jim Nabors seems as if he's sleepwalking not acting. You'll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of Burt's wig wasn't bad in this film. His worst wig day was in Smokey and the Bandit 2. Anyhow this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with Cannonball Run 2. The original Smokey and Cannonball and Hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films. This one isn't. Even Ned Beatty who is a great actor stinks. You'll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate. And mind you this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on. It's lousy pure and simple. Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny. And least I forget Stroker Ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before his somewhatrevival years later in Boogie Nights another film that like Deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.".

He tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue. Jim Nabors seems as if he's sleepwalking not acting. You'll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of Burt's wig wasn't bad in this film. His worst wig day was in Smokey and the Bandit 2. Anyhow this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with Cannonball Run 2. The original Smokey and Cannonball and Hooper which thankfully had no sequel are great funny films. This one isn't. Even Ned Beatty who is a great actor stinks. You'll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate. And mind you this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on. It's lousy pure and simple. Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny. And least I forget Stroker Ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before his somewhatrevival years later in Boogie Nights another film that like Deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so.";

The plot of Stroker Ace hearkens back to those days of Bewitched and it has Burt Reynolds as a NASCAR driver doing everything possible to get out from under a contract with a sponsor who's a blithering idiot.Although Burt certainly gets in his innings in Stroker Ace especially seeing him in a chicken suit and driving his car in a race in one the best one in Stroker Ace by far is Ned Beatty. Beatty got an Academy Award nomination for playing the all powerful malevolent media mogul in Network. Here he takes the same character and plays it for laughs and he's absolutely hysterical. Beatty owns a fried chicken company and he could easily have been one of McMahonTate's clients from Bewitched. If outrageous overacting lead by Ned Beatty isn't reason enough to watch Stroker Ace than certainly the curvaceous Loni Anderson should do. Loni is giving out with her best Marilyn Monroe imitation as Beatty's advertising person who thinks that what Beatty is asking of Reynolds is tasteless and stupid. Of course she falls for Burt on the screen and in real life.I'm not a NASCAR fan but I don't think you have to be to watch Stroker Ace and enjoy it. I have however become a fan of the Professional Bull Riders in recent years and they have their sponsors set up in a similar fashion as does NASCAR for its various drivers. I don't think the PBR has any sponsors as outrageous as Ned Beatty. If this film was about the PBR I can just see Beatty insisting to Guilherme Marchi that he ride a bull in a chicken suit or something equally bizarre.The film got bad reviews and I can't see why. It's not sophisticated comedy to be sure but it's not all that bad. And Ned Beatty alone is worth seeing and appreciating Stroker Ace.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stroker Ace 1983 12 out of 4 I must admit that when people say Burt Reynolds I gladly call myself a fan since I love DELIVERANCE and enjoy both THE LONGEST YARD and SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT. So far I've stayed away from his 80s output but decided to tackle my first one with this turkey and it's rather sad if you really think about how bad this thing is. In the film Reynolds plays Stroker Ace a hotshot Nascar driver who signs a contract with a chicken king Ned Beatty who soon has the star on the road making a fool of himself. With the help of his mechanic Jim Nabors and another associate Loni Anderson Ace must try and find a way to get fired and released from the contract. Earlier I said it was sad to watch something like this considering some of the great things Reynolds had done in his career so it's rather stupid of me to highly recommend this film due to how incredibly bad it is. I really wasn't expecting too much but it's rather shocking to see how unfunny this comedy is and the only reason it avoids a BOMB rating from me is simply because it remains entertaining simply so you can see how much worse it's going to get. The movie has no plot to think of and what little there is is just downright stupid. Do we really believe someone would sign this contract without reading it? The movie contains one bad joke after another and we get at least four with Reynolds looking in the mirror to comment on how good his hair looks. I honestly can't say he gives a bad performance because he plays that same Good Ol' Boy that he made a career out of. He's certainly going through the motions but he comes off looking as if he thinks he's doing a great job. Nabors is slightly charming in a few scenes but Beatty comes off pretty bad throughout. Anderson's entire character seems like something from another movie and the supporting cast includes various Nascar drivers Bubba Smith and even Elvira pops up in perhaps the best gag of the film. I think the scariest thing is that this movie apparently did pretty well at the box office and this wasn't the film that would eventually kill Reynolds career. I plan on going through more of his output from this decade and I really hope nothing is worse than this here. Fingers crossed.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the middle of the 'Cannonball Run' franchise between 1 and 2 after 'Hooper' and towards the end of the 'Smokey and the Bandit' franchise before the third Needham and Reynolds teamed up again with this effort. Easily the weirdest movie title I've come across for some time it sounds like a porn flick funny thing is its actually the main characters name. So the fact this is a Hal Needham movie you can guess its gonna be about fast cars. Yep fast cars Burt Reynolds some blonde eye candy and crashes business as usual. This time Reynolds is actually a genuine race car driver on the NASCAR circuit...instead of the regular dashing cowboy. But this being a Reynolds character this race car driver is of course arrogant flashy and carefree of virtually everything around him your basic narcissistic Reynolds character. Sounds good huh well let me ice your balls down a tad. So Ace loses his sponsor by generally being an asshle so he has to find another. Along comes Torkel Ned Beatty who runs a fast food chicken franchise offering Ace a deal did I forget to mention Torkel's director of marketing and public relations is the blonde bombshell Loni Anderson? Well that pretty much explains why Ace accepts the deal without reading sht. He then spends the entire movie along with his mechanic Jim Nabors trying to get out of this bad deal which sees him opening fast food joints and dressing up in a chicken suit.Yes that is in fact the whole plot in a nutshell and yes you're right it is extremely thin on the ground. This really does come across as a lame attempt to squeeze another fast car flick out of Reynolds by either Needham or Warner Bros. I mean seriously the aim of the movie is for Ace and co the try and get fired by Torkel so they don't have to do the stupid things they agreed to do by the contract. At times this does include some racing which is filmed at the famous locations of...Charlotte Motor Speedway Talladega Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway. Now this might sound impressive but it isn't really as much of what we see is stock footage clearly and the sequences filmed for the movie are obviously done so in front of sets and small crowds.The racing segments are too damn obvious clearly racing at a slow speed and clearly not in any real danger of anything despite what the plot wants you to think. Sure Reynolds does appear to be behind the wheel of a real moving car as we've seen in his other car flicks but there is zero tension or thrills here nothing to engage you at all. To top that you don't really see much racing either a few minutes of car footage some refueling some wheel spins some cars grouping bumper to bumper at slow speeds that's it. Its then a quick cut to the finish where Reynolds generally wins if he hasn't been beaten by his incredibly clichd young good looking blonde male rival. Every racing flick protagonist has to have an arch rival antagonist who's usually blonde and younger or the same age.When Ace isn't racing he's doing these promotions for Torkel's chicken franchise. Obviously these things aren't suppose to be genuinely funny or of high quality they are suppose to be hokey and embarrassing for Ace but its embarrassing to watch! There is literately nothing remotely interesting to see in these scenes its not funny its not clever Loni Anderson in skimpy attire doesn't make it any better well... and Jim Nabors ISN'T funny dagnabbit!! At the same time Beatty as Torkel is a quite disgustingly stereotypical southern hick type who really made me not want to visit the American south. His chauffeur is played by Bubba Smith...but I don't know why because he does nothing accept lift a car up when a jack breaks. That's the sole reason why they cast the guy for that one visual strength gag good grief!Yeah so spoiler alert who cares! in the end they manage to trick their way out of Torkel's dastardly contract with the help of Feeny Anderson who of course falls for Ace during the run time. Did anyone really NOT see Loni Anderson's character failing to fall for Reynolds slimy charms? You know what's gonna happen in this movie from watching the first five minutes and no I can't overlook that. Thing is what Ace and co do to break the contract isn't that deception and kinda illegal? pretty sure you can't pretend to be a big company and pretend to offer to buy someone out.Yeah so if you like Needham's rollicking stunt flicks then look elsewhere there is none of that here. This is a weak entry and offers no excitement at all from either the racing or the characters. The only plus points I can think of that some folks might like here is the historic car porn on display and the casting of various famous NASCAR drivers none of whom I have any clue about.3.510".

	onyx:emotionText "In the middle of the 'Cannonball Run' franchise between 1 and 2 after 'Hooper' and towards the end of the 'Smokey and the Bandit' franchise before the third Needham and Reynolds teamed up again with this effort. Easily the weirdest movie title I've come across for some time it sounds like a porn flick funny thing is its actually the main characters name. So the fact this is a Hal Needham movie you can guess its gonna be about fast cars. Yep fast cars Burt Reynolds some blonde eye candy and crashes business as usual. This time Reynolds is actually a genuine race car driver on the NASCAR circuit...instead of the regular dashing cowboy. But this being a Reynolds character this race car driver is of course arrogant flashy and carefree of virtually everything around him your basic narcissistic Reynolds character. Sounds good huh well let me ice your balls down a tad. So Ace loses his sponsor by generally being an asshle so he has to find another. Along comes Torkel Ned Beatty who runs a fast food chicken franchise offering Ace a deal did I forget to mention Torkel's director of marketing and public relations is the blonde bombshell Loni Anderson? Well that pretty much explains why Ace accepts the deal without reading sht. He then spends the entire movie along with his mechanic Jim Nabors trying to get out of this bad deal which sees him opening fast food joints and dressing up in a chicken suit.Yes that is in fact the whole plot in a nutshell and yes you're right it is extremely thin on the ground. This really does come across as a lame attempt to squeeze another fast car flick out of Reynolds by either Needham or Warner Bros. I mean seriously the aim of the movie is for Ace and co the try and get fired by Torkel so they don't have to do the stupid things they agreed to do by the contract. At times this does include some racing which is filmed at the famous locations of...Charlotte Motor Speedway Talladega Speedway and Atlanta Motor Speedway. Now this might sound impressive but it isn't really as much of what we see is stock footage clearly and the sequences filmed for the movie are obviously done so in front of sets and small crowds.The racing segments are too damn obvious clearly racing at a slow speed and clearly not in any real danger of anything despite what the plot wants you to think. Sure Reynolds does appear to be behind the wheel of a real moving car as we've seen in his other car flicks but there is zero tension or thrills here nothing to engage you at all. To top that you don't really see much racing either a few minutes of car footage some refueling some wheel spins some cars grouping bumper to bumper at slow speeds that's it.

It might have been exciting back in 1959 to see some guy pick up a tree but the modern special effects fests have eclipsed it. Any kid interested in seeing fighting musclemen today wouldn't watch this they'd be watching Smackdown or whatever it is. WWF. WWE. I don't know. Anyway they'd rather see Rick Flair and John Cena insult each other.But hey! I liked it because I think Steve Reeves was cool! He looked the part with his beard. And he had some build better than all the musclemen that followed better than the bodybuilders today. This was his last good film. For all the others he shaved off his beard and journeyed to strange places like Russia and India. He should have stayed in ancient Greece.If your a retro person you would love this. I dig the retro dancing Greek island chicks. I dig the fake tigers. I dig the chariots I dig Steve beating up the world's heavyweight champ. You might find other things to dig so pay homage to old Steve Hercules Reeves himself. He might have been governor of California too.".

Their trip is interrupted when Hercules must do battle with the giant Anteus Primo Carnera whose strength seems to exceed his own until he realizes that Anteus is the son of the earth goddess Gea and can't be defeated on land. On their arrival in Thebes the trio discovers that the kingdom is in the midst of civil war  Oedipus Cesare Fantoni the blind old king is dying and his two sons Polynices Mimmo Palmara and Eteocles Sergio Fantoni are confronting for the throne and threatening to destroy each other and the populace.

Ulysses must figure out how to keep himself alive restore Hercules' record get them both out of Omphale's grasp before she tires of amnesiac Hercules and has him killed  and get them both back to Thebes before the kingdom is burned to the ground.

In a breathtaking denouement Hercules brings his chariot into the middle of the thunderous fighting  knocking down assault towers and sweeping cavalry before him to halt the battle.This mythological movie is plenty of adventures  emotions thrills  atmospheric settings and colorful scenarios well photographed by the maestro Mario Bava . The plot this time is drawn from the legends surrounding the royal house of Thebes which are most familiar to audiences through the Theban plays of Sophocles as Aedipus at Colonia and Seven against Thebes by Aeschylus . It is widely considered to be one of the top 10 greatest Peplum films of all time. This great film will surely attract a whole new generation of classic movie fans. And for seasoned cinematic connoseuirs Hercules Unchained 1959 will rekindle an era of film making at its best. This is Steve Reeves' second and last film portrayal of Hercules is in certain ways better than his first . For others who simply enjoy watching timeless pieces with icons such as Steve Reeves. The corpulent Steve Reeves was a hunk man who made lots of roman epic films also called Musclemen movies. Luck's Reeves changed when Italian director Pietro Francisci persuaded him to go overseas to star Hercules and sequel Hercules and queen of Lydia also titled Hercules unchained  that served as the prototypes of all cloakandsandal movies to come and both of them became a surprise US hit smash . Later on he followed with Goliath and the Barbarians The giant of Marathon The Trojan horse The son of Spartacus and The Avenger among them . Steve was an American bouncing who emigrated Italy and created a true starsystem based on pumpedup heroes. He paved the way for other actors to seek their fame and fortune in Italy playing bouncing adventurers . Other stars by the time on this type of movies are Mark Forest Gordon Mitchell Dan Vadis Brad Harris and 'Gordon Scott' who made him more important competence. Nobody nevertheless topped Steve in popularity . Rating  Good  high recommended for Peplum fans".

For certain though with Steve Reeves generally acknowledged as the best of the movie strongmen to portray the Greek demigod all the rest are pretty lame by comparison. But even here the movie takes a quick down hill turn from the original Hercules though it does offer a fun time if you're not in the mood for real Greek mythology. Really how serious can you get about a character who's name sounds like crayon even if he is a colorful sort.In the story Herc and his sidekick Ulysses Gabriele Antonini attempt to mitigate a feud between two brothers who both want to be the king of Thebes. Following a wrestling match with former world champ Primo Carnera Hercules has the misfortune of drinking from the 'waters of forgetfulness'. Falling into a daze he and Ulysses are captured by the soldiers of Queen Omphale Sylvia Lopez who promptly realizes that he's the man of her dreams and maybe even a candidate for the old trophy cave. Omphale plays it up for all the leggy cheesecake glory it's worth giving new meaning to 'over the top'. For his part Ulysses decides to play the dumb and dumber routine until he can snap Herc out of his stupor.Watch closely the second time Hercules takes up Ulysses' challenge to bend the iron torch stand in an attempt to remember who he is. He successfully does so and then unbends it just as easily leaving a slight curve in the stem. However when he returns the stand to it's original location the stand is perfectly straight.Before it's all over brothers Eteocles and Polinices do each other in following a chariot battle and hand to hand combat with swords. Hercules prevails in a battle against weirdly diamond striped tigers reuniting with long suffering 20 days to be exact wife Iole Sylva Koscina. Koscina looking gorgeous manages to maintain her dignity throughout which is saying a lot as every other woman in the film was cast for their eye candy appeal.Don't take my comments as a put down of the movie as I'm trying to give my review the same goofy flavor as the film. That means having some fun with an early offering from a genre that generated nearly two hundred movies following the first two Steve Reeves epics. If you can't do that at least try a glass of some Grecian spring water.".

Falling into a daze he and Ulysses are captured by the soldiers of Queen Omphale Sylvia Lopez who promptly realizes that he's the man of her dreams and maybe even a candidate for the old trophy cave. Omphale plays it up for all the leggy cheesecake glory it's worth giving new meaning to 'over the top'. For his part Ulysses decides to play the dumb and dumber routine until he can snap Herc out of his stupor.Watch closely the second time Hercules takes up Ulysses' challenge to bend the iron torch stand in an attempt to remember who he is. He successfully does so and then unbends it just as easily leaving a slight curve in the stem. However when he returns the stand to it's original location the stand is perfectly straight.Before it's all over brothers Eteocles and Polinices do each other in following a chariot battle and hand to hand combat with swords. Hercules prevails in a battle against weirdly diamond striped tigers reuniting with long suffering 20 days to be exact wife Iole Sylva Koscina. Koscina looking gorgeous manages to maintain her dignity throughout which is saying a lot as every other woman in the film was cast for their eye candy appeal.Don't take my comments as a put down of the movie as I'm trying to give my review the same goofy flavor as the film. That means having some fun with an early offering from a genre that generated nearly two hundred movies following the first two Steve Reeves epics. If you can't do that at least try a glass of some Grecian spring water.";

After the first 30 minutes or so the stuff tired me sheerly through the fact that my mind ceased to remain in the elevated state necessary to appreciate and roll with what the director wanted to achieve visually.

	schema:reviewBody "Hercules Unchained 1959 is an ItalianFrenchSpanish sword  sandal flick in the mold of Kirk Douglas' Ulysses 1954. I always loved Ulysses as a kid and adult which is far better than the boring 1997 TV remake The Odyssey despite its datedness. So if you have a fondness for Ulysses Hercules Unchained is more of the same with a very similar plot i.e. the journeying hero forgets who he is while bewitched by a beautiful babe on some island.Californian muscleman Steve Reeves plays the titular herogod to perfection. Reeves is most known for his Hercules role but interestingly only played the part twice in this film and the first one Hercules 1957. Anyway one good sideeffect of watching Reeves is that it will likely inspire guys to get in shape the same effect as watching Stallone as Rambo.In this film Herc is married to the beautiful Iole Sylva Koscina but he forgets his wife and homeland after drinking of the waters of forgetfulness and falls under the spell of Queen Omphale Sylvia Lopez of the isle Lidia. So Herc is caught between two beauties Sylva and Sylvia.Hercules Unchained can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. It's a fun fantasy adventure with dated effects but it also addresses quite a few mature themes.One theme is the boneheaded predilection of men to sexual gratification and their intrinsic weakness to the spell of feminine beauty. Herc is married to cutie Iole Sylva but it wasn't too hard for him to fall under the power of Omphale Sylvia. And he has the perfect excuse  Aduh I forgot !.Another theme is that feminine power can be used for good or evil productivity or destruction. Sylva uses her feminine charms to catch herself a manly hunk Reeves for a husband and family while Sylvia uses her womanly power to capture literally a neverending succession of studs. Sylva wants a lifelong mate and family whereas Sylvia is a black widow who kills her conquests after she gets bored with them and puts 'em in her trophy case so to speak you'll see what I mean.Look around and you'll easily see both types of women in real life. One girl I knew in high school for example would catch herself a hunk boyfriend and ultimately start cheating on him as soon as she got bored she would then let go of the boyfriend and officially hook up with the guy she was cheating with once she got bored of him she'd start cheating with the next guy ultimately dropping the boyfriend for him ad nauseum. She was notorious just like Omphale Sylvia. She would even break up best friends with here expert feminine powers. The lunkheads could never come to the realization of what she was actually doing because they were too susceptible to her bewitching charms.Interestingly Sylva is beautiful in a cute way whereas Sylvia is beautiful in a sharp leggy and glamorous way. Both are well worth catching the film for if you're a redblooded male.Another theme is that of negative rivalry. The two siblings vie for kingship or control of Thebes. Proud rivalry begats enmity and violence and ultimately mutually assured selfdestruction. Both actors are outstanding fittingly displaying a palpable royal pomp.The sets and costuming are noteworthy. Mario Bava did the cinematography and special effects as well as some directing so the film has that colorful Bava look.BOTTOM LINE If you can overlook certain dated aspects like the editing Hercules Unchained is enjoyable on numerous levels both juvenile and mature. It's the obvious precursor to modern films like Troy. GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "Hercules Unchained the sequel to Steve Reeves' megahit Hercules isn't quite what I remembered it to be. Reeves definitely has the look of Hercules much more so than most of the bodybuilders who followed or imitated him in these movies and he's actually not a bad actor all things considered. Sylva Koscina playing his wife is absolutely breathtaking. She just radiates class is spectacularly beautiful and has a body to die for. Sylvia Lopez as Queen Oomphale is another case altogether. Although she's quite leggy and has a great body and thankfully doesn't mind showing it she's frankly not all that attractive looks to be wearing about 50 pounds of makeup and a gallon of lip gloss and is to be honest not a very good actress. However that doesn't matter much as she has a whole slew of young gorgeous scantily clad servant girls prancing and slinking around which is a pleasant distraction. The action scenes aren't as good as I recalled themI saw it the other day for first time in probably 30 years and was actually quite disappointed. Hercules' fight with a tiger is laughablealmost as phony as Victor Mature's fight with the lion in Samson and Delilahhis clash with Oomphale's guards near the end of the picture is very badly done and the climactic battle between the forces of the two brothers is handled extremely poorly. There were more than enough extras to show a good battle scene but for some reason the filmmakers focus mainly on closeups or twoshots of a few individuals fighting each other which makes no sense at all and the battle consists mostly of a lot of guys running around raising dust and some chariots racing around and that's pretty much it. Time apparently really does play tricks with your memory I recalled this picture as having much more action in it than it really did but other than Reeves' fight with Primo Carnera pretty much nothing happens in the first half of the film and the action that does occur in the second half is mostly perfunctory and as noted not very well done.Still Reeves is impressive to look at and does have a certain presence you can't take your eyes of Sylva Koscina the servant girls are a treat the photography is nice for the most part and some of the sets are impressive. The dubbing is of course atrocious but it always is in these pictures so that's not news. You could do worse than rent this once. It's just really not worth seeing twice.".

	schema:headline " Hercules is back and this time he is unchained!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the second outing for Steve Reeves as Hercules and it is a direct sequel as it picks up pretty much where the last film left off. I saw this film as an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 not sure the episode it was as I do not believe they did the Hercules films in order. This one is like the first Hercules film in that it actually looks very good as far as production value especially considering the time it was released. That being said the film also drags just as the first one did. In fact I find the Hercules films all follow a similar blueprint for the most part at least the ones I have seen. Hercules goes on a grand adventure ends up captured by some beautiful queen and then proceeds back on his adventure. There is always that filler where he is tempted by some beautiful albeit strange lady. The only film that really did not follow this blueprint was the first film but it did feature a segment where some of the men were taken prisoner by the Amazon women Hercules was on the island too but that time is the only time I have seen where it was not him. Steve Reeves looks the part of Hercules but even when it wasn't Reeves they usually did a good job of finding someone with a good build and beard. Though I say Reeves looked the most natural.The story has Hercules and his new bride Iole travel to Hercules hometown with Ulisses in tow. Hercules has to battle the giant Anteo right off the bat and this is probably one of the few highlights of the film. After the battle he ends up finding out that his hometown is about to go to war due to two brothers feuding for the power of the throne. Hercules does his best to try and bring peace but unfortunately he drinks some water that is enchanted and pretty much gives him amnesia. He and Ulisses are then captured and brought to a kingdom where a beautiful but weird looking queen seduces Hercules and convinces him that he is king and she is his queen. Meanwhile tensions build between the two brothers as both think Hercules is working for the other! This made for an all right episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The problem with them doing this one and the first Hercules is the time constraint on the show. Makes the films seem very messed up as one can just see that there are huge portions of the film that were cut out. Not as bad as the first Hercules film where it was like they only did highlights from each plot point. This one still is a bit of a mess during the ending scenes as they seemed to focus mainly on Hercules exploits on the island of the sex craving queen. Still it was rather funny though the fact all these Hercules films kind of play out the same way makes doing four of them a bit excessive.So the movie is not too terribly bad but not good in any way either. I just find this Hercules films of the older days to be a bit slow moving as it is mainly set up and then a brief burst of action here and there. At least they give Hercules his incredible strength though as they do a good job making him look inhumanely strong. Plenty of pretty girls to look at for the guys and plenty of sweaty dudes for the girls almost a film for everyone! Just too much talking and not enough battling for my tastes though.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film deserves at least some credit for having pretty good color effects. This was again in the early days of color. The acting and dialogue aren't even that bad. I will say that it's still a bad movie and you shouldn't recommend it. It's mostly because the plot is hard to follow. Then again I'm not sure if it's that the plot itself is hard to follow it's just that you don't really care. Most of us are probably familiar with Greek mythology. They reference the names a lot but there isn't enough of a story to really care.The final battle scene isn't bad but what weighs this film down is the hokey acting. I feel bad for not knowing everyone's names. I mean it's not a memorable movie but you'd think I'd least know the names of the figures from classical Mythology. It just doesn't do it any justice. The weirdest part is probably when this one guy randomly goes nuts on the bed. I think this may be the longest movie ever featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I've heard the running time be 105 or 107 or just 96 minutes. I only saw 75 minutes on the version but I'm too lazy to go and watch the whole full version. I just think that version is enough and besides it's nothing to write home about. 12".

However when he gets to Thebes he discovers that things have changed for the worse as two brothers Polinices Mimmo Palmara and Eteocles Sergio Fantoni are locked in a bitter dispute over who will be the new king and war is about to break out between them. To make matters worse while trying to mediate a solution Hercules is captured and beguiled by the evil queen of Lydia named Onfale Sylvia Lopez which only exasperates the situation. Now as far as the overall merits of this film are concerned let me just say that a person may have to make some allowances in order to fully appreciate it. First it was initially filmed in Italian and dubbed in English which sometimes doesn't capture the equivalent emotion of the event. Also the fact that it is over 60 years old doesn't allow for any modern special effects which would have helped this film immensely. But the fact that it is in color should count for something and viewers of this time will certainly understand this. Be that as it may although the story is somewhat entertaining it doesn't quite measure up to the previous film and because of that I rate it just a notch below it. Average.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few movies are so controversial that the Movie industry does their best to kill them off see Terry Gilliams' Brazil. Such was the case with The Devils First to clear a few things up...this did NOT come from a play nor was it a novel. It is based on Aldous Huxley's painstakingly researched religious history of the famous Loudun exorcisms during the time of Richelieu. The book may be out of print but my wife found a copy published in 1952 by Chatto  Windus. There are some more recent publications but this one is lovely with an engraving of Bishop Urban Grandierthe main character dating back to 1627. Huxley actually includes original letters which still exist written by the participants of this travesty. Much of the dialogue of the film is directly from Huxley. The vision however is uniquely Russell's. When this movie was originally released it was given an X rating not due to sex or even violence although there is some of each. The plain fact is that the film in its original form is simply overpowering. The Movie Review board thought so! I was fortunate enough to see the original uncut version rated X at the local arthouse upon its release. This film is a shortened version. While still worthwhile this film absolutely SCREAMS for a Criterion Collection restoration to its original brilliant form.".

This film was met with great controversy and opposition due to its contents and depictions of blasphemy.

I was house sitting for a friend who's house was in the boonies in Anchorage and it was a dark  snowy night. I watched this movie totally engrossed  unable to turn away  kinda like a train wreck! I slept with the light on that night. I went out  got the out of print book at the library. The book by Huxley is totally different although the movie was faithful to most of the historical aspects of the story. The book is a beautiful testament of faith. You really should try to get a copy if the film piqued your interest in this slice of history. There is also an opera that is based on this story as well as a John Whiting play and all of this is based on historical facts. Obviously I have done some research since seeing the movie. That's how much it affected me.The story is one of politics versus spiritual redemption desire versus despair. The acting is wonderful  especially Oliver Reed. To me this is his best performance ever. In addition it's a Ken Russell film so the presentation is wild to say the least. But for this story it works. Derek Jarman's sets also lend a modernretro kind of feel to the movie. Watch this one late at night when you are all alone. It's a one of a kind that I have never seen duplicated since. Not even the Exorcist has the same kind of horrific darkness as this movie if you watch the credits of the Exorcist they use some music from the Penderecki opera The Devils of Loudun.SPOILER BEYOND HERE This movie is not for everyone. If you get the imported copy from England there is the restored Rape of Christ scene that some will find not only horrific but absolutely revolting. This movie is not for everyone  but the same can be said of any movie really. I'd prefer to watch this rather than Dumb and Dumbmer. I recommend this movie to those with an open mind  a taste for the unusual. It is a movie FAR ahead of its time  in fact Warner Brothers STILL will not release the restored copy  that's how controversial it is. A controversial movies doesn't always equate with a great movie  but this movie is singular in its achievement.".

For some it's a horrific and unwatchable display of savagery while for others it's an intense yet rewarding ride into a city beseiged with madness. It is Ken Russell's most tolerable film to sit through because it is always interesting and contains many memorables scenes and images but at the same time it is highly controversial and challenging often making you want to turn away from the screen.The story is of a highly influential priest in the French city of Loudon. He is a magnetic man with strong opinions and pride lusted after by many women including a disfigured nun. The authorities decide that he is a risk to their plans and have him falsely accused of various disgusting sexual crimes for which he is burned at the stake.There are some extraordinary moments in this film. The burning at the end is the most unforgettable of all with Oliver Reed literally blackening and bubbling in front of your very eyes as he burns away. The scenes involving Vanessa Redgrave as the amorous nun are equally haunting and the torture scenes with Michael Gothard as an exorcist trying to force a confession out of Reed are truly painful to watch. This film is certainly not for all tastes but if you can bear the more gruesome moments then you will find it fascinating viewing and no matter how hard you try you won't be able to ignore its intensity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can never understand why The Devils which was such a major film and caused such controversy never became a cult classic being shown every other week on cable TV.  This film totally annihilates all the trashy straighttovideo horror films.  Based on true events in 17th century France this film is one of the most horrifying tales of man's intolerance religious and sexual.The tale begins with an outbreak of the plague which the folk of the middle ages with typical misunderstanding of the real cause rat fleas believed that someone was to blame. Who more convenient a scapegoat than Father Grandier played by the notorious Oliver Reed an actor who ended his rambunctious life by dropping dead in a bar.  The sexual appeal of Fr. Grandier drives the supposedly celibate clergy into a frenzy of jealousy. A group of nuns led by a noblewoman who has been forced into the convent due to her physical deformity and therefore lack of marriageable options joins in the hysteria which is not satisfied until Fr. Grandier is burned at the stake.Although set in France in the middle ages a lot of the hysteria can be seen today in our more enlightened times. Just witness the periodic witch hunts in the United States such as the furore over the alleged Satanic cults running day care centers not to mention the reds under the beds hysteria of the 50's.This was one of Ken Russell's most controversial films and definitely very 70's in its style after all we had Mick Jagger and Twiggy perfectly cast as decadent French nobility and it has taken 20 years to see how right on the mark he was.Although Russell was the hottest thing in cinema for a while he faded like a discarded fashion as every wannabe copied his style but without being able to understand what is was that set Ken Russell apart.  Unfortunately Russell did not help his reputation by becoming more and more the icon of bad taste.  Eventually he became a parody and the fickle who had formally worshipped his genius could not disassociate themselves quickly enough.Like Orson Welles Ken Russell's brilliance will not be realized until a new generation discovers his work.  I recommend The Devils along with The Music Lovers as his best work.".

	schema:reviewBody "When reading the following review please keep in mind that I saw this film in slightly unorthodox circumstances. Without meaning to sound smug the screening I attended took place at my University was chaired by Ken Russell and was of a restored version of The Devils. The missing footage found by the critic Mark Kermode had been spliced back in and the film restored to the director's vision as close as possible. Given that I've never seen the original edit released to cinemas back in the 1970s and that this was only the second time this version had been screened I think its fair to estimate that the film I'm reviewing will be significantly different to the one that is widely available so please keep that in mind.Anyway...starting with a bizarre sequence involving an androgynous foppish King prancing around a theatre stage done up like an Egyptian Queen Ken Russell's The Devils is a film that over the course of its subsequent hour and forty minutes is liable to offend as many people as it will entertain. The extravagance of the Royal French Court filled with laughing nobles and brown nosing politicians resplendent in the very finest dark ages fashion is soon juxtaposed when the film turns a stark gaze on a rotting countryside filled with pestilence and disease. Maggot infested corpses line the road and the attention is quickly turned on the town of Loudun where Priest Father Grandier battles not only the plague but the political schemers who want to demolish the walls. Grandier is such a charismatic public figure however that the politicians are powerless until they elaborate a plan to have him tarnished with accusations of blasphemy.Central to this conspiracy is a chapter of Nuns living near by of whom the hunched Sister Jeanne proves instrumental. Scared of her own sexual desires the woman is driven mad by her very human nature and soon the inquisition are knocking on her door and every woman in the building is being tortured and brain washed in the name of Christianity. The evils of religious fanaticism are plain to see with Michael Gothard's scene stealing extremist Father Barre being the most disgusting example of a Priest you are ever likely to see on film. He batters and humiliates women for the sake of getting his own way and is so inflexible that he will send people to their deaths rather than admit his own fallibility. Controversial scenes abound as Barre's determination brings about nothing but misery with the brainwashed nuns stripping off and indulging in a mass orgy culminating in perhaps the most offensive scene when a statue of Christ is pulled down from the chapel walls and used by the nuns as a sexual play thing.While it may depict blasphemy though the film itself is not blasphemous and believe it or not actually celebrates Christianity. It does so through the figure of Grandier Oliver Reed at his very best a man whose faith in God is so strong that he will not allow the misled elders of the Church deviate him from his path. He isn't a perfect man and has a weakness for the fairer sex but he will not bow down to pressure or allow physical pain to weaken his love of God he is a fine depiction of a Priest of which the Church can be proud.However religious sermonising isn't the chief attraction because let's face it the reason most of us would want to see this movie is because it's controversial. With the aforementioned cavorting on the cross and nun orgies it's not hard to see why and the Inquisition don't exactly come off particularly well either as they stride around the countryside bullying and torturing and ultimately teaching their flock to hate not to love. Furthermore The Devils is possessed pun very much intended by a ceaseless madcap energy that is easy to get swept up in and over the course of the film you will witness flagellation nun on nun lesbian action deranged inquisitors chanting confess as they beat people with hammers and perhaps most bizarrely of all Oliver Reed duelling with a man using a stuffed crocodile in place of a sword.Yes it is a bit uneasy to watch sometimes. Yes at times it does resemble little more than visual extremity taken to the limit and no its not likely to find it's way into the Pope's DVD collection any time soon. The underlying message is ultimately a pure one though and it has the added benefit of being one of the most insane films you're ever likely to see as well as making you glad you don't live in the middle ages. If you ever get a chance to see the restored version I couldn't recommend it higher.".

He batters and humiliates women for the sake of getting his own way and is so inflexible that he will send people to their deaths rather than admit his own fallibility. Controversial scenes abound as Barre's determination brings about nothing but misery with the brainwashed nuns stripping off and indulging in a mass orgy culminating in perhaps the most offensive scene when a statue of Christ is pulled down from the chapel walls and used by the nuns as a sexual play thing.While it may depict blasphemy though the film itself is not blasphemous and believe it or not actually celebrates Christianity. It does so through the figure of Grandier Oliver Reed at his very best a man whose faith in God is so strong that he will not allow the misled elders of the Church deviate him from his path. He isn't a perfect man and has a weakness for the fairer sex but he will not bow down to pressure or allow physical pain to weaken his love of God he is a fine depiction of a Priest of which the Church can be proud.However religious sermonising isn't the chief attraction because let's face it the reason most of us would want to see this movie is because it's controversial. With the aforementioned cavorting on the cross and nun orgies it's not hard to see why and the Inquisition don't exactly come off particularly well either as they stride around the countryside bullying and torturing and ultimately teaching their flock to hate not to love. Furthermore The Devils is possessed pun very much intended by a ceaseless madcap energy that is easy to get swept up in and over the course of the film you will witness flagellation nun on nun lesbian action deranged inquisitors chanting confess as they beat people with hammers and perhaps most bizarrely of all Oliver Reed duelling with a man using a stuffed crocodile in place of a sword.Yes it is a bit uneasy to watch sometimes. Yes at times it does resemble little more than visual extremity taken to the limit and no its not likely to find it's way into the Pope's DVD collection any time soon. The underlying message is ultimately a pure one though and it has the added benefit of being one of the most insane films you're ever likely to see as well as making you glad you don't live in the middle ages. If you ever get a chance to see the restored version I couldn't recommend it higher.";

I wish I could say I haven't watched stories which seemed hauntingly similar to Loudon's played out on the news many times.But beyond the 'moral' as I see it is the truly very creepy feel to the whole film. The scene in which an entire convent of naked nuns are being exorcised by an inquisitor of the 'demons' that are forcing them into a wild orgy of sex is genuinely memorable as one of film's most surreal scenes. Amazingly these events happen in a quite understandable sequence for logical if nightmarish reasons under Russell's direction. These people really seemed from a whole different world as if they weren't human but they obviously were alltoo human and the sudden realization that this might actually be closer to the heritage of my own culture than what I was taught REALLY creeped me out.

Russell never met a line he couldn't bend into a circle and a light bulb he didn't explode into a star burst supernova. Where most directors are ascetic Russell is a glutton. Where many whisper their convictions with hushed words Russell screams through a megaphone. This I adore about him.And The Devils is drum roll please his masterpiece! Yes this film is savage. It is shocking. It is perverse and violent and all of that. But it is also one of the greatest films ever made. Very similar to The Crucible and if you haven't read that stop what you're doing and read it instead of this.A priest brilliantly played by Oliver Reed in rennaisance era France is caught in a political squeeze play and becomes the subject of a literal witch hunt. He is put on trial for being a demon and a group of nuns are bullied by a crazy exorcist into claiming themselves possessed. The whole thing plays out with the maximum amount of grotesqueness imaginable. Even if one is used to Russell's films what is shown here could prove unwatchable for some.We get nuns ripping their clothes off and running around naked pretending to be possessed people burned at the stake forced vomiting nuns copulating with Jesus just a hallucination though physical torture of many different varieties. It's very in your face. However the subject is topical obviously and it really deserves to be seen by more people.Another great reason to see this movie is Vanessa Redgrave who plays a hunchbacked mother superior. A very conflicted character attracted to Oliver Reed. I've never liked Vanessa Redgrave much but she is magnificent in this movie. And her performance is one of the creepiest I have ever seen rivalling Paul Smith's sweating smiling sinister jailguard in Midnight Express.However my selfish view remains I hope this movie never ever gets released on DVD that way it will stay unknown and I and the rest of the smart people on earth will get to enjoy it as our treasure and ours alone. It will not spread to the masses and be diluted and trod upon and destroyed. This film is art. It is not junk put out by your local movie studio. This is a film of passion and meaning and sweat and blood. If you are reading this and you have no idea what I am talking about stop reading and go away and never watch this film. Ever! You will merely dilute it with your stupid realityTV watching fingers.Thank you.Also some of Ken Russell's other great beautiful films include Savage Messiah Altered States The Music Lovers Women in Love and Mahler.".

The simplefact that many of Ken Russell's films are hated makes me love them allthemore. This is arguably his best film and his only political one. As a periodpiece this film is stylized but looks very convincing and the cinematography and setdesigns by Derek Jarman another genius of film are stellar. Consider why films like this one aren't made often and you have part of the answer as to why this film is still so shocking. Many people dislike his films because of what he reveals about all of us but that's toobad. People didn't like what Auschwitz said about humanity but there it is. Apparently Warner Brothers has finallydecided to release this film as a director'scut in 2006 or 2007. It is beingreported that all footage removed by the BBFC and American censors mainly Warners in 1971 will be reinstated in an unratedcut approved by the director. It may have been taken from the Aldous Huxley book and the 1960s play by John Whiting but it is Ken Russell's film.Alsoincluded will be the BBCdocumentary by Mark Kermode Hell on Earth about the makingof the film and the firestorm it created. The renegade DVD by Angelfire is acceptable and will have to tideusover until then. It has the aforementioned Kermode documentary and a widescreentransfer 1.851 the wrong aspectratio the film was Panavision at 2.351 of the film with some of the deletedscenes like the Rape of Christ reinstated. It is a flawedversion but adequate and is relativelycheap. This was a film that Warners hated after the executives saw the finalcut. The Warner press bookads even state it was a hardsell with posters marketing the film as horrorit is but a politicalone. Some of the posters warned potentialaudiences that it was a film most people won't like! In a film that bombards the viewer with violence decay plague and death it isn't surprising that people miss some of the film's thematicpoints it has a lot to say the threats to individualrights and liberties and spiritualliberty are often playedout in the same ways in different timesandplaces. You can see this in the parallels madebetween Oliver Reed's character Father Grandier and that of the acceptedChristology in 1600sFrance represented by the characters of Father Mignon Sister Jeanne and Cardinal Richelieuan unholytrilogy?. Is there muchdifference in why Grandier is degraded similarly to Christ? Russell a Catholicgoesfurther is there anydifference between the politicalscapegoating of Urbain Grandier and Jesus? The answer should be obvious and Richelieu's theocraticyearnings for power can only be seen as a threat to liberty just as they are now in the Middle East and the United States. Even from that remoteyear of 1971 Russell could be saying that these political and spiritualstruggles are oneandthesame and that they are eternal. This is not an exploitationfilm but it is as dark and horrific as any classic horror film. What is mostterrible is that it is true. Keepinmind not one image is in this film bymistake as Russell places an image in a film for a specificmeaning and purpose. The film is a warning to be vigilant against the aims of power and shedslight on why Christ was crucified.The images of people beingtortured vomiting actinghystericallythey are not there to merely shock but as a warning about socialhysterics of allsorts. Repression can leadto perversion states Russell resoundingly. Set specifically in 17th Century France after the eight Hugenot Wars The Devils should be read as a cautionarytale of how people can willingly giveup their liberties in uncertain times notunlike our own. The religiouswars still rage and will continue to. With the world finally being able see what director Ken Russell intended we might see this film being veryinfluential in yearstocome. Italianfilmmakers were inspiredthey created the nunsploitationgenre fromit! Good lapsedCatholics all. This is what the Grand Guignol was basedon. From the 1600stonow the threats are the same.

All the films involving naughty nuns mostly European productions are worth watching if you're a cultfan but Russell's film easily remains the most remarkable one. The Devils is quite a brutal film often featuring very shocking and repulsive images. Highlight of this if you can call it that is a violent act of exorcism performed on a deformed nun played by an impressive Vanessa Redgrave. The premise of this film was based on a bestselling novel and actually is a little overwrought. The Devils demands total attention perhaps the unusual topics make it only accessible to true cinemabuffs and fans of unpleasant historical epics. It handles about a convent of sexually frustrated nuns and their desires towards the handsome young priest Graindier Oliver Reed. Mother Superior doesn't manage to win the heart of Graidier and seeks revenge when he falls in love with another girl. She's offered the chance for this when Cardinal Richelieu himself wants to eliminate Graindier for obtaining too much power and influence in rural France. There are some boring parts but these are widely made up by some ultraimpressive sequences like the scene in which Mother Superior has a vision of Christ's crucifixion blend with her own sexual fantasies about Father Graindier.The flawless acting performances by Oliver Reed and Vanessa bring this film to a higher dimension. Especially Reed is terrific. I already thought highly of this charismatic actor but after seeing the Devils he's truly immortal. Still the very best aspect about this production is the breathtaking setdesign by Derek Jarman. A must see ladies and gentlemen!".

We the fans have to settle with substandard legit releases such as Angel Video's version it's better than nothing at least!. THE DEVILS is more than anything a political drama. It is scandalous because the main character's are nuns priests and magistrates doing lees than heavily acts. You have to consider that this was based on true events. Sure Russel might've exaggerated here and there but from what I can gather the events are pretty much accurate. This movie should be on IMDb's top 250. So much filth is located in that list that if it were on paper I'd already burn it.Make no mistake THE DEVILS is a masterpiece of film making and has lost NONE of it's punch in over 30 years. A must for anyone who considers him or herself a serious movie fan.".

	onyx:emotionText "With all the trash that lingers out there on DVD it angers me even more that the pathetic self righteous zealots at Warner Bros. have not released Ken Russel's THE DEVILS on DVD. We the fans have to settle with substandard legit releases such as Angel Video's version it's better than nothing at least!. THE DEVILS is more than anything a political drama. It is scandalous because the main character's are nuns priests and magistrates doing lees than heavily acts. You have to consider that this was based on true events. Sure Russel might've exaggerated here and there but from what I can gather the events are pretty much accurate. This movie should be on IMDb's top 250. So much filth is located in that list that if it were on paper I'd already burn it.Make no mistake THE DEVILS is a masterpiece of film making and has lost NONE of it's punch in over 30 years. A must for anyone who considers him or herself a serious movie fan.";

Would love to get a DVD of the file... any help would be appreciated. Puts a realistic perspective of what man made organized religion is all about. Just an earlier version of the fanaticism we see today in Islam. Vanessa Redgrave was spectacular as a nun and the horror the character survived could knock you out of your seat. Baby watches father burn at the stake and the Jesuits plot their next moves. The technology available for torture and war was less sophisticated than today but probably more effectiveat least as seen from today. Amazing I can recall the images so clearly after 36 years.".

	schema:headline " Excellent but flawed British film";
	schema:reviewBody "British director Ken Russell's adaption of Aldous Huxley's book The Devils of Loudun is one of the most origional controversial and daring films ever made. The film takes place in 17thcentury France and centres on the hypocritical and licentious behaviour of debauched priest Father Urbain Grandier brilliantly played by Oliver Reed. A second plot strand involves the humpbacked nunn Sister Jeanne played by Vanessa Redgrave who along with her fellow nuns is obsessed with Grandier. When the nuns become seemingly possessed disgruntled representatives of the Catholic Church and corrupt officials move in and seize their opportunity to get rid of Grandier.The film gets off to an excellent start gradually building up the tension and highlighting the flaws within the Catholic religion. However the middle section involving the possession of the nuns is far too theatrical and overthetop and the action becomes weighed down by the overbearing performance of Michael Gothard as Father Barre and Derek Jarman's lurid sets. The final section of the film however is mightily impressive and wellscripted and benefits hugely from Oliver Reed's committed performance.While Vanessa Redgrave impresses in the role of Sister Jeanne this is Oliver Reed's film and a performance which proves he was a great actor and not just a great hellraiser. This film illustrates that he is easily the equal of his contemporaries including Caine Connery Harris and Finney.While director Ken Russell's films can range from the very good to the absolutely awful The Devils is without doubt his best. This is perfect material for Russell to work with and the ideal outlet for his unique vision. Russell was part of the new breed of controversial directors who emerged in the late 1960s and 1970s who courted controversy with images of sex nudity violence and shocking images. The Devils is no exception and while it will by no means be to everyone's taste it should be commended for its daring take on the hypocritical side to religion and for helping to pave new ground in cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't consider myself to be a particularly religious person so the controversial antiprotestant stance didn't really faze me although I can easily understand if others are offended by this film. My main issues with this film extend to the followingThis is quite a chaotic picture and it seemed to me that Russell was more bothered about causing controversy and shocking his audience at the expense of telling a potentially interesting true story. I must admit some of the early scenes were quite disturbing but for the first hour it was just overkill as the film went from one over the top sequence to another. We're then treated to a lot of incomprehensible dialogue ridiculous setpieces over the top acting. Lots of things happened in the first hour that seemed to do nothing to advance the story. Now I'm not the sort of person to pan a film just because it's controversial A Clockwork Orange is a great film which also caused a lot of controversy in its day but the thing that harms this film so much is that it's so boring. No matter how much I tried I just could not get involved in the story  the shock factor is OK at first but when there's nothing of substance to back it up it grows repetitive and starts to feel like a bit of a gimmick.Russell does start to show some focus in the final 30 minutes or so but even in these final 30 minutes we're treated to some rather formulaic plot twists that did nothing to improve my opinion of the film as a whole.Looking at the acting then again I'll use the words 'over the top'. Redgrave spends the whole time with her head cocked to the left and either speaks at about 3 decibels or shouts at about 300 decibels. Reed fared slightly better although there were many occasions when he seemed to speak then shout when delivering his lines. The worst offender was Michael Gothard as Father Barre whose acting was embarrassingly bad.This is a shocking film but there is one thing I can think of that is more shocking than this film and that is..... it's IMDb rating. 7.8 for this monstrosity is taking the proverbial. I found it boring ridiculous and quite empty if I'm honest. A truly awful film that I have no desire to ever watch again.".

The script was apparently based upon a play by John Whiting  the novel 'The Devils of Loudon' by Aldous Huxley  claims to be based on truth. To be honest I am not a religious person  I openly  freely admit I haven't even read the bible so I cannot express any personal opinion about how The Devils relates to anything in either a good or bad way in the bible or religion in general. What I can express an opinion about though is whether The Devils is a good film or not  I firmly believe it is for those with loose enough sensibilities it's a powerful film that maybe has some truth behind it it paints a somewhat unflattering picture of the Church  the abuse of the power it had during the 17th Century over God fearing people a power which it brutally exploited to it's own ends according to The Devils. From torture to false confessions to sexual deviancy The Devils isn't dull that's for sure whether or not you will enjoy it depends on your tolerance levels for such material which deliberately mixes sex religion  violence in a provocative way. I think it's a good film with strong character's a good solid plot which you have to concentrate on to follow  some poetic dialogue. It's a bit slow in places  some of it is a little overthetop but that adds to the entertainment value.Director Russell does a great job  The Devils looks simply sumptuous with brilliant sets including the white tiled Loudun which gives the film a clean sort of feel  an unusual look. The costumes are detailed as is the period setting in general. The film oozes style  visual flair with some beautiful yet at the same time disturbing scenes featuring naked Nun's torture religious fanaticism  sex set against the impressively realised backdrop of 17th Century France. The Devils has become controversial because of it's mix of sex violence  religion  while there are a few graphic scenes this probably shocked more back in 1971 than does in 2007. There is a fair amount of nudity but only one tame sex scene while most of the female cast get their clothes off there is no male nudity there are a couple of off screen enemas there's a couple of torture scenes involving someones legs being broken  a pin stuck through someones tongue there is implied masturbation someone is agonisingly burned at the stake victims of the plague are seen dumped into huge pits that contains 100's of bodies  a scenes when a sick woman has wasp's in jars attached to her body as a 'cure'. I personally didn't think it was quite as shocking as it's generally made out to be.Technically the film is top notch with fine cinematography high production values  good music. Set in France The Devils was actually shot at Pinewood Studios here in England. The acting is very strong here with a career best from Oliver Reed he certainly though it was his best performance.The Devils has a big reputation to live up  while I think it can't quite manage it it's still a challenging film which deals with issues many may not agree with or want to watch. I liked it for what it is but then I'm not religious in any way so it didn't offend me in the way it might other's. A strong film  worth watching for those with the stomach.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1971 Ken Russell achieved what must be the most scathing attack against Religious and Sexual repression ever put to celluloid. Treating religion as a purely political rather than a moral or ethical force he created a film that has more than stood the test of time. Russell shocked the popular historical fairytale view of the time out of it's bare faced complacency and gave it a more contemporary relevance. A hugely controversial film 'The Devils' went from director to Censor and back again several times before a mutually agreeable final cut was approved. The head of the British Censors who passed the film resigned shortly after release leaving his successor to deal with the backlash. Certain right wing Christian morons and guardians of public decencynamely Mary Whitehouse may she burn in the abysmal fires for eternity with her Festival of Light sheep wanted to completely ban the movie outright. They did not succeed. As for the cast well Oliver Reed gives the performance of his life as the Priest Urbain Grandier who submits to his own earthly desires. He seeks to find a path to God through the love of a woman. His objections to compulsory celibacy in the Church eventually get the better of him and he pays the ultimate price. Vanessa Redgrave is superb as the deformed sexually frustrated Mother Superior who has designs on Grandier. She is used by those in what authority there isto implicate an innocent man in a chaotic trial of Heresy Witchcraft and Demonic association. The direction cinematography set design costumes Script and score are all excellent. There is no way a mainstream company would release a film like this in movie theaters today. This has now been deleted from Warner Brothers VHS catalog having last been released in a widescreen maverick directors edition in 1998. No plans for a DVD edition exist at present but I live in hope for such a release soon. This film should not be buried and forgotten. It displays the work of a director at the height of his creative ambitions and is a scathing document of a wholly absurd piece of European history.".

My answer would be yes.Sure JeanClaude Van Damme isn't here Donald Gibb serves as the link between the two movies but Daniel Bernhardt as petty thief Alex Cardo who discovers the meaning of honor makes for a likable charismatic lead who also bears somewhat of a resemblance with JeanClaude.Also interesting is the narration told in flashback by Alex Cardo's trainer Master Sun played by James Hong to a throng of young disciples. In these moments in particular Bloodsport II shows that it is completely aware of what kind of movie it is that it does not aspire to be anything more and even pokes fun at itself see the excellent ending for example.In short Bloodsport II The Next Kumite is not as awesome as it's predecessor but it does what it aspires to do it gets the job done. The cinematography isn't as good here as the first time making the fights less impressive but they're good enough. The story and the fact that the movie changes location from Hong Kong to Thailand contribute to not make it a rehash of the original. The actors from Daniel Bernhardt to Donald Gibb passing by James Hong and Pat Morita are just right.

It's not really a sequel to Bloodsport and by no means does it come close to matching it however it's highly enjoyable with an excellent lead performance by Dainel Bernhardt. However i found the main villain kinda weak and he is no Bolo Yeung that's for sure however he looked big and was pretty menacing at times. The story is interesting but the last fight sucked! and was way too short. The Directing is good. Alan Mehrez does a fairly good job here with some neat shots here and there and some cool shots during the fighting scenes he did a decent job overall. The Acting is actually excellent. Dainel Bernhardt is AWESOME here! he was great in the acting department! in fact he reminds me of Van Damme in a lot of ways! he is also awesome in martial arts! however the chemistry between him and Lori Lynn Dickerson was off! but overall his performance was awesome! Bernhardt Rules!. James Hong is fabulous here as Alex's Mentor and trainer! and was really likable he rocked!. Donald Gibb is awesome here as Ray once again and he cracked me up. however he has a lot less to do this time. Lori Lynn Dickerson is terrible as the love interest and had no chemistry with Dainel what so ever!. Pat Morita is great here with what he has to do. Ong Soo Han is very good as the main villain however his fighting skills did not impress me and he just seemed like a big strong military guard! that being said he did kick a lot of ass and looked intense!. Ron Hall and Nicholas Hill are both very likable. Overall i highly recommend this give it a shot! just don't expect the greatness of Bloodsport. 12 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some movies that you actually are supposed to hate. Kind of like a dish that isn't good for you or doing a small bit of gambling you know you aren't supposed to enjoy it because it's wrong. But hey we all have vices right? Bloodsport 2 is one of those movies for me.The premise of the movie is pretty simple. An arrogant thief named Alex Cardo played by Daniel Bernhardt gets caught by the police after being setup by his partner. It turns out that Cardo is already a good martial artist but when he goes to jail he meets a person with even stronger kung fu named Sun James Hong. The rest is pretty straight forward from there. A reformed criminal seeks redemption a student learns the Ultimate Technique from his master. Said reformed jailbirdstudent enters to the Ultimate Death Match tournament to honor his master and gain back his honor. Along the way we get a lot of new faces and some old ones as well if you've seen the first movie a ton of fights some big bad evil former student and some pathetic facsimile of a romance happen.Probably the strongest point of this film is the fight choreography and action sequences. I actually believe that when they were brainstorming this film they decided to make a tournament fighter featuring different styles of martial arts. But they needed something to try and ensure some modicum of notoriety so they tied it into the languishing franchise of Bloodsport thanks for Dux getting tacitly outed as a fraud picked up the services of Pat Murita and called it good.But back to the point you see a ton of different styles in this film and nearly all the fights are very well done. Bernhardt does a reasonable job as a Van Dammeclone despite being his first film and special mention go to Ron Hall and Ong Soo Han for their roles in this film as well. Gibb reprises his role as Ray Jackson as well but it's more for comedic effect. That said he does a fine job hamming it up.Otherwise there isn't anything wrong with the technical aspects of production. The story has a ton of clichs some of the dialogue is downright awful You are a true warrior Alex is one of the single most out of place lines of all time. It's the Bloodrayne sex scene of dialogue but without Loken's umm... assets. The romance subplot is outright horrible and seemed like it was forced in as an afterthought for the purposes of trying to mirror the success of the original film as much as possible. The musical score isn't anything fantastic but they at least made the pieces fit as best as possible and a few of the tunes are catchy. Some of the segments of the film are legitimately funny as intended and provide a welcome relief from the boring secondary plot elements.On the whole there isn't much to the film other than the fight sequences. It does take some time to get to what we all want to see. It's worth the wait or just the use of the fast forward feature on your DVD or other methods of delivery. If you enjoyed the first film are a fan of tournament fighting movies or are a fan of Bernhardt or Donald Gibb you'll enjoy it. Otherwise you might be best passing on this.".

Daniel Bernhardt was not a bad replacement for Van Damme but the problem is that he is constantly copying him! Especially in face expressions! But OK we are not here to compare these two guys yes I know Van Damme is a real life champion and fighter while Daniel is a model but OK his fighting style and skills are good he is good. Now for the main stuff this Kumite tournament was good! I like the fights there is some karate kung fu judo Brazilian jujitsu tae kwon do... fine choreography... other things that are good are special appearances by Pat Morita and James Hong... the leading lady Lori Lynn Dickerson very lovely and to mention Philip Tan well at least we have Donald Gibb again as Ray Tiny as a main guard on kumite and promoter still in his own comic relief... but he was used to look more like the first film. The story is rather different that from the first film it is a classic low budget marital art movie. Alex Cardo Bernhardt get imprisoned after trying to steal a valuable sword from Pat Morita. During his time in prison he learned so called Iron Fist from master Sun James Hong. And after that he enters the Kumite tournament where he faces a fighter former prison guard Demon here played by Ong Soo Han the guy's cube hair and acting makes his character look laughable trying to be new Bolo Yeung aka Chong Li... but he still looks tough...

You have to have an invitation to get in the competition and you have to earn it.I won't tell anymore because i think i have told pretty much about the movie right now.The bad thing about the movie is that it's so boring in the beginning and not interesting at all. The good thing is the scenes with hitting and punching. There's a lot of fighters in the competition. Alex meets many friends there.

This movie also had something no other tournament movie ever had and that was the fact that nothing interfered with the final battle. In most movies like this true fans are often let down when the movie has gone well and the director decides to confict some other event in the movie with the final battle. Trust me many great tournament movies have often been ruined by such stupid ideas.  But thank god that the director of this movie had more sense than many others who would have ruined this masterpiece.  I mean the final battle in this film went as smooth as a Rocky fight!! So all in all I give this a 1010 and believe me it definitely earned every point!!!Be sure to keep your eyes open for my next DANIEL MANIA comment of the day!!!!Film Suggestions for DANIEL MANIA! tournament moviesBloodsport The Quest The Quick and the Dead Rocky Rocky II Rocky III Rocky IV Enter the Dragon 8 Mile Mortal Kombat Bloodsport 3 Game of Death Grappler Baki.".

Yes the movie does recycle many of the show's jokes but it does so in new yet relevant contexts that keep the material funny if you are familiar with the South Park world. If you aren't familiar with that world as I wasn't before seeing the movie the gags are simultaneously accessible yet often subtle.Subtle? Yes many of the gags are. Indeed one of the pleasures of owning a copy of the movie is having the ability to review the movie in slomo if necessary and discover throwaway sight gags that one has missed in the delirium of watching this anarchic satire the first time through.  And if you have the DVD you can add subtitles to catch many of the songs' often elusive lyrics.Then there's the music. What is it about movie musicals that attracts great satiric minds? Not since Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow has a work of art so subversively exploited the conventions of the movie musical as South Park. From the droll opening strains of Mountain Town to the Disneyesque Up There to the Les Miserables spoof La Resistance South Park simultaneously sends up the genre while paying homage to it and still finds room to use the songs to score delicious points against its myriad targets.One last thing this movie is not cynical. Beneath the scatological humor the cartoon violence the scathing portrayals of Wynona Ryder et al and the backdrop of adult xenophobia sexual repression and political opportunism is a sensibility that exalts childhood as an island of honesty and idealism if also of idlike impulse and frequent selfishness.

	schema:reviewBody "When you have the reputation that Parker and Stone do it is hard to get rid of the sterotypes that have been drawn around you.  You are forever stuck in the mold that has been bestowed upon you.  But perhaps sometimes when stigmas of that nature are forever embedded with your name and reputation it actually gives them more leeway to make a statement that is political in nature.  As long as they disguise that statements with all that made them popular in the first place they can get away with it.  So now if I said that beyond the nonstop vulgarity and infinite humour that this film contains is a film that has an important message camouflaged in animation would you believe me?  Would you care?First off this is the most profanity laced film I have ever seen in my life and that includes early Eddie Murphy efforts.  But the profanity in this film had me in stitches.  Honestly that was almost not just a figure of speech either.  I laughed so hard that I almost banged my head on the on the person in front of me.  Remember how absorbed you were at the horror of war at the beginning of Private Ryan?  Well if you had to parallel the two and replace horror with humour that is a safe comparison.  This film is so  funny and I really enjoyed it on that level.  I can honestly say that I haven't laughed so hard since Office Space.  The profanity goes a bit overboard at times but I think that was on purpose.  Some of the humour is a bit gross  seeing Sadam's rubber propalactic was funny but a little sick at the same time  but I think these guys wanted to see how far they could go. And they went very far and they dared the MPAA to censor them even more and hey I was very entertained.But on the political side there are a lot of dicey issues that are covered here.  Censorship for one.  It's funny because we as Canadians and Americans have some of the same ideologies and one of them is free speech.  But if that is what we want then we have to be willing to go all the way.  You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct.  Free speech means free speech.  Free to express your thoughts in an open forum.  This film tells us that free speech is free as long as you don't offend the masses.  It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue  many of those films get an AA rating  but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film.  That really is silly.The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.  It doesn't matter that perhaps some of the issues at hand are clouded and misunderstood many  people stand behind their government to the very end. Kill em' all in the name of the Constitution.  There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues.  A particular scene with Bill Gates is funny.Parker and Stone have given the finger to the ratings system in America and I think people will like it.  They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie.  If the U.S. ever went to war with us it would probably be over in a day or so.  So thanks for making us look at least competetive.  That was cool.It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater but there is more to this movie than just humour.  To accomplish that and still be known as the guys who made fart jokes and the F word popular is quite a feat.  This film is there to enjoy but it is also there to ask some tough and interesting questions.  Enjoy the film but listen to what it has to say.  That is besides the F and S word listen to what it wants to say. One last observation and that is when I was in line for the film a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me.  When they asked for South Park the cashier asked if she was sure because there is a lot of profanity in the film.  The lady reassured her that it was fine.  Her daughter can listen and watch but knows not to repeat.  That is responsible parenting.  Teach your kids right from wrong and hope they turn out well. That's all you can do.  And I applaud that parent for doing so.  She may never know who I am but I will remember her for quite some time.  Maybe if more people were like that there wouldn't be such a fuss about profanity. After all they are just words.".

And they went very far and they dared the MPAA to censor them even more and hey I was very entertained.But on the political side there are a lot of dicey issues that are covered here.  Censorship for one.  It's funny because we as Canadians and Americans have some of the same ideologies and one of them is free speech.  But if that is what we want then we have to be willing to go all the way.  You can't pick and choose what is more free and more appropriate than something else just because it is not politically correct.  Free speech means free speech.  Free to express your thoughts in an open forum.  This film tells us that free speech is free as long as you don't offend the masses.  It also says that in MPAA's world it is okay to see blood and guts and intestines and brain tissue  many of those films get an AA rating  but profanity dictates that an R or an X is required to see the film.  That really is silly.The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.  It doesn't matter that perhaps some of the issues at hand are clouded and misunderstood many  people stand behind their government to the very end. Kill em' all in the name of the Constitution.  There are also some stabs at religion and being gay and a plethora of other issues.  A particular scene with Bill Gates is funny.Parker and Stone have given the finger to the ratings system in America and I think people will like it.  They have also given much more credit to the Canadian armed forces in this movie.  If the U.S. ever went to war with us it would probably be over in a day or so.  So thanks for making us look at least competetive.  That was cool.It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater but there is more to this movie than just humour.  To accomplish that and still be known as the guys who made fart jokes and the F word popular is quite a feat.  This film is there to enjoy but it is also there to ask some tough and interesting questions.  Enjoy the film but listen to what it has to say.  That is besides the F and S word listen to what it wants to say. One last observation and that is when I was in line for the film a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me.  When they asked for South Park the cashier asked if she was sure because there is a lot of profanity in the film.  The lady reassured her that it was fine.  Her daughter can listen and watch but knows not to repeat.  That is responsible parenting.  Teach your kids right from wrong and hope they turn out well. That's all you can do.  And I applaud that parent for doing so.  She may never know who I am but I will remember her for quite some time.  Maybe if more people were like that there wouldn't be such a fuss about profanity. After all they are just words.";

Last year also saw the release of the duo's Orgazmo and Cannibal  The Musical both made prior to the South Park phenomena. I became a fan. With South Park  Bigger Longer and Uncut the television show makes the giant leap to the big screen with a completely over the top feature that will probably end up as the one summer film that gives the audience the most pop for it's coin. To synopsize the film would be too painful and boring.  It's so packed with plot and characters that a one sentence generalization would do the film no justice.  I'll put it this way  If you don't know get or find South Park funny DON'T GO SEE THE FILM.  There might be droves of walkouts as soon as the opening sequence ends by people who thought that a cartoon could never be that bad.  The R rating and the Uncut of the title are there for a reason.  Heed the signs. Paced like a bat out of hell South Park is the funniest film to come around in some time.  While most of the jokes might seem stale to real Park devotees Director Parker knows exactly how to keep the film flowing and in the process show us new sides and characters that used to be unattainable on Comedy Central.  The movie is vulgar and offensive that's the idea. But Parker and Stone never once get meanspirited about things always making sure everybody get a slice of the laughingstock pie. The dreaded bleeping of the curse words is finally gone leaving Parker and Stone their first chance to show the world just how far they can take this concept.  After hostilities with the ratings board over the NC17 given to Orgazmowhich was harmless fun this new film which is far more raunchy than Orgazmo can be easily viewed as one big middle finger to the ratings board.  It's the first film I have ever seen that purposely goes unbelievably far just to see what they can actually get away with.  It's very interesting to compare this film which made it out with a R rating to others that were slapped with the NC17.  I believe that this is what Parker and Stone had in mind. Watching the antics of Stan Kyle Cartman and Kenny on the silver screen does have it's advantages.  The film is decidedly cinematic often jumping to showstopping musical numbers that I love Parker for.  Working with Marc Shaiman Parker brings us a whole new load of songs that are equal parts silly and yet retain some musical respect.  A just world would find evil Canadians Terrence and Phillip's Uncle Fua at the number one spot on the charts.  Like Cannibal the songs stay in the head. They move beyond their comic foundation and feel like real songs Parker has a musical gift and this South Park feature really showcases it. But don't fret fans the film is jammed packed with comedy that represents what South Park is all about.  Canadians AfricanAmericans Jews Catholics the poor the wealthy gay straight bi men with voiceboxes men with puppets on their hands... Everyone is made fun of here.  And every moment of this 80 minute film is comedic gold.  Like the Beavis And Butthead film this movie comes out just as people are beginning to write off the TV series.  And similar to Butthead this film has made a true fan out of me.  No other flick this year will have the stamina the audacity and the sheer momentum to please like this little South Park film.  I give Parker and Stone endless credit for crafting a film that nobody will expect and that every fan will relish. 9".

	schema:reviewBody "What can I say but OH MY GODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had heard rumors about this movie's extremities no pun intended and that it was much more...ahem...wild than the t.v. show.  Now I've only seen a handful of the television shows and they're pretty racy and raunchy but I've always liked what I've seen.  It's definitely not a show or movie! for kids.  Or the faint of heart or the easily offended.  But then again if you know that you're an easily offended person DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I loved this movie.  Granted I have to admit that I was shocked and surprised through 95 of it.  But it was great nonetheless. It was funny and vulgar and said pretty much everything in a manner that was NOT politically correct.  But then again aren't we all getting pretty sick of political correctness?I think one of the things that gets most of us at least myself is that when we were kids that age we never would have gone around saying half of what those kids did.  Or if we did we did our best not to get caught!  Of course I was only ever threatened with getting my mouth washed out with soap...not my mother starting a war with a foreign country! The musical numbers were great!  They were very upbeat and will stick in the minds of viewers for years to come.  In the future when we're all sitting behind our desks or whatever jobs we may have we'll notice that we'll be humming certain catchy tunes and when we stop to wonder what it is we'll remember the songs from South Park both with humor and with horror that we're actually humming them out in the civilized world.  The scene I think the best for musical numbers was where several of the different songs were going on at one time.  It was very Les Miserables like I saw the musical so I know what I'm talking about in a very sick and twisted sort of way. It was simply funny and light hearted.This movie poked fun at just about everything in the book.  Nothing was spared.  Not Christianity not different racial stereotypes and certainly not the gay community.  But none of it was handled in a fashion to be hateful or humiliating.  In my opinion all the jabs were meant to get people to see that there shouldn't be the divisions that there are and when people get separated they leave themselves open to ridicule and criticism. Rather if we all came together and put aside the divisions and stereotypes then perhaps we could all see the humor in remarks and jabs like the ones made in this movie.  As for the political statement it's true you know.  This country as are many others is always looking for something or someone else to blame for all the troubles.  We as a nation are hypersensitive to every little thing and just about everything is taboo.  From swearing to being able to purchase certain adult oriented toys a person can't do anything in this country without being censored or forbidden to.  It's sad when a state's laws or a person's hysteria keeps people from their constitutional right of free speech and the like.  And this is what this movie was trying to point out. I agree with the person who is his review of this movie wrote They're just words about the swearing in the movie.  And that's all they are. I give this movie a 10 for its humor its musical numbers and its obvious statements.  I think that everyone who has an open mind should go see this movie...and then go again and take someone who doesn't have an open mind so that it can be opened by the hilarious things said and done in this movie.".

And it also shows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem just like a bunch of comedy writers and composers but that they could be truly freedom fighters by showcasing this film.The story is about the four boys of South Park Stan Marsh Kyle Broflovski Kenny McCormick and Eric Cartman and after they go into a rated R Terrence and Phillip flick they start to use their new founded dirty words to excessive use.  Since the film is Canadian a war breaks out between Canada and America.  Kenny dies thats not a giveaway because on the TV show Kenny dies in every episode and winds up in hell to find Sadaam Hussein and Satan as gay lovers.  Both plot sides are very hilarious depending on if you watch the show and it's very satirical if you don't believe me just look at Bill Gates getting shot in the movie.The Movie seems quite content in it's dirty foulness and funny comedy musical type way to make us laugh not that thats a bad thing but I think that Matt and Trey are tying to tell us something with this film.  It is a wakeup call to America that if censorship doesn't change soon we might actually go to war with a country over something as arbitrary as censorship and freedom.  Or... it's just a good old fashioned comedy with fart jokes sex humor and a Winona Ryder playing pingpong in her private area.  Of course that's just my opinion I could be wrong.

The opening 10 minutes had me rolling in the aisles how would you like to suck my blls Mr garrison? and the song its easy mmmmkay being some of the highlights. the jokes while repetitive based on swearing or insulting someone never get old and the genius of ideas such as operation get behind the darkies while being offensive are undeniably funny. the only people who would rate this movie any less than at least 7 are the pathetic types who'll say oh its to vulgar and rude and offensive. thats the point! so if you're someone who can laugh at yourself which we should all be able to in an unserious movie such as this and want to witness some amazing moments of comedy genius than this is for you. special shout out to the creators of south park for the character Eric cartman the real star of this movie who would be up there on par with homer simpson for all time greatest comedy character if not for his foul mouth and habit of insulting well..everyone! 1010 from me for all the nights this ones cheered me up with out fail.".

The storyline is very clever looking at how much came out of such a simple idea. At the same time this movie does have some good points that were brought up such as how people think media makes kids to do things and about freedom of speech. This isn't everyone's cup of tea but it is definitely a clever movie with some huge laughs and good messages.".

It was definitely bigger and longer.  It certainly seemed uncut even though it wasn't.  See June 29 studio brief.  It was hilarious.Plot The movie had a great plot.  I won't give it all away but it is definitely big.  It starts with Stan Cartman Kyle Kenny and Kyle's little brother sneaking into the Terrance Phillip movie Aes of Fire which has been rated R.  They learn all kinds of swear words and use them at all times.  The rest of South Park kids see it also and by the next school day the parents find out and totally hate the movie.  They form a group against the movie.  It goes out from there.  There is also a plot with Kenny going to hell and finding Saddam Hussein and Satan in love.  Saddam is a hornball.  And Satan regrets the whole relationship.Crudity  Definitely for adults only.  It probably has the most swear words than any other movie this year.  It has cartoon nudity.  It has breasts and wriggling penises.  All cartoon of course.  It has violence galore by the end.  Do not take your kids to see this or be prepared to feel uncomfortable.  All theaters must enforce the carding laws for this one. However if none of this will offend you to the point of hatred do not see this.  It also has racism sexism and offends every group out there from the Gays to the MPAA to the parents.As a whole  The funniest movie so far of 1999.  I laughed so hard.  I found it only mildly offensive personally but then I also love the movie Pink Flamingos.  I cannot recommend this movie to everyone.  I can recommend it to those who are not offended easily.  This does not include the people who feel brave because they survived There's Something About Mary.  Parents will not like this movie unless they are completely openminded and I recommend not seeing it with your children.  However it is wonderful.  I loved the musical format that they chose.  Everywhere there is a song. Also stay past the credits there is an afterscene.  It is trying to be a Pink Flamingos. I love it but can only recommend it to the group from 1730 male.10".

This creates such a shockwave that Kyle's mother gets the two Canadian superstars arrested and put in the electric chair during a USO show. It is so similar to what parents go through whenever they find something offensive and think their children are in danger.Once Satan finds out that the US and Canada are at war he and his lover Sidam Hussein...that's right...decide it is the perfect time to unleash hell on earth. Kenny finds out because he is dead and sent to hell. Surprised he is dead? Didn't think so. It's his job to warn his friends of the incoming danger. What results from all this chaos is non stop hilarity.What makes this movie so amazing is that it isn't just a South Park movie...it's basically a South Park Musical! Trey and Matt have written an entire movie's worth of songs. Each one funnier than the next. The Academy Award nominated song Blame Canada performed by Robin Williams at the Oscars and by Kyle's mother in the movie is incredible.The madness doesn't stop with the singing and the dancing the censorship on TV is no more and the kids like the Fbombs fly...and more...and worse. Hearing fourth graders cuss like that is too much and makes the movie very enjoyable.South Park Bigger Better  Uncut is one of the best guilty pleasures around and everyone should take part in it at least some time in their lifetime. It is a timeless epic film done in animation. Although Phil Collins beat South Park out for the Oscar with his song from Disney's Tarzan this movie is a winner.".

I am convinced that South Park is the best show on TV and the only excuse to turn on that disgusting Comedy Central AKA The Beer and Sex Channel but some people wonder if the movie is as good as the show. Take my word for it it isn't. It's ten times better. In the movie Stan Kyle Cartman and Kenny see an Rrated film starring their favorite Canadian actors Terrance and Philip. The movie is entitled Asses of Fire and if I may quote Arthur Taussig the title is the least offensive thing about it. In the opening scene of Asses of Fire we discover why it was rated R. I won't give away one of the funniest parts of the movie but I'll just say that I didn't know you could use that many obscenities in only three minutes. When the movie ends the boys leave the theatre repeating all the words they've heard in the film. Not knowing what the words mean they continue this behavior the next day at school. Their teacher sends them to the guidance counselor who subsequently calls their mothers. As those who watch the show may have guessed Sheila Brosfloski Kyle's mother is outraged and begins a campaign to have the film banned.It's general popculture knowledge that Kenny McCormick is killed in nearly EVERY episode of South Park. One can naturally assume that his death in the movie would be the KennydeathtoendallKennydeaths. It is but unlike his frequent deaths in the show his death in the movie is a huge contributing factor to the plot. This may be a slight spoiler if you can call the way in which Kenny dies a spoiler. The boys end up seeing the movie again and Kenny is killed while imitating something he saw in the film that may be too inappropriate say in this review. He is banished to Hell for skipping church to see the film and we discover that Satan and Saddam Hussein are in a homosexual love affair. In this relationship Satan is surprisingly warm and caring and wants to communicate with Saddam but Saddam just wants sex. The conversations between these two characters throughout the film are hilarious. Meanwhile back on Earth Sheila Brosfloski's movement to have Terrance and Philip banned has spun out of control. Canada is blamed for all of the problems of America's youth America is preparing to literally wage war against Canada all CanadianAmerican citizens are sent to deathcamps and Terrance and Philip are scheduled to be executed. Back in Hell Kenny listens to a conversation between Satan and Saddam. Bible readers know the seven signs of the end of the world. The fall of an empire the coming of a comet etc. We discover that when the blood of Terrance and Philip touches American soil Satan and Saddam Hussein will ascend from Hell and rule the earth. It is now up to Stan Kyle and Cartman to save humanity from the horrors of every Christian's worst nightmare and his boyfriend George W. Bush's worst nightmare. This film is more than hilarious. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are the funniest individuals in America. This film is an animated musical but parents beware it doesn't bare the Disney familyfriendly stamp of approval. The best songs in the film are Up There I'm Super What Would Brian Boitano Do? and the infamous Blame Canada which was nominated for an Oscar. The best voice jobs by the creators were Saddam Hussein Matt Stone and Satan Trey Parker. I could watch this film twenty times every day and never tire of it. Caution while this film is animated it is certainly not for the kiddies. It is filled with vulgar language but it is not gratuitous. The language used is the purpose of the film. The moral of the film is that no matter what words your children learn from a film it is not the filmmaker's job to raise your child. It's an anticensorship film. It is the up to the parent to put it into context and punish accordingly. I would recommend this film to everyone who is not easily offended or an extreme Christian YOU WILL BE OFFENDED. If you're into satirical cartoons or just want to see Canadians drop bombs on Alec Baldwin South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut is a mustsee.".

Like MASH South Park contrasts the perceived obscenity of language and sexuality with the true obscenity of war and violence.  The film has become even more poignant in these dark times of wars fought under false pretenses. The film is also a musical and benefits from the catchy tunes of Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman.  Highlights include the Blame Canada song and a Stanley KubrickAnthony Burgess tribute involving the Vchip. It is an excellent film overall and is among my favorite animated features.   1010".

I'm a person  who watches South Park regularly on T.V. and  I can say that the movie is viewer friendly to people who never watch the TV series is different from the TV series and it stays true to the TV series. The opening of the movie intentionally makes fun of the opening sequence to Beauty and the Beast. Although the TV show sometimes does songs the movie purposely does several songs to keep the movie lively and turns it into a musical. The first song of the movie is probably the most important because it introduces the main characters. Many people believe that South Park is mindless cursing and swearing and that maybe true but the first swearing word in the movie is actually forshadowing of what will happen to Kenny one of the lead characters when he dies. The song that has the most  swearing in it is the Terance  Philip song. The song consists of the most swearing words I've ever heard in a single minute. What makes this song so great is that it symbolizes how many times a child hears a swearing word before they actually start using it. What people might hate most about this movie is how offensive it is especially towards Canadians but I've heard before that anyone who finds South Park offensive is probably not thinking. I personly have relatives who are Canadian. Beyond the story of the movie there are other things that make the movie interesting such as the bad animation. But this is actually another high point of the movie. Nowadays people have become so familiar with the stunning breathtaking life like animation that South Park takes the audience back to when the first animators experimented with stop motion animaition. To date South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut has recieved an Acadamy Award nomination for the song Blame Canada has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records for having the most swearing 399 times of swearing and is on IMDb's  list of the best animated films. I have made a top ten list of the best animated films and South Park had made it to number one. Ranking higher than Prince Mononoke and Spirited Away. This is the kind of movie that people should let their kids see but only if the parents can teach their children the terrible meaning and usage of the words. Beyond that there is no reason why a person shouldn't find this movie entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a wonderful story and an artifact both cultural and historical.  It takes us across the Berlin Wall in the last year of the German Democratic Republic.  In the background we hear avant garde electronic music and when the characters go to the theatre we see a modern fanciful production. It is a reminder of German modernism in the arts something that one rarely sees on the screen.The students in Phillip's the protagonist's high school class write their essays about a quote from Bertolt Brecht.  This quote about a common man in his own community  goes a long way to explaining the apparent lack of an ending. I confess that I found the ending a bit odd until I watched the movie a second time.  The protagonist is not going to live a Hollywood 'happy ending'.  He is going to live in the back streets that are gay East Berlin.  He will not have the easy life he adopts at the beginning of the movie and he is going to continue being a high school teacher.  Phillip is not going to allow the East German state his profession his family or his girl friend to supress his own self.  He is living on a tight wire but he is an ordinary citizen of a socialist state.The noncapitalist industrial society that serves as the backdrop for this coming of age story is no more. It is refreshing to see a movie without product placements and the crass commercialism.  Coming Out is a flash back to a society where gays were repressed but lived out their lives in spite of society.  If you think Bush's America is repressive imagine living in a police state like East Germany with the Berlin wall.  This fact gives Phillip's coming out such significance.  His dilemma makes modern American gay life seem comparatively carefree.  We take so much for granted.The director is obviously accomplished.  The budget is adequate so we are spared the technical problems of gay cinema on a shoe string.  The acting and dialog are convincing .  The German is exceptionally crisp and clear allowing someone with a first year college course in German to catch subtleties that are not captioned.  The cinematography is good and moves the plot forward.This film was erotic without being pornographic.  It was far more realistic than Maurice for example.  It touched me in a way that coming out films rarely do.  It reminded me of the first time I went to a gay bar in a small city all quite selfconscious and anxious and awed.  More importantly it reminded me of what I wanted to find there.".

	schema:reviewBody "COMING OUT is a seventeenyearold movie created in East Germany while under Communist rule about the dangerous milieu in which gay men closeted their identity. It is a stunning achievement in that it presents the agony of coming to grips with sexual identity in a suppressive atmosphere opening to public viewing the night the Berlin Wall tumbled. With this knowledge the story of these people is all the more heartbreaking with the chance that life for each character would have been different if told a few months later! The real tragedy is that the story is timeless and universal the trauma of young people coming out is still potentially as wracked with anguish as the trauma of this film.Philipp handsome young Matthias Freihof is a popular high school teacher tightly in the closet who happens to bump into literally an open and needy pretty girl Tanya Dagmar Manzel who immediately invites him to her apartment and introduces him to her bed. They form a comfortable bond Philipp thinking his sexual identity problem is solved. Then Tanya brings home an old friend Redford who Philipp instantly recognizes as a boy with whom he has had hidden sex in the past. Old feelings are aroused and Philipp runs into the night only to end up in a secretive gay bar where he meets Matthias handsome young Dirk Kummer invites him home and in a beautifully captured moment has a wholly satisfying physical encounter. Both men are enraptured.Philipp returns to Tanya who questions his evenings' whereabouts and Philipp manages to keep his secret the relationship suffers. Philipp has meetings with his mother and during one of these meetings his mother tells him she is sure Tanya is pregnant she has all the symptoms of morning sickness and 'a woman can tell'. Philipp though mortified declares he will remain with Tanya and at a party when the couple encounters Matthias Philipp and Matthias greet each other with passion Philipp introduces Tanya as his wife. Matthias is shocked and hurt and flees and outraged Tanya discards Philipp. Philipp roams the streets and parks looking for Matthias realizing they can now be lovers but doesn't find him. He instead encounters one of his high school students Lutz Robert Hummel and has a onenight stand. In a sleazy gay bar Philipp meets an old man brilliant actor Werner Dissel who relates how life as a gay man during Hitler's reign had resulted in incarceration in a concentration camp that gay men will always be persecuted. Returning to his classroom Philipp is informed that he is under observation because of his sexual activity. Struck by silence Philipp stands before his class his future unknown.This story by Wolfram Witt as directed by Heiner Carow is as fine as any relating the terrors of coming out. That it is performed by such a fine cast is even more impressive and the real banner that flies over this film is that it doesn't attempt to provide answers or maudlin endings. It merely stops  leaving the futures of each of these welldrawn characters to the imagination of the audience. It is powerful it is well made it is worthy of continued appreciation as a brave little film from another period in time a period that continues into the present in so many places. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

Philipp is a pleasant and sociable chap  and finds it easy to fall in love with a woman who has held a torch for him since their high school days. However when her best male friend turns out to be his own teenage lover with a lot of emotional baggage attached Philipp realises that his passion for men hasn't wained.The soundtrack music is excellent  and it's refreshing to see a film which doesn't pander to the viewer  you have to pay attention and infer some of the plot but it all makes perfect sense.Coming Out is an empowering film  made and set at a time when all sex between men was equally illegal in my home state of Queensland as it was in East Germany. The opening night for Coming Out in Berlin was the same night that the Wall came down  that would have been one memorable night for all involved.I was impressed enough to immediately order the DVD from the USA  it's a great film to share.A few young people in the audience thought that Coming Out was a comedy which is weird considering the opening detailed scene of a seriously ill young man in hospital having the contents of his stomach pumped. They guffawed at the fashions the disco music and the dancing  but thankfully they shut up soon enough.I thought the ending was particularly poignant  especially considering the film's title.I also enjoyed seeing Charlotte Von Mahlsdorf as the barmaid in the gay club. She was perfect for that part  and it is a fitting tribute to her.".

East Germany was for a communist country rather liberal homosexuality wasn't illegal just ignored women were an integral part of the work force and society... yet still communist. I am a bit confused by one writer's comment regarding Bush's oppressive America...I think it rather resembles this movie. But I digress...Overall the movie is a success given its origin. No tragedies but rather a man who struggles with his identity and ultimately accepts himself emotionally as a gay man. I guess it is a period piece as much as 'In and Out' may be considered a period piece. Maybe historical representation would be a better term in particular with this movie given the timing of its release. The ending is left rather open leaving the viewer wondering where Philipp might next end up. Maybe there was supposed to be a sequel? We'll never know I guess.And yes he does look good in a pair of jeans.".

There are echoes of an expressionistic Berlin cabaret tradition the exaggeration in the dance club scenes and the song in the experimental theaterconcert scene. The angst rings true. The atonality of some of the music in the soundtrack adds to the angst. The director obviously sees something atonal about these young men in love but maybe it reflects the cultural context rather than disapproval?

	schema:reviewBody "As a youth Philipp had an unconsummated relationship with a schoolmate but panicked and ended it. He's now a teacher in a high school and starting a relationship with a woman named Tanja who teaches at the same school. When Tanja introduces him to a friend of hers who turns out to be Philipp's old schoolmate Philipp's questions about his sexuality resurface. When Philipp begins to explore his feelings by checking out a local gay bar he meets Mathias a charming young man who is equally smitten with him.Philipp is attractive and has a puppy doglike air of vulnerability but while Philipp is starting to be more honest with himself about what he wants he's not honest with those around him and in his confusion and panic ends up hurting all of those that try to love him. This makes for a sadder movie than other coming out stories such as Beautiful Thing or the older Making Love.In summary this is an interesting but ultimately unfulfilling story look at one man's coming out. There are scenes that are over the top and others that I just plain don't understand but this may be a cultural thing. E.g. Several patrons leaving a gay bar have never met Philipp but come up to him as they pass him in the street stroke his hair and point him inside. Also the bar has gay men in costumes that are wilder than anything I see in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade. Is it a special event or were gay bars in East Germany more festive than I'd heard?".

He's now a teacher in a high school and starting a relationship with a woman named Tanja who teaches at the same school. When Tanja introduces him to a friend of hers who turns out to be Philipp's old schoolmate Philipp's questions about his sexuality resurface. When Philipp begins to explore his feelings by checking out a local gay bar he meets Mathias a charming young man who is equally smitten with him.Philipp is attractive and has a puppy doglike air of vulnerability but while Philipp is starting to be more honest with himself about what he wants he's not honest with those around him and in his confusion and panic ends up hurting all of those that try to love him. This makes for a sadder movie than other coming out stories such as Beautiful Thing or the older Making Love.In summary this is an interesting but ultimately unfulfilling story look at one man's coming out. There are scenes that are over the top and others that I just plain don't understand but this may be a cultural thing. E.g. Several patrons leaving a gay bar have never met Philipp but come up to him as they pass him in the street stroke his hair and point him inside. Also the bar has gay men in costumes that are wilder than anything I see in the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade. Is it a special event or were gay bars in East Germany more festive than I'd heard?";

	schema:headline " Finally a convincing gaythemed movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Coming Out is an East German 105minute film from 1989 so this one was made shortly before the Fall of the Berlin Wall and it will soon have its 30th anniversary. The director is Heiner Carow and the screenplay is by Erika Richter and Wolfram Witt. For these two it is definitely the most known work today and for Carow I believe his most known is still the one about Paul and Paul but I think this one here is way better. The cast also includes a handful known actors today. I am not familiar with lead actor Freihof though which is disappointing as he plays his role well. But Manzel and Gwisdek are known to everybody with an interest in German film these days. Just like the main character in Taxi zum Klo another gaythemed German film from the 1980s the protagonist here is a teacher. That's really the only parallel though as this one here is really not ready to show everybody that he is a homosexual. The film is also not as obscene and in your face. It is a movie that is really about sexual identity and has no intention to be controversial only to be realistic. That's why Freihof's character ends up in a relationship with a woman before at a party really discovering who he is and his heterosexual relationship as well as his profession make thing really complicated overall. This movie never drags which is quite an achievement for a film over 100 minutes. And it goes out on a very high note as the story of the old homosexual is very touching and shows our hero that his situation could actually be a lot worse which makes it somehow an uplifting film I guess. It's nice to see the awards recognition it deserved and this is a contender of my favorite GDR movie for sure. Sadly this country has not been too great in terms of filmmaking but here we have one that really stands out. And this also applies to the big number of gaythemed short films that are mostly forgettable. I very much recommend the watch. I was occasionally closer to giving this one an 8 instead of a 6 out of 10.".

This visit clearly disturbs Phillips who then visits a bar which happen to be a gay bar and meets new set of characters including the boy who we all saw at the beginning of the movie as Matthias.Then everything gets connected perfectly as 20 something Matthias develops an interest in Phillip and the two begin a shy yet charming relationship. It would be also the time when Phillip begins questioning his relationship with his now wife Tanja and eventually leaves her note stating that he needs some time off. Matthias would invite Phillip to his birthday party and afterwards the two sleeps together in Phillip's apartment. It is then that more is revealed about Phillip such that his homosexuality has always been well kept inside of him and his relationship with Matthias including sleeping with him is his first.Later Phillip would know that Tanja might be pregnant which then he quickly changes course and gets back in touch with her claiming that he won't leave her again. A night at the opera would be an important occasion when Matthias who was searching for Phillip ever since that night meets the latter and the two hug in a loving manner in front of Tanja and so everybody would know of the truth Matthias would be crushed when Phillip introduces Tanja as his wife and Tanja who gets to know of Phillip's sexual orientation.Tanja breaks it off with Phillip who went chasing after Matthias without much luck. It might be safe to assume that this would be the time that Matthias tried killing himself in reference to the first scene of the movie. Phillip's search of Matthias continues in different bars until he find him in the company of one of his students Matthias who is clearly still hurt pushes Phillip away and refuses his love which sets Phillip over the edge declaring his true self to his mother as well as mistreating an elder gay man at another bar in frustration of his own problems of a high school teacher coming out as gay which the elder man tells him of his own more complicated history being gay and imprisoned during the Nazi days.Finally Phillip decides on embracing his true orientation even if he never gets Matthias back and has a nice confrontation with the head teacher at the end.Coming Out is a beautiful movie dealing with gay issues the characters as well as their representation are believable and especially Phillip who you cannot decide on hating him over his weakness of not being able to decide on a relationship or the fact that it makes him the more human. Matthias gets the most sympathy as he fell in love with the wrong guy and got his heart broken but through it all regardless of the suicide attempt he never doubted his gay self. This movie is recommended to all who is interested in gay issues besides it gives you a different environment a rare movie during rare times out of East Germany before the fall of the wall.".

In the street scenes the cars that drove by seemed pretty old and I had to look at the year this film was made cause it looked like it could've been the sixties based on the technology of the cars. It's amazing that even in 1989 East Germany was a completely different world to ours. Matthias Freihof did a beautiful job portraying his character with just enough desperation and angst to keep you enthralled. This is not an overstated or over produced film. It's almost if you are there next to this guy watching real life. The mood of the time and place completely captured. Almost gave me a sense of dread.

Basic premise Peter Derns Timothy Hutton gets a temp Kris Bolin Lara Flynn Boyle that is smart sexy and ambitious. She seems like a Godsend at first because she actually helps him in his dogeatdog world of marketing. His boss Charlene Faye Dunaway is great in her supporting role as both mentor  menace. One of the problems is that Peter is under mental supervision aka shrink for supposed paranoia  extreme jealousy. When things start to go wrong as Kris works her way up the ladder everyone thinks he's just paranoid. Hmm? Well you can probably guess what happens next. But even though this movie is predictable it doesn't stop me from watching it whenever it's on. The actors are fun to watch and very attractive. The sexual tension between Hutton  Boyle is believable. And there are plenty of deaths to keep it moving right along! Just a fun movie nothing major or worthy of the Academy of Dramatic Arts but then not everything has to be. Just enjoy this for what it is a guilty pleasure.".

External reviews often completely trash this movie without finding anything positive. Well get this chemical makeup Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini! Timothy Hutton habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days superstar Faye Dunaway and Steven Webber from the TV show Wings. How's that for voltage? Add in a proved plot line with a long pedigree Hand that rocks the cradle Single White Female many more some great whacky dialog and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen and yeah...I'll bank that. How could you possibly lose? Actually I really like this movie even just watching it straight. The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad hammy mugging acting and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style but other than that I like it. However if you make me analyze it OK it's riddled with plot holes dropped threads unanswered questions implausibilities etc but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me. And it does. So with that in mind you could look at it as one of the so bad it's good genre and it does succeed on that level. I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script. It actually has a lot of good stuff in it. For example One of my favorite literary devices is the buddy thing which is an entertainment staple Laurel and Hardy Skipper and Gilligan Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies Balky and Larry in Perfect Strangers etc. This movie features that but in four directions Hutton and his boss Hutton and his buddy Webber Hutton and his rival Platt Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there. The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog which I'm still quoting years later. For example You're BLOWIN' it man. YOU'VE GOT THIS PROBLEM. And one of the greatest lines ever Good gosh how hard can it be? I'm not asking you to splice DNA you just DO IT! Wonderful stuff. Finally it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching. I would have liked to give this movie a 10 because it's really one of my favorites but I couldn't do that in good conscience so I had to go easy on the superlative.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many of the key scenes are telegraphed in the style of Friday the 13th.Faye Dunaway is overthetop. She's sort of like The Joker in batman. She kind of channeled her character from the movie Network but it didn't work here as well. Timothy Hutton is my favorite actor. He makes it look so easy and has such an appealing presence. Another reviewer said that you want to root for his character because you identify with him. I agree. That's the case with most of his movies.Lara Flynn Boyle was great. She nailed it. However her hair style and the psychotic look in her eyes were a real turn off. Maura Tierney is meant to look depressed and plain. Therefore there was no eyecandy in this one for me although I understand that Boyle was for most men.Portland and Oregon in general looked great. I never thought of skycrapers and big businesses in Portland but I guess there are some. There is a scene when the characters are traveling down to the state capitol of Salem via the Coast Highway. That was just thrown in for scenery because the coast is way west of the road to Salem.The main character's personal problem from the past is key to the plot. It seems a bit farfetched but I liked it. A simple cheap plot device but I'll allow it.I thoroughly enjoyed the physical atmosphere the buddy aspect the believable wife Hutton's persona and the devilish Boyle. Not a great film but I will undoubtedly take out my VHS copy again in a few years or introduce it to a friend.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many of the key scenes are telegraphed in the style of Friday the 13th.Faye Dunaway is overthetop. She's sort of like The Joker in batman. She kind of channeled her character from the movie Network but it didn't work here as well. Timothy Hutton is my favorite actor. He makes it look so easy and has such an appealing presence. Another reviewer said that you want to root for his character because you identify with him. I agree. That's the case with most of his movies.Lara Flynn Boyle was great. She nailed it. However her hair style and the psychotic look in her eyes were a real turn off. Maura Tierney is meant to look depressed and plain. Therefore there was no eyecandy in this one for me although I understand that Boyle was for most men.Portland and Oregon in general looked great. I never thought of skycrapers and big businesses in Portland but I guess there are some. There is a scene when the characters are traveling down to the state capitol of Salem via the Coast Highway. That was just thrown in for scenery because the coast is way west of the road to Salem.The main character's personal problem from the past is key to the plot. It seems a bit farfetched but I liked it. A simple cheap plot device but I'll allow it.I thoroughly enjoyed the physical atmosphere the buddy aspect the believable wife Hutton's persona and the devilish Boyle. Not a great film but I will undoubtedly take out my VHS copy again in a few years or introduce it to a friend.";

It stars Lara Flynn Boyle The Practice as a quirky femme fatale who causes problems for the people around her. Although the movie was well cast and put together well there really was no point to it! It never really went into Boyle's character's personality about WHY she was so strange! Overall I'd rent this just for entertainment not for a good thriller! Sure to become a 1990s cult classic.

Peter Derns is an executive and former mental patient great combination who receives a beautiful temporary assistant to bridge a stressful period. She  the gorgeous Lara Flynn Boyle  immediately proves herself useful and she even gives good input for the company's newest project. But of course she becomes a little too obsessed with her boss and career and pretty soon other rival executives start to die in mysterious circumstances. Very convenient if you want to climb up the companyladder but nevertheless suspicious. The Temp is one of those countless early 90's thrillers that introduce femme fatales as dangerous psychopaths other examples being Single White Female The Crush and The Secretary but this premise actually is pretty weak and overly predictable. The screenplay features a series of clichs typically lame officehumor and really ALL the characters are annoying stereotypes. There's nothing even remotely interesting about this film and the downright lousy ending will make you regret sitting through it even more.".

The whole scene at the end with the chases in the factory was just to much and I'm not sure if the final twist in the last few minutes was supposed to be clever but all it made me do was think CMON! By the end of the movie The Temp has become to jumbled and over the top to be interesting. It's not the performers who were fine.

Laura what happened to you? Stop with the fillers and cigarettes for food! It's horrible to see once beautiful actresses go downhill so badly. I don't really know if Faye Dunaway did a good job or not because rather than focusing on her acting skills all I could see were her terrible teeth. I couldn't focus on anything else. Ugh!Oliver Platt gave a great performance as usual. This guy is so great in everything he's in that if for some weird reason he were to accept a role in a Sharknado film it would become a potential award winner. He's that good! He just cannot miss. I love watching him onscreen.As far as my serious critique of this film  the one thing I will say for it is...it did do a good job showing the psychological aspects of the affects of someone who is a pathological liar. They tell the truth just enough to always be able to cover their tracks but deep down their motives are usually pretty twisted. To complicate matters with the situation Timothy Hutton's character is just coming off of therapy in regards to paranoia. I don't know how many people are out there IRL going to the extremes that Laura Flynn Boyle's character did but IRL even on a much smaller scale and not like the extremes in this film pathological liars seemingly skate through on everything and are never held accountable for anything because they lie and twist things just enough so they are still believable. If questioned they can always find a way to put things back on the other person so that they think they are the ones that are wrong or who might be losing their mind. It really is kind of an incredible thing to witness. At the end of the movie Timothy Hutton's character says you've always got an answer. While viewing this I even found myself wondering at certain points along the way if she had actually done those things. If they hadn't had the one smoking gun with the phone call he got in the hotel you still might be able to walk away from this film thinking it was up for interpretation  whether she was truly guilty or not or if it was just his paranoia. I think the film is leading you to believe that she did do all those things but the way they portrayed it  it's not like they went back and showed her specifically doing each of those things. She just always popped up after something happened or she had a perfectly logical answer for everything even the one thing that you thought for sure would be a smoking gun in the end that would just nail her to the wallshe had an explanation for it the fake photo of her family. What was the end game for her in this scenario? Are we to surmise that eventually she would have killed him to take his place? The one thing that does not make sense and that really shows just how twisted she isif she really did do itis cutting the brakes on the car. How could she have known that they wouldn't have crashed and died? She had no way to know that so what was the motive for cutting the brakes? Did she do that so that Timothy Hutton would think it was somebody else so that she wouldn't look guilty and they would have a bonding moment? It all seemed rather unclear. Also the ending was very anticlimactic for as dramatic as everything had been up until that point you would've thought they would've ended it with a scene of them standing outside on a balcony or something and him telling her she was fired and then her trying to come at him and kill him or push him off and as they're fighting she's the one that gets pushed off because at this point she is going to be so ready for revenge that you know she's not just going to leave quietly. But we're just kind of left hanging and having to figure out our own ending. At any rate I think it was ok. If anything it's fun to go back and see these movies for the wardrobes alone.".

One of the things he talks about is paranoia I think. He does have problems with paranoia during the show.I was hoping to see some of the love and romance from Lara Flynn Boyle that she is capable of but her character Kris Bolin does not show that. Kris Bolin however is not evil and calculating only a guilty person would be.The movie is a mystery. It keeps us wondering who did it. There are many things that are done such as sabotage and for some of them there are not clear answers to who done them.Unfortunately this is another story where the writers do not play fair. I really think that if you knew at the beginning how it will end then there are times you would think it is ridiculous that the person would do what they do.I like that Peter Derns treats Kris Bolin as an equal as much as he does.. He wants to get back together with his wife they are separated and I think that is implied at the beginning of the movie and behaves accordingly. I like Maura Tierney as the understanding and tolerant wife but the wife is not in the movie a lot.".

However when his new temp Kris Bolin arrives she proves not only she's beautiful but very efficient in her job and helps him successfully with his campaign. But there's something not quite right about her intentions which Peter starts picking up on and some executives fall to mysterious deaths. Is it all in his head all is Kris really behind all of this.Director Tom Holland has such films behind him like Fright Night Child's Play and Thinner but this sedate and tame psychothriller really does pale in comparison to those fun flicks. Holland's competently assured direction makes slick work of this lifeless and mechanically structured premise that never really takes off even with such a deviously twisted idea. Because of Holland's panache and a terrific cast Faye Dunaway is great! it stays effectively watchable. It's just too bad that studio interference in the editing side damaged just what could've been. The theme is all about playing on the twisty paranoia and lurking competition for success but it goes on to lack that real daring and dark edge like a knife in the back. It sets itself in taut confines and can feel rather calmly. The wordy script goes about things in quite an unbalanced frame with an almost tongueincheek style getting caught up in the serious moments. The two never really level out. Fredric Talgorn's music score is generically jarring but suitable and Steve Yaconelli's sharply lensed photography and lighting placement is ably done for the right effect. Timothy Hutton is perfectly cast and the excellent Lara Flynn Boyle is rapturously sexy and cunning to the bone. There's quite an intriguingly unpredictable pattern to Hutton and Boyle's mindscrewing relationship. This is where most of the pressure filled and sexual tension arises from. Oliver Platt appears but seems wasted in an insignificant part as a slimy executive.Lukewarm thriller that never finds its way out of its artificial mould and ends rather abruptly.".

P.S the movie The House on Carroll Street is not as far fetched as one might think with President Turman passing the secret order Project or Operation PaperClip in September 1946 having the US Immigration Department allow hundreds of exNazi scientists which many of Truman's supporters and admirers say that he didn't know about into the US. This was done in order to help in developing rockets and other military hardware in fighting the Communists Menace overseas in far away places like Korea and Vietnam.".

P.S the movie The House on Carroll Street is not as far fetched as one might think with President Turman passing the secret order Project or Operation PaperClip in September 1946 having the US Immigration Department allow hundreds of exNazi scientists which many of Truman's supporters and admirers say that he didn't know about into the US. This was done in order to help in developing rockets and other military hardware in fighting the Communists Menace overseas in far away places like Korea and Vietnam.";

The 1950's atmosphere is caught very well elegant clothing superb cars leafy New York streets New York's Grand Central Station and a cameo role for the shiny Chicago Express. The OST by George Delarue too is worth while listening to. It does more than just underpin the action in the movie it stands perfectly well on its own legs.I've noticed some reviewers made a link between the looks of Ray Salwen Mandy Patinkin and a young Richard Nixon who was heading the House on Un American Activities Committee HUAC in the early fifties. I'd rather compare the smug Salwen figure with Roy Cohn McCarthy's right hand and ax man. Patinkin would have been a perfect choice for the main role of Citizen Cohn in 1992 although James Woods too did a nice job As other reviewers have pointed out there are indeed some similarities with Hitchcock movies from the 1950's. All shots show clean streets nice looking people shiny cars You won't see any hoodlums hobo's mean looking motorcycle gang members. There's not even the page of a newspaper pushed around by the wind in the New York streets. Even the bad guys that kill the German young man with a knife are dressed up as if they come from the horses or some fancy restaurant. The romance between McGillis and FBI man Cochran Daniels too is treated in a very 1950's way. To many viewers this will be seen as a lack of chemistry between the two main characters. However to my h.o. an all too steamy relationship would have somehow spoiled this elegant movie and especially slowed down the pace considerably.OK there are a number of weak points in the scenario it's highly improbable that a hush hush operation of smuggling Nazi's into the US would have used such an unsafe safehouse as the one in Carroll Street. ID papers would have been arranged for while those war criminals were still in Europe to reduce as much as possible the risks. And it's rather silly seeing a Senator's aide going as far as entering into Emily's bathroom. Very intimidating OK but I'd rather think this kind of a job would have been left to some low ranking goons. And finally what the heck is he doing on the roof of New York's Grand Central Station ??? Still nobody complains about similar weaknesses in let's say North by Northwest or Sabotage. Indeed this movie doesn't pretend being a semidocumentary like De Niro's Guilty by suspicion 1991 or Citizen Cohn are. And as pure entertainment House on Carroll Street does a nice job. I'd rate it 810".

It falls into neither common failing of such films  there is no attempt to graft an anachronistic approach to an older style nor to bring that older style into a modern decade. This film understands that such a style cannot be separated from the emotions and perceptions of the time.Peter Yates a director who generally creates for the present time does an unexpectedly excellent job at recreating this lost world. He uses cinematographer Michael Ballhaus who went on to photograph Quiz Show another 1950s recreation to wonderful effect letting him capture his scenes in a manner that never once strays from the older approach. Yates shows us how thrilling the suspense and big setpieces can be when not buried in special effects and quick cuts. Yates proves why he's one of the great overlooked talents.Jeff Daniels and Kelly McGillis have very much that 'star chemistry' valued for this sort of picture. McGillis especially brings a lightness and intensity most modern actresses could only pretend at. Patinkin is appropriately menacing.

Christopher Buchholz provides an engaging fearful yet somehow innocent performance to the character of Stefan.Imagining that The House on Carroll Street were somehow released during the era in which it is set I have little doubt it would be considered one of the great classics. Films such as North By Northwest have all the same limitations and plot implausibilities yet are no more or less thrilling than this one. I see nothing of lower quality to be found here only a picture made in a period where it couldn't be recognized. If you love the classic thrillers you should certainly love this one as well.".

In fact there are only two items in the House on Carroll Sreet to suggest that this movie is NOT a product of that decade. A the cast of this movie were just being born when Hitchcock was in his prime. and b there is a bit of frontal nudity. Needless to say you would never see that in Hitchcock's days in fact before he made Psycho it was considered indecent to show qa toilet being finished on screen or so I heardThe makers of The House on Carroll Street have a great eye for detail and they recapture the period beautifully. Everything has been carefully assembled down to the last fat stripped tie. If the House on Carroll Street was released thirty years earlier it may have been a classic but by the 1980's the Hitchcockfilmnoir formula had become somewhat generic. There are still great movies like Chinatown but there are a lot of critically bashed items as well such as Brian de Palma's work. The look of this movie took me back but not the storyline. It feels shallow derivative and also rushed so it's not as great a movie as it could've been. It's just a good movie. Leading the cast is Kelly McGillis. Her performance is not that great but her screen presence is interesting. She plays the role with a sort of Grace Kelly mindset and she knows how to act with her face although the makeup job deserves a bit of credit there too. In terms of character she doesn't have a whole lot to work with in fact most of the characters in the film are genre stereotypes. On screen this film is full of life but on the pages it could use a bit more strength. The House on Carroll Street is not great but it's enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Emily Crane a photo editor at Life Magazine refuses to turn over to a Senate committee the names and files of a civil rights organization she's associated with she doesn't realize she'll soon be out of a job and probably the cause of a young German being stabbed to death. That's not the least of it. Soon she'll be refusing a great hamburger while a senior Senate committee staff man uses catsup on a white dining clothe to illustrate the red menace. And finally she'll find herself clambering over the interior catwalk of New York's Grand Central Station dome high above the floor while killers try to insure she trips. To my mind The House on Carroll Street is a solid and talented if not exceptional child of Hitchcock. The year is 1951 and antiCommunism hysteria is in full bloom. Congressional demagogues blacklisting and secret FBI files abound. When Emily Kelly McGillis loses her job we learn she's under FBI surveillance. Agent Cochrane Jeff Daniels has been assigned to take secret photographs of her find out who she talks to and to follow her about New York. He observes when in need of a job she is interviewed by Miss Venable Jessica Tandy to read to the old lady. And one afternoon relaxing in the townhouse garden of Miss Venable's home she overhears part of a conversation in German coming from the next house. Naturally nosy she moves closer through the bushes glimpses the face of a young German fellow she accidentally met a day or two before on the street...and then sees the face of the Senate staff head Ray Salwen Mandy Patinkin. Salwen was responsible for hauling her before the committee. Something is not right. A few days later she follows the German to a Jewish cemetery and finds him writing down the names of dead Jews. He seems scared. Before long she is helping him escape from the house on Carroll Street only to see him stabbed death in front of her. By now FBI agent Cochrane not only realizes something is very off he realizes Emily Crane has nice legs is quite likable and may be in danger. He's puzzled when he is warned off by his superiors and then taken off her case. In solid Hitchcockian style we have been following this nice and nosy woman while she slowly discovers skullduggery and then realizes that she has placed herself at great risk. And in equally solid Hitchcockian style we have met the man in agent Cochrane who with persistence and humor will attempt to keep her from danger while joining her in uncovering a plot that deals with German war criminals and powerful men in high places. The movie has welldirected set pieces ranging from a covert meeting in a huge dim Greenwich Village book store to a spooky breakingandentering into the now abandoned house on Carroll Street where Emily meets a man with a knife to the exploration of the tunnels below and the girders high above the Grand Central main station. Most of all it has two instantly appealing main characters in McGillis and Daniels. Both are completely natural in their portrayals. They have guileless faces. We immediately like both of them. Daniels in particular shows the kind of openfaced honesty that makes the movie so satisfying. The caveat I have is Mandy Patinkin. He is a forceful intense actor. Patinkin makes Salwen a creature of such supreme selfconfidence such repellent humor that Salwen doesn't just stand for the evils of the period he disgusts us. Patinkin's selfserving powerjustifying Salwen full of phony patriotism and contemptuous high spirits in my opinion very nearly overbalances the movie. Patinkin is just an inch away from becoming a caricature. Added to that are two speeches that Patinkin is given to justify his actions. Unfortunately they move over into manipulated melodrama. The speeches are so overthetop they tend to place the movie on hold while Patinkin gives them. However the screenwriter is Walter Bernstein a talented man who was blacklisted for years. I'm more than willing to cut him some slack. I think The House on Carroll Street is a wellcrafted semiromantic thriller which doesn't use explosives well there's one cynicism or cumbersome back stories. It has two attractive and likable leads a plot with a message or two which keeps moving along and a bit of humor. It also has a happy ending which in one regard may be unexpected.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching beautiful women sneaking around playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy. So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.There are many allusions to different Hitchcock pictures not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the starring role. She is dressed up as Grace Kelly and she is not far off the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing.

So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.There are many allusions to different Hitchcock pictures not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the starring role. She is dressed up as Grace Kelly and she is not far off the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing.

Everything about this story of Kelly McGillis and FBI agent Jeff Daniels uncovering a scheme to smuggle postwar Nazis into the US disguised as dead Jews. Mandy Potinkin is the chief heavy but the sullen Nazis and their agents are all around hulking in doorways dressed in dark suits following the innocent McGillis around the streets of New York destroying furniture smoking in public and committing other unforgivable sins.Hitchcock was fond of pointofview shot and used them judiciously. They're notable here as well. McGillis slowly climbs the wooden stairway of a dangerous old house just like Lila in Psycho. She's also threatened while nude in the bathtub just like Marion in Psycho. And her name is Miss Crane just like Janet Leigh's. A scene takes place aboard the Chicago Express which bore Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint west. The couple tries to disappear in a theater crowd while being hunted by the bad guys. Cf. Saboteur Torn Curtain. The final chase takes place through a kind of national monument  not Mount Rushmore or the British Museum but rather Grand Central Station whose Oyster Bar I highly recommend. Potinkin winds up hanging hundreds of feet above the floor of the station holding on to a bank of chicken wire that slowly parts under his weight. He suffers the same fate as the villain whose jacket sleeve parts strand by strand until he falls from the Statue of Liberty in Saboteur.The plot I described briefly above is conjectural because it's never made entirely clear what's going on. Nobody sits down and explains carefully to McGillis exactly what the MacGuffin actually is. Peter Yates seems to have surrendered his own unique style and given us a pale imitation of De Palma's paler imitations.".

The storyline seemed watered down so as to dispense of matters such as a decent plot. Instead the film opts for a more lightweight approach giving us an Agatha Christie type lead character that is caught snooping into top secret government business the pace picks up but the film fails to grip the viewer in a way that creates tension or excitement. The ending was not bad but it all seemed like a straight to video movie that probably got released due to its star being in the box office hits Top Gun  Witness.

It's a well meaning return to the world of film noir that paints a fine picture of the dark world of McCarthyism and the still dangerous remaining members of the Nazi party in post war New York City. Kelly McGillis is a Life magazine photography editor fired after refusing to give names in the red scare. She is identified as a member of a subversive group out to improve society obviously no real threat but enough to make the government paranoid. A chance encounter with a young German immigrant brings her into real danger as the threats of a Nazi regrowth are revealed to her.For about the first 45 minutes the film seems to be going down all the right paths but all of a sudden it starts to become a bit convoluted and unbelievable. The film does remain suspenseful and features a fun late 40'searly 50's look at New York City. Subway stations haven't changed neither has Strand bookstore or off Broadway theaters. McGillis has a fine leading man with American agent Jeff Daniels boyishly sheepish but handsome and theater legends Mandy Patinkin and Jessica Tandy in major supporting roles. Peter Yates directs this modern film noir thriller with passion but something is clearly missing. I can say that I enjoyed this more the second time as opposed to back in 1988 when this hit the theaters. My rating hadn't changed but my observations about smaller details were greatly different.".

My son actually hooted and hollered when Sharkboy started fighting the plugs. He grabbed my shirt and motioned for me to watch even though I already was. I think I just witnessed my son discovering his first hero.My daughter laughed and laughed. She loved Lavagirl. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. And my daughter is old enough to understand the themes of pursuing your goals and remaining strong in the face of discouragement. So I think she walked away very pleased with the film.

My son actually hooted and hollered when Sharkboy started fighting the plugs. He grabbed my shirt and motioned for me to watch even though I already was. I think I just witnessed my son discovering his first hero.My daughter laughed and laughed. She loved Lavagirl. She thought it was hilarious when Lavagirl zapped Sharkboy because he said someone else was prettier. And my daughter is old enough to understand the themes of pursuing your goals and remaining strong in the face of discouragement. So I think she walked away very pleased with the film.

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't planned on wasting my time reviewing this mess but there are some subtleties that crept into my consciousness after the second forced viewing which may enhance a prospective viewer's experience.First of all this movie obviously was designed for younger kids. That fact alone has a detrimental effect on a review done by an adult as can be seen by previous reviews. However it should be noted that a movie for the target audience will most likely be attended by their parents or guardians and should be at least bearable for them also. This movie falls short in that regard.My son who is 5 absolutely raves about this movie and will no doubt wear out the DVD in the next few weeks. But my younger brother who is 17 walked out five minutes into it. Kids under 12 will probably be best entertained by Sharkboy  Lavagirl. It is a very colourful movie with a lot of motion and many bizarre graphics. There is nothing offensive in this movie by the way. Even the fight scenes are mild and clean.Now the main subtlety on my mind is that Sharkboy who was the best actor in this colourful but mindless drivel has obvious hidden talent. This movie however was not the right venue to expose that talent. Sharkboy moves well in action scenes and would be more aptly suited to a martial arts style role. Also Sharkboy has a wide range of facial expressions although the ones emphasised by this movie consisted mainly of scowls and frowns. With continued training suitable roles and of course and most importantly proper direction Sharkboy could go far with his acting career. Also he is a decent looking lad which seems to be a requirement for an acting career these days. I'm certainly hoping we'll be seeing more of Sharkboy in the future.Another noted item If you have the 2D version it seems to be far superior to the 3D. My son thought the glasses were fun the first time but after that he didn't want anything to do with them and now only watches the 2D version. Possibly this 3D effect is better if viewed in a theatre.I'm giving out a rating of 7 for this title simply because it certainly has the ability to entertain the kids...which was its purpose I'm sure. I would definitely recommend Sharkboy  Lavagirl if you have younger children. For adults it has no value whatsoever.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't remember the last time a movie confused and tormented my filmgoing soul as much as this movie did. Everything inside of me everything in me that loves Shawshank Redemption and Vertigo and Raging Bull and all these great great great classic movies tells me that Sharkboy and Lavagirl was awful. And it was. Drastically awful. And I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Let me try and explain it this way  I have written ongoing lists of the greatest films ever made and the worst films ever made and Sharkboy and Lavagirl is the only movie I've ever seen that has gotten a placement in both lists for me.Sharkboy is about a young child named Max who dreams up wonderful fantasies and adolescent superhero type adventures. Eventually he travels into this dream world aided by the aforementioned Sharkboy and Lavagirl as they fight to keep the dream world a happy go lucky place from the evil Mr. Electric. So there's the story. Simple childish and a bit reminiscent of Neverending Story. I knew this plot before my 6 year old cousin made me watch the film and I sighed. What a waste of two hours this would be. Then something strange happened. I got a chill. Then Lavagirl and Sharkboy appeared and took Max into their spaceship and I got more chills. Throughout the course of the movie especially in the end I was enthralled and received more goosebumps than when I watched Braveheart much to the embarrassment of my dumbfounded girlfriend.I have no idea how to explain my reaction to the film. I was pleasantly surprised obviously and I had a lot of fun watching the movie I'm excluding the terrible 3D version of the film which is a pointless distractor and takes away a lot of the magic. Then why am I only giving this movie 5 stars out of 10 a middling mark to avoid giving it a 10 or a 1? For the same reason why the movie is both on my list of most hated and most loved  it's a bad movie. To say it's a guilty pleasure to me would be underestimating guilt and pleasure. The script is silly the special effects are slapdash the editing is at times incoherent the acting is atrocious and there are moments where even my 6 year old cousin grimaced at the lame dialogue. But damned if this movie isn't a lot of fun.So I can't really recommend the movie to anyone over the age of 10. I still can't believe that I a 17 year old classic film lover enjoyed this movie as much as I did. But I can definitely tell that it's a movie younger kids especially boys for I'm pretty sure every boy this age has dreams and fantasies just like the ones in the film will love. I harkin this bizarre feeling I have for Sharkboy to when you find an old cartoon you used to love as a young child and watch it again. Even though you're reciting the lines and the songs like you did when you were young you know deep down that if it wasn't a childhood favourite and gave you so much nostalgia you'd hate it just as much as everyone else. This is what this movie was like for me. It was the childhood flick I never got to see. Maybe that warrants a recommendation. Maybe still not. I really don't know  you'll have to see it for yourself and find out.Or maybe not.".

As a mother and teacher I can tell you that while the characters and situations are unique they are also completely representative of the types of stories and imagination games that I have heard again and again.My own children have certainly created their own superheroes steeped in the same balance of derivative lore and imaginative elements that Sharkboy and Lavagirl possess. When faced with similar fantasies played out on screen my children responded gleefully. Heck even before we got the DVD home their imaginations had been so captured by what they read on the box that they could not stop discussing it. And once they had viewed the film the conversation continued and continued and continued!. Almost immediately characters from the film began showing up in my children's own pretending games only not quite as they had existed in the movie. The characters grew and evolved and were changed and fluffed until they fit seamlessly into my daughter's world of Sigalates and my son's Robotland.In other words the film did beautifully what all good fantasies do it inspired others to create examine and expand their own. In my opinion that is a near complete success.".

So I am a fan of what I feel he is trying to do.I saw the trailer for this movie and thought it looked well... like a bad idea. But then I heard that it was his son's idea and I did warm up to it. That said I didn't go to the theater expecting very much but I knew I wanted to watch it with the mindset of a child. I have a younger brother and now that I have seen it... I want to take him. But wouldn't have taken him without seeing it first as he is still quite young. So my girlfriend and I went and after a heated debate about film with some cinematic idiot while my girlfriend was in the washroom we went in to see what it was all about.So I'm not going to write out all the thing I liked it didn't like as a play by play on this movie. The one main thing that I really hated was the constant puns. But really if I was a kid I really think I would like it a lot. It didn't seem all that different to me than any of the spy kids and I plan on taking my little brother to see if my theory is true. The 3D worked on me and while things weren't flying in my face the whole time it did give the movie a strange depth.So what can I say I was in no way expecting cinematic brilliance but I did enjoy most of what I say created before me. I'm 20 years old and I think I understood what they were trying to do.So I don't know... give it a chance. Take a kid to see it or just try to enjoy it for what it is. But try to remember this when you are a kid your imagination is insane. My brother tells me the most foolish crazy stories... because he is a kid. The movie lets imagination run free and I think that is a good thing.".

But wouldn't have taken him without seeing it first as he is still quite young. So my girlfriend and I went and after a heated debate about film with some cinematic idiot while my girlfriend was in the washroom we went in to see what it was all about.So I'm not going to write out all the thing I liked it didn't like as a play by play on this movie. The one main thing that I really hated was the constant puns. But really if I was a kid I really think I would like it a lot. It didn't seem all that different to me than any of the spy kids and I plan on taking my little brother to see if my theory is true. The 3D worked on me and while things weren't flying in my face the whole time it did give the movie a strange depth.So what can I say I was in no way expecting cinematic brilliance but I did enjoy most of what I say created before me. I'm 20 years old and I think I understood what they were trying to do.So I don't know... give it a chance. Take a kid to see it or just try to enjoy it for what it is. But try to remember this when you are a kid your imagination is insane. My brother tells me the most foolish crazy stories... because he is a kid. The movie lets imagination run free and I think that is a good thing.";

Everyone thinks he's making them up until one day they show up to whisk him off to Planet Drool to help them fight the evil Mr. Electric George Lopez and Minus.The plot sounds like a film that only kids will like. However it has Rodriguez behind the camera and he did a good job with the first two Spy Kids movies. Unfortunately The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3D is no where near as good as his previous work. Besides for Rodriguez I didn't really have high hopes for the film Spy Kids 3D was awful and the trailers made this film seem like a joke. While watching the film I thought it really was a joke. It was really cheesy and it was quite bereft of entertainment. I was hoping the film would start picking up from the weak start. Unfortunately it didn't.The acting is horrible which is surprising since the kids in Spy Kids were pretty good actors. Taylor Lautner who plays Sharkboy does the worst job and he gives a really wooden performance. Taylor Dooley who plays Lavagirl isn't much better and her performance is pretty weak. George Lopez just makes a fool of himself and he gives an over the top performance. David Arquette and Kristen Davis both give decent performances but they don't really appear in the film. The lead who is played by Cayden Boyd also gives a wooden performance. I know they are just kids but their efforts felt a little weak.I am really disappointed with Robert Rodriguez. The direction was really weak and the editing seem to have been done by a child. He spent too much time on the style instead of the story. Sadly the film isn't even that stylish and it just looks like a mess. The story is pretty cheesy and lame. I know it was written by a kid but it was still pretty weak. Since the story is weak the film is very dull. The sad thing is that the movie is only 85 minutes long but it feels so much longer since there is very little here to actually enjoy. The special effects are also pretty bad and they left me with a headache. In the end this family film is better left on the shelf. Rating 210".

	schema:reviewBody "A colorful and occasionally imaginative film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl In 3D!!! is an overall disappointment a movie that had good intentions at the beginning but devolved into a cheesy message for our youth. The movie revolves around Max Cayden Boyd the pickedon grade school student who would rather create his own world rather than live in the real one. Of course he's picked on by class bully Linus Jacob Davich of course his parents are always fighting David Arquette and Kristin Davis and of course Max lives life as a miserable school student who has very little going for him. Writerdirector Robert Rodriguez formulated the entire movie from story to special effects based on inspirations provided by his children. There are reasons that most movies even the bad ones are not made by children. The movie is well meaning but relies on too many familiar story devices class bullies mean teachers quiet kids who save the day. We've seen this movie before but the colorful Super MarioMushroom Kingdomlike worlds that inhabit the movie does add some to the entertainment value. Max is taken to his dream world known as Planet Drool by Sharkboy Taylor Lautner and Lavagirl Taylor Dooley the two superheroes of the world. Each superhero contains some depth not as much as the superheroes in The Incredibles but the nice little subplot of each character trying to find their place in the world was a nice touch. For instance after one difficult scene to watch we now know Sharkboy cannot rap well at all. Otherwise the characters are each have one note. George Lopez hams it up most likely intentionally to offer a cheese element to this movie but I found his characters to be annoying. The movie's plot lacks any imagination and the world of Planet Drool does feature some creativity but not enough to save an otherwise pedestrian family feature. This movie is Rodriguez's second foray into the 3D genre and though I did not use the 3D glasses while viewing the movie the scenes accenting the technology are pretty obvious to the casual observer and distract from the overall viewing experience. I really enjoyed the visual style Robert Rodriguez employed in Sin City and that movie may have even been enhanced with a few 3D moments but Sharkboy and Lava girl was a move in the opposite direction for the maverick director.".

It's a ripoff of Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan and the only laughs are because of how annoyingly stupid this is. There are several horrid one liners told by SharkboyLavagirl's hair catches on fire and he says Let her cool off some steam. Any good reviews that you read of this are from kids 3 and under that learned to type or mentally disabled adults. David Arquette lends his bad acting to an extremely pointless and brainless part. I had to cringe when Sharkboy started singing an off tune and non sensible song. One of the lines from the song is Go to sleep you little bleep.....what? What's a little bleep? Also the 3D was horrible and was so dark that I could only stand the first 2 minutes of it then the glasses went off. All the other people in the theater were either sleeping or putting guns up to their heads if the movie didn't end in a minute. Don't see this horrible movie ever. After you see it you'll be depressed.My rating0F 90 minutesway too long. rated PG for poopy humor and some ugly computer generated action.".

Now I know why people complained. What a mess.All I can say is this Robert Rodriguez's cinematic prowess exceeds most theaters' current technology. This amazing kid's film is great fun when viewed digitally. Seeing the polarized version not yet shown outside Austin was like stepping inside a View Master projector  something I always wanted to do when I was a kid. Unfortunately what Robert has conjured up can't yet be seen the way he designed it. Someday soon perhaps! earlier comments posted in June 2005Little did I know yesterday that when my eightyearold granddaughter and I went to see The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3D we would be viewing a polarized print of the film made exclusively for the Austin premiere. As Robert Rodriguez explained what we were about to see there was no way to imagine beforehand how the 3D experience would be transformed by the killer combo of the polarized version shown on an IMAX screen through multiple DLPs. Once the movie started however I immediately realized I was watching something light years beyond anything I had yet seen. Trust me when I tell you that when Rodriguez waved his magic wand over the audience we caught an unforgettable glimpse of a child's dreams as well as the future possibilities of cinematic fantasy.Don't listen to those who say there's nothing new to be had here or that the story's derivative or it's just for kids. Forget what you hear from cynical reviewers unable to momentarily access their inner child. This story written by a kid for other kids hasn't been tainted by anyone's opinion about keeping the older filmgoers entertained through adultthemed inside references and innuendo.In making this film Robert Rodriguez has wisely protected and preserved his son Racer's unique vision without the addition of dumbeddown mature wisecracks. Mr. Rodriguez along with his producerwho just happens to be Robert's wife and Racer's mom Elizabeth Avelanknows that when it comes to children play is their work. By respecting and valuing the realm of childhood imagination this unique family team together share a story with us about the myriad ways creative thinking can impact the real world. Awe and wonder are not treated lightly here but rather offered to viewers in a much less adulterated form than that to which we have become accustomed. Today when I think about it I simply close my eyes and smile.".

There were some fun spots though.TRAVIS Most of the characters I hated. Too bad Mr. Electric didn't do away with some of em before he was defeated. They were weak and poorly acted...esp. Max. But I liked Sharkboy for the most part. He had that cocky attitude that sort of appeals to me. And although not original some of his oneliners were cool.ANNETTE Travis is a bit harsh as usual but I'll agree with him about weak and poorly acted characters. I couldn't even identify with Lavagirl although I thought she was quite attractive. Sharkboy was a really cute guy though. Mr. ElectricTeacher was nothing short of annoying.TRAVIS Story was really lame but it's probably good enough for younger kids. It pretty much bored me tho. Some of the 3d was okay and I noticed it looked a heck of a lot better on our LCD TV than the old one.ANNETTE Yes. The story was very weak. But it was colourful and as Travis noted should appeal to a younger audience. 3d was fun but not the best I've seen. We watched this on a 27inch LCD screen with quite nice results.ANNETTE I thought the scene where Lavagirl zaps Sharkboy out of jealousy was the cutest part of this movie. And the way Sharkboy copied the tone of the Jurassic Park character's false calm in his yell...scream comment when they were on the trainofthought was sort of humorous.TRAVIS Yeah Annette. You would like that zapping scene! My favourite scene was when Sharkboy says ouch with that shteating grin on his face when Lavagirl kisses him.Well anyhow as you can see we didn't totally abhor this movie. Although I think we both agree the only decent acting was by Sharkboy. For the most part this movie was boring. But that's most likely because we are too old for it. If you've got younger kids it will probably entertain them adequately. Avg. rating5.TRAVIS I rated this a 4 cause it seemed to be cranked out without much thought. With some extra work it could have been a lot better. The only reason it gets as high as a 4 is cause I liked Sharkboy.ANNETTE I rated this a 6 because it seemed to appeal to the audience intended. But I also agree that with more time and attention there certainly could have been a lot of improvement. Perhaps if Rodriguez decides to make a sequel he will obtain a better story with better actors and surprise us all.".
