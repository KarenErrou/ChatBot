	schema:reviewBody "What exactly is the sound of thunder? If this movie is any indication then it's the sound of moviegoers thundering towards the exit demanding their money back. Yes the movie is that bad.Hey Johnny how bad is it? This movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury wishes he could invent a time machine so that he could go back in time and NOT write the short story thus preventing this movie from ever being made.Whoa that bad? Worse. In fact this movie is so bad that Ray Bradbury might kill himself just so he can roll over in his grave. I know you think I'm trying to be cute but I'm being serious. This was one of the strangest movie experiences I've had in quite a while. The problem is that I went into the movie expecting to enjoy it. I thought it had the chance to be pretty good. So at the very start I was trying to make excuses for what was unraveling on screen.The first thing to induce unintentional laughter was the fact that Ben Kingsley the owner of the time traveling safari who's only interested in how much money he can make looks like Bob Barker. Nice poofy white wig Ben. Oh well no big deal I can laugh that off. Then we're introduced to the first CGI dinosaur of the movie. Hmm that sure looks really fake I thought. Oh I know! It's supposed to be fake. They're tricking the hunters into thinking the dinosaur is real but it's mechanical or something. Nope. Imagine my sheer horror when I came to the realization that the dinosaur was supposed to be real. Wow. At this point I started to get nervous.Then came the incredibly bad green screens. Folks these are some of the worst green screens I've ever seen. My words cannot do justice to how fake they looked. Some might even say they looked faker than those things Pamela Anderson tries to pass off as breasts. When you can tell that the actors are walking on a treadmill then you have serious issues that are long past addressing. I was absolutely shocked at what I was witnessing. Honestly I started to get confused and thought What in the world is going on? This movie cost 80 million to make there's no way it can look this bad. Where there's a will there's a way and somebody must've had a strong will to make this as cheesy and as goofy as they could because I cannot come up with any other explanation.I actually like the concept of the movie  the butterfly effect  the theory that something as small as a butterfly flapping its wings can produce longterm effects on a dynamical system. However this movie presents the theory in the most outlandish most unbelievable way imaginable. Sorry but I just didn't buy it. One of the scientists in the movie argues that if you kill a bee then that bee can't pollinate a flower and an animal will not be able to eat that flower thus that animal will die and can cause damaging longterm effects. Um if Flower A never blossoms then an animal that's hungry will just go find Flower B and eat that. I don't think the animal will immediately die AND CAUSE HUMANS TO TURN INTO ALIENLIKE CREATURES!!! Come on.So the movie decides to take the butterfly effect to the most extreme depths that it possibly can  fine whatever. What really bothered me is it doesn't care to explain why killing the butterfly resulted in the world being taken over by horribly rendered CGI creatures. It would have at least been nice to have an explanation as to why and how such drastic changes took place because of one simple butterfly.The butterfly would've been killed in a volcano that erupts right before they head back to the time machine anyway so how do you explain that? Well if your name is A Sound of Thunder then you don't. You just say Here's the premise now we're just going to become a monster movie and have the good guys be chased by bat monsters in the dark. Well I'd be interested in hearing what's said when this movie becomes one of the biggest if not THE biggest flops of the year.At about the halfway point I realized that there was no need to continue to rationalize why the movie appeared to be so bad. I accepted the fact that in this case appearances were not deceiving and this was just a really horrible movie. If you can accept that from the start then there is plenty of unintentional laughter to be had.Once our heroes started being chased by weird apebatdinosaur hybrids I just kicked back laughed and shook my head at the fact that the CGI is as bad if not worse than what you see in SciFi Original movies starring Lorenzo Lamas and Michael Par. I wish I were exaggerating.I honestly don't know how this movie was allowed to achieve such mediocrity. You know when one of the characters starts off with an American accent then begins to fluctuate between American and British accents and then eventually settles into her native British accent that everybody involved has obviously thrown in the towel and said Screw it let's just get this over with. You would think that in the year 2005 a movie with an 80 million budget wouldn't look more like a movie that was made on an 8 million budget. I'm sorry but CGI this awkward on this size of a budget is just inexcusable. Way to go Hollywood. We can only hope a few jobs are lost over this disaster.".

	schema:reviewBody "The possibilities of time travel make for complex science fiction. As one of SciFi's great writers Ray Bradbury saw the potential for making a point and used it to a frightening end. As a lameduck director Peter Hyams saw the opportunity to make one more project and maybe give his career some muchneeded resuscitation. The misaligned dichotomy simply results in a mess.In the mid21st Century Travis Ryer Ed Burns leads prehistoric hunting safaris from which the Time Safari groan company earns its bread and butter. Having seized the time machine built by Sonia Rand Catherine McCormack Charles Hatton Ben Kingsley built up his company to overcharge the indulgent rich who seek to have a new experience. On a trek with a pair of thrill seeking buddies a couple of things go wrong and although everyone survives the mistake causes changes in time and evolution. It is at this point where the noticeable deviation from Bradbury's story occurs. In the original tale there was no going back to fix the problem and the time travelers were left to face the horror of a world which had been subtly altered to permit ignorance bigotry and fascism to be the dominant qualities of mankind. In the hands of these screenwriters the mistake simply becomes a vehicle to generate a variety of creepycrawly monsters that stalk the people of the story as they try to literally race against time and fix the mistake.The script drags all the clichs out and leaves the actors to cover them. There is the greedy CEO the disillusioned scientist the noble hero loyal sidekick and even a corrupt official. The scientist expresses her outrage at the corporate abuse of her invention to the hero who is a better man than she expected. All the actors do everything they can to rail against the pitfalls they are presented with. Ed Burns conveys an easy hero's swagger and knows that he'll get more mileage out of underplaying than by shouting. Catherine McCormack does a highly competent job of spouting endless reams of technobabble while managing to sound like she actually knows what she is talking about but she and Burns simply have no romantic chemistry. How Academy Award Winner Ben Kingsley ended up as part of the production is anyone's guess but the quirks that he piles into the carnivalmouthed Charles Hatton are the single best bit of entertainment.Hyams fumbles the details to the point of insulting the audience. People make all sorts of irrational decisions just to forward the plot or introduce a set piece. When someone makes a mistake they usually recheck their work. Here the tech drops a piece of equipment and visibly damages it. He restacks it and ignores it. Even the hero at one point declares that the party must go down into the dark abandoned unstable and partly flooded subway tunnels because it's the only way. Presumably it's better to have the odds stacked against you where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures instead of staying on stable ground where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures. Although there isn't any sort of racial subtext the movie goes so far as to sacrifice the only major AfricanAmerican character as a distraction to hungry monsters so the white people can run for their lives. It doesn't seem to be making any sort of realworld point and the editor does struggle against this obviously outdated plot moment. However it ultimately plays out badly and without dignity. There is also no reason other than it looks cool to believe that changes in time would occur in visible waves of force that knock people and cars around but not buildings or animals. One can imagine that this might have been at least fun in the hands of a militantly perfectionist filmmaker like Jim Cameron who beats even clichd celluloid moments until they resound with the exact shape and feel he demands. In spite of making several films throughout the 90's and recent years Hyams peaked with 2010 The Year We Make Contact in 1984  while standing on Stanley Kubrick's cinematic shoulders. Even taking the troubled production history of A Sound of Thunder into account Hyams butchers the possibilities here.The audience is denied the simple delight of watching special effects during a scifi adventure because of the shoddy craftsmanship and a lack of money. Several virtual sets were created to make a more complete city of the future but they often look unrendered and more like a very good artist's drawing. However this is not a substitute for a good set and it is painfully clear when actors are standing in front of a green screen. This was originally slated for a 2003 release which would have put it ahead of the virtual productions of Sky Captain and Sin City. Had things not been derailed by the original production company's bankruptcy see the Thunder trivia section on IMDb.com then maybe this would have been noteworthy in its attempt to push special effects boundaries. Unfortunately for the filmmakers there were many times when the audience at this screening burst into laughter at some of the sights. The one thing that Hyams' FX team does get right is the gang of computergenerated creatures that should have been the design for the villain in his 1997 movie The Relic. As cool as the things look it is 8 years and 3 movies past due.Failures in effects and leaps of logic can be forgiven but only up to a point. This is not a misfire form an otherwise successful director. This is a poor turn by a weak hand who refuses to respect his characters or the audience who has come to be entertained. Only the actors make the weak production bearable. A Sound of Thunder got a second chance to pull things together but look into your own future and avoid watching this mistake.2 out of 10".

In the original tale there was no going back to fix the problem and the time travelers were left to face the horror of a world which had been subtly altered to permit ignorance bigotry and fascism to be the dominant qualities of mankind. In the hands of these screenwriters the mistake simply becomes a vehicle to generate a variety of creepycrawly monsters that stalk the people of the story as they try to literally race against time and fix the mistake.The script drags all the clichs out and leaves the actors to cover them. There is the greedy CEO the disillusioned scientist the noble hero loyal sidekick and even a corrupt official. The scientist expresses her outrage at the corporate abuse of her invention to the hero who is a better man than she expected. All the actors do everything they can to rail against the pitfalls they are presented with. Ed Burns conveys an easy hero's swagger and knows that he'll get more mileage out of underplaying than by shouting. Catherine McCormack does a highly competent job of spouting endless reams of technobabble while managing to sound like she actually knows what she is talking about but she and Burns simply have no romantic chemistry. How Academy Award Winner Ben Kingsley ended up as part of the production is anyone's guess but the quirks that he piles into the carnivalmouthed Charles Hatton are the single best bit of entertainment.Hyams fumbles the details to the point of insulting the audience. People make all sorts of irrational decisions just to forward the plot or introduce a set piece. When someone makes a mistake they usually recheck their work. Here the tech drops a piece of equipment and visibly damages it. He restacks it and ignores it. Even the hero at one point declares that the party must go down into the dark abandoned unstable and partly flooded subway tunnels because it's the only way. Presumably it's better to have the odds stacked against you where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures instead of staying on stable ground where you might run into bloodthirsty creatures. Although there isn't any sort of racial subtext the movie goes so far as to sacrifice the only major AfricanAmerican character as a distraction to hungry monsters so the white people can run for their lives. It doesn't seem to be making any sort of realworld point and the editor does struggle against this obviously outdated plot moment. However it ultimately plays out badly and without dignity. There is also no reason other than it looks cool to believe that changes in time would occur in visible waves of force that knock people and cars around but not buildings or animals. One can imagine that this might have been at least fun in the hands of a militantly perfectionist filmmaker like Jim Cameron who beats even clichd celluloid moments until they resound with the exact shape and feel he demands. In spite of making several films throughout the 90's and recent years Hyams peaked with 2010 The Year We Make Contact in 1984  while standing on Stanley Kubrick's cinematic shoulders. Even taking the troubled production history of A Sound of Thunder into account Hyams butchers the possibilities here.The audience is denied the simple delight of watching special effects during a scifi adventure because of the shoddy craftsmanship and a lack of money. Several virtual sets were created to make a more complete city of the future but they often look unrendered and more like a very good artist's drawing. However this is not a substitute for a good set and it is painfully clear when actors are standing in front of a green screen. This was originally slated for a 2003 release which would have put it ahead of the virtual productions of Sky Captain and Sin City. Had things not been derailed by the original production company's bankruptcy see the Thunder trivia section on IMDb.com then maybe this would have been noteworthy in its attempt to push special effects boundaries. Unfortunately for the filmmakers there were many times when the audience at this screening burst into laughter at some of the sights. The one thing that Hyams' FX team does get right is the gang of computergenerated creatures that should have been the design for the villain in his 1997 movie The Relic. As cool as the things look it is 8 years and 3 movies past due.Failures in effects and leaps of logic can be forgiven but only up to a point. This is not a misfire form an otherwise successful director. This is a poor turn by a weak hand who refuses to respect his characters or the audience who has come to be entertained. Only the actors make the weak production bearable. A Sound of Thunder got a second chance to pull things together but look into your own future and avoid watching this mistake.2 out of 10";

It sure seems like people both the pros on rottentomatos and the amateurs here are just trying to outdo each other in how nasty they can be. Let me hit the major objectionsThe time waves. Oh boy people hated the time waves. Too complicated and it was different than the previous movies they'd seen they said. I would point out that the timewave theory most recently appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who series and it made sense on its own terms. The movie took care to explain why the time waves could not be passed through and why the alternate travel at the end eliminated them. What else could you ask for? Would people prefer the lousy nonsensical fadeaway theory of Back to the Future? Or the Terminator style of just ignoring the paradox altogether? I for one like to see new scifi ideas when I watch scifi movies. The griping about the central plot innovation reminds of how people hated the original Ring movie for the idea of the enchanted videotape.The SFX. Granted they weren't at the level of Lord of the Rings but the movie did not cost as much as Lord of the Rings. For a movie that had so little money left over for post after the Czech floods destroyed the sets during shooting it's rather unfair to point out that there were only a handful of vehicle models and one of the street textures came from 3D Studio Max. The effects on the whole were far better than most of what we saw in the 1990s and they were considered adequate then. To say the SFX looked like cardboard cutouts? Give me a break. That kind of frothing at the mouth is not helpful in a review. Moreover the SFX always advance the plot which is something that can't be said for the Star Wars podrace or the Harry Potter Quidditch also known as the George Lucas et al. Bathroom Break.The acting. One of the previous comments glowingly referred to Ben Kingsley's work in Sexy Beast. Now that movie had the worst camerawork since Blair Witch and the most turgid obvious plot and the tardiest pacing of any movie I saw that year. If that person likes movies like Sexy Beast I believe the polite word for that kind of movie is dialoguedriven then it's their own damn fault for going to see a monster scifi movie. I believe the acting could be fairly described as competent  easily better than the Star Wars movies for example. Nobody is going to win an Oscar but on the other hand it doesn't star Russell Crowe.The script. I agree it could have used some editing but at no point do the characters act like complete idiots. I would have liked to have seen an explanation of why the expeditions never ran into each other until the end and why the main character just disappears at the end. But most if not all of the minor plot holes could have been resolved with better dialogue. For instance instead of wasting time saying roughly It will hurt when you're pulled twice the female scientist could have said when this machine shuts down this version of you will die. When they're going into the subway the main character could have said there are monsters up here and we would die there may not be monsters down there instead of whatever frivolous comment he made. In other movies much of the Matrix 2 and 3 or the ending of AI the plots simply made no sense on a first watching. It is better in my opinion to have a script that could use a little editing instead of one that completely bamboozles the moviegoer. Also the repetitiveness of the movie such as the apelizards which seemed to be everywhere seemed to be because of SFX shortbudgeting  they had a limited creature budget. As I said above I think it's a little unfair to criticize the movie for being lowbudget when on the whole it looks pretty good.I was glad to see a Bstyle scifi movie since its been months since the 2005 Doctor Who series finished. It had big sets famous secondtier actors and lots of SFX. The plot was miles better than the last four or five Star Trek movies to say nothing of Alien v. Predator and it's a shame that it will do so much more poorly just because it doesn't have a franchise attached to it.".

The Los Angeles Times said The picture looks as murky as its story line and most everything on the screen looks patently fake. CNN.com remarked 'Sound of Thunder' smell of garbage. But Variety.com summed it up nicely Every bit as bad as advance buzz has indicated... And then some.I first heard about this movie prior to its release on TVGuide.com's Coming Soon section. The singlesentence description suggesting a plot around time traveling safaris for the sole purpose of killing a Tyrannosaurus Rex that was going to die anyhow just seemed well a bit loopy at least for a major motion picture. So I read the short story by Ray Bradbury upon which the movie was supposedly based and even though I had a hard time visualizing such a story expanded to 2 hours of running and screaming on the big screen hoped for the best. After hearing and reading all of the dramatically poor reviews by movie critics and fans alike curiosity got the best of me. I wanted to know if it was really that bad.It is. It is every bit as bad. In fact a halfhour into the film I was completely alone free to yawn stretch scream at the top of my lungs and move about the theater.The basic premise is relatively simple as it was a short story to begin with. In the year 2055 time travel has been patented by a greedy businessman played by none other than Sir Ben Kingsley as he's credited sporting a white wig that one movie critic likened to a lump of cotton candy and yet another likened to a massive White Persian cat perched atop his head. I prefer the latter analogy. Time Safari Inc. offers rich people a chance to travel 65 million years into the past to kill  not hunt  dinosaurs already predestined to die at the same place and time. As long as the merry band of time travelers remains on a path resembling transparent liquid metal that hovers above the terrain and do not interfere with the environment in any way history and evolution as we know it are still preserved. Of course the rigid controls supposed to be in effect are futile against a cowardly inept rich snob who carelessly stomps on a butterfly.The Butterfly Effect is of course the theory that maintains that a butterfly's wings flapping on one side of the earth could eventually cause a hurricane thousands of miles away. In the movie the effect causes ripples in time i.e. a tidal wave in the form of a series of 'Time Waves' that exactly resemble and mimic the aquatic version visibly sweeping over the Windy City at distant intervals and knocking the main characters around in Matrixlike slow motion shots. Immediately following each successive time wave hideous distortions abound in the form of primordial and deadly vegetation halfprimate halfreptilian creatures with the need to feed on humans giant reptilian bats and not to be outdone a brief cameo by the maneating scarab beetles of 'The Mummy' fame. Seriously.But enough about the pathetically stupid script. I wanted to know if the special effects were really as bad as people claimed. At one point the camera tracks the two main stars Edward Burns and Catherine McCormack as they cross a busy futuristic street in one of the worst onscreen examples of greenscreen effects I have ever witnessed in a big budget movie. I can't readily explain it with words  when you see it you're simply distracted by how fake it is the rendering even the lighting contrast. In another reckless greenscreen scene Burns and costar Jemima Rooper whose native British accent keeps resurfacing throughout the movie are supposed to be walking along a sidewalk and immersed in conversation but are instead spitting out stupid dialogue while obviously stationary on a moving walkway. It's as if someone pulled the plug on the computers before CGI rendering was completed.In Sum 'A Sound of Thunder' is every bit as bad as the bad reviews have claimed. The script is stupid. The effects are deplorable. The acting? Who cares. It may not be nearly as bad as ''Manos' The Hands of Fate' but I would definitely consider it to be the worst movie of 2005 thus far and the worst movie I ever paid to see in a theater.".

The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventurous movie out of would you think. This movie however fails to entertain and I think that that is this movie biggest flaw. Perhaps it takes itself too serious and a little bit more humor certainly wouldn't had done the movie any harm.

Mainely Jurassic Park obviously.The characters also don't help to make the movie any more compelling or at least interesting to watch. I still think that Edward Burns did a fairly decent job as the 'heroic' main lead. The rest of the characters however really get muddled in into the movie and they get very little interesting to do. The movie rather relies on its visual which are extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very irritating character. Basically all her character does is complain and talk about how right she was and the rest oh so wrong. Her character just isn't a likable one. And the rest of the characters...well I already have forgotten their names I think that that is saying enough about them. It certainly is true though that Ben Kingsley's performance alone makes this movie worth watching. He is really excellent in his sort of villainous businessman role but from the moment when he disappears out of the movie the movie really goes downhill rapidly.Visually the movie is extremely poor. It has some dreadful looking CGI effects and they couldn't even get the more simple 'bluescreen' effects look convincing in the movie. The sets are also awful and cheap looking like they can fall over and break down every moment.The movie never gets tense exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible. It's a very distant movie with distant characters that fails to impress. There are plenty of action sequences but all of them are so ridicules looking and far from believable that they never get tense or good enough.So basically this movie is lacking in everything that is needed to make a genre movie like this one a good and successful one.

Poorly poorly poorly executed. The CGI dinosaur is a joke as are all the other creatures and the futuristic outside shots are so lame you can practically see the green screen outline on the actors. Shot during the 2002 flooding of Prague A Sound of Thunder was delayed for so long because the production company went bankrupt. And it shows.".

I couldn't give a rat's arse for the CGI  if a film is good it doesn't matter  but the insane contrivances drove me mad. I overlooked the whole way the team was worked and only mildly cringed at Ben Kingsley taking yet another nonsense film role like Species. The tripe he came out with was pathetic and actually beyond clichd  not a phrase I thought I would ever use and although admittedly he tried to inject humour into his ridiculous lines ultimately it was a pained delivery.

I don't I think need to say more. And the way they were continually chased by steroidridden mandrills and stupid giant bats just shoot it! And almost all the dialogue. And was there supposed to be some chemistry there? Missed that one. And the turning a university particle accelerator into a time warp device accurate to 1 minute in 150 million years and didn't they appear right there but back in time so how did trooping across the city put him back at the T Rex?....The more I think about this film the more I am coming to the conclusion that I have probably seen a worse film but I can't think what it is at the moment.

	schema:reviewBody "I wonder how the scriptwriters failed to miss this blindingly obvious plot hole but I really do have to point it out. The premise for this movie is the discovery of time travel and a rather original way to make it lucrative. By sending time tourists back in time to hunt Tyrannosauruses the company is providing a unique and profitable adventure. However they constantly remind their patrons not to touch anything not to stray off the path and not to influence in any way the past for fear of altering the future.As explained in the movie killing a single bee 65 million years ago could deprive a flower from being pollinated and hence not provide an animal with food then a prey from a meal etc. etc. all the way down the 65 million year old road. Of course any animal will simply eat the flower next to it if one didn't get pollinated but that is not the plot hole to which I am referring. This concept of causing vast changes via a very small and insignificant event is called the Butterfly Effect. And this movie bashes you on the head with that analogy.In order to dramatically alter the future one of the characters actually steps on and kills a butterfly gee how obvious a Butterfly Effect is that? thereby changing the past and violently causing the downfall of mankind. That may be a bit of a stretch to say the least but there was also the matter of the volcano. The company picked a moment in time where a Tyrannosaurus Rex gets trapped in a tar pit and dies anyway therefore shooting it first with ice bullets in no way alters its fate and thus avoids any conundrums for the future. Also they picked a moment 5 minutes before a volcano blows in order to provide a margin of safety should anything go wrong or get left behind the volcano will wipe it out anyway. There is even a dramatic scene with the hero returning to the present day in the nick of time just as the destruction wrought by the volcano arrives to wipe out everything in the past. Do you see the problem here? How in the world could stepping on a single butterfly one minute before it was to be incinerated by a volcano have any impact at all on the future? Even if some butterflyeating predator was deprived of a meal the movie demonstrated in intimate detail that the volcano wiped out everything including the butterfly and anything within 100 miles that was planning on eating it! So a butterfly living one minute less than fate had provided for it is supposed to turn the Earth into a paradise of monkeylizards? That makes no sense at all! People who see this movie are expected to be pretty loose with the plot after all they have to accept time travel and all the conundrums that evokes. But I still find it amazing that the single event on which the entire movie is premised is so fundamentally flawed.Other reviewers have commented on the fantastically bad special effects but at least one of them provided an explanation. Apparently the production company decided to screen test the movie prior to putting the finishing touches on the effects. When the abysmally bad response came back they threw in the towel rather than throw good money after bad and the effects were never improved upon. Too bad the dinosaur wasn't that bad neither was the actual event which projected them back in time. There was a hilarious greenscreen on the sidewalk scene which was so poorly done it was incredibly obvious that the actors were walking on a treadmill. A few finishing touches would certainly have improved the whole but the plot would still have bite marks large enough to fall through. Ha ha.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I've found the scathing reviews and remarks about this film here and on Rotten Tomatoes to be very amusing I have to say that I can't quite fathom where all the anger and disgust comes from. It's as if certain films are doomed before their release  critics decide they are going to hate it before they even make it through the opening credits or often before they even walk into the theater. Sometimes the derision is justified  Aeon Flux deserved most of the poor reviews it received  but often a film is never given a fair chance. I feel that is the case here.Note that I say this even though I don't care that much for Ed Burns and never have  I hated him in 15 Minutes hated him in Confidential and pretty much consider him one of the most overexposed overrated young actors in the last 510 years. I imagine he has his fans and followers and I admit he's a pro level actor but I can take or leave his onenote selfimportant cocksure screen persona. And yes the special effects are less than totally convincing . There were lots of moments where the textures weren't especially good like they needed to make a couple more passes with the renderers and lots of minor glitches and badly matched green screens that jarred my eyes. But if you don't actively look for the glitches and just accept what you see uncritically they work fine. Ang Lee's much ballyhooed Hulk effects were at least this problematic whenever the Hulk figure had to interact with live actors and that film was hyped as a masterwork of special effects several years ago. The cast and the acting in general is no better than it has to be for which I blame the director and the script because a few of the supporting players obviously have some juice and charisma given the right settings and dialog. McCormick especially seems to be struggling with a thankless role and even under that burden she's the most interesting thing in the film. Most of the time though the actors are stuck with unconvincing dialog and set speeches or else they have to mouth derivative clichs you've heard too many times before. The script also didn't really play fair with the mechanism or the logic behind the time waves rigorous logic doesn't seem to be a strong suit for Hyams in science fiction settings see Outland and Supernova for similar examples of lazy holefilled plotting. But even with all these strikes against it when I finally got around to viewing Thunder on DVD I found it was a decent little romp. Nothing to get excited about but nothing to despise either. I tend to think of it as equivalent to something like The Rock's The Scorpion King  the standard bases are covered the standard moves are made and hardcore scifi fans will get their movie fix for a bit long enough to make to the next bit of sci porn like Aeon Flux UnderworldEvolution or Ultraviolet. I spent 5 to buy this used on DVD the DVD was a very barebones package BTW with only two theatrical trailers and subtitles for extras and decided I was satisfied and had gotten my money's worth. In fact I might even watch it again sometime in the future during a science fiction film marathon with some friends. People who spent 812 including popcorn to see this in the theaters...may well have been disappointed. All I can say is judge for yourself. If you see A Sound Of Thunder on the racks at your local Blockbuster and you are in the mood for a middling scifi adventure film you may enjoy it if you give it a chance.".

It's as if certain films are doomed before their release  critics decide they are going to hate it before they even make it through the opening credits or often before they even walk into the theater. Sometimes the derision is justified  Aeon Flux deserved most of the poor reviews it received  but often a film is never given a fair chance. I feel that is the case here.Note that I say this even though I don't care that much for Ed Burns and never have  I hated him in 15 Minutes hated him in Confidential and pretty much consider him one of the most overexposed overrated young actors in the last 510 years. I imagine he has his fans and followers and I admit he's a pro level actor but I can take or leave his onenote selfimportant cocksure screen persona. And yes the special effects are less than totally convincing . There were lots of moments where the textures weren't especially good like they needed to make a couple more passes with the renderers and lots of minor glitches and badly matched green screens that jarred my eyes. But if you don't actively look for the glitches and just accept what you see uncritically they work fine. Ang Lee's much ballyhooed Hulk effects were at least this problematic whenever the Hulk figure had to interact with live actors and that film was hyped as a masterwork of special effects several years ago. The cast and the acting in general is no better than it has to be for which I blame the director and the script because a few of the supporting players obviously have some juice and charisma given the right settings and dialog. McCormick especially seems to be struggling with a thankless role and even under that burden she's the most interesting thing in the film. Most of the time though the actors are stuck with unconvincing dialog and set speeches or else they have to mouth derivative clichs you've heard too many times before. The script also didn't really play fair with the mechanism or the logic behind the time waves rigorous logic doesn't seem to be a strong suit for Hyams in science fiction settings see Outland and Supernova for similar examples of lazy holefilled plotting. But even with all these strikes against it when I finally got around to viewing Thunder on DVD I found it was a decent little romp. Nothing to get excited about but nothing to despise either. I tend to think of it as equivalent to something like The Rock's The Scorpion King  the standard bases are covered the standard moves are made and hardcore scifi fans will get their movie fix for a bit long enough to make to the next bit of sci porn like Aeon Flux UnderworldEvolution or Ultraviolet. I spent 5 to buy this used on DVD the DVD was a very barebones package BTW with only two theatrical trailers and subtitles for extras and decided I was satisfied and had gotten my money's worth. In fact I might even watch it again sometime in the future during a science fiction film marathon with some friends. People who spent 812 including popcorn to see this in the theaters...may well have been disappointed. All I can say is judge for yourself. If you see A Sound Of Thunder on the racks at your local Blockbuster and you are in the mood for a middling scifi adventure film you may enjoy it if you give it a chance.";

In one scene they couldn't sync up the speed of two characters walking with the speed of the sidewalk going by. There were scenes in which you could clearly see where the set ended and the green screen picked up. If this was a big budget film then I pity the fool that funded it. The directing was also awful. The feeble attempts to jolt the audience with pathetic scare tactics left me rolling in my seat with laughter. I would give this movie one star. The only reason that it even gets the one star is that this could be a good movie to rent with your friends if you're looking for a good laugh.".

However all the while Dr Rand faced every challenge with the savvy of a seasoned pro understanding the physics of it all with a clarity that the audience unfortunately were left to envy.

While this is a convenient plot device as it allows our heroes enough time to resolve the problem it makes no sense whatsoever.

The fact that the moth was projected forward in time may give it some credibility but the life of that moth 65 million years ago was significantly altered ergo any change to evolutionary history would have begun then and not be dependent upon a return to our current time.To solve the problem the team goes back in time to prevent the change in variable from ever happening. By doing this successfully we see that the changes to evolution never happened and that noone even remembers the events! Surely what works for the solution should work for the original change?

It cant pollinate a flower that some animal would snack on. Neither the butterfly nor the plantlife would survive!! How can changing the past influence the future in waves? What determines the time interval of these waves? Why would you remember what reality used to be like if it no longer exists? Besides wouldn't this cause an ambiguity in the time loop? If the present is different how can one go back to the past  alter it? One more thing if there were no builders since homosapiens apparently don't evolve in the new reality why are the buildings still standing?The special effects were not that great beginning with the first scene from the past looks like something from Jumanji. The acting was really not that great either. I would expect to be more panicked and yes cursing sweating profusely and perhaps angry to boot if I'm being chased by carnivores! The mouthtomouth in the water filled subway tunnel was laughable. And even though Ed Burns looked great with his permanent stubble he lacked the raw sensuality or intensity of say Richard Gere who he resembles remarkably. The only saving grace of this movie as far as I'm concerned is that it is set in the future Chicago. Always nice to see renditions of that as in I Robot.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film yesterday and was a bit excited when I remembered the name being the same as that of the Ray Bradbury story it's based on hoping that at least a fairly good interpretation could be made. Boy was I wrong. I was almost completely aghast at the painfully obvious green screen scenes most especially early on when Edward Burns and that one girl are facing the camera and walking towards it on a frickin' treadmill! I did like the futuristic city look and some of the car designs and wasn't too surprised to see so many cabs of the same design either. After all how many cabs of the model featured in Taxi Driver have there ever been in big cities? However the subway trains were also painfully obvious miniatures. And if this is supposed to be 50 years in the future then why do they still use keyboards on their computers instead of flat panel screens like those we first saw on Star Trek The Next Generation? Anyway it's very hard to do a decent time travel story all of the Star Trek spinoffs all too often fell back on that tired plot device more often to ridiculous resolutions than not and it was unbelievable that the company would only take people back to the exact same point of time when the party kills the Allosaurus I never knew they had twin red crests on their heads I guess it was to differentiate them from the even more popular TRexes because in reality they'd just keep running into themselves back then which would then create multiple time lines! Of course they conveniently ignored that little tidbit till later on when it was more important to the storyline.The Allosaurus looking huge and mean and so obviously fake the Jurassic Parks dinos were far superior! most likely probably would've just started eating everyone instead of waiting around for them to kill it moments before it would've otherwise died anyway so there was no tension there for me. Well tension of waiting for the stupid thing to start eating those idiots. The evolved baboon hybrid characters were interesting in concept but just looked and moved too unrealistically.This film fails so badly on so many levels that I'm not sure I'd even recommend anyone rent it on DVD no matter how much extra content may be included like deleted or restored footage. After all why waste anymore time watching this drivel than you could help? Bradbury should've had more of a hand during production of this film to make sure that it was more accurate to his short story like the episode of some scifi series Showtime's The Outer Limits perhaps? that I seem to recall doing a much better version of it.".

Anyway it's very hard to do a decent time travel story all of the Star Trek spinoffs all too often fell back on that tired plot device more often to ridiculous resolutions than not and it was unbelievable that the company would only take people back to the exact same point of time when the party kills the Allosaurus I never knew they had twin red crests on their heads I guess it was to differentiate them from the even more popular TRexes because in reality they'd just keep running into themselves back then which would then create multiple time lines! Of course they conveniently ignored that little tidbit till later on when it was more important to the storyline.The Allosaurus looking huge and mean and so obviously fake the Jurassic Parks dinos were far superior! most likely probably would've just started eating everyone instead of waiting around for them to kill it moments before it would've otherwise died anyway so there was no tension there for me. Well tension of waiting for the stupid thing to start eating those idiots. The evolved baboon hybrid characters were interesting in concept but just looked and moved too unrealistically.This film fails so badly on so many levels that I'm not sure I'd even recommend anyone rent it on DVD no matter how much extra content may be included like deleted or restored footage. After all why waste anymore time watching this drivel than you could help? Bradbury should've had more of a hand during production of this film to make sure that it was more accurate to his short story like the episode of some scifi series Showtime's The Outer Limits perhaps? that I seem to recall doing a much better version of it.";

The idea that changing even a minute part of history would affect all subsequent history is worth exploring.A Sound of Thunder is a whimper and should be sent back in time to the '50's where poor production values were valued in B movies. In this film there is no satire of the genre not anything to indicate the filmmakers were even making fun of themselves".

	schema:reviewBody "After hearing about how awful A Sound of Thunder was I decided to see it in the theater just to have a good time and laugh at something horrible. I got what I was looking for. Warning Mild Spoilers Ahead  One of the most laughable aspects of the movie was the excessive and quite possibly the worst greenscreen use I've ever seen. Even for a movie that was supposed to be released in 2003 the special effects are ludicrous. Every scene that takes place outdoors in 2055 is greenscreened in such a bad way that there's absolutely no way to cover it up. The cars look like they were designed by a 2 year old with a Lego set. The Allosaurus looks like it was pulled straight from a PlayStation 1 cutscene movie and the way it acts when things get screwy is hilarious. There is also no explanation of the solid waterlike walkway how in the hell the government would have ever passed a time travel device that could be so dangerous how Dr. Lucas manages to avoid the plant that grabs his gun how the buildings were destroyed etc. Popcorn flick all the way.The only reason I have given this film a 2 instead of a 1 is because of the apelizards and IMDb has a picture of one on the Photos page. Other than that the creators of the movie give you one beastie for each area of earth air land water and plants. People die of course in a way that is pure Hollywood and you'll understand what I mean if you see this piece of trash.Overall the movie was made to entertain not to make you think. Yes there is some easily forgettable dialog involving apparently deep scientific theories but they only scratch the surface of interest and they are quickly wrapped up and brushed away for action to keep the audience from thinking too much about the fact that time travel as we now know it is basically impossible. Throw in cheesy dialog awful editing gigantic plot holes the worst CGI and greenscreening in years a hunk and some largebreasted women futuristic Super Soakers and you get the worst film of the decade.".

The tone of this film with the lives of two young gymnasts at its center is straightforward and unpreachy. Aside from brief glimpses of the obligatory posters condemning the U.S. masses in blue suits swearing allegiance to the socialist cause and abundant references to the General what we mostly see are the two girls and the intimate details of their lives singing karaoke with their families preparing for school in the morning being chided for not eating their breakfast or doing their homework and struggling through hours of exhausting gymnastic practice. There is also the spectacular dizzying footage of the mass games which alone would be worth the movie ticket. There was never the feeling that this is meant to be an insidelook even though the film does owe much of the fascination surrounding it to its subject matter. It was enlightening and entertaining to see what life is like in Pyongyang but to approach this film as simply a bit of cultural curiosity is to miss the richer experience it offers one that had me rooting and fretting for the two girls as they approach their final performance and hoping that their wish to perform in front of the General comes true.".

However there were also veiled criticisms of North Korean life but it required having to listen carefully as the comments were rather veiled. In particular some of the comments made by the parents related to recent tough times when food was in short supply and of poor quality.In itself such a comment means very little to an audience in a Western democracy but in North Korea such a comment could've had the family sent to a concentration camp for implying that North Korea was not always the land of plenty.It's true this documentary is full of propaganda but it certainly isn't a propaganda film aimed at painting North Korea in a positive light.

And it is clear that the movie is made by people who do not live in that same regime. The filmmakers look at the human 'weak' side of these people instead of just showing these people as role models. The North Korean government would see these people as becoming a glorious unified whole during these games. We see them as robots and slaves to a corrupt regime that doesn't care about them.It is like British people visiting and making documentaries about the Nazidevotees in the late 30s Germany.

This film let an insider see what its like in a country that only exists with in itself without all of the trends and the typical attitudes by the people you will find in the USA. I can understand their hatred and frustration towards the land of the free and it was just magical to me to see what these people are about and what they truly stand for and what they believe. My argument has always been the US wouldn't like it if other nations invaded them and tried to control their way of life so why do they think they can do it to other nations. Whose Washington to say North Koreas wrong?? When it all comes down too it united states citizens are just as brainwashed as any other nation about what is right or wrong but the film is very good and it gives you a look at a country that is basically a secret to the western world.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film does NOT show what ordinary North Koreans go through. It focuses on an a family of the communist elite in Pyongyang who by western standards are filthy rich because they actually have some rice and meat for dinner. Give me a damn break. In order to live in Pyongyang where this film was shot you need to be a member of the communist party. You need to prove your allegiance to the communist party. In order to do that you will probably need to inform on other people who will end up in a gulag and will die of starvation beatings exposure or other privations if you are not outright executed. The informant is a murderer by proxy.The film follows the lives of just such people. Some may be brainwashed. Some know exactly what they're doing. Some put decency to the wind and will do anything they can to survive. It's called dog eat dog. No Korean pun intended. Of course this all throws in the question of how exactly a UK crew was given access to a completely closed society a society that could violently collapse at the drop of a dime if it had more information to the outside world. Could it perhaps be that these dunderheads are actually sympathetic to the murderous regime of JongIl? All signs point to yes. At the very least they consider this just a 'different system' of life. Just like living in your own house with your wife and kids is 'different' from being in solitary confinement in a state penitentiary... at best.If the filmmakers had any integrity heart soul or bravery they would have gone against all odds to expose the horrors that occur on a daily basis in this awful place. The concept of the socalled mass games as a tool for brainwashing  which is exactly its purpose  could have been shown for the sham that it is but instead is given a nice glossover in this rubbish film. The director's commentary on the DVD is the prize winner. He actually states something to the like of I am just trying to show ordinary people in DPRK and it's just a different system. Well the Third Reich was a different system too.Please try to keep your eyes open people! Relativism in the face of abject evil will make you the first in line under the firing squad when the bullshit artists come to power.".

	schema:reviewBody "I only began to know a bit more about North Korea thanks to my school's past social studies and history classes where at both times the Korean War was mentioned and being discussed. It was like few years back but at times it kept ringing in my head.Maybe because since some time back there has been those news reports on the tearful reunions and meetings between the ordinary families of the two Koreas. And also with all that 'Korea wave' happening in terms of its pop culture especially and the media liberation in South Korea she is slowly starting to present some of its darkest moments in its history onto the screen.Just like before the start of the documentary which I saw on the Discovery Channel it stated that North Korea is the least visited least known and the least understood nation in the world. I have to agree with my heavy heart it's true. Speaking from someone who was once a History student it's very saddening to at times for me to read of stories of how life is like in North Korea through the papers. It's not that I want to condemn the western media but then the world is just like that.Are you able to determine where you should be born? If you are born into a country which has a very different system of government which may deemed socalled 'evil' to the outside world there is no way out. Unless you know how to do something about it.This documentary follows two girls one belonging to the workers' class and the other  the intellectuals' class being raised in different backgrounds in the capital of Pyongyang and how they are preparing for their country's most spectacular and wellknown event to the outside world  the Mass Games. It's kind of interesting to know that in the country itself it has three classes  the peasants the workers and the intellectuals.For all those who said that this documentary is all about propaganda and stuff like that  open your eyes please. Which is why I said earlier it's not that I don't want to condemn the western media on their portraying of the secretive state actually. I kind of know the feeling because living here in Singapore for my entire life I am more or less aware how those western media at times see us. Making all our democratic system of government sounding as if it's not what a democratic country should be. As it's often being said  'When in Rome do as the Romans do.' How can you expect everyone to follow your style of democracy? Back to the case of North Korea. It's kind of like a big opener to know how living in the capital is like and how kids like one of the girls being featured for this documentary went about in their daily school life. Maybe ordinary Americans may kind of wonder why the North Koreans as being shown in this documentary always blame them for whatever faults they have like one of the families blaming the Americans for their constant blackout in the house but then it's like I don't know...the North Koreans are being brought up in a way that America is their biggest enemy and it stands everything what they disagree upon.It's all comes back to a case of ideology. History has shown us what communism can do as it does for Russia and its eastern European neighbours once. But in the case of North Korea its citizens had been taught to think in that manner. I know propaganda is involved given it showed how they really respect their leader.Sadly propaganda is everywhere though we may not want to admit it at times. I had heard the propaganda word umpteen times in my past History classes that I don't even want to think about it. We should at least count ourselves lucky we are living in a civilised world.Overall this is one documentary which shows how life is like in one of the least visited least known...and the least understood nations in the world.".

This is a working class family in the capital  nothing more nothing less. Note how they compensate for lack of water at times by storing water in the bathtub and how the commentator explains the rationing of foods. There is no glossing over at all. The only point I thought rang a bit false was the school trip to Mount Paekdu which happened to include the two heroines of the film even though they were not in the same year and the younger was a very mediocre student according to her own teacher. That was probably arranged to organize some nice footage and a neutral topic.".

It shows that even though they are worship their leader under a bunch of lies they all seem content and happy cause that is all they know. It is focused on everyday life there as is and not so much about how the leader is this God like figure. It's there but not as prominent. I really wonder what became of these girls and their family.

He swallowed what the Communist party told him hook line and sinker.And in doing so he has become an enabler if not an accomplice to the starvation and purposeful killing of hundreds of thousands if not millions of brainwashed North Korean citizens.If you want a real idea of what life is like in North Korea I recommend Dispatches Undercover in the Secret State. This documentary...this aiding and abetting to the slaughter of innocents should be burned on a pyre before being buried in the earth.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Daniel Gordon made films that didn't take place in North Korea we'd probably never notice them. His often tedious straightforward style seems to fit in with North Korea's propagandistic notions of what makes a good film. Gordon's films are watchable only because he has incredible access to one of the most closed societies in the world. People are fascinated by North Korea and will watch almost anything that comes out of there if only to learn more about what makes the place tick. A State of Mind is a mediocre film about what it means to be loyal to Kim Jong Il and Gordon merely tells it like it is which is commendable. But Gordon's use of voiceover and his very sedentary style of filming bog the film down. His almostexclusive access to North Koreans' daily life will give him a niche for years to come or at least until the North Korean government collapses. One also wonders however if Gordon might one day be accused of being the Leni Riefenstahl of North Korean filmmaking. Riefenstahl was the infamous filmmaker who made propaganda films for Adolf Hitler. Her most famous one is titled Triumph of the Will and after WWII until she died just a few years ago she was forced to deal with the legacy of having propped up a leader who is about the closest thing to the devil the world has ever seen. Gordon's closeknit ties to the North Korean regime and his attempts to portray North Korea as a normal country with people who are healthy and happy could land him in hot water someday especially since rumours now swirl about death camps in the socalled Democratic People's Republic of Korea DPRK and there is absolutely no doubt that labor camps for political prisoners already exist.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't like to politicize my reviews. I have found that in practically ever land there are amazingly good filmsregardless of the political tensions between my country and theirs. For example although things are a bit tense now with Iran this nation has made some wonderful filmssuch as the films of Majid Majidi which manage to transcend nations and ideologies. So if you are willing to be openminded and look you can find good everywhere in my opinion. However this is a difficult proposition with North Korea. They don't seem to be making movies and there simply is almost no opportunity to look into their culture to see what the nation is like as there simply is almost nothing going in or out of this isolated nation. However back about a decade or so ago a few small glimpses occurred and A State of Mind is one of them. Like it or not for now this is all we appear to have from which we can learn about this nation. And because of that I think it's well worth seeing.A State of Mind is a film made by a British production company. They were invited to the nation to follow several girls as they prepared for the 'Mass Games'. These games are ENORMOUS pageants in which many days of mass parades and performances are done to honor their leader. Some of these HUGE spectacles required 80000 people and millions of man hours according to the film!! The devotion and energy of the participants is difficult to imagine in our Western cultures and I would never imagine folks I know joining in a massive celebration in which the individual is sublimated to the glory of the State. It's just so very foreignand this is what makes the film hard to stop watching. It is almost like looking onto an alien cultureand this is NOT meant as a criticism at all. What I liked best is that the narrators didn't overnarrate or opine about the nation. Instead they mostly just showed the people and let them talk. Now I might have liked to have heard about the restrictions placed on the filmmakerssuch as where they could and couldn't visit and questions they could or could not ask. But this is really not all that importantwhat IS important is that it gives you a glimpse of what is going on in North Korea. See it and learn.By the way the reason I didn't score this one a bit higher is that I do think that perhaps TOO MUCH of the parading was shown. It became tiresome to watch the girls practicing again and again and again and again for months. However even this was interesting in a wayimagine how this was for these thousands and thousands of kids who did this! Wow....Another documentary filmed in North Korea by Western filmmakers was National Geographic's Inside North Koreaabout a group of doctors who came to the country to perform free eye surgery for many blind North Koreans. It is fascinatingperhaps more so than A State of Mind as the now sighted folks did not thank their doctors when their bandages were removed but immediately ran to a poster of their leader Kim Il Sung and began crying hystericallythanking HIM for the restoration of their sight.".

Kris Kristofferson however is a multisubstance abuser and because we're talking about the rock scene has the groupies attached to him. Unlike in the other two versions Streisand catches him with one and the whole thing about the pure love loses its potency because of it. However the incident does set him up for his final moment of self destruction.All the supporting characters from the other two versions are completely eliminated. Gary Busey has a nice role as Kristofferson's music arranger who fulfills many of the functions that eliminated characters from the other versions have. The rest of the film's supporting parts are very undefined which makes this version weaker than the others.But for those who are interested in hearing Barbra sing A Star Is Born will more than satisfy you. The film got an Oscar for the song Evergreen which Kristofferson and Streisand duet and it became one of her best selling records. Judy Garland was similarly served in her version with The Man That Got Away although that song was nominated and did not win.A Star Is Born is an enduring tale and I don't think we've seen the last of it. May the next group of players do the story as much justice as the three pairs of costars I've cited.".

	schema:headline " The Ultimate Wallow for Barbraphiles...Watch Closely Now as the New DVD Has Solid Extras";
	schema:reviewBody "Thirty years after its initial release the third version of A Star Is Born finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers the feminist anthem Woman in the Moon from this 1976 film. Easy to dismiss the movie's careerpolarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywoodstyle clichs that variations of it exist in other films including Streisand's own Funny Girl. This time reset to the thencontemporary music scene the timeworn plot follows selfdestructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deepdive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break.Troubles dog their courtship from the outset as John Norman both names please responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution. To John Norman Esther represents his last shot at happiness and in turn she is drawn to the innately decent creative musician underneath the faade. In the movie's most pivotal scene he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert and her career takes off. Inevitably he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success and if you are familiar with any version of this story you know the rest. Directed by Frank Pierson although Streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display the film still manages to draw me in even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative. It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.Although Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly. The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporaryoriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock. From the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the Oreos she can't help but come across as an established star. I can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes Esther more strident than poignant when John Norman's woes become overwhelming. This creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than Esther's response to it. This is capped off by an uninterrupted eightminute closeup of her memorial performance  great except when she regrettably mimics John Norman's style toward the end.Kristofferson on the other hand gives a superb performance throughout managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love pride and resentment toward Esther. He makes his vodkasoaked onstage growling work within this context. Otherwise what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals. The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Norman's levelheaded manager Brian and Gary Busey as his cynical band manager Bobbie. Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print. A big seller in its day the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970's  some songs still quite good Everything Woman in the Moon Watch Closely Now some that have moved to kitsch Queen Bee Kenny Loggins' I Believe in Love and of course the inescapable Evergreen.The print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering. Streisand's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her featurelength commentary. She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film the casting and the reportedly troubled production. She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie's producer and her dissatisfaction with Pierson as a director. I just wish she could have provided more scenespecific comments that directly relate to what is on screen. She also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her e.g. it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of Peters. I think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her.There is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes especially Kristofferson's mixedfabric poncho and orange polyester shirt. There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisand's optional commentary. One is a comic breadbaking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies. Another is an extended scene in which she plays Evergreen on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep. The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts which I agree with Streisand should have been used. Fittingly the theatrical trailers for all three versions of A Star Is Born are also included.".

	onyx:emotionText "Thirty years after its initial release the third version of A Star Is Born finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers the feminist anthem Woman in the Moon from this 1976 film. Easy to dismiss the movie's careerpolarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywoodstyle clichs that variations of it exist in other films including Streisand's own Funny Girl. This time reset to the thencontemporary music scene the timeworn plot follows selfdestructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deepdive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break.Troubles dog their courtship from the outset as John Norman both names please responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution. To John Norman Esther represents his last shot at happiness and in turn she is drawn to the innately decent creative musician underneath the faade. In the movie's most pivotal scene he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert and her career takes off. Inevitably he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success and if you are familiar with any version of this story you know the rest. Directed by Frank Pierson although Streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display the film still manages to draw me in even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative. It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.Although Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly. The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporaryoriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock.

	schema:reviewBody "To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second closeup followed by another twoandhalfminute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand  striking a Christlike pose  behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record.Or think about this The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars yet while Streisand's songs are performed in their entirety  including the interminable finale  her costar Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties do they actually sing a duet.Or consider this Streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times including taking credit for musical concepts and her wardrobe from her closet  and she also allegedly wanted but failed to get codirecting credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer with a producer credit going to her thenboyfriend and former hairdresser Jon Peters. As such Streisand controlled the final cut of the film which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it doesn't explain is how come given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisand's greatest box office hits it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance.Anyway moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sexdrugsandrock'n'roll Streisand plays Esther Hoffman a pop singer on the road to stardom who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson's John Norman Howard a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Hasbeenville. In the previous incarnations of the story Norman Maine sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer Vicky Lester achieve her success. In the feminist seventies Streisand  Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man so the trajectory is skewed she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one he's a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher but almost ruthless while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit.Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material making little attempt to give much of a performance and oddly it serves his aimless listless character well. Streisand on the other hand exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems if not too rehearsed at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence though at age 34 Streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And indeed had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way to make Streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist.But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim they don't seem to be aware just how coldblooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from Esther Blodgett so that Streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride.The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes including the Oscarwinning Evergreen by Paul Williams and Streisand. But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be a vanity project.".

This third version actually fourth if you include 1932's What Price Hollywood starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman stalls early in the game by transposing the dramatic setting of Hollywood moviemaking to the brash uncouth poprock music scene... and it is only one of many fundamental mistakes this movie makes.The ragstoriches story of Esther Hoffman Howard ain't believable for one second.  Streisand the struggling artist?  She plays Barbra the hardassed star from the very first scene lacking the courage or ability to immerse herself into a fullyrealized character.  She brays and bullies from the onset showing no emotional colors whatsoever in a performance bereft of weakness vulnerability and as a result sympathy.  Ironically she played this part to perfection ten years before  as Fanny Brice the gawky chorus girl who became a Ziegfeld Follies legend.  Well somewhere in those ten years is a big star who has forgotten how to laugh at herself.Its been said that Elvis Presley was briefly considered for the part of John Norman Howard the singer on the skids but turned it down for fear of being upstage by Streisand.  All the same one wonders what The King might have done with a tooclosetoreality role like this.  In the hands of Kris Kristofferson he tosses in a performance so lackadaisical and careless that one wonders if he was sober at all during the film's shoot.  They appear to be performing in two different movies.  Neither one interesting.The screenplay is hopeless trite and corny fueling some of the most unintentionally funny scenes in recent memory.  Streisand's fight scene with Kristofferson after she catches him in the sack with some chippy and her emotional cassetteripping scene in the mansion after John Howard's death are just plain embarrassing.  If she's such a perfectionist in real life how did these two scenes ever get by the editor's scissors.The one thing Streisand did right in this movie is the one thing she can never do wrong.  Sing.  Possessing arguably the finest vocal instrument known to man she weaves absolute magic in her singing scenes notably Woman in the Moon and especially her heartbreaking finale number Are You Watching Me Now.  Here and only here does she seize an emotional connection to Esther that evaded her throughout the film.Alas it is not enough to save this film dud.  But if you must see this I'd advise you to skip the acting scenes and fastforward to each Streisand number.  Better yet buy the CD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Barbra Streisand brought her own vision to A STAR IS BORN the third version of this classic Hollywood story about the romance between an up and coming star and her alcoholic husband whose career is fading into oblivion. Streisand put her own stamp on this movie making the story more acceptable to her and more accessible to 1970s film audiences. She changed the setting of the story from films to the world of music making her Esther Hoffman a struggling singer who is discovered by an alcoholic selfdestructive rocker named John Norman Howard Kris Kristoffersonwho grooms her for stardom while his own career falls apart. We all know this story and have seen either of the previous versions and some were unsettled by the fact that in this version John Norman doesn't commit suicide he is killed in a car accident instead taking away a lot of the power of the story. The point of the original story is that the actor sacrifices his own life so that his wife won't give up the career she's worked so hard for. One of the most amusing parts of the original and 1954 versions is the whole episode about Esther changing her name so it looks better on a marquee. Here our feminist heroine Esther Hoffman refuses to change her name and for me this small but vital plot points diluted a lot of the power of this story. This production is overblown and uneven. It should be understood that Streisand was just on the edge of insanity while making this film. She was involved at the time with future film producer Jon Peters who was running her career and her life. Peters butted heads with leading man Kristofferson as well as credited director Frank Pierson who pretty much directed this film in name only...Streisand and Peters had the last word on everything regarding this film much to its detriment due mainly to Streisand's complete trust in Peters who really knew nothing about filmmaking at this time. But no matter what else she does this movie comes alive whenever Streisand sings. Highlights for me were Queen Bee Woman in the Moon With One More Look at You and of course the Oscarwinning Evergreen. With all the hats she was wearing while making this film needless to say Streisand was not very focused on her performance here which can be described kindly as uneven. Kristofferson in a role originally offered to Elvis Presley is strong and surprisingly sexy as John Norman Howard and Gary Busey also scores as John Norman's manager. For hardcore Streisand fans only.".

Also the bath tub scene between Streisand and Kristoferson is just so sexy!  The music is great as well.  This is the groovy 70's Babs at her best!".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this 70's remake of the marvellous Judy Garland  James Mason classic from the 50's itself a remake film snobs more than I expected without accepting that one isolated minute in it was better than its counterpart in the predecessor. A rocky update of the story is a decent idea and in fact lends itself well to the storyline and if the execution is a bit clunky and now dated that's both pardonable and understandable.Things I liked  well let's start with Kris Kristofferson who with the more difficult part certainly convinces as a hellraising rock star fuelled by drugs and alcohol aware of tastes and fashions passing him by but with enough perception to see Streisand's Esther as the future. It's fun trying to pick out rock prototypes for his John Norman Howard character  I'm between Jim Morrison and Leon Russell myself the latter married at the time ironically to sultry singer Rita Coolidge who herself gets a brief cameo appearance while Howard's behaviour at Streisand's little night club where he discovers her recalls an infamous out of control episode in the lost weekend period in John Lennon's life if memory serves. A pity they couldn't have trusted the writer of classics like Help Me Make It Through The Night and Me And Bobby McGee to contribute some of his own songs to the soundtrack and certainly his signature song here Watch Closely Now gets done to death.I also quite enjoyed the soundtrack. I'm no fan of La Diva Streisand's singing or indeed acting but at least in her vocals she exercises some restraint and delivers a surprising variety of material demonstrating at least some versatility on her part from the titletheme ballad Evergreen the gorgeous music to which was surprisingly enough written by her light Labelletype funk of I Believe in Love and the big torch ballad The Woman in the Moon which while beneath Judy's The Man That Got Away covers the same territory in a still acceptable way.Things not to like  Streisand herself does a reasonable job and initially tones down her trademark kooky and sensitive personae a bit but you never really believe in her as a real person. Unfortunately as the film progresses so does her profile and we get embarrassingly lame scenes with the couple cooing at each other in various locations including a candlesurrounded bath scene Streisand overacting furiously as she argues with a cassettetape of Howard's voice after he's done his James Deantype exit from the planet and worst of all that single long shot of her singing the finale medley which is when you appreciate that yes it's just another Barbie vanity exercise after all especially when you see her name down as executive producer.The dialogue is pretty rockstar clich throughout and some of the situations come across very secondhand too Howard snorting up before every show his assaults on a critical deejay Streisand's MOR music somehow wowing a crowd of rock 'n' rollers at a benefit gig and of course the familiarity with the story reduces the surprise element of some of the plot developments.All told though long as it was there were far worse films than this made in the 70's. By the way what a pity they never released the version of Evergreen with Kristofferson harmonising on the middle section  it works a treat and adds to an already very pretty melody.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's always been many people's dreams to become famous. Who could resist having tons of fans lots of money and being able to do anything you want? It's a big change for anyone who makes this transition and most of the time they end up cracking under pressure. Once this happens frequently the newly discovered celebrity will turn to drugs and other means to escape reality to find peace among themselves. But how often does someone discover the right person that'll keep him or her from going down the wrong path while in this state of glory? Now a days it happens often enough that nobody thinks about it. Back then though probably was a different story.Audiences will be introduced to artist John Norman Howard Kris Kristofferson an entertainer who's stardom is beginning to die among his fans. He takes drugs drinks constantly and sings the same hits every time he's on tour. Until one night he goes out on the town decides to sit at a local bar and discover someone who can sing just as good if not better than him. That singer is Esther Hoffman Barbra Streisand a girl just trying to make a living seeking love and hoping to make it big in show biz. It's John who's going to help her get there. Thus allowing Esther to as John puts it  Getting small piece of the American Dream. Ergo the title of the movie.The movie is directed by Frank Pierson who also wrote for Cool Hand Luke 1967 and Dog Day Afternoon 1975. Pierson also wrote the screenplay with two other writers who formed a fairly solid story. The only weak point is the unclear characterization Kristofferson's character. There are some motivations of John Norman Howard that aren't exactly explained. He'll do actions that should require explanations to but doesn't give one. It's understood that he's a wild and free man but every action has a motive behind it. They don't just go unexplained. Other than that Kristofferson's performance is well acted. It's even more coincidental that a lot of the scenes displayed throughout the running time depict rather closely to what Kristofferson himself was going through at the time of his life.Barbra Streisand also puts in a good performance as the unknowing upcoming celebrity that is forced into the life of popularity and paparazzi. Of course when Streisand and Kristofferson are together their chemistry feels natural. This is also displayed when these actual artists perform together as well. Audiences should appreciate that Streisand had the singing scenes filmed without voiceover work. It makes the performances and singing that much more believable and emotional. There's also a few other actors who pop in from time to time. Tony Orlando and Kristofferson's future spouse Rita Coolidge have a scene together. A very young and what appears to be sane Gary Busey plays John Norman Howard's head collaborator. Even Robert Englund from A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 has a brief scene.Although the films running time is about as long as your normal Michael Bay summer blockbuster which may bore some viewers these last few pieces help make the film as entertaining as it can be. Assisting to condense the movie as much as it could and make scenes flow was editor Peter Zinner who also edited for The Godfather 1972. Then there's Roger Kellaway's score to the film which does try to keep the emotions high. However it's not always present because half of the emotion is shown in the singing done by the main leads which should satisfy most score aficionados. Lastly is Robert Surtees' cinematography where he captures very large concert audience shoots and some very beautiful rural landscape. It's an entertaining human drama with some flaws.It lacks a little characterization and might be long for some but the actors portray raw emotion and real performances to boot. The story is also a good representation of how quickly popularity can fall or soar.".

	schema:headline " Sentimental favorite surpasses the previous versions in many ways";
	schema:reviewBody "A blockbuster at the time of it's original release it was the secondhighest grossing film of 1976 the third screen version of A STAR IS BORN has always divided critics and fans alike. The film open to scathingly negative reviews however 5.6 millionbudgeted picture went on to gross over 150 million at the box office and won an Academy Award and five Golden Globes. It's not without some irony that Streisand's most commercially successful film would also remain her most controversial. For every ten fans who state that STAR is Streisand's best film there are always ten more who claim it is the weakest film in her filmography. Although both sides have some merit to support their claims it should still be noted that the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN remains one of the most touching and highly entertaining showbiz dramas that Hollywood ever produced. For my money it's the best version of the oftentold tale.The film is solidly enjoyable and throughly absorbing. Changing the setting from the old Hollywood studio system to the competitive world of the music industry was actually a great idea and the screenplay forges a realistic contrast between the characters' romance and their careers. This is the main area that the 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN actually surpasses it's classic predecessors. For example the film is especially successful when depicting the clashing personal and professional difficulties during recording sessions and the neverending phone calls that interrupt Kristofferson's songwriting attempts. This version of the story is also more believable in it's portrayal of the lead characters. For example the female leads in the two previous versions were so virtuous and selfsacrificing that they came off as saints. On the other hand Esther the female lead in this version is not only portrayed as being strong and passionate but also flawed and conflicted. This makes her feel more real than the Janet Gaynor or Judy Garland characters felt in the previous films and makes the story that much more effective.The performances are all on target even if some of the supporting characters aren't fleshed out enough. If you're looking for an actresssinger who can walk the fine line between tough and vulnerable without making herself seem like a script contrivance Streisand is definitely the girl you want. She's one of the few film stars who can make even the most banal dialogue seem fresh and natural and as usual she manages to make a strong emotional connection with the viewer. Simply put her Esther is a fullyrealized threedimensional human being. Kris Kristofferson may not get much respect now for his laidback characterization however he's always interesting watch and displays a magnetic charisma here that he seldom displayed elsewhere in his career. Kristofferson actually received rave reviews at the time from NEWSWEEK TIME and even the NEW YORKER's usually vicious Pauline Kael. Gary Busey and Paul Mazursky also give believable performances but both have a fairly minimal amount of screen time.The film's soundtrack recording was also a massive success hitting the 1 on Billboard's Hot 200 and selling over four million copies in the US alone. The Streisandcomposed Evergreen with lyrics from Paul Williams is unarguably one of the most gorgeous songs in contemporary pop brought to evenfurther life by an absolutely incomparable vocal performance from Streisand. The rest of the film's original songs mostly composed by Williams and Rupert Holmes are pretty good as well and Streisand sounds fantastic  her live solo numbers remain in the memory long after the rest of the movie has faded. Streisand's vibrant performances bring Woman In The Moon and With One More Look At You to thrilling life and make even sillier numbers like Queen Bee work far better than they have the right to. Kristofferson's solo numbers sound somewhat tuneless however that may have been intentional since he is playing a singer in decline.Though naturally dated in some respects it definitely does reflect the decade in which it was made the seventies take on A STAR IS BORN still holds up remarkably well. The film is wellmounted and slickly produced the chemistry between the leads is extremely powerful and always feels genuine and Streisand has two emotional scenes near the finale that are both aching effective. In conclusion A STAR IS BORN is not only entertaining and moving but it also transcends all criticism.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a horrid disaster of a film.  From beginning to end it's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing.  The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to.  The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson's character at his peak or Streisand's character struggling.  The first should be seen in decline and the second rising.  The final Streisand number could have been one of the greatest finales in film if it was directed and edited properly.  The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake.  Had the band audience and wide shots of the stage been shown this number could have been dynamic and interesting.  This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout.  The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay.  The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK granted the story of the born star is about Streisand's character but the love story alone is fairly universal. Can love survive when one partner is seen as more successful than the other? Both Streisand and Kristofferson give solid performances. These characters are in love but are clearly on different trajectories. The music is important for the forward movement of the film but it's not really a musical per se. Both Kristofferson's and Streisand's performances are great so get the soundtrack if you don't have it. I think this movie still holds up even almost 40 years can you believe it? later. The messages in the movie seem to be stronger once you've lived life had success had failure been in love and lost love. Overall do you need to be a Streisand fan to like the movie? It helps. If you don't like her you won't likely enjoy the movie but she doesn't come across as the sole focus of the movie. Her story his story and their story seems to be told in equal measure. Haven't seen it? Do. Saw it years ago? See it again soon.".

Yes the critics were right about everything Streisand's pop songs sound more like her usual Broadway showstoppers Streisand's character's instant stardom is contrived to say the least Kris is an excellent songwriter but he uh can't sing a note yet he didn't write any of the songs in the film and getting a little mean here even with a beard Kristofferson is prettier than Babs. So why have I seen this film at least 100 times? Well it was extremely entertaining despite it's many clichs and the other things I've sited. The music is also good as cheesy as Babs' songs are and as poorly sung as Kris' are. I'm apparently not alonein 1976 only Rocky made more money at the box office not bad for an RRated movie in a year that had many great films such as Taxi Driver Network All the President's Men and The Omen The Bad News Bears to list a few. Very dated today but I still want to watch it again.".

As I watched it for the first time I was expecting another romantic tearjerking Barbra Streisand film Something like The Way We Were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters Esther Hoffman and her John Howard was nonexistent making it impossible to get attached to the characters. There wasn't anything romantic about it. Streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fastforward button. At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. Parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on and I kept asking myself when it was going to end.The death of John Howard was completely predictable. There was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie and when he died I felt no emotion whatsoever. It wasn't a tragic accident it was him basically being an idiot. Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard.The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The ending of the movie when she sings With One More Look At YouWatch Closely Now was my reason for giving this film a whopping 310. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.".

It's real. The scene where she records Evergreen ranks with the best in the business.. all live no lipsync very special. Streisand is often criticized for being a Diva but she delivers on this one. She is majestic singing With One More Look At You. She deserved the Oscar she and Paul Williams got for Evergreen. Kristopherson had his moments too far above most of his movie appearances. This version of the Born franchise ranks with the first one of 1937 Janet Gaynor Frederic Marchalthough I will always enjoy Judy Garland and James Mason musical remake of 1954.

He played a drunkdruggie only the way someone who really had gone through it could  and he had  in '76 he finally got on the wagon so it was all very real.The music is GREAT and even though in later years I thought Streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense I think it's more a problem for male viewers than female. Us gals are just looking at Kris  and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest  my husband cannot watch the movie bc of her  he doesn't like her looks. But I did make him sit through just the red Ferrari scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was  the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music blasting  you should have seen it on my 50 plasma  WOW!!!! And lastly the transfer quality was GREAT  anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film.Brought back some great memories of my mom and I loving this movie together I bought a copy for her for Christmas. Would have loved to watch it together with her last night.I have tried to sit through the original with Judy Garland but I guess seeing this one first I just can't get into the earlier era. Watching all the concert footage in the '76 version was so much like what I was living at the time.I am working my way through the commentary by Streisand but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs so far she has barely even mentioned Kris or details about scenes in the movie. Her voice sounds EXACTLY the same now as then.Check it out if you grew up in the same era as me born in 1960 you will love it.Wendy".

Surprise surprise I loved it.The reason I was able to enjoy A Star Is Born so much is because I pretended it was a completely different movie. If you've seen either of the two earlier versions and expect a traditional remake you'll probably hate it. John Gregory Dunne Joan Didion and Frank Pierson may have based their concept on a previous story but they've written a completely different script. So for the purpose of telling you my thoughts on the film I won't compare it at all to the Judy Garland version.Kris Kristofferson might be the only person in the world who can pull off a bearded '70s look while still coming across as hygienic. It doesn't make sense that I think he's wildly attractive since I usually hate that look but I was in heaven with the amount of eye candy in this movie. Perfectly cast as a popular rock star he starts the movie past his peak. He drinks snorts cocaine forgets his lyrics onstage and performs outrageous lifethreatening stunts. He chances upon Barbra Streisand singing in a nightclub and is so impressed with her talent he propels her to stardom. And of course they fall in love.I really am surprised by how much I liked this movie since so much of it isn't usually my cup of tea. The 1970s isn't my favorite decade and I usually find the clothes and hairstyles irritating. With exception to two of the plentiful songs in the movie I didn't really like the music. Barbra Streisand's character has plenty of bite to her which I don't usually find sympathetic. Somehow putting all the elements together worked beautifully. Somehow it made total sense that Barbra gave Kris attitude when they were first getting to know each other. I won't be buying the soundtrack but Barbra's vocal talent was extremely impressive it was very understandable that audiences in the film were wowed by her. Both leads put their whole hearts into their performances and even though this was the third time I'd seen the story I still cried during each of their big scenes. If you know the story you know which ones they are. I'd always thought of Kris as just a goodlooking singer but I was surprised by how much dramatics he poured into his scenes. Barbra is always a good performer and in her romantic oneonone scenes she's tender and vulnerable. She's been paired up with a very long list of goodlooking leading menRobert Redford Ryan O'Neal Jeff Bridges Omar Sharif Nick Nolte and young Mandy Patinkinand I've never seen her with greater sweeter lovelier chemistry than with Kris Kristofferson. The way they look at each other is so beautiful like how Jack Carson looked at Doris Day in Romance on the High Seas. If you like the Oscarwinning song Evergreen you'll love the scene in the movie when they sing it together.My advice is to either watch this version first or forget you've seen any other version when you rent it. He's gorgeous she's in her permprime and if you like '70s rock you'll really love it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sherlock Holmes became such a quick fixture in motion pictures that it is possible to write studies on the various movies and actors centered on that character.This particular film was an early Hollywood take on Holmes in the sound period. It is interesting to note that it came out only three years after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died in 1930. By the time this had come out Hollywood had done silent and sound films about Holmes with William Gillette John Barrymore and more recently Clive Brooks. But the three best Holmes' of the sound period were still to come along Arthur Wontner in Great Britain Basil Rathbone in Hollywood and Jeremy Brett on television. Holmes in this version was Reginald Owen best remembered for his Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1938 version of A Christmas Carol. Owen was a very good character actor villainous in films like The Call Of The Wild but funny as anything in The Good Fairy. He had played Watson already so he was one of the few actors to essay both friends parts. But he seemed too laid back to be a good Holmes.A Study In Scarlet appeared in December 1887 in Beeton's Christmas Annual a long forgotten magazine in Great Britain which is only now recalled because of Conan Doyle's novella. If you are lucky enough to stumble onto the Beeton's of that month and year and it is the original than hold onto it  it's worth many thousands of dollars.It's in two parts. The first half is The Lauriston Gardens Mystery wherein Dr. John H. Watson our narrator introduces us to his friend and roommate Sherlock Holmes and then to the adventure set in April 1881 where he first became aware that Holmes was a consulting detective and was consulted by Scotland Yard's Detectives Tobias Gregson and G. no further name ever given Lestrade not Lastrade as the movie's cast of characters named him. Lestrade would be the best known of the detectives in the saga who would consult Holmes and would be most memorably played by Dennis Hoey in the Rathbone films. Here he's played by Alan Mowbray  not badly but with little electricity.The plot of the first portion of the novella is about the murder of two men one by poison and one by a knife wound in the heart. Holmes traces the story back to the old west where in the second half entitled The Country of the Saints it is linked to the Mormons in Utah.Most if not all was jettisoned into a story about murder for insurance centering around Anna May Wong and Alan Dinehart. Dinehart's character Thaddeus Merrydew is based on a single line of writing in the four novels and fifty six short stories that were written by Conan Doyle. In The Adventure of the Empty House when reading a list of people with M in their name he is searching for the biography of Colonel Sebastian Moran he finds a reference to Merrydew of abominable memory. That's it! No Thaddeus Merrydew just Merrydew. Somebody concocting the script remembered that one reference. I may add this was also the last time in movies there was any villain named Merrydew against Mr. Sherlock Holmes.As an early talkie film about Holmes it is worth seeing  but it is not among the best Holmes movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1932 the California Tiffany studios had been hardhit by the depression's increasing damper on the motion picture industry and had most recently been taken over by the troika of Burt Kelly Sam Bischoff and William Saal producing under the achronym K.B.S.One of the talented individuals attracted to K.B.S. during this turbulent period was Robert Florey who had directed THE COCOANUTS in which the Marx Brothers made their film debut and coauthored the script of FRANKENSTEIN then adapting and directing MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.A STUDY IN SCARLET was Florey's third project at Tiffany and he was again scheduled to both write and directhis preferred mode of working. While producer Bischoff had purchased the motion picture rights to the title of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel for only a small sum Florey was told to compose a new scenario to costar Anna May Wong opposite Sherlock Holmes.A cause for the alteration of the original plot is that producers may have felt the title exceeded the worth of the actual story. Conan Doyle's original written in 1887 was a vehicle for a denunciation of the contemporary Mormon practice of polygamy which for American movie makers may have aroused concerns of censorship and regional distribution difficultiesjust the type of difficulty a small independent company like K.B.S. could not afford to risk. As well half the narrative consisted of a lengthy confession with Holmes only present in the prelude which would have surely disappointed most filmgoers. While A Study in Scarlet was the first Holmes mystery Conan Doyle wrote it had been filmed only twice before with an English feature and an American short both appearing in 1914. Not until 1968 was the subject tackled again this time by the BBC in a fiftyminute television presentation.Given a week to come up with a narrative to fit the picture's title and Wong's presence Florey collaborated with his friend Reginald Owen who had been chosen to portray Holmes and split the 1000 script payment. They collaborated on the continuity in consultation with Art Director Ralph DeLacy in order to utilize as many standing sets as possible economies always being especially important at a studio like Tiffany even on as significant a project as A STUDY IN SCARLET.At this point Florey left having received the offer of a longterm contract from Warner Bros. on condition that he leave immediately to direct their comedic mystery GIRL MISSING. Bischoff allowed Florey to leave with both agreeing that his replacement as director on A STUDY IN SCARLET should be Edwin L. Marin. Marin age 33 previously had helmed only one movie on his own a low budget item entitled THE DEATH KISS 1932. At K.B.S. he had just finished assisting Florey on THE MAN CALLED BACK and THOSE WE LOVE waiting for such a break.Although the FloreyOwen script contained no similarities to the novel their plot did demonstrate a familiarity with the world Conan Doyle created for Sherlock Holmes. Elements are present from other Holmes stories especially The Sign of Four The RedHeaded League and The Five Orange Pips. There are many of the typical clues devices and mannerisms.The title is incorporated to refer to a very exclusive organization called the Scarlet Ring a group of eccentric and highly ambiguous characters so suspicious of one another that they are afraid to even walk together. Upon the death of any member his property is divided among the remaining survivors suddenly they begin to die at an alarming pace under strange circumstances. This group of individuals were personified by an unusual group of actors including J.M. Kerrigan Halliwell Hobbes Wyndham Standing Tetsu Komai and Cecil Reynolds.Some critics have pointed out the movie's similarity to And Then There Were None  Ten Little Indians with suspects killed one by one and their murder announced by a nursery rhyme. But if anything the influence was the other way around since Agatha Christie's novel was not published until 1939.The script of A STUDY IN SCARLET was extremely polished and wellconstructed developing at just the right pace while carefully building the appropriate mood and environment. The movie breathes life into the classically eerie atmosphere of the British mystery creating a pervasive feeling of fear in the fogbound studio streets of the Limehouse section of London. Strange gatherings arranged by secret codes take place in abandoned outoftheway buildings dark and oppressive deadend streets are places of isolation and terror fog and shadows hide murderers and their victims.Suspense is heightened by a number of devices. For instance the killer is kept unseen while at the same time menace is suggested by having the crimes viewed through the murderer's eyes using a subjective camera. The silhouette of a giant shadow appears on a wall as the victim stares at the audience and screams It can't be you followed by a closeup of a hand checking off the name of one more member of the Scarlet Ring who has been killed. The climax of this technique comes in a longtake with the stillunknown murderer visiting the crooked lawyer played by Alan Dinehart the camera completely adopts the viewpoint of the killer as Dinehart opens the door and the unknown individual is offered a cigarette puffs of smoke ascending in front of the lens.The sense of locale was enhanced by the use of a nearly allBritish cast something unusual for a Hollywoodmade Sherlock Holmes picture. Reginald Owen in particular was given the necessary latitude to offer a different interpretation of the Holmes personality. Owen portrays a much more human less remote man more akin to the personification offered by William Gillette in his stage play to whom Owen even bore a certain physical resemblance.By the time A STUDY IN SCARLET was released in mid1933 K.B.S. and WorldWide had folded with Fox handling the distribution. The picture opened to an excellent critical reception.".

But if anything the influence was the other way around since Agatha Christie's novel was not published until 1939.The script of A STUDY IN SCARLET was extremely polished and wellconstructed developing at just the right pace while carefully building the appropriate mood and environment. The movie breathes life into the classically eerie atmosphere of the British mystery creating a pervasive feeling of fear in the fogbound studio streets of the Limehouse section of London. Strange gatherings arranged by secret codes take place in abandoned outoftheway buildings dark and oppressive deadend streets are places of isolation and terror fog and shadows hide murderers and their victims.Suspense is heightened by a number of devices. For instance the killer is kept unseen while at the same time menace is suggested by having the crimes viewed through the murderer's eyes using a subjective camera. The silhouette of a giant shadow appears on a wall as the victim stares at the audience and screams It can't be you followed by a closeup of a hand checking off the name of one more member of the Scarlet Ring who has been killed. The climax of this technique comes in a longtake with the stillunknown murderer visiting the crooked lawyer played by Alan Dinehart the camera completely adopts the viewpoint of the killer as Dinehart opens the door and the unknown individual is offered a cigarette puffs of smoke ascending in front of the lens.The sense of locale was enhanced by the use of a nearly allBritish cast something unusual for a Hollywoodmade Sherlock Holmes picture. Reginald Owen in particular was given the necessary latitude to offer a different interpretation of the Holmes personality. Owen portrays a much more human less remote man more akin to the personification offered by William Gillette in his stage play to whom Owen even bore a certain physical resemblance.By the time A STUDY IN SCARLET was released in mid1933 K.B.S. and WorldWide had folded with Fox handling the distribution. The picture opened to an excellent critical reception.";

It will probably never be produced as written because of it's religious issues. This is an attempt to apprehend the big cheese in a series of murders involving the Scarlet Circle. Men are dying according to the same poem used in Christie's Ten Little Indians And Then There Were None. Holmes is aware of what is going on but can't really strike quickly. This results in deaths not being prevented. While there is a seriousness to this film there is a lot of humor as well. The characters are rich and interesting and the acting is pretty good.

As long as you don't expect to see the original story there is certainly enough to make this a feature worth seeing.Reginald Owen is solid as Holmes although he does not leave his mark on the role in the way that Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett did. Owen does have the unique distinction of having played both Holmes and Dr. Watson having played the latter in Sherlock Holmes the year before A Study in Scarlet.The rest of the cast likewise play their characters in a straightforward fashion allowing the story and atmosphere to get the main focus. The one who does stand out is Anna May Wong who adds beauty and a mysterious presence although unfortunately she does not get a lot of screen time.The story itself has numerous turns and keeps you guessing.

	schema:reviewBody "A Study in Scarlet was produced by the lowbudget E. W. Hammons at the lowbudget Tiffany Studios starring a former Watson possibly cast because of his association with Holmes films Reginald Owen as Sherlock Holmes. The presence of Holmes and Watson is the only connection to the Arthur Conan Doyle story of the same name and that in and of itself is not a bad thing. I have no problem with a Sherlock Holmes film straying from slavish fidelity to the creator of the character. However this one seems to deviate from the original not as a result of the filmmakers' creativity being exercised in order to make something new but often in ways that make Holmes into someone that resembles a generic detective protagonist more than the most recognizable of them all.It's a little odd to see a supposed Sherlock Holmes dart around wearing clothes clearly dated to the 1930s the only appearance of the famous deerstalker is in cartoon form in the opening titles but since the story doesn't depend on anything terribly timeperiod appropriate the transposition to the contemporary setting doesn't have too much of an effect. A curiosity here is that we are repeated told that Sherlock Holmes lives at 221A Baker Street not the traditional 221B even though he still seems to be living upstairs. Whether that's a simple error on somebody's part or a nod to the liberties being taken with the original stories there is no way to tell.Owen unfortunately is rather stiff and unremarkable in is portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. Many point out that he doesn't look the part and traditionally he doesn't but that hasn't been a problem for countless other actors. If he had managed to make the role his own through his performance it wouldn't have been for him either. He has little presence and seems to think that if he bellows each line with enough conviction and selfsatisfaction he'll sound as if he knows what he's talking about.Sadly the rest of the actors are rather wooden and unimpressive as well including Anna May Wong. Warburton Gamble makes no impression as Watson and some of the murder victims are laughably unconvincing in their hesitant screams for help at their dying moments. Everything is taken deadly seriously except for some overplayed comic relief involving characters at a pub which only semi works.There is a good mystery story at the heart of this film about a circle of criminals whose members are being murdered onebyone but the execution including the direction which the exception of one clever shot inside Merrydew's office near the end mainly doesn't go beyond static two an threeshots is too lackluster to serve it well. The scriptwriter deserves credit for a good concept and for a good method of developing the story through showing us going on in all quarters without completely explaining its significance but nobody else seems to have been trying very hard.It's still entertaining most of the time and fun for viewers who will eat up anything Holmesian but it's far from the best executed film version of the detective's adventures.".

Of course Holmes is supposed to be arrogant  but here it's a sort of flip arrogance  hard to explain exactly but it just seems both perfunctory and unnecessary. And having Holmes shoot one of the bad guys in the back at the end  that didn't work at all.The plot has little to do with the novel from which it takes its name here Holmes is on the trail of a murderer slowly killing off members of some secret society which is only revealed in nature at the end but which we can figure out very early on.

A Study in Scarlet boasts an impressive cast  even down to Hobart Cavanaugh in an uncredited bit as Innkeeper Thompson. The plot does seem to have more in common with Agatha Christie's book And Then There Were None but that wasn't published until 1939. Even though it was filmed at the California Tiffany studios it certainly had an authentic English feel to it. The amazing thing is how the cast most of them American actors came up with very creditable English accents. You didn't even get that in A productions let alone the cheaper films.Reginald Owen had played Dr. Watson to Clive Brooks' Sherlock Holmes in the 1932 film of that name but in this film he played Sherlock Holmes. A body is discovered in a railway carriage pulling into Victoria Station. A code containing the words scarlet and Limehouse is printed in the paper. He is the second member of a secret society of which Alan Dinehart is the head to die. They divide up the money but decide not to give any to the victim's widow Mrs Murphy Doris Lloyd. She then goes to Sherlock Holmes with a rhyme she found among her husband's things. After the meeting another member is shot through the heart. Sherlock Holmes talks to the widow Mrs. Pike. Played by Anna May Wong with a very creditable English accent. Even though she is given top billing she is not given much to do  she does look very exotic though. The members are killed off one by one  each one receiving a little poem before hand. It is clear that Thaddeus Merrydew is the master mind behind all the murders but the actual murderer was a surprise.June Clyde plays the heroine Eileen Forrester. She made a little splash in early musicals ie The Cuckoos 1930 Hit the Deck 1930 then in 1932 she was named a Wampus Baby Star. That kept her career going until the end of the 30s. Allan Dinehart that oily villain of so many 30s movies plays Thaddeus Merrydew. Billy Bevan an old silent comic has a part as a helpful patron at the inn.Recommended.".

Happily he was much better as Holmes but once again I have been spoiled by Basil Rathbone and Arthur Wontner. Nevertheless he was more than adequate but was done in by the leaden pace of the proceedings in A Study In Scarlet  it could have been so much better with a little tension and suspense and a few less dead spots as the the storyline was excellent.

Heck they even included a bunch of characters that weren't in this tale! It's bizarre because Reginald Owen seemed a very odd choice for the leadseeming much more suited to the role of Watson than Holmes. Much of this is just traditionactors famous for playing this same role repeatedly were William Gillette Arthur Wontner Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett were all thin guys and bore some similarity to each other. Owen just looked nothing like them and this took some getting used to. This isn't a bad thingjust an odd thing.Also I am really confused by the film because although it bears almost no similarity to A Study in Scarlet the film is very similar to Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None a.k.a. The 10 Little Indians and another title which I can't use because I doubt if IMDb would allow me to use the original title due to political correctness. However Christie's novel did not appear until the late 1930s so it appears that perhaps she lifted the plot from this 1933 film or at least was strongly inspired by it. I am really surprised there wasn't a lot of uproar about the similarities.If you ignore all these aspects you still have a poor film because the film had such poor production values. There was no incidental music lousy dialog the acting was often VERY poor and the whole thing simply had no energy. As a result instead of being engaging the whole thing was mindnumbingly dull and I can't recommend you see it.".

So would naturally see any Sherlock Holmes adaptation that comes my way regardless of its reception.Furthermore interest in seeing early films based on Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and wanting to see as many adaptations of any Sherlock Holmes stories as possible sparked my interest in seeing 'A Study in Scarlet' especially one with such an appetising and great title. Also with interest as to how Reginald Owen a bizarre casting choice on paper but some initially weird casting choices have been known to come off surprisingly better than expected so that wasn't a concern would fare as Holmes. 'A Study in Scarlet' is a very loose film adaptation the names and title being the only resemblances. It is not one of the best Sherlock Holmes adaptations certainly the best of the Jeremy Brett adaptations and films of Basil Rathone fit under this category. It's also not among the very worst although one of the lesser ones overall being a little better than any of the Matt Frewer films particularly 'The Sign of Four' and much better than the abominable Peter Cook 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.There are good things with 'A Study in Scarlet'. Anna May Wong really spices things up in a sensual performance shame she didn't have more screen time. Alan Mowbray is a quickwitted and not too idiotic if not quite electric Lestrade and Alan Dinehart intrigues as Merrydew. Nice shots here and there and the ending is a satisfying surprise if not ingenious. The setup and framework is neat.However anybody who raised eyebrows at Owen's casting before watching are not going to find themselves converted seeing him in the role. It's not because he's wrong physically he is also far too stiff and tends to overplay the role. Warburton Gamble is an insipid and forgettable Watson having the opposite problem of being too much of a buffoon like Nigel Bruce but displaying little personality. The lacklustre at best chemistry between the two and the wanting performances of both actors makes this iconic partnering fall flat. June Clyde is both melodramatic and disengaged with some ridiculously delayed reactions.Visually 'A Study in Scarlet' is pretty lacking too time and budget limitations seem to be evident here. There is nothing evocative or handsome about the production values the sets being very drab and most of the way it's shot and edited is very primitive. Moreover too much of the script lacks flow and intrigue just as insipid as Gamble's Watson and with comic relief that is overplayed and pointless. The direction is never more than pedestrian. Other than Owen and Gamble the biggest faults are the story and pace. The pace tends to be dull hurt by some very tedious padding that is not always necessary. The story lacks tension and suspense as well as not always easy to follow.Overall underwhelming. 410 Bethany Cox".

Yet there's none more famous than Basil Rathbone Holmes with Nigel Bruce Doctor Watson in what developed into a popular film series for Universal a decade later. It's a little known factor that Owen happens to be the first actor to play Watson in one movie 1932s SHERLOCK HOLMES Fox featuring Clive Brook and Holmes in another. As often stated for A STUDY IN SCARLET the plot actually doesn't follow Conan Doyle's first Holmes novel but instead contains an original idea scripted by Robert Florey with continuity and dialogue credited by Reginald Owen himself.The story opens at Victoria Station London with a light post and car indicating a modern setting for one brief scene where two cleaning ladies having difficulty opening the door to a compartment get Mr. Partrudge a porter to look into the matter.

After a coded newspaper clipping 6 9 3 7 13 7 Scarlet 23 4 7 Limehouse M is shown on screen from the Daily Telegraph the following segment shows a secret meeting presided by Thaddeus Merrydew Alan Dinehart a crooked lawyer and legal representative of a mysterious organization called The Scarlet Ring.

Three days later Sherlock Holmes Reginald Owen and his assistant Doctor Watson Warburton Gamble of 221A Baker Street are visited by Murphy's widow Annabella Mary Doris Lloyd a pub owner explaining how she's been cheated of her late husband's fortune left to the organization.

Slight difference Black Boys was changed to Little Indians. Could it be that Christie had seen this movie and lifted some material for her novel? Another interesting factor found in A STUDY IN SCARLET is how the camera becomes the subject matter with Merrydew looking directly and talking into it without revealing the identity of that person. This visual style is most identified to 1940s film noir mysteries notably LADY IN THE LAKE MGM 1946 and DARK PASSAGE WB 1947 though done earlier in A FAREWELL TO ARMS Paramount 1932 which makes one wonder which film and director originated that visual style.With limited byplay between Holmes and Watson this edition is very much Holmes indeed crime solver. Though he does take time to disguise himself at one point it's not much of a disguise. Other members in the cast include Leila Bennett Daft Dolly credited as Daffy Dolly Hobart Cavanaugh The Bartender and Tempe Piggot Mrs. Hudson famously played by Mary Gordon in the Rathbone series. Acceptable adaptation that's become a curio to film buffs.

Perhaps the change in address was for legal reasons.Again for reasons of their own the producers inserted a tedious scene involving some ancient English vaudevillians doing a drunk routine so ancient it might have come from a medieval farce.However the story for what it is does hold one's interest and moves along quickly even though it made little sense. The pretty little ingnue playing the heroine has the disconcerting habit of displaying emotion two or three beats after the relevant action and her neatly mustached boyfriend may have been one of the gimcrack chairs strewn around the set for all the life he shows. The gorgeous Anna May Wong apparently wandered in from another movie. She's on camera for only about 10 minutes but her talent is so much greater than any other member of the cast that she makes every scene she graces memorable. Lord how that lady could slink!Two possible borrowings 1. A literary device holding the story together  a children's rhyme  may have been borrowed by Agatha Christie for Ten Little Indians a book she wrote long after most prints of this movie had been converted to banjo picks. 2.

The movie itself doesn't really hold its audience's attention with a number of unsavory characters lead by shyster London lawyer Thaddeus Merrydew Alan Didehart. It's Merrydew  Co. who were all involved in smuggling a cache of jewels out of PreCommunist China circa the late 1920's and are now dropping dead like flies on the streets of London because of it.After a Mr. Murphy was found dead on a London bound train his wife Mrs. Annabelle Murphy Doris Llyod hired detective Sherlock Holmes Reginald Owen to see if her husband in fact was murdered not that he committed suicide like the London Police reported. Holmes soon discovers through a number of cryptic messages in the local newspapers that there's this group of people involved in an illegal jewelry smuggling operation that started back in China some eight years ago. The ringleader of this gang of Jewel thieves is top London criminal lawyer Thaddeus Merrydew who represents them.

In major roles the wonderful Anna May Wong shines as Mrs Pyke while Alan Dinehart beamed with equal assurance as a crooked lawyer. Alan Mowbray essayed a quickwitted Lestrade while Warburton Gamble did the honors as Dr Watson. The rest of the players from Doris Lloyd's hesitating Widow Murphy to Tempe Pigott's brieflyglimpsed Mrs Hudson are equally fascinating. Edwin L.

To hear and see how professional the Rwandans were and helpful in producing and being extras of the movie was worth buying the DVD.There are hidden and internally scars that will never heal however my hope is that this movie will present a lesson to how the UN forces from France Belgium Italy Canada and the US were inactive in their missions to police and stop the massacres. My anger was raised when the Canadian general Dallaire who saw all this could do nothing because of the political stance of the countries mentioned and how he wanted to do something but his hands were tied.Although the story was based on a fictionalized romantic story and the rest of the characters and events were true I congratulate ALL for this poignant VISUAL STORY TELLING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THERE. I have not read the novel heard it was an international bestseller and certainly raised the question what in HEAVEN is wrong with peoplegovernments who had the military potential the tools and certainly the possibility to stop this tragedy. Unfortunately other dissimulated wars are happening still in Africa such as in Darfur and no once cares...Will it take filmmakers with a conscience to raise awareness??? What are the news media doing in all this? Questions asked but that will be never answered.If you are one that cares...see this BEAUTIFUL movie...some end scenes are graphic but like one Montreal newspaper critic said...it will show you the bad and good side of humanity.FYI....according to the movie producers Rwandans are genteel softspoken people....that is what is most surprising about this genocide.".

When the genocide finishes in July 1994 Bernard returns to the chaotic Kigali seeking out Gentille in the middle of destruction and dead bodies.The heartbreaking and powerful Un Dimanche  Kigali is certainly the best Canadian movie I have ever seen. The engaging story is a sort of complement of Hotel Rwanda and Shooting Dogs focused in the romance of a Canadian journalist and a Tutsi waitress but disclosing also the genocide of the Tutsis in the landscape of a troubled Rwanda while the West simply ignored and turned back to the fate of millions of people. Luc Picard has a magnificent performance that would deserve a nomination to the Oscar if this award was really concerned with great movies and performances the gorgeous Fatou N'Diaye has also an awesome performance in the role of Gentille. The direction is realistic supported by stunning cinematography and scenarios. It is worth seeing this gem recommended to lovers of great movies. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Tenso em Ruanda Tension in Rwanda".

However the producers tried to convey to many political messages to the audience while wanting to put forward a Titanicstyle love story between the two main characters. The main focus switched continuously between the loveguilt relationship between the Gentille and Bernard and the events in Rwanda during that time. With many flashbacks in between all possible twists were defused well before the audience imagination started to kick in given the circumstances.On the other hand the western authorities in this movies are depicted as binaries and stereotyped to the point of being completely caricatural which removed a great deal of credibility to the plot. The movie condemns the inertia of the western powers in general and Canada in particular in face of the genocide. Canada is a poor choice for personifying the main actor that could change the course of history in the Rwandan tragedy. It was simply a matter of the geography no colonial ties with Rwanda and no clear role in that country at that time. It almost likened to accuse let say Peru for its inertia toward the Holocaust during WW2. Belgium on the other hand would be a more credible choice.I got out of the movie with the feeling of seeing a modern day adaptation of a Shakespeare's drama between two lovers with footages of the Rwandan massacre from CNN inserted in the background. The WW2 Holocaust or the Camdodian genocide could served as decorum to the story with the same effects.This movie could pick up where 'Hotel Rwanda' left off but it decided to be just a complement of the later.".

	schema:headline " A Dan Dailey Delight With Anne Baxter as Another Annie With a Gun";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie came out four months after Annie Get Your Gun with Betty Hutton. Anne Baxter plays a female sharpshooter role quite similar Annie. It suggests that if Betty Hutton had not been available Anne Baxter would have been an excellent second choice for Annie. While the movie isn't quite as good as Annie it is a totally entertaining piece shot in gorgeous Technicolor. If 1950 hadn't been a year filled with great movies like Sunset Boulevard All About Eve with two terrific performances by Ms. Baxter and Betty Davis Samson and Delilah and the aforementioned Annie Get Your Gun it is possible that this one would have picked up at least a few nominations. Dan Dailey has never been better. He is totally relaxed and charming in his role as a salesman of mustache cups and subscriptions to the Saturday Evening Post. Anne Baxter plays her Annie type character with surprising ease and coolness. She seems totally natural when she takes the badge and town sheriff role from her wounded grandfather wonderfully played by character actor Will Wright who appeared on over 60 television shows in the 1950s and early 60s.Rory Calhoun looks much younger and far handsomer than he was starring in The Texan a decade later. This was the first of three movies he was in with Marilyn Monroe. This is Marilyn's debut film unfortunately she's only in it for about five minute. It is also Western star Jack Elam's debut. Look quick he's in it for less than minute. You can also catch Victor Sen Yung Hop Sing on the 1960's Western Bonanza. Walter Brennan also has two or three nice small scenes. If you're a Maverick television fan this is a must see. While not the first comedy Western this movie is probably closer to Maverick in tone and style than any other movie. Its even closer than James Stewart's Destry Rides Again. Dailey and Baxter giving great performances is the reason to watch but the Technicolor beautiful Colorado scenery and bit parts by future stars is a lot of icing on this sweet little cake of a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "A feel good moderately entertaining western farce along the lines of 'Calamity Jane' and 'Anne Get your Gun' but mostly lacking the musical aspects of these better known films of the same early '50s era. Actually Anne BaxterKit had played a rather similar tomboy with an itchy trigger finger a couple of years earlier  in the conventional western Yellow Sky. It does feature the versatile and likable Dan Daily who did star in quite a few lesser known musical comedy romances perhaps most notably several with Betty Grable. Dan plays a small time traveling salesman and con artist who journeys to a small townEpitah in western Colorado by train on its maiden trip with Walter Brennan as the engineer. Anne stars as the cute seemingly naive Calamity Janelike granddaughterKit Dodge of the town sheriff who takes an immediate dislike toward Dan's character. Marilyn Monroe in one of her early bit parts is one of the show girls in a traveling troop that happens to land in Epitah about the same time as Dan.One of those rare westerns actually shot mostly in the region it is scripted to be inin the mountainous region near Durango making use of the Denver and Rio Grande railway. The main plot involves the mostly botched attempts of the local stage line owner to sabotage the coming train line. The other significant aspect of the plot is the initial blatant hostility of Kit toward Dan's character which gradually changes to an unlikely infatuation.

Dan and Kit have to decide whether they want to make their whirlwind association permanent. Be prepared for a 'surprise' flip flop.

	onyx:emotionText "A feel good moderately entertaining western farce along the lines of 'Calamity Jane' and 'Anne Get your Gun' but mostly lacking the musical aspects of these better known films of the same early '50s era. Actually Anne BaxterKit had played a rather similar tomboy with an itchy trigger finger a couple of years earlier  in the conventional western Yellow Sky. It does feature the versatile and likable Dan Daily who did star in quite a few lesser known musical comedy romances perhaps most notably several with Betty Grable. Dan plays a small time traveling salesman and con artist who journeys to a small townEpitah in western Colorado by train on its maiden trip with Walter Brennan as the engineer. Anne stars as the cute seemingly naive Calamity Janelike granddaughterKit Dodge of the town sheriff who takes an immediate dislike toward Dan's character. Marilyn Monroe in one of her early bit parts is one of the show girls in a traveling troop that happens to land in Epitah about the same time as Dan.One of those rare westerns actually shot mostly in the region it is scripted to be inin the mountainous region near Durango making use of the Denver and Rio Grande railway. The main plot involves the mostly botched attempts of the local stage line owner to sabotage the coming train line. The other significant aspect of the plot is the initial blatant hostility of Kit toward Dan's character which gradually changes to an unlikely infatuation. True Dan seems rootless and superficial but he has seen much of the world in contrast to Kit's lack of experience in the world beyond her little corner of Colorado. Included is a very strange paradelike train trip from Epitah to Tomahawkboth bogus town names for CO with no rails for the first portion of the trip the train being pulled by a team of horses and the showgirls following in a stagecoach!

	schema:reviewBody "This one starts with a fairly serious if not standard premise if the new railroad train can make it to the town of Tomahawk Colorado by the prescribed time they'll win a subsidy that gives the rail line an advantage over the local stagecoach outfit. Unfortunately the film devolves into virtual farce by the last half hour as a reluctant engineer Walter Brennan is faced with the necessity of taking his train apart! in order to make it to the finish line. Which wound up being even more ludicrous than the team of horses it took to pull the engine and three additional railroad cars over forty miles of wilderness devoid of train tracks. If any of this was even remotely believable it would have made for an interesting story but as it is the picture is best viewed strictly for light entertainment.The surprising thing for me winds up being how this 1950 color picture previewed a couple of classic black and white TV Westerns down the road. In not too much of a stretch Anne Baxter's character is turned into Annie Oakley for the 1954 series the sharp shooting cowgirl who gained fame in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show of the late 1800's. And with Richard Sale writing and directing there's no question that the Chief Yowlachie character was the basis for Yancy Derringer's sidekick and bodyguard Pahoo KaTeWah. The Chief used hand gestures to speak and portrayed the same stance and attitude as Pahoo while using a tomahawk instead of a dagger. Need any more convincing?  his name was Pawnee the same tribe that Pahoo came from.This was my first look at Dan Dailey in any kind of role and he coyly plays off of the female Kit Dodge Baxter in an amusing manner particularly in that 'bussing' routine. Lending support to the unconvincing dynamics of the story was his unique ability to participate in a perfectly choreographed song and dance routine with Madame Adelaide's girls complete with his own props! You know one of the Madame's dancing girls looked just like a young Marilyn Monroe! But geez couldn't they get someone more authentic to play the role of Crooked Knife? So I check the credits and that's none other than the original screen Tonto Chief Thundercloud not even attempting some phony Indian dialect. What a let down and not even upset that the railroad hands wiped out half of his war party! At least the story had a neat twist finale when the Mayor of Tomahawk expanded the city limits to allow the train to achieve it's goal and 'win' against all the obstacles thrown it's way. But good grief what was that farewell between Kit Dodge and Johnny Behind the Deuces all about when her five 'kids' joined to wave goodbye. Somewhere along the way Grandpa Dodge's birds and bees talk wound up being a mere afterthought.".

Larisa Oleynik could have made her role really great. She could have tugged the audience's heart strings from beginning to end but she didnt. Once again in her defence the film didnt concentrate enough on the emotional side of Jules's cancer instead they stuffed it with way too many dance routines that just ended up being boring and hogging too much of the screen time. I know this film is about a girl who just wants to dance but really they were great steps dont get me wrong but too much of a good thing can be bad and boring. They should have concentrated alot more on the emotional and made sure there wasnt a dry eye by the end. Its strange that they didnt give Peter Coyote a pretty darn good actor by my standards more screen time. he had only two minor scenes with little dialogue and hardly any room for emotional response. There is one scene in which Jules tells her parents she wants to stop chemo and he shows signs of potential but then they leave it at that.With all due respect the book was much better.".

Jules played by 10 things I hate about You's Larisa Oleynik is focused determined talented and driven living for the dance classes she takes after school.  Sam Shiri Appleby  Roswell and Swimfan is more relaxed and seems comfortable bathing in the reflected glory of her best friend.  As Jules' life is threatened by cancer she sees her dream of attending the prestigious Julliard School of dance slipping from her grasp.The performances were good though not incredible and the dance sequences in this film were fantastic. I am not a trained dancer but both the leads completely hold the viewer's attention on the dance floor.I found Larisa's Jules to be vulnerable and accessible.  She degenerates well during the course of the movie and the battles she is fighting while largely offscreen can be seen in her face.  Unfortunately she doesn't quite get enough dialog to flesh out her character as much as I would have hoped.  In a strange move Sam seems to be the more complex character and Shiri injects a believability into her obsession with Jules that I found touching.In life there are rare people whose simple presence moulds us into something better than what we are.  Jules has this effect on both Sam and Sam's mother and the director wisely chooses to discard several potential hallmark moments in favour of examining this adoration and the damage it can do.  The relationship between Sam and her mother and the friendship between Jules and Sam are both put at risk by Jules' glory.The direction was unobtrusive which is important to telling a story like this and apart from the climactic dance scene and some dream sequences the story is told well.  The dream sequences were important as Jules' perfect existence is ripped away from her leaving her pulled towards places she does not want to go however I thought they could have been handled better.  I also was confused by the use of slowmotion in the final dance scene as all the dancer notions of time and space and form which are handled well throughout the film seemed to be lost here.Overall I have to give this film a good rating for displaying both realism and subtlety two qualities that are rarely shown in this type of film. The reaction to Jules' crisis and the effects it has on those around her are completely believable and I think the fact that this film is based on a true story really helps here.  While I have to admit that I prefer Shadowlands starring the superb Antony Hopkins full marks to both leads the director and the dance choreographer.7.510".

Now with a premise like this it was almost a stamp on guarantee that I was going to like this movie. The amount of angles that they can go with this story and make it into something immensely enjoyable is amazing. Turns out I didn't like it.Okay so the story Jules and Sam are both dancers that have danced since they were 6 years old. Sam loves to dance but Jules is obsessed with it and it's her lifelong dream to do it professionally. That comes to a screeching halt when what she thought were hip pains turns out to be a form of cancer and it basically chronicles how Jules Sam and their families live with this.The biggest complaint in the sense that because this was taken out the whole thing falls apart is that these characters almost have the personality of dishwater. I mean with our 2 leads for example aside from them liking dance and having each other as best friends what do you know about them? The answer is almost nothing because if they did elaborate on other personality traits then they didn't make this very clear. I could go on and on with how much this ruins the film completely.With all this said the actors all do decent jobs. I mean I know they're trying very hard to do this and it really shows. I think the best performance is Oleynik as Jules as she is conflicted with being unable to fulfil her dream for being a professional dancer. I mean they almost carry the movie.With this said I thought this movie relied on a lot of Dance choreography than anything else. Half the time they put dance sequences in places that don't make sense. I mean if it is supposed to convey some kind of symbolic meaning then the symbolism is very poorly put across.So I guess if you like any of these actors then this movie will be worth some kind of viewing. I mean the acting from most of the players is pretty good but the characters are bland cardboard cutouts. The amount of ways this story could have been tackled even if they gave the characters more personality could have connected me to the characters a lot more that when the ending comes along that I would be sad at it. So If you're a fan of these actors then watch it If you aren't then this movie won't work.".

To me it didn't seem like the characters were really showing how much Juliana's Cancer was affecting them. There was only one scene when I felt her parents were really showing us their true feelings in the situation. Sam I would also have liked to have seen the emotions from a best friends point of view which I don't think was shown that much. This movie was based on dancing but it could have took a deeper more indepth look at the sides of Cancer and how it was affecting Jules's family and friends. Something which really caught my interests in this movie though was the music. The music in this movie really conveyed the situations playing in front of us and fitted in perfectly. For me the music was one of the best parts of this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Feng has traditionally produced a movie each year close to the new year but the tone of his movie has grown darker and sadder. A World without Thieves is another example of this progression.The story is simple but the characters have layers and the dialog remains classic Fengstyle as ever. All performances are good to great. The villain role is set up perfectly for Ge You. The production value is the most polished I've seen from a Feng's film. The camera work the editing and the music score all feel artistic and are mixed together quite well. As for his previous movie Cellphone there are a number of sad moments in the movie where your heart will be heavy. Overall highly recommended. 8 out of 10.".

Shortly thereafter she announces to her lover that she wants them both to abandon their thieving lifestyle and settle down. When he refuses they argue and split.On foot and hopelessly lost Li encounters Sha Gen Wang a simple man who wants to find a wife and settle down with the money he's earned.

However while Bo wants to get back together with Li he has his eye on Sha Gen's moneybag. To make matters worse a whole gang of thieves is on board the train and they all wouldn't mind helping themselves to the easy cash. It's thief vs thief as the train rolls through gorgeous landscapes and Li has her work cut out defending Fu from all sides not least her unscrupulous lover.I've only seen one of director Feng Xiaogang's movies before 'Big Shot's Funeral' and will admit to not being blown away by that. This however is a very engaging and beautifully shot romantic crime comedy and I enjoyed it immensely. The product placement that seems to have offended many viewers slipped by me and the procommunist message simply fits the character of Sha Gen and did not seem out of place. I certainly didn't feel anything getting forced down my throat.Andy Lau manages to be a likable rogue while Rene Liu plays her role with a lot of heart. Their onscreen chemistry is perfect.There are a number of 'fight' scenes between the thieves that put me in mind of the 'God of Gamblers' series of films. Instead of fighting with Mah Jong sticks or flinging cards at each other though the thieves duel with razor blades as they try to poach from one other. These scenes are inventive and done with flair and just the right amount of CG trickery.I did have a problem with the ending which  while being necessarily melodramatic  seemed overly manipulative. To compensate for this Rene Liu's acting at the conclusion should leave all but the hardest of hearts unmoved. I have to admit with some shame that this is the first film I've seen starring this astonishing actress. It will definitely not be the last.".

As the film begins they are extorting money from a rich man they have filmed trying to seduce the woman. Soon after this the woman decides she has had enough of this kind of life and wants a normal existence. Her partner in crime however has no intention of quitting the business. She stops at a Buddhist temple to pray and there is befriended by a worker on the temple. The man whose friends call him Dumbo is returning home with his five years wages from working on the temple 60 000 RMB. Although his friends tell him to wire the money home and warn him about thieves he insists he is fine taking the money on the train with him and that they are too distrustful of people. In an attempt to prove to his friends that there are no thieves on the train the young man has announces to the entire train that he has the money and that any thieves should show themselves. When they don't Dumbo says seethere are no thieves here. On the train he hooks up with the thieving couple and the woman makes it her mission to try to protect the gullible young man from those who would steal the money in particular from a gang of thieves on the train and perhaps from her own partner. Like Bu Jian Bu San this film is not a light comedy although it seems to start out as such. Instead it is a serious and emotionally taxing film that can be alternatively thought provoking and hilarious with the contrast between the gullibility of the young man and the sophistication of the world weary thieves providing the central moral focus Feng is a major Chinese writerdirector. He traditionally releases movies around the Chinese New Year. A beautiful movie highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw A World Without Thieves at a film festival and I loved it. I had expected a more straightforward Hong Kong production but this was more of a mainland China movie. We follow a malefemale couple of thieves Bo and Li both surnamed Wang but apparently not married the woman of whom is trying to abandon her criminal lifestyle for the sake of her unborn child's karma. So she decides to protect a naive country bumpkin who's transporting his life's savings by train surrounded by people who want to rob him. As you can imagine a plot with this kind of stark sacrificial emotion involved must be difficult to turn into a successful piece of filmmaking. But this director pulls it off.The movie is grand and beautiful. The emotional intensity and depth conveyed by the actors repeatedly brought a tear to my eye. The characters themselves cry several times and their pain is convincing. The really impressive thing is that the movie really blends several genres. It has a plot and characters which are usually played for laughs in lighthearted action comedies yet here they are treated seriously. The action scenes are lowkey in order not to detract from the more important emotional matter. And adding in the magnificent cinematography the end product becomes an art movie.For the cinematography of this movie is simply breathtaking. Landscapes and people are filmed with inspired visual flair. There are a few kung fu scenes in the movie the most impressive of which is the peeling of a raw egg without breaking the membrane but they are done very untraditionally. The skirmishes are never really shown except in brief halfblurred flashes mimicking pickpocketing skills where you practically can't see the moves. However these scenes are accompanied by special music and most certainly have an aesthetic all their own contributing to making this movie unique. The director is trying to do something new and different with the kung fu scenes and I think he succeeds. The focus of the movie is not on the fight scenes but on the characters' emotions and the dazzling cinematography.The end of the movie is also stunning. In order to honor his lover's wish the male thief who has no desire to reform ends up getting himself killed in order to return the country bumpkin's money to him from a rival master thief. Now you can focus on the return of the money and find the moral of the movie naively romantic. Or you can focus on the heartrending death of Bo and be moved to tears by his sacrifice which was for love of his partner and not for the naive country bumpkin. I did the latter and I believe the director was going for this reaction. This was not a naive movie about protecting an innocent soul from the unavoidable evils of the world it was a character study focusing on two thieves who ended up disappearing from the world one through reform and one through selfsacrifice. It touched me deeply.All told a masterpiece that I can heartily recommend and which I will certainly acquire for myself when I get the chance.Ratingswise I initially wondered if I should give it an 8 or a 9. But upon reflection of how perfectly put together this movie was and what a great artistic accomplishment it is and how the consideration of its themes and their resolutions continue to move me when I think back on the climactic scenes I have to give it top marks. 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Witness how Andy Lau comes across in two movies under two different directors. In the Zhang Yimou's cheesy impersonation of an art film House of Flying Daggers poor Lau is reduced to almost laughing stock in a hopelessly crafted and lifeless character. In Feng Xiaogang's A World Without Thieves Lau is given a proper opportunity to act and he responds with a creditable performance.Not as wellknown to the world at large as Zhang who has achieved fame through shameless succumbing to cheap melodrama Feng is nevertheless the biggest name in China. Make no mistake about it Feng's films ARE commercial. But on top of the commercial elements Feng retains his unique blend of style humor and heart. On the other hand while Zhang still rules when it comes to cinematography a film does not live by cinematography alone.And Feng does not suffer by that much even in that department. The opening shots of AWWT are simply breathtaking. The ensuring scene is equally impressive with Wang Li Rene Lau praying in the open temple courtyard among the throng while partner Wang Bo Andy Lau engages in a duel of sorts with femme fatale Li Bingbing. The rhythmic rousing sound from the throng the sincere penitence of prostrating Wang Li and the intimidating dexterity of the two dueling thieves blend together in a unique atmosphere created by Feng's ever attentive camera bringing the audience right into the heart of the movie.The plot is simple and essentially predictable set in a familiar slightly claustrophobic train journey pitching thieves against thieves and against law enforcers over certain potential loot. This however does not prevent the movie from offering the audience a bit of everything jawdropping feats suspense and tension interesting characters a love story struggle between good and evil. What I like about it is that it is unpretentious. Wang Li's and later Wang Bo's penitence simply as result of her pregnancy comes across much better than pseudo philosophizing for example as in Running on Karma which incidentally also stars Andy Lau.The movie features an ultimate good guy character Fu Gen Wang Boaqing who almost like an idiot doggedly believe that there's no bad guy in this world and hence the title. Wang plays it so well that even the most cynicismstricken audience will find it difficult not to love him. Andy Lau as mentioned has given a solid performance even when the character is somewhat stereotyped. Rene Lau easily one of the best Chinese actresses around today handles her part with ease. Watch for the last scene when she gulps down mouthfuls of food while a tear trickles down her cheek. And there is of course Ge You sort of China's Lon Chaney who appears in every one of Feng's films and never fails to give a delightful surprise every time.In sum an unpretentious entertaining commercial but high quality film.".

	schema:reviewBody "What do you get when you combine an idealistic country bumpkin two sets of professional thieves and a long train ride with more than it's share of surprises along? Well if it's awesomely directed acted and filmed it's probably Feng Xiaogang's A World Without Thieves a slow paced but rewarding film. In the opening we meet a male and female couple who are professional thieves named Bo Wong Andy Lau and Li Wang Rene Liu. After an argument about Li leaving the profession Bo kicks her out of the car. Walking into town Li meets a naive orphan named DumboBaoqiang Wang who happens to be carrying his life's saving of 60000 dollars with him in his carryon bag. Li and Fu quickly become friends when Bo reenters the story. The three decide to take a train ride where they meet another set of professional pickpockets. Dumbo soon finds himself in the middle of two set's of scheming thieves his only protection is the sympathetic thief Li Wang. But is she enough to save the lamb from the wolves?The film's first 20 minutes is actually the best shot and most emotionally affecting part of the film it actually called to my mind the better works of Zhang Yimou. The opener also features some brilliant work by Photography Director Zhang Li. The shots of mainland China's mountains and are incredibly shot and framed. Unfortunately after the characters enter the train we loose the beautiful landscape shots. The film than turns into a war of thieves complete with what I'll call Pickpocket Kung Fu a series of dangerous contests double crossings and all kinds of outright deliciously scandalous behavior.Although shot a bit tooclosely for my tastes the action scenes are welldone but they seem to be a bit out of pace with the film's beginning feel and overall themes. The competition scenes where actually much more satisfying than the film's martial arts. I wished the director would have featured more of the pickpocketing tricks and less of the razorblade Kung Fu. Luckily the sum of the whole is greater than it's parts and overall AWWT makes for one of the most satisfying films I've seen in years.The characters also help make this film what it is. Andy Lau is excellent as the devious but likable Bo. Rene Liu is also great as the Yin to Bo's Yang. Her Character is played pretty straight forwardly but is convincing as the only real character in the film that could be called a decent personother than Dumbo. Everyone plays holds their weight in the film actually the only weak linkin terms of actingis Baoqiang Wang as the naive countryman. His performance isn't bad but seems to be a bit overdone is anybody really that innocent?. On a inconsequential side note I understand the concept of Andy Lau's need to disguise himself being a wanted man and all. But why did the director feel the need to dress him in that horrible wig? I actually applauded and cheered approximately 70 minutes into the film when Bo looses his hairpiece in the wind.Bottom Line A World Without Thieves is an all around good time. It has it's share of minor faults but is overall a great film.".

It has it's share of minor faults but is overall a great film.";

	schema:reviewBody "A world without thieves is close to impossible at least not in our modern world where there are those who covert what others have and given no means of obtaining those items legitimately seek the easier way out and give in to temptation. But there are those who naively think that such an utopia is possible perhaps given their simple background and their trusting nature to not see the evils of man. Sha Gen the Dumbo Wang Baoqiang is one such person who declares and openly challenges on a crowded passenger platform to wouldbe and to himself non existent thieves that he has RMB60K on him.Andy Lau and Rene Liu play Wang Bo and Wang Li respectively a Bonnie and Clyde styled couple whose profession is to profit from conning and thievery. They're skilled pickpockets and in a scene set in a temple we see what Wang Bo is capable of with his deft hands armed only with a thin razor. Things don't go down well for the couple as Wang Li decides to forgo the partnership and go legit for fear of karmic retribution. As such she takes it on herself to look after the kind hearted Dumbo and what could Wang Bo do except to go along even though he's secretly harbouring thoughts on that 60K cash package.But like the adage of washing your hands in the golden basin their will and skills are put to the test when Uncle Li Ge You and his band of merry thieves which include Lam Ka Tung as Four Eyes and Li Bingbing as Leaf board the same train and constantly poke and probe for opportunities to succeed in fleecing Dumbo like a helpless sheep when his guardian wolves are less than alert. It's a classic cat and mouse game with each side displaying their fangs as they encircle their prey with the prey none the wiser to the drawing of territorial lines. It's not very often in recent times that you have a movie set for the most parts on board a train and good ones at that unless you pass the likes of Steven Seagal's Under Siege 2. The first Mission Impossible movie had a great action sequence Bollywood's Dil Se featured an awesome dance on the roof of a moving train and The Darjeeling Limited and Before Sunrise had great conversations but I'd dare say Feng Xiaogang bested them all with this movie. It's not difficult then to say that I've enjoyed this movie having seen his Banquet and Assembly both of which I had liked and I guess his works are now on my watchlist.But it's not all claustrophobic in having everything set on a train. There were ample opportunities for lush cinematography to accentuate the beautiful vast lands that China has although at some points to allow for action sequences some of them had to be superimposed instead. Don't let that mar your enjoyment though as the effects were pretty much nicely done on par with what you'd come to expect with movies made in Hollywood. But the characterization here takes priority as well in moving the story forward especially with Andy Lau's character caught in the crossroads of listening to his heart as well as figuring out the intentions behind the admiration from a grandmaster thief.And Ge You if you'd think his portrayal in the Banquet was onedimensional you should see him in action here with his various disguises and his silent charisma shining through chewing up almost every scene he comes in. It's little wonder that he's a frequent feature in the films of Feng Xiaogang and I look forward to his next with the director starring opposite yet another Chinese thespian in Jiang Wen. Rene Liu had great chemistry with Andy Lau and thus made their couple character quite believable in their love for each other as well as the conflict of ideals that they face which put a strain in their relationship. The only gripe I have will be that some of the fleecing scenes were shot in too close up a manner but it sort of emphasizes on the blink and you miss sensibilities that these crooks have to capitalize on in order to practice their trade. And that of course presents itself as a perfect opportunity to rewatch this wonderful movie again. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies I'd heard a lot about but never quite found myself in the right place to see until I finally managed to lay my hands on a Hong Kong DVD. Few things in movies irritate me like white subs against light backgrounds especially when it's a widescreen DVD with acres of virgin darkness below the screen area but in this case such gripes are largely irrelevant. The plot is neatly woven and each character is given enough time to establish their true intentions. Not being a Chinese speaker I tend to watch the nuances of expression for glimpses of the subtler plot elements and that usually helps me to fill in the gaps left by those unreadable subs. Subjectively this is a very mobile film which gets moving in fine style with some beautiful travelogue style tracking shots of high mountain China and a mildly incongruous borrowed top of the range Beamer. The brief hiatus before the train journey begins allows us to glimpse the widening cracks in the happy couple's business relationship. The naivety of the young farmer they encounter is a useful counterpoint to Andy Lau's selfishness. And thus begins an exploration of honesty under duress.I don't want to go into too much detail but suffice it to say that there's some fun cgi trickery some elegant grifting duets and some nicely underplayed camp malevolence all washed through with strangely hypnotic slightly blurred cinematography and lighting. Very similar to the woozy feeling one gets after a few hours on a train.This film covers its many bases with an elasticity that allows the viewer to figure it out in their own good time. The underlying atmosphere of quiet menace versus insouciant braggadaccio centred around the naif's bundle of cash and his gentle zen philosophy is perfectly played out to a subtle and suitably rhythmic score. Where a western film would brutally overdramatise the scene on the roof of the train here it's played so nonchalantly that one would almost assume it's an everyday occurrence.As a modern take on an old fable it works on every level. I enjoyed watching the onion being peeled away layer by layer to the point where it became pure fatalism. Honesty dignity bravery and compassion. With added sleight of hand and a pinch of sorrow and sadness. Well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will introduce the film Tian xia wu zeiA World Without Thieves which was directed by Feng xiao gang in 2004. This story is simple but fun. It tells the couple of thieves Wang li and Wang bo protect the innocent young man who comes from countryside from being stolen by Li shu and his team. No one in the world could believe there are no thieves in the world. However Feng xiao gang decided to tell people the truth by an interesting way. This film has a very clear structure which is about Sha gen's 60000 yuan. At the first Wang bo wanted to steal Sha gen's money but Wang li found she was pregnancy and would not like to do the crime. However another team which was leaded by Li shu focused on Sha gen's money and Li shu also wanted to show his ability to Wang bo by this action. In the end Wang bo died but he protected his wife and Sha gen's 60000 yuan. Actually money is not the only thing that Wang bo and Wang protected. What they would like to keep is the quality of kindness and confidence between people. One scene in this film gave me a deep impression that Sha gen shout in the train station Who is thieves? Can you stand out? then he said there is no thieves in the world because no one can stand out. This is a really interesting detail and I think many people will laugh at Sha gen because it is impossible for a thief to prove he or she is a thief and has done a lot of crimes. However from that we can see Sha gen is a very kind man he believes all of people in China are helpful and innocent. He also trusts there is a confidence between different people even they do not know each other. He also said to Wang bo and Wang li it is impossible for people are worse than wolves. The director takes Sha gen as an example to show some people in the countryside in China are pure and kind in that age. These people believe that they can have the happiness by their efforts and everyone in the world will give you a hand when you are in trouble. However in the real world people just call it is utopianism. In my opinion the goal of director is not to destroy the crimes and create the ideal society he wants to show kindness by Sha gen and makes audience find the confidence between people. This is also what director would like to protect in China. The couple of thieves about Wang bo and Wang li also gives me a deep impression. Director uses them to show that people can still be a kind man if they know their faults and correct them. Wang bo is an experienced thief and he only trusts the money can change people instead of kindness and confidence. In the beginning of the film he looked down upon the guard who only saluted the men who has good cars but not let the other people come in the house. We can find that he would like to be a bad man but the real society force his to do that because people only have respect for rich men. After he knew his wife was pregnant and she asked him not to do the crimes again he still believes he will always be a thief even he decides not to do that. However the baby of them saved him. He and Wang li did not want their baby to go their way. I think they even want their baby can be the man like Sha gen. Therefore the couple made a decision to help Sha gen. We can see that Wang bo used his life to protect the money and his wife in the end he also protected kindness and confidence. There is another important point that the director Feng xiao gang uses many interesting communications in the whole film. He does not like making this movie become serious and he wants to make people know his ideas by a funny way. Audience will be happy and moved by his film then they will think about real meanings about these interesting performances and scenes. Many films just show their themes by a serious story and it is hard for most of audience to accept directors' ideas. Therefore this is also the success of Tian xia wu zei.".

	schema:reviewBody "As another reviewer stated here this feels like a light comedy. But there is so much more to it. And to have the ability to mix the lightness especiall in the way many scenes are staged and shot with the philosophical question it raises is just plain great. It might not be your cup of tea or you might think that some people are reading things into the movie that aren't there. But seeing a trailer for another movie done by this director I am pretty sure that those things are meant to be there.Nevertheless it doesn't make this movie flawless. And quite a few people will dislike it. But as with many movies you should be able to tell if you like the visual style and tone of the movie when it reaches the ten minute mark. If it didn't convince you by then you could stop watching because it won't have any different effect by the end of it. On the other hand if you are captured no pun intended into the world you will have a truly great experience watching this movie.".

It's about two thieves who become conscience stricken when they meet an honest farmer who dreams of a world without thieves. A World Without Thieves is a new style movie for Feng Xiaogang. It moves away from his usual black humor grotesque and sometimes bizarre depictions of reality. This new film carries a more sentimental and idealistic story. Feng Xiaogang said This is a fresh try. Film producers and audiences will all get tired if we keep making films in the same way. It is something like a narcotic. Audiences may fulfill their dreams watching a movie. If audiences can accept new styles it gives us more chances to make different movies.".

Whether Andy Lau acquitted himself well I could not judge distracted as I was by the ridiculous wig he was wearing for most of the film.The script sounds like a good idea and on the whole believable though the character of 'Dumbo' seems a bit too naive even for a country bumpkin. The story was at least in the right spirit and sufficiently melodramatic for such a 'holiday film'. The action sequences were well done often highlighting the dexterous talent of the pickpockets.What bothered me most however was the amount of shameless product placement  an assortment of brand names repeated in the credits. Feng Xiaogang has always tended towards commercialism but oversteps the mark here. Perhaps the director should consider directing TV commercials as an outlet for this tendency.In sum this is a goodlooking and mildly entertaining holiday film with pretensions to depth but too much commercialism to make it ring true.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie certainly looks good but it never really gelled for me. Andy Lau plays onehalf of a married pickpocket team whose wife much to his annoyance announces she wants to go straight. On a train they meet Dumbo a simple peasant taking his savings home and not really caring who knows about it because he doesn't believe anyone would want to steal from him.Ah. That's what didn't gel. Strange how writing something down can sometimes bring an obvious but elusive thought rising to the surface. The problem with this film is that the characters are so poorly drawn and unbelievable. Nobody out of pampers is as trusting as young Dumbo and even peasants must have had people trying to nick their crayons at school or run off with one of their goats or something. You could argue that he's a little simple but I don't think so  not to the degree he'd need to be in order to be so trusting.Lau sports a daft wig for no apparent reason for most of the film and would love to relieve Dumbo of his money but knows wifey would really kick him in to touch if he did. He tricks Dumbo into giving him some of it and when a member of a band of travelling pickpockets steals the money from Dumbo Lau steals it from her fully intending to keep it because he didn't steal it directly from Dumbo.This travelling band of pickpockets working under a boss who seems to be something of a master of disguise also doesn't ring true. Hollywood might have just about gotten away with it in a Fu Manchu flick in the 30s but it doesn't work here. Some of the interplay between Lau and this Mr Big is reasonably entertaining and the intricately choreographed fight scenes within the confines of the train's narrow corridors are well staged but overall whether or not this film is intentionally attempting to create a metaphor for the problems encountered in our journey through life it just fails to convince and only fitfully entertains.".

The director is working with some great actors Andy Lau and Ge You but he doesn't let them act. The editor cut scenes as if he never had more than two inches of film at a time.Speaking of acting Andy Lau is too old for this role. He is a great actor but it's hard to believe him when he tries to play people half his age.The director needs to ease up on the aftereffects. A strong echo is heard when a man is shouting in a prairie. The lighting aftereffects are just distracting. Then we have people appearing and disappearing... for no reason and it has nothing to do with the story. Somebody just got excited about what can be done with special effects and forgot about the story.The fight choreography works like this 1 a fight or a pickpocketing scene begins. 2 the camera shows a super closeup of a fingernail moving by a strand of hair. Whose fingernail? Whose hair? You can't tell. 3 the camera shows a super closeup of a couple of fingers moving near some cloth. Do we have any idea whose fingers? No. Do we have any idea what's supposed to be happening? No. None of the fights or kung fu magic are really shown. The movie is worse in this respect than Tim Burton's Batman.".

Then we have people appearing and disappearing... for no reason and it has nothing to do with the story. Somebody just got excited about what can be done with special effects and forgot about the story.The fight choreography works like this 1 a fight or a pickpocketing scene begins. 2 the camera shows a super closeup of a fingernail moving by a strand of hair. Whose fingernail? Whose hair? You can't tell. 3 the camera shows a super closeup of a couple of fingers moving near some cloth. Do we have any idea whose fingers? No. Do we have any idea what's supposed to be happening? No. None of the fights or kung fu magic are really shown. The movie is worse in this respect than Tim Burton's Batman.";

Part I is obviously the making of the album. You get to see some cool outtakes and hear the songs in the production process. You also get a peak at the real Metallica outside of studio and stage. You almost feel like you know them. Part II is the best though. Almost 2 12 hours of live Metallica. There are a bunch of live performances spanning the first leg of the tour as well as award shows and tribute concerts. Again you get to see more of Metallica being themselves offstage as on. Also on both parts you get to see the music videos from the album including 'Enter Sandman' 'Sad But True' and 'The Unforgiven.' When I first bought this set years ago on tape I wore them out. I could watch these over and over. Thanks to DVD they will last a long time. Definetly check this out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The two segments involved in the documentary feature Metallica both the blackclad public leaders of metal madness and the laidback long hair goofballs from down the hall playing electric guitar at 3 in the morning.The direction was awful shaky.  In terms of a documentary director Adam Dubin chose to involve the presence of the film crew as much as possible in the privacy and business of the bandmembers to the point of where much of the material is essentially them playing to the camera.  This is an effect that can alter the realism of the documentary and put the subjects into a position to where they feel compelled to act for the camera instead of being their true selves.  There were also many baffling cuts into the middle of a joke or editing techniques that involved blending and blurring of conversations that at times some of the meaning and humor is lost.  The effect is similar to walking abruptly into a roomful of laughing people and not getting the joke.The documentary does work best as an insight into the workings of major studio album.  For example in the first half we get to witness the real brains behind the band in action as drummer Lars Ulrich and lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield butt heads and raise all hell and putting their ambitious new project titled The Black Album into tape.  The album displayed a new mainstream style with emphasis on shorter slicker songs.  Metallica a band that has forever been called  sellouts seem to know what they were getting themselves into and the hard work and determination evident in the documentary dispels any doubts of their merit.Interesting to note is the minimal input lead guitarist Kirk Hammet and bassist Jason Newstead this being only his second album with the band contribute to the production process. They more or less are nowhere to be seen for most of the first half of the documentary.  Also note the lack of reference reasons unknown to Michael Kamen the composer of the string section on the track Nothing Else Matters who Metallica later worked with on the SM project.Metallica nonetheless has a very drawing power and the documentary peppered with some awesome filming of the band doing what they do best in concert and the welldone music videos is a must have for anyone.".

I ended up seeing the movie a year or two later at a friends house where we marveled at the guitar wizardry the bombastic drumming the lamenting vocals the nonexistent bass lines that was metal for ya in the 90's no bass. Now back then i actually took these idiots seriously but after rewatching this movie last night the tour tape vol.2 i feel like i have rediscovered four of the funniest dudes! Everything Lars Ulrich says in this movie is stupid. Throughout the film the various band mates are put into a real world style cubicle and probed by a huge microphone to talk about their lives and touring blah blah. So these interviews are funny Lars contemplates turning arena rock touring on its head with various ideas meant to stimulate the audience. One is the addition of a snake pit the other is having like ten drumsets on stage so he can run around the place causing havoc. For a tour video its not bad its actually pretty damn good. You see the bowels of the huge stage where groupies and their moms get rocked guitar purchases hotel conversations partying fans and plenty of performances and music video's. I don't think any other metal band has come close to what they did in the early 90's relating to product sales. This double VHS paved the way for the Binge and Purge box set which was great and many more packages to follow. Yeah they went commercial they took the paycheck but they did give fans a lot to look at and listen to for a while. And counting. Great band greater comedians RIP CB eight stars.".

Kirk electrocutes himself trying to play guitar. There's some real smarts for you. I use to be a Metallica fan before I watched this. They should have quit after Cliff died.

The story begins with him as a disfigured older man and then he tells the story starting with him at age 10 encountering a girl named Neemi whom he befriends and wants to perform on stage with at his pretend theater. That girl leaves before she's able to do this and leaves him heartbroken. Ten years later as he's going to college he encounters another girl whom he names Neemi in remembrance of his former friend but then she also leaves before accomplishing the task. After failing a test in college he boldly leaves his family to start a theatre though this is against his family's wishes. He opens a theatre company but is still searching for his Neemi. He thinks he finds her but his best friend also is in love with her and this causes him to disfigure himself by setting the stage and himself on fire. This is a compelling story that is well played but it is almost overlydramatic especially the scene with him leaving the familyprobably because this is just not done in their culture. The movie does end on a good note although I won't give away the ending. The total film is really well put together. If you can handle the many Indian musical numbers you should enjoy the movie. The story in itself is enough to recommend the movie despite it being a little bit overdone.".

	schema:headline " Showman Raj Kapoor arrives on the scene";
	schema:reviewBody "More than six decades back a very young man proved his talent at a very tender age of 24 years and within less than a decade that young man started being called as the showman of Indian cinema and amassed a lot of respect. This 24 years old youth was Raj Kapoor who had demonstrated his worth in his directorial debut itself which was Aag 1948.Aag fire is an emotional story whose protagonist Kewal Raj Kapoor wants to make it big in the world of theatre. He starts cherishing this dream since his childhood itself and one more extension of his dream is to stage the classic story of Sanskrit poet  Bilwamangal and his sweetheart  Chintamani with himself playing the role of Bilwa the hero and his childhood buddy  Nimmi playing the role of Chintamani the heroine. Destiny separates Nimmi from him and after growing up not only he starts pursuing his dream with the help of Rajan Prem Nath but also searches his Nimmi only in every girl he comes across. However his thirst of getting the association of his childhoodlove Nimmi in his life and his theatreworld remains unquenched. The ladies entering his life have to leave him due to the worldly constraints. One day out of frustration he sets his own theatre on fire and gets burnt. His face is disfigured and uglified due to the burnings suffered. However finally he gets married to a girl selected by his parents only to get the most pleasant surprise of his life on their first conjugal night.This black and white movie is a showcase of the brilliance and the abundant talent of the great artist  Raj Kapoor. How he could make popular and impressive movies becomes clear when we watch this maiden venture of himself as a filmmaker producer as well as director. He had the vision and the ability to pick the pulse of the audience as to what it thought and what it wanted to see on the screen. Aag is not so pleasant as his later movies are. In fact it is a dark movie delving deep into the psyche of a youth with sky in his eyes and the pain of losing his childhoodlove in his heart. The fact that the hero tries to locate his childhoodlove Nimmi in every woman he comes across tells a lot about the passionate love and the peculiar loverpsyche. When a girl Nirmala Kamini Kaushal has to part ways with him quite reluctantly the viewer is able to see and realize the pain in her heart in addition to the pain in the heart of the hero. It's the sheer brilliance of Raj Kapoor that he repeated this scene with the same dialogues bidding farewell to her after a few reels with another leading lady Nargis and no monotony is felt by the viewer. In the climax the viewer can empathize with the happiness of the protagonist as well.Raj Kapoor could make his musical team properly with his second movie  Barsaat 1949 only. However at least one member of his musical team  Mukesh got associated with him in this movie itself and he sang one of the most memorable songs for him in this movie only  Zinda Hoon Is Tarah Ki GhameZindagi Nahin a painsoaked Ghazal authored by Behzaad Lakhnavi. Ram Ganguly composed touching songs for this movie including Kaahe Koyal Shor Machaaye Re Dekh Chaand Ki Or Raat Ko Ji Chamke Taare Dil Toot Gaya Ji Chhoot Gaya Solah Baras Ki Bhayi Umariya etc.This movie cannot boast of high production value considering the limited resources of Raj Kapoor at that time. Still technically it is admirable by all means. Cinematographer has done a brilliant job in conveying the intensity of the story with the use of lights and shadows. In fact I feel that considering the dark nature of the story and its presentation it's good that it got made in the black and white era. The lack of colours has assisted the darkness embedded in the screenplay and the characters to come out vividly before the audience.Performance wise talking Raj Kapoor has proved in Aag that he was not just an excellent director he was an equally excellent actor too. He has depicted the ambitions emotions and frustration of the young protagonist very well through his eyes gestures and voice. Nargis got associated with the R.K. Banner with this movie and gave the glimpses of the famous RajNargis chemistry that became properly visible in the later movies of the banner. Kamini Kaushal and Nigar Sultana have also done pretty well. One interesting trivia is that three decades later to Aag Raj Kapoor again used the incident of the burning of the face of a lead character in Satyam Shivam Sundaram 1978. This time it was the heroine of the movie. The sound of the footsteps of Raj Kapoor's much later and overambitious project  Mera Naam Joker 1970 can also be heard in this movie through the coming in and going out of women in the protagonist's life.I recommend this black and white emotional saga to all the fans of Raj Kapoor all the viewers liking emotional movies and those who are interested in knowing how the art of filmmaking got evolved in Bollywood post the Independence of our country. Despite certain weaknesses and certain over the top things this maiden venture of the great showman is highly laudable.".

KewalRaj Kapoor is a young and passionate young man wanting to make a career in theater but his father wants him to continue the family tradition of practicing law. He fails in the exam and runs from his house to fulfill his dream of working in theater.The film shows the lifelong obsession of Kewal with Nimmia girl whom he loved as a small boy. This reaches to the point that he names Nimmi whomsoever is closest to his heart. The film shows that Raj Kapoor was both a capable actor and director. Though the film is not technically brilliant the use of shadows is remarkable. The songs being composed in forties aren't very remarkable apart from Mukesh's Zinda Hoon Is Tarah. The acting by Nargis and other supporting cast is also good.".

No one delivers the emotional expression through the entire spectrum the way she does. I just sat there in awe watching her. I guess my standards have slid a bit since she left. But she makes all the competition seem like runnersup to me.I can now say that I think the movie should sweep a lot of awards It deserves Best Screenplay Best Musical Director Best Cinematography Best Choreography and Best Supporting Actor and Actress Kunal and Konkona of course. If there was an award for a woman carrying the lead all by herself there's no question Madhuri Dixit would deserve it. There have only been a few Nargis Hema Shabana who've been in that elite group. Madhuri belongs there too.There is SO much music and dance in this movie it is hard to pick a favorite. But as soon as I saw the dancers in red with their hair flying doing the song about Ishq during the LailaMajnu play I knew that I had seen this year's favorite for me. I like them all especially the traditional one for Aaja Nachle. But the staging lighting and choreography for this Ishq dance were so DRAMATIC that it stands out.I loved the subplots like the most boring man and his wife. The quarreling of Imran and Anokhi. The conflict between the Raja and Dia Akshaye a favorite of mine really gave this movie a nice bit of electricity. And of course when they told the story of Laila and Majnu as kids with her feeling every pain he had and the world tearing them apart my heart went awwwwwwwwwwwww not mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this time.Oh did I mention Best Costume. Madhuri was dressed so nicely! That last one when the play concluded was just gorgeous. I can see that this play would win the hearts of townspeople in a small village.Anyway EVERYONE should see this movie. I did a 50 mile round trip and this time I don't even regret it. Out of all the movies I've seen this year this one truly made driving worthwhile.9 out of possible 10".

She is the best actress to have come out in the last couple of years and the girl is here to stay! Sonam Kapoor? pfft! Katrina Kaif? pfft squared! The story is simple but busy with dramatic moments that touch deeply and comedic moments that have the audience rollicking. There isn't a single minute that drags this film is not only well written and well acted but well paced a dear rarity in Bollywood. In short it is here to bring Bollywood back to where it belongs!

Not counting Omkara this was probably the best film I've seen this year. It was uplifting and beautifully done especially the LailaMajnu part which I wanted to watch again. Madhuri who I was too young to appreciate in her heyday was vivacious and elegant and seeing her dancing and her expressions were such a treat. She's surrounded by the stalwarts of Hindi parallel cinema Raghubir Yadav Irrfan Khan Konkona Sen Sharma Ranvir Shorey Vinay Pathak etc and I won't even bother saying anything about Akshaye Khanna because I'm just too damn biased. The plot drew from stories that have been around since the beginning of cinema. It's cute and inspiring and it appealled to me more than Chak De India because of the dancetheatre aspect of it. I think Anil Mehta did a wonderful job. As I was leaving the theatre everyone kept saying how wonderful it was and that oddly made me feel proud because I think this a truly nonconformist film and if it does well which it should it does completely on it's own merit not because of starpower Madhuri excluded gimmicks or because it's part of some trend.

As I was leaving the theatre everyone kept saying how wonderful it was and that oddly made me feel proud because I think this a truly nonconformist film and if it does well which it should it does completely on it's own merit not because of starpower Madhuri excluded gimmicks or because it's part of some trend. So do go see it!";

Aaja Nachle may not make that amount of money but Madhuri Dixit still has all that steam.Aaja Nachle is a very entertaining film. It has a predictable but sufficiently engaging storyline. Diya Shrivastava Madhuri Dixit comes from New York to a small Indian town where she grew up. Her mission in hand is to save the theater where she learned to dance and perform from being pulled down to construct a shopping mall. Does she and how? That is Aaja Nachle.What really makes the film work are the character artists. They are all handpicked good actors. Their roles have been thought over and come out very well on screen. Raghuvir Yadav Ranvir Sheorey Vinay Pathak and Divya Dutta shine. Konkona Sen is a great actress and lives up to her reputation. Kunal Kapoor does OK.Aaja Nachle is a musical the way Indians understand that genre and enjoy it. The film is unabashedly musical. The song lyrics are conversational and the choreography is of all sorts  street celebration costume extravaganzas sensual movements and vintage Madhuri Dixit moves. The dancedrama in the climax is very well done.This is Anil Mehta's directorial debut. He has worked earlier to make Madhuri Dixit look great on screen as an ace cameraman. This time around he has given her a worthy comeback vehicle. Jaideep Sahni has written the screenplay. This seems to be his year. Another good job done after 'Chak De India'.Aaja Nachle is a film of limited ambition but goes on to meet it. It is a nice weekend treat. Watch it.P.S  I watched Aaja Nachle at a multiplex near my home today the first day of its release. Madhuri Dixit appeared in all her glory for the song 'Nachle'. She moved like a divine charm. But guess what  not a single whistle ! I sometimes miss the 'cinema halls'. I missed more not having learned to whistle.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm quite frankly bewildered and saddened by some of the negative reactions both from movie goer's and critics with regards to Aaja Nachle. Many people expected for the return of Madhuri Dixit to films that Yash Raj would have created some huge spectacular epic full of pomp color and costumes. But that simply isn't Madhuri's style now. It was a script she approved because she felt it was most like her life now. And she chose well.Frankly the movie is perfect for her. The dancing reflects all of Madhuri's abilities as a dancer from classical Indian styles to modern. She dances better than ever here. Is the script original? Absolutely not but critics of this movie have conveniently forgotten that most Hindi films do not have scripts that are particularly original. Aaja Nachle is simply a movie that every country in the world who produces films has made at one point or another. The underdog takes on the governmentthe bad guythe evil ruler overcomes a lot of obstacles and wins the day and usually the heart of the people or someone else. The difference here is that Madhuri the lead actor doesn't end up with a romance at the end though we get the future possibility. Madhuri like Juhi Chawla and other Indian actresses who are over 40 and married realize that they can no longer run around trees believably like their younger counterparts. So a role such as this is perfect for Madhuri. The problemsflaws of this script shouldn't unfairly rest upon her shoulders.What people also forget is the wonderful ensemble cast this movie has. I throughly enjoyed their stories and personal relationships and problems corrupt politicians a best friend held back by her husband a boring man who wants more spark in his love live the angry young man who finally learns what love is and the young woman who learns what depths love can take her to. It's the solid characterization that this movie has that makes it engaging. Not elaborate costumes or big musical production numbers.That having been said the musical numbers particularly the playwithinthemovie run the gamut from being fun to beautiful to heart breaking. I was particularly struck by one song not on the soundtrack Ishq Ishq. Madhuri's dancing in this is both modern and reminiscent of a worshipful devotee. Breathtaking.Ignore the naysayers. Notice that most of the people here actually liked the film. Don't expect some elaborate script or huge costumed melodrama like Devdas. It is what it is a feelgood movie with a wonderful cast and the return of the Queen of Hindi cinema doing exactly what she does best. May this not be her last film.".

I mean at the end of it the goonda politician who would sell his soul for power and money is shown crying and business man who would bribe one and all has had a sudden change of heart! Please!!

	schema:headline " Another Sketchy Fairy Tale from the Yashraj Factory";
	schema:reviewBody "Sketchy is the word that describes 'Aaja Nachle' as the film has no depth at all and becomes just another halfbaked Yashraj fairy tale. With so many talented people associated with this project my expectations were high. 'Aaja Nachle' isn't exactly the worst film of the year and it is quite watchable and forgettable.Seeing now that Aditya Chopra wrote the screenplay I am not surprised at all by how the story turned out. The plot itself is nothing new. Why didn't the director focus more on Diya's passion for art and her desire to bring back the culture that she too got disconnected to? Instead it's only about how Diya will get the people to act in 'Laila Majnu' so that the theatre will be prevented from demolition.The dialogues though are witty and sharp just don't suit the characters. For instance when Madhuri's character tells Akshaye Khanna that she never loses one wonders about her marriage and her parents and friends disowning her. Also why is she shown to teach aerobics in America? What happened to the dance she learned in India? One of the major disappointment is how the Ranvir ShoreyMadhuri Dixit love angle was totally left unresolved. In one scene we see Shorey thinking wanting to tell Madhuri about his feelings and then we see Akshay Khanna flirting with her and visiting her in America. Wasn't Khanna's character an MP? What did he just quit his post? Yes there will be many more questions. Too many. The film is supposed to be about dancing singing art and culture and how that unites people but this point is too superficially tackled. Even the execution is very poor as the sets look artificial.In the opening scene we see Madhuri poorly do some tap dancing and aerobics and I was wondering whether she lost it. Then she did some wonderful dances in the title track and the Laila Majnu sequence and she reminds that she's indeed great with the Indian dance. I've always thought of Madhuri as an average actress and never found any of her performances outstanding but like many people even I expected something different and better considering that she'd be wiser as her career was already filled with bad film choices. Of course there are a few exceptions. I'm also appalled by reading some comments where people have stated that they're glad that she still hasn't lost her old charm. Why should she? She's only 40.However she picked the wrong film as a comeback. Her acting ranged from mediocre to decent but in all fairness it's the writing and direction that has let her down and she probably couldn't do much else with the role. Every single actor suffer from sketchy characterization. Akshay Khanna Vinay Pathak Divya Dutta and Irfan Khan are totally wasted. Kunal Kapoor is unintentionally funny as the goon. Ranvir Shorey manages to shine and Konkona Sen Sharma does the best she could with her part. Darshan Jariwala is awful.I really enjoyed the Laila Majnu sequence. Though its presentation does not fit well with the rest of the film e.g. the zoomlens camera from the top focusing on the bed how did Diya manage to pay for rebuilding the theatre so spectacularly. Nonetheless it's a beautiful sequence and IMO the best thing in the film. I also enjoyed the audition sequence especially Konkona's pathetic attempt to get the role. Her dance was laugh out loud hilarious. By the way she makes a cute Laila.'Aaja Nachle' is quite a blunder. Coming from the Yashraj factory it's no surprise but knowing the numerous talents involved it's a miserable surprise.".

Two thumbs up!BOTTOM LINE Its a bold attempt to show the art as it should be and not attempting to appeal to the new generation. That is the best thing I loved in this movie.";

	schema:headline " Very entertaining Madhuri shines!";
	schema:reviewBody "Upon release Anil Mehta's Aaja Nachle which was widely promoted as Madhuri Dixit's comeback vehicle failed miserably. I watched it now for the first time and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It is such a nice film  colourful musical beautiful. This it the story of Diya a trained dancer who many years ago ran away from her town with an American man she fell in love with and moved to New York. Now Diya is a professional dancerchoreographer and a divorce with one kid. In spite of having promised to never return to India she hurriedly flies back when learns that her trainer is on his deathbed. She is late as he has already passed away but he leaves a message for her as his last wish to save an old theatre named Ajanta where she used to dance from getting ruined and turned into a shopping mall. The story follows Diya's firm decision and later efforts to revive the Ajanta theatre in a town where she is widely infamous. Her plan is to set a new play named Laila Majnu. The problem is that people in the town dislike her and only a good response to it can change the theatre's fate.Aaja Nachle is essentially a musical nothing very serious nothing to be taken seriously and nothing that will provide you with new lessons in life. What it definitely does provide is entertainment and there it scores. It is not a great movie but it has a great sense of fun and it flows well. The song numbers are appropriately incorporated into the film and in this one they are presented mostly as realistic situations in accordance with the story. The film has many subplots many of which I think were effectively presented particularly the one involving the character of Mohan Sharma Diya's past fiance who was abandoned as she ran away. Several sequences are extremely funny. My favourite is when different girls most of whom know nothing about dance audition for Diya's play. Director Anil Mehta is an accomplished cinematographer and he uses his skills to the max in his first directorial effort. Choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant which is obviously very important is very well done. The music directors duo SalimSulaiman compose a nice soundtrack without which the film would.Aaja Nachle rests on the able shoulders of the wonderful Madhuri Dixit who is as charming natural and charismatic as ever. Clearly her absence from movies has dimmed absolutely nothing about her neither her acting prowess nor her everso commanding screen presence. Dixit is according to me one of the most beautiful women in the world and here her youthful juvenile beauty is replaced by a more mature and ripe look which is equally appealing. Her eyes speak volumes her expressions and gestures remain refined and forceful and her smile... oh this gorgeous smile it is as amazing and mesmerising as ever. Diya's persona is actually the one that made Dixit the star she is the star who at some point could give any hero or heroine a run for their money. She is a strong woman who reeks charisma and dares to live life on her terms. The film doesn't give Dixit many opportunities but she delivers. She is feisty yet gracious fiery yet elegant and she is always vivacious and graceful. And what can one say about her dance? Nothing except it is astonishing.The supporting cast includes many great actors most of whom are not given that much scope some of whom getting really small parts but all are good. Konkona Sen Sharma is awesome. She is simply hilarious as the aggressive unrefined Anokhi who is madly in love and will do anything to get the man she wants including dance like an idiot. Towards the end she looks very pretty and it is overall a very good performance. Kunal Kapoor as Imran Pathan is very fine in what can be termed as his own version of the angry young man. Nothing great but despite playing an overly hostile and hottempered guy he's quite a likable fellow. Ranvir Shorey steals the show in a small role that is surely the bestwritten of all and he is excellent. Akshaye Khanna in an extended guest appearance is good as he is in most of his films. Divya Dutta is very good in a tiny role Irrfan Khan is criminally wasted in the even tinier role of her husband. Vinay Pathak is wonderful as the boring husband. Sushmita Mukherjee is funny as his wife while Raghubir Yadav and Jugal Hansraj provide good support.Among the songs I really liked the title track which is catchy and Madhuri's dance for it elevates it further. My favorite song however is the melodious Ishq Hua. The film's best sequence is when the Laila Majnu play finally takes place. It is just beautiful spectacular and is clearly wellinvested and wonderfully executed and performed. The ending is expectedly sugarcoated but who cares? It seems like some people just cannot appreciate anything that is not dramatic. This film is generally a lighthearted musical that's how it's treated  it is good Hindi film entertainment and a timepass movie in the most positive sense of the word. Another complaint was that Madhuri got a rather bland role which didn't do justice to her talent. So people had not seen her weeping copious tears for so long that they badly expected her to do it again? Can't an actor be good when he's playing a character with less tears and more smiles? Actually the film is more of a tribute to Dixit's mastery of the art of dance which was one of the main factors that made her so popular and I say it's worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Yash Raj film scripted by Jaideep Sahni of Khosla Ka Ghosla Bunty Aur babli and Chak DE fame that was set to have the diva dance back into our hearts  in other words a must see film? I went with great expectations that were never met and was left with a sense of sadness for what Madhuri's comeback could have been but was not. This is the story of Ajanta a dancedrama school with a supposedly revered teacher ? a guy I do not know in a wandering dervish type avatar. He gathers young girls and trains them in the dancing parampara that must not die. What parampara you ask? Well  this parampara seems to be a cross between the dancing style of J Lo and Madhuri in Dil To Pagal Hai a parampara that is very much alive and has nothing to do with our culture at all! The young Diya Madz runs off with a white photographer for National Geographia sic! and is disowned. She turns into an aerobics instructor as far as I can tell! Then the dervish dies and the small town has to be taught that parampara and Ajanta are more important than a mall on that site. And we all flock to the multiplex at the biggest mall to see this travesty! The older Diya has to return lock horns with the Raja turned MLA a totally wasted Akshaye Khanna many goons led by a bemused Kunal Kapoor her old flame Ranvir Shorey her old friend Divya Dutta now married to her arch nemesis a nonacting Irrfan Khan and has to find a suitable Laila an overacting Konkona Sen for staging Laila Majnu Ki Daastaan on the stage of Ajanta.What works in this film is so meager  Madhuri has a flat role with no nuances and the bravura kathak dancer is made to tap dance! I do not think a worse role could have been written for this actress who left her mark on the 90s and then shot back to notice as Chandramukhi in Devdas. But to her credit she is the one who manages to make the film somewhat engaging. The music is decent in parts but better outside the film. Ranvir Shorey does a good job as the jilted lover and Divya Dutta plays her role well.What does not work is so much  it kept me checking my watch so I could get a coffee in the intermission and then wait for this film to end. Konkona Irrfan Akshaye have terrible roles with no depth whatsoever and then do not do anything with what they do get to work with. Raghubir Yadav is okay but the guru belongs in a school for madaris! The sets are so fake and film city. The final play staged is too opulent and filmy for a small town. Do we really need to see Laila in a diaphanous white gown sleeping on a round bed shown from above? What this film needed was a a decent script this was completely lacking  what a disappointing effort by Mr. Sahni b a decent director  this one had no clue c a realistic setting like that of Bunty aur Babli to make it all seem a bit real d someone at YRF to get a clue about what culture really means  it is not about BW dancing or tap dancing or aerobicsbollyrobics how about some real culture for a change? But no worries  YRF will soon have to get a clue or sink except CDI they have produced nothing but tripe in recent memory. I hope Adi Chopra wakes up before he throws away the legacy of the pere.But the final word has to be about Madz  she still has IT the smile the style the looks the actingdancing ability  hope she make better choices in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think Aaja Nachle was meant to be a groundbreaking movie with the coolest screenplay. On a whole its even somewhat uninspired and not entirely original but its a good movie nonetheless. In the context of Bollywood however it's actually is pretty original. Which was the last bigscale femalefronted Bollywood movie there was? Frankly I can't think of anything in the past two decades. Nothing from of the large scale Yash Raj fame.To the critics who think this movie wasn't even worth a watch I think you've got the point wrong. Well sure it is a bit too polished a bit too commercial and safe but what choice do the producers have? I don't think the Indian film industry is ready for something more experimental and adventurous. There had to be some trade off.Even then some of that commercialised coat melted with Madhuri's charm. Yes I think Madhuri played her magic well in this movie. She sunk her teeth into the role and exuberanted her charm so well I think she alone added a lot more colour to the movie. She almost overshadows the second and third lead in the film Konkona Sen and Kunal Kamar. Both of them played their roles well and did a commendable job at that.To sum it up I think most critics of this movie expected too much from the comeback of the lady who's been hailed as Bollywood's greatest actress. As it is she shone brightly in a movie that's decent. Its storyline may be somewhat predictable from the onset but its still an untapped genre in Bollywood.I'd say sit back relax don't think too much and watch it for what its worth.I'd give it 7.510".

As it is she shone brightly in a movie that's decent. Its storyline may be somewhat predictable from the onset but its still an untapped genre in Bollywood.I'd say sit back relax don't think too much and watch it for what its worth.I'd give it 7.510";

	schema:reviewBody "Why does it happen in Bollywood? If a person is successful what is the surety that his kid will be the same? Exceptions like Hrithik Roshan do exist but in most cases the kids are awful. Here I am talking of Aditya Chopra. He's burying his father's hardearned name with a series of senseless movies which is bringing Yash Raj Films to an alltime low. They have already started cutting down on movie promotions. Except for Chak de all YRF movies this year Tara Rum Pum Jhoom and Lagaa chuneri have bombed. We say once bitten twice shy. But even thrice shy is not working. Now Junior Chopra comes with another Dumbo Aaja Nachle.As far as Madhuri is concerned the dhakdhak lady has not lost it. She still looks charming and can dance unbelievably well. And as a mother of 10 year old she looks great in the role.The problem is script direction music and the wrong selection of cast.The script is predictable boring and spontaneous. By spontaneous i mean that whenever some event happens in the movie it is solved in the next 5 minutes. Also the play in the end was below average. I could hear some emotions and applause in theater during the play but that was only from the audience in the movie itself. Moreover the overall story is not strong. And if you add an average direction to a predictable storyline the end result is definitely gonna be boring.Another problem is music which is just OK. For a movie revolving around dance you need to have a breathtaking music but there is hardly anything there in that department. The songs are equally boring.When we talk about good actors not being given enough opportunities we mean give them movies which lazy starkids are ruining. If you want Konkana Sen Sharma and Kunal Kapoor to form a Dancing Couple you have gone nuts. They are best suited for demanding roles which involve strong character. As for other actors they don't get much of screen presence. But i did like the little girl who portrayed Madhuri's Daughter. Looked an original NRI kid.Anyways watch this movie on a boring weekend if you have nothing much to do or wait for it to come on the idiot box. Just to cheer you up it is better than the torturous Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.".

	schema:headline " Madhuri's come back got to be better than this";
	schema:reviewBody "Aaja Nachle is the come back movie of heartthrob of 90s  Madhuri Dixit the dancing diva the Dhak Dhak queen ..but sadly Aaja Nachle turns out to be a mediocre movie which is definitely below the mark. I am sure Madhuri Dixit deserves better than this.. The movie starts in NY where DiaMadhuri a successful aerobic instructor or dance teacher is informed about her dying Guru. She immediately flies to India to meet her teacher who i mite add is clearly the most irritating character in the movie. On her way she recollects all the memories of her life in India where she learned how to dance and LIVE. The flashback part is the hardest to bear..Madhuri is clearly not a bubbly teenager anymore..n its a torture to c a 40something jumping around the city merrily..her Guru addresses her as Chudail..n thats wen u realize that not all dialogs in the movie r meaningless.. Coming back to the story Dia elopes to NY with her Firang boyfriend Steve how he falls in Love with this old woman is a mystery!!when her parents forcefully try to marry her to Mohan Ranvir. She leaves behind a hostile town few broken hearts and a close friend. Once in NY she realizes that it was a bad decision. Now after all these yrs..She is coming back to Shamli. She reaches India but by the time she is here her Guruji is already dead thankfully!! but master ji manages to torture by means of a video he leaves behind where he tells her that Ajanta the theater faces demolition because MP Akshay Khanna wants to build a SHAPPIN MAAL there. Dia decides to revive Ajanta by doing a show with the people of Shamli within 2 months and hence save it.I love underdogs movies its a genre which forms its foundation on hope aspirations motivation and courage. Sadly Aaja Nachle fails to embark these emotions. As told by Guruji  Jo Dil Se Nikalta Hai who Kala art Hota Hai Jodil Mein Reh Jata Hai Who KaalaBlack Hota Hai. Aaja Nachle also fails to inspire it fails to indulge you into the lives of the characters. The journey for Dia that seems so difficult in the beginning turns out to be a cake walk. She hardly struggles to achieve the success. Naach Gana Nahin Nritya Sangeet Choudhari Sahib is enough to convince the rowdy politician Choudhary SahabAkhilender Mishra. Aapke Jaise modern Jamaane Ke foreign educated MP Se convinces Akshay Khanna. The whole town which hates Dia is pouring in for auditions. Madhuri Dixit gets tons of extras huge sets costumes Funds to do all that and there is not even one single scene which shows her intense struggle or tries to explain how. Definitely these things can be left as cinematic liberty but a few explanations would have made the story more believable.One thing which will impress anybody is the star cast of the movie. Ranvir Shourie as the tea stall owner Mohan who is madly in love with dia clearly stands out in terms of performance. This guy speaks from his eyes and when he says Chai bhi aapki main bhi aapka he moves the screen Vinay pathak looks cute and definitely acts well. Kunal Kapur Irfan khan divya dutta Konkana Sen  looks like the Director spent all his time on casting.. But the problem lies with the script which hardly leaves any scope for brilliance by any of these actors. Irfan Khan is wasted Divya dutta has just one good scene and she does a great job. Dia tries to convince Shamli's junta to support her in her struggle to save ajanta by saying Jab Tak Suraj Chaand Rahega Shamli Mein Ajanta Ka Naam rahega. Clearly Shamli is not convinced and definitely not you...After the dialogs i have quoted so far it wouldn't require lot of brains to gauge another sad fact..the dialogs of the movie are uninspiring to say the least.. Another shortcoming is the music you expect mind blowing music the kind of music which will make you jump off your seat and shake a bit. But Aaja Nachle's music is anything but great. It's an average soundtrack with few moments of thrust. Another shortcoming is Vaibhavi merchant. This movie was offered on a platter to her..she couldn't have asked for more than Madhuri.. I was wondering if this was the same woman who gave us Kajra re. After a horrible performance in Saawariya Miss Merchant again fails to impress. I know its not that bad a job but for a movie like this you expect choreography which is out of this world. The last 20 minutes of the movie in which the play is shown clearly stand out but with stupid moments like Na Maaro Chot Lagti Hai Na Maaro Chunmun Si Hatheliyan Hai POOCHKAARO It leaves you with mixed emotions.Anil Mehta never tries to go into details. He didn't explore any single character he fails to put forward the emotions of any character and how the transformation is taking place. IF only he would have tried to put the characters of lives on the celluloid the end result would have been different. Yash raj has given us great movies but something is missing now. Chak DE is the only movie coming out of this production house which comes out as a winner. Tara Ra Rum Pum Jhoom Barabar Laga Chunari Mein Daag and Aaja Nachle also fails to live up to the expectation.".

	onyx:emotionText "Aaja Nachle is the come back movie of heartthrob of 90s  Madhuri Dixit the dancing diva the Dhak Dhak queen ..but sadly Aaja Nachle turns out to be a mediocre movie which is definitely below the mark. I am sure Madhuri Dixit deserves better than this.. The movie starts in NY where DiaMadhuri a successful aerobic instructor or dance teacher is informed about her dying Guru. She immediately flies to India to meet her teacher who i mite add is clearly the most irritating character in the movie. On her way she recollects all the memories of her life in India where she learned how to dance and LIVE. The flashback part is the hardest to bear..Madhuri is clearly not a bubbly teenager anymore..n its a torture to c a 40something jumping around the city merrily..her Guru addresses her as Chudail..n thats wen u realize that not all dialogs in the movie r meaningless.. Coming back to the story Dia elopes to NY with her Firang boyfriend Steve how he falls in Love with this old woman is a mystery!!when her parents forcefully try to marry her to Mohan Ranvir. She leaves behind a hostile town few broken hearts and a close friend. Once in NY she realizes that it was a bad decision. Now after all these yrs..She is coming back to Shamli. She reaches India but by the time she is here her Guruji is already dead thankfully!! but master ji manages to torture by means of a video he leaves behind where he tells her that Ajanta the theater faces demolition because MP Akshay Khanna wants to build a SHAPPIN MAAL there. Dia decides to revive Ajanta by doing a show with the people of Shamli within 2 months and hence save it.I love underdogs movies its a genre which forms its foundation on hope aspirations motivation and courage. Sadly Aaja Nachle fails to embark these emotions. As told by Guruji  Jo Dil Se Nikalta Hai who Kala art Hota Hai Jodil Mein Reh Jata Hai Who KaalaBlack Hota Hai. Aaja Nachle also fails to inspire it fails to indulge you into the lives of the characters. The journey for Dia that seems so difficult in the beginning turns out to be a cake walk. She hardly struggles to achieve the success. Naach Gana Nahin Nritya Sangeet Choudhari Sahib is enough to convince the rowdy politician Choudhary SahabAkhilender Mishra. Aapke Jaise modern Jamaane Ke foreign educated MP Se convinces Akshay Khanna. The whole town which hates Dia is pouring in for auditions. Madhuri Dixit gets tons of extras huge sets costumes Funds to do all that and there is not even one single scene which shows her intense struggle or tries to explain how. Definitely these things can be left as cinematic liberty but a few explanations would have made the story more believable.One thing which will impress anybody is the star cast of the movie. Ranvir Shourie as the tea stall owner Mohan who is madly in love with dia clearly stands out in terms of performance. This guy speaks from his eyes and when he says Chai bhi aapki main bhi aapka he moves the screen Vinay pathak looks cute and definitely acts well. Kunal Kapur Irfan khan divya dutta Konkana Sen  looks like the Director spent all his time on casting.. But the problem lies with the script which hardly leaves any scope for brilliance by any of these actors. Irfan Khan is wasted Divya dutta has just one good scene and she does a great job. Dia tries to convince Shamli's junta to support her in her struggle to save ajanta by saying Jab Tak Suraj Chaand Rahega Shamli Mein Ajanta Ka Naam rahega.

Of far greater interest actually is the arc the film traveled in terms of its critical and audience reception.  Actually this phenomenon can be easily charted by scrolling through the reviews of the film found on either imdb.com or amazon.com.  If you look first at the earliest evaluations of the film  when it was still an unknown entity riding the film festival circuit  you will note the almost universally rapturous response the movie received from viewers caught off guard by the originality of its concept and the uniqueness of its execution.  However if you continue to scroll through the reviews with the passage of time you will notice a rather extraordinary development that occurs.   At about the time the film officially opens to immense media scrutiny and unprecedented box office success the reviews suddenly undergo an amazing change in tone.  Due to the buildup of expectations resulting from the above elements viewers begin to tear the film apart mercilessly declaring it to be cheapjack annoying hopelessly overrated and totally lacking in terror or suspense.  Rarely have I ever seen such a violent backlash against any film though just try to find someone who will admit to liking Titanic' nowadays  one begins to wonder just who were all those people who collectively managed to fork over all that cash to the tune of 600000000 in the United States and Canada alone.  In many ways though The Blair Witch Project' may have made a ton of money it is easily the most profitable film ever made it may ultimately have been a pyrrhic victory for its makers since an audience that feels it has been ripped off' once is not one who will be favorably inclined towards your next project.Perhaps this helps to explain the dismal box office performance of the sequel awkwardly entitled Book of Shadows Blair Witch Project 2.'  As one who actually liked the original film and yes I saw it long after the initial media hype had died down I can't say that I expected much from this newest addition to the franchise.  The first film was such a unique work stylistically that even less than most films it definitely did not cry out for replication.  Actually this new film starts off rather well choosing to acknowledge the reality of not only the original project but also the media ballyhoo and frenzy that attended it.  The film cleverly lampoons the cottage industry that sprang up around the first film catering to tourists who descended in droves on the oncepeaceful town of Burkittsville Maryland where the original fictional documentary' was set. Taking over the reins from the first film's creators writer Dick Beebe and writerdirector Joe Berlinger create a scenario in which a group of fans obsessed with the original film embark on a Blair Witch' tour that naturally turns out to be more than they bargained for.  By eschewing fancy special effects of any kind and hewing closely to the reality' conferred by its documentary style approach the original film managed to convey a real sense of mounting terror as the people involved became more and more terrified and confused by what was happening to them.  The makers of the sequel attempt to create essentially the same impact here but with far less effectiveness.  Part of the problem is that the demands made on a big budget studio production are obviously worlds apart from those made on a small independent film in which experimentation and imagination are often allowed  and even at times encouraged  to flourish.  As a result the makers of the new film violate the very lessismore credo that made the original film work in the first place.  Thus as these new characters begin to spiral down into confusion terror and madness we are offered a plethora of quick cut glimpses of demons ghosts flashbacks etc. that are more distracting than terrifying.  We could believe what was happening to the characters in the original film because the singlecamera technique made it all seem so plausible and real.  This film just feels like the typical stock horror film filled with fancy techniques but little of the stuff that true nightmares are made of.  More often than not the viewer feels more like laughing at the silliness of the proceedings than gasping.  Eventually even the dialogue seems to be providing an almost subconscious running commentary on the film itself as the characters yell out at various points such pearls of wisdom as This is too weird' and This makes no sense.'The story does a nice job at the end showing how what is captured on film or tape may not necessarily correlate with the facts of history.  And I guess we are also encouraged to read the film in two ways  as both a genuine horror story in which the Blair Witch is somehow exercising her supernatural powers or as a study of mass psychosis playing havoc with a group of emotionally offkilter people.  Yet in the long run Book of Shadows' just doesn't seem worth the effort.  Any way you slice it a horror film that doesn't horrify has failed to live up to its calling.  Stick with the original model this time around.".

The movie is certainly less suspenseful but offers a little more gore and shock value coppled with a lot of really good heavy metal music.

	schema:headline " Very very underrated movie which is actually really good  Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Movies that do not walk you through it and leave some interpretation are great in my book. Blair Witch 2 is one of those movies. The ending had me confused at first and then I thought about it. As I see it there are 2 different possibilities. There's the idea that what you saw the characters do is actually what happened and then the Blair Witch doctored the tapes and killed those people. I find this idea a little hard to believe because the whole thing with messing with the tapes is strange but it is the Blair Witch after all. The other idea is that they blacked out or were seeing things different when the crimes happened. Like when Kim had that confrontation with the clerk Peggy. What she thought happened was she got pd at Peggy stormed out while leaving the cash. But what the tapes revealed was that she cut Peggy's throat. So Kim thought she didn't kill Peggy but I think she did. I believe the second theory because in the beginning Jeff says that film lies but video always tells the truth we saw the film but the video cameras were the video. I even listened to the commentary track and the director even says himself that there are many possibilities. Whew! Enough explanation of the ending hope I didn't ruin it. They movie is kind of ironic in the fact that it is making a big deal about the commotion of the first movie and that it was in fact not true. Lots of dream shots and other things to freak you out. I highly recommend seeing this. Plus the music rocks like that sweet credits tune".

I almost changed the channel when I realized that it was the sequel to Blair Witch Project but like a superficial girl I saw Jeffrey Donovan on the screen and stayed a moment ending up watching the entire movie.The movie was about a tour guide former mental institution patient Jeffrey who takes a group of tourists Gothic Kim Wiccian Erica and a couple researching the Blair witch Tristin and Stephen into the woods where the footage from the original movie was made. One night they camp out in the woods drink talk have fun. All the while they videotape their night. Suddenly they all wake up and have no memory of what had happened that night. Tristin and Stephen's research notes is found ripped to shreds all over the campsite the tapes hidden away. They find the tapes and eventually go to Jeffrey's home. Looking through the tapes they see nothing but eventually they run the tapes backwards and they find that they had a wild party. Still unable to put the pieces together completely they find out that tourists that they had a runin with were murdered and it was them who committed the crimes. Erica is found dead and they realize that Tristin is to blame for the murders I don't believe it is confirmed but it is implied that she is possessed by the Blair Witch and they confront her and as she ties a rope around her neck she mocks them especially Stephen who loses his cool and pushes her off of the stairs. The three remaining are arrested the cops have video tapes that shows them killing others. The tape shown to Stephen shows Tristins death completely different than how it occurred showing the 3 ganging up on her and kill her by tying the rope around her neck and pushing her off. They are baffled and assumed to be arrested.It is shot completely different from the first a fiction movie rather than a fauxdocumentary and the storyline being more clear.

That was one of the best movies of last year and now Book Of Shadows Blair Witch 2 is clearly one of this year's worst. It is completely contradictory to the original contains not a single character we care about and is recycled from about every other horror film released within the past five years. After comparing the two movies I am disturbed.Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2 the title is meaningless has not one strand of decent plot impression. There is just scene after scene detailing an assortment of unfocused misfits on a field trip to see the related sights and settings of where events in The Blair Witch Project took place. There is Jeff Jeffrey Donovan the leader an expatient at a mental hospital Stephen Stephen Turner who is writing a book on the Blair Witch phenomenon in the company of his girlfriend Tristen Tristen Skylar who is pregnant but is hoping for a miscarriage. Also among them is Kim Kim Director a Goth and Erica Erica Leerhsen another practicing Wicca who wants the Blair Witch to be her mentor. These characters smoke a seemingly endless amount of pot apparently engage in ritualistic sex had have strange experiences when they wake up the day after they set camp having no recollection of what happened the night before.There is such a struggle for good storyline the filmmakers provide the characters with excessively blunt dialogue to reveal important information and plot points. However to get anything out of the writing one would have to care about the characters and the movie provides no reason anywhere for us to concern ourselves with any of the characters. There is no development or introduction nor does the film contain any motive or reason. This is unfortunate because the only thing holding the movie together is the mystery of what occurred during the five hours the group cannot remember. How are we to concerned ourselves with the inactive conflict if we do not care about any of the characters?Perhaps the biggest flaw with Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2 and there are many is the fact that it is never scary or suspenseful. I was somewhat curious about what happened to the characters during those mysterious five hours but there is no clarification. Some of the scenes have potential to involve us with horrific material but never on the recognizable level of the original Blair Witch Project. The film often builds tension but forgets or does not know how to relieve it. The sequences that do attempt to answer our disputes are cluttered and distraught although they do contain disgusting disturbing and violent nightmare imagery. What really bothers me with movies these days is how so many provide inquisitive thoughtprovoking questions but never the longawaited answers. A specific scene in the movie has one of the characters ask what is happening. I think just about everyone in the audience had the same question on their mindthe movie has no answers.".

The camera in this film turns on itself and shows that once something has been filmed it takes on a life of its own apart from the realm of what we call fact or fiction.  I'm reminded of Robert Wisdom who said in Todd Solondz's generally superior Storytelling that once you put it on paper it all becomes fiction.  It's the same concept here with film.  A story which may or may not be true turning itself inside out so many times that neither the audience nor the characters know for sure what the truth is anymore.  It's a cautionary message and a reprimand which seems to have generally gone unheeded.I'll probably see this again.".

	schema:headline " A concept film masquerading as a horror movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Book of Shadows is technically the follow up to the 1999snoozefest The Blair Witch Project but has few ties to the original. This movie is not a true sequel to BWP. It mentions the original film as a work of fiction and it is debatable if the BWP2 storyline exists in the same continuum as the first film. BWP2 has better writing effects and production values than its predecessor. It is unfair to compare the sequel to the original as the second installment isn't even a true horror movie. Book of Shadows examines the experience of supernatural phenomenon as it is experienced in reality. The question is Are the events in the movie objectively happening or are they subjective experiences of the participants based on collective delusion? The film maintains a constant level of tension and creepiness but genuine scares are few and far between. That said I believe that the filmmaker's intention was not cheap frights. Viewers are shown the events though the victims eyes you spend most of the film trying to figure out what is going on. The confusion is played out less through plot advances but rather through character development. The writing is decent. Every character but the Wiccan has believable dialog. There are also some great scenes that show a level of cinematography that is not evident in the grainy original. The BWP used amateur video to create the mood of the original. There are no scenes in the movie that are technically well done. BWP2 has some well architected images that invoke tension by their design. The only point where this movie suffers is in its attachment to the original film. This is not a great movie but people will hate it because of its association with the BWP. The film is based on the cultural event surrounding the BWP not the movie. Audiences may not have been sure if the footage in the original movie was real or faked. Even if they knew it was 'just a film' there was still doubt about the subject matter. Was there a real Blair Witch legend? Was the movie based in fact? Was there a disappearance? BWP2 focus on the confusion created by the uncertainty. If you were frightened by the original BWP it was because of the mystique not because of what you saw in the film. This movie examines the effects of mythology and belief on the collective perceptions of the believers. If this movie had focused on some other phenomenon than 'Blair Witch Hysteria' it would not suffer from the backlash of the original. I think this is a good flick and worth a rental if not the price of admission. Don't expect a horror film this movie is working at a higher level.".

	schema:reviewBody "Attracted by the film The Blair Witch Project' hoards of film fans have been pouring into the small town of the film.  One such group books onto a Blair Witch Hunt' tour to camp in the woods and see the sights. When they awake the next morning to find their camera equipment smashed 5 hours unaccounted for and their film hidden in the same spot as the film from the original movie they are unsure what happened.  However as they replay the video tape they notice some very weird things.Undeterred by bad reviews I decided to watch this film on television the other night.  Initially I was impressed by the idea instead of following the original movie the sequel twists the idea of the original as a documentary and presents it as a film but then uses the film to present another story that is in the real world'.  Conceptually this was quite clever and I was drawn in by it.  Sadly this didn't last very long and it wasn't long before it became quite an ordinary film that wasn't creepy in any way and was actually quite dull.The plot is interesting  interesting enough to keep me watching anyway. The twists are the end are meant to be horrifying and perhaps surprising but by then all they got out of me was an oh' of vague interest.  For most of the film it is noisy chat and fake surprises and creepy goingson.  They didn't work as the film felt very trashy and uninvolving.  The gore and flashed edits of violence were supposed to keep us guessing I think but they only served to numb me to the film as did the occasional dreamfantasy sequence.  It was a shame as it was a clever idea and had some good bits in it but the delivery let it down.The direction is very plain and doesn't manage to build an air of suspense anywhere near as well as in the original resulting in a rather boring series of scenes punctuated by scares' that don't work.  The cast don't really help either they don't come across as real people and it is hard to care for such as self important group of people who are walking stereotypes  the goth the witch the college boy etc.  At least in the original we got to see them break down and become more afraid during the film  here they could be the cast from any teen horror movie.As you may have guessed I'm not a big fan of teen slasher movies but Blair Witch was much more than that and traded on atmosphere  that was it's strength.  By throwing in gore from the very start and having tonnes of little imagined scenes of horror Book of Shadows loses that strength and becomes a movie that lives and dies on it's ability to scare.  Sadly the originally good idea doesn't scare and remains interesting' and nothing more.  It is a shame that they had to make this film as it won't satisfy those who like their horror creepy or those who like it bloody.".

Was it mass hallucination? was it a curse? ?? all of the above? up to you to guess at thats the fun of it.Just cause you don't get it doesn't mean it isn't good. Matter of fact thats probably just proof this movie is good there's plenty for you to miss and many people miss it. I have a feeling the people that didn't care for this movie didn't understand natural born killers requiem for a dream blue velvet or a billion other movies either.excellent flick  I've seen it about 4 times I love the visuals the music the actors the plot  i loved the secret message hunt provided in the DVD version that was a lot of fun  and i enjoy the whole concept but I'm not going to get into any spoilers  for those that don't get it.... ah well maybe an action movie is a better choice for you.".

It's not shot in a mock documentary style but in a conventional way on a sound stage with a script and regular cameras and special effects.

There's nobody here you've ever heard of seen before or will want ever to see again.  The acting is uniformly wooden and forgettable and similarly the direction by Joe Berlinger who surprise surprise hasn't directed anything else you've ever heard of either.  We're therefore stuck with the worst of both worlds the low artistic aspirations of a studio film combined with the low budget of an independent picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film best described as an interesting failure this sequel didn't have me holding my hopes up very much  seeing as just about all reviewers gave it negative marks. In my mind THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was one of the scariest films I've ever seen and any film following that is going to look bad in the process. So I kept my expectations extremely low and went to see this sequel on Halloween. It's a film that borderlines on genius and very nearly manages to be extremely scary but loses all credibility with a cast of poor performers and some cheap shock tactics. Indeed it's easy to be alarmed by the jump in your seat shots of objects smashing through windows or instead be disgusted by some gruesome hallucinations our friends have  a woman rips a man's stomach open with her nails another girl is seen to eat a dead bird  but the underlying themes in this film are the ones that make it interesting.Looking beyond the obvious shockgore tactics this film's main theme is that of perception  and whether we the audience or they the people in the film are truly seeing what's going on. Clever editing is used to build up to the chilling revelation and the ending was for me a very good one. Sadly the true horror of the situation is underplayed in favour of a high dosage of unwanted comic relief poor acting and a whole slew of supposedly disturbinghorrific moments which actually turn out to be unintentionally funny.Whereas the first film established a backtoroots documentary approach this film in turn goes overboard with the exploitation tactics to appeal to a young audience. One character wanders around naked for much of the film while repeated clips of a bloody murder are shown throughout the film. The one interesting character in this film is the tour's guide an exmental patient who finds his sanity breaking down as the film progresses. Played by Jeffrey Donovan the acting is spot on and he turns in an excellent portrayal. It's just a shame that the others don't live up to his standards. The actress playing the pregnant woman is forced to do a lot of humiliating things and her acting skills are frequently laughable  of course this is not helped by inane dialogue like when she sprouts about dead children looking up her skirt. Her husband is not much better being as he is a bland puppet while the Wiccan character in this film I found to be extremely irritating. Finally the actress playing the goth shows glimpses of a real talent but for the most part she's simply obnoxious. And don't get me started on the intrusive music used at every opportunity.While it simply cannot live up to the first film this is more interesting to watch than your typical mindless slasher or gorefest. The film is based around some real deepseated fears of madness and chaos and with a better execution I think this may have been as good as the original. Just enjoy all the general weirdness going on as the film messes with your head and let it suck you in. My favourite parts of this film were when the camera footage was being pieced together and revealing some pretty bizarre stuff. The shock ending is powerful too. As a followup BOOK OF SHADOWS BLAIR WITCH 2 sucks but it almost stands on its own as a complex partially successful piece of psychological horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aaltra is a film like no other. It is not just dark humour it's a pitch black comedy. The only thing is that the comedy doesn't start at the beginning of the film and I was wondering if someone had got it wrong. When too feuding neighbours both get themselves in to a fight a subsequent accident with a tractor leaves them both paralysed from the waist down. Wheelchair bound and completely inept at being disabled the two then venture on a highly bizarre road trip to try and get compensation from the company who's tractor got them in the mess in the first place. Where are the laughs? I hear you cry well about twenty minutes into the film I started to chuckle and by the end I was wiping the tears from my eyes.

The only thing is that the comedy doesn't start at the beginning of the film and I was wondering if someone had got it wrong. When too feuding neighbours both get themselves in to a fight a subsequent accident with a tractor leaves them both paralysed from the waist down. Wheelchair bound and completely inept at being disabled the two then venture on a highly bizarre road trip to try and get compensation from the company who's tractor got them in the mess in the first place. Where are the laughs? I hear you cry well about twenty minutes into the film I started to chuckle and by the end I was wiping the tears from my eyes.

I suspect that this was a necessity due to the very low production budget but the filmmakers have cleverly turned this to the advantage of the narrative. The whole film looks like some stark minimalist seriocomedy by Samuel Beckett. Imagine Vladimir and Estragon in wheelchairs on their way to see Godot. Or two Hamms without a Clov.There are some bizarre continuity lapses these seem to be down to the low budget. And there is also a very gratuitous insertion of a naked woman I suspect that the distributor insisted upon this in order for the film to get a larger audience. 'Aaltra' is not to all tastes but I laughed heartily and the filmmakers show real ability. I'll rate this movie 7 out of 10.".

Second most of the players in this story are nameless. Third there is virtually no musical sound track but there is a hilarious scene at a biker gathering when le chanteur finlandais Bouli Lanners sings  in English  the well know blues song 'Sonny'. And finally the story is told more or less visually as good cinema should while the sparse dialog fills in the narrative 'gaps' for the viewer.It doesn't start as a road movie at all two locals in a provincial town have an argument that results in both of them rendered paralyzed from the waist down. After a period of hospitalization they both return to their homes in wheelchairs realizing that their lives are ruined unless they try to get compensation from the company that produced the faulty equipment that caused their injuries. So they decide to go to Finland together to the headquarters of the company  Aaltra  and demand compensation. And so they begin their journeyin wheelchairs! The rest of the story isn't really about Aaltra at all. Instead the directors  who also play the two paralyzed protagonists  use that scenario to explore and satirize how ordinary people treat the wheelchair bound and viceversa setting up some moments of sidesplitting humour and irony as the two travel 3000 km to finally reach their objective. And what an objective it is...which I'll leave you to discover.For me this movie is a treat a feast about why people go out of their way to be helpful kind difficult unpleasant devious obnoxious etc  and what can happen when they lose the capacity for trying to understand another's point of view. It's an object lesson for all and a very funny one to boot.Highly recommended for all lovers of good cinema and clever comedy.".

It also portrays the bleak loneliness of the island each man can become if he's not very lucky and the unlikely ways in which this loneliness can be alleviated.Visually I enjoyed the painterly quality of the over lighting of many scenes which allows moments of reflection and in the tradition of true art encourages the viewer to see everyday objects or scenes in a new light. Again I don't think it spoils anything as it's merely a brief passing scene to suggest you look out for example for the tall thin man in the wheelchair at the railway station disappearing into the light after passing one of the main protagonists in a doorway  it reminded me of the paintings of Francis Bacon among others. Even grim events can have a visual beauty or at the least an arresting quality about them and this is a film that has the courage to flaunt the fact and doesn't shy away from what is at first sight mundane or ugly. And as it highlights the hidden beauty of many ugly things so it also highlights the humour that can accompany the most unfortunate events. Even dreadful people have stories worth telling. As regards the humour it is indeed black and cynical but at the same time and as is reinforced by the ending it actually leaves the viewer or this one at any rate with a warm feeling and a sense almost of admiration for the sheer dogged tenacity and survival instinct of the two main protagonists. Moreover the humour marinated in my mind so that next day when trying to recount some of the scenes to friends I found myself crying with laughter so that I was barely coherent and seeing even more humour than I had noticed at the time.This is not an unpolished piece of work it is in fact skillful and deceptively subtle. A more obviously polished style would have sat uncomfortably with the spirit of the piece. It works on more than one level rewarding anyone who can view it completely clear of any assumptions prejudices or unnecessarily prudish criteria. It doesn't waste time being polite it just tells it like it is. Remember you're just watching it. It's only fiction and art and you don't need to approve or disapprove. Just experience and hopefully enjoy. I can't wait for it to be available on DVD so I can share it with my friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "AALTRA Gustave de Kervern Benot Delpine  FranceBelgium 2004A rare combination of reallife drama and black humor this lowbudget film from Belgium is a treat from start to finish. Shot in bw Scope almost every frame of this refreshingly original roadmovie on wheelchairs seems to contain a delightful comic setup greatly enhanced by its grainy 16mm bw photography.The film kicks off in a rural area south of Brussels where Gus and Ben played by the writerdirectors KVern and Delpine are neighbors. Gus is a farmer and spends most of his time daydreaming on his tractor. Ben is a commuter who has trouble at his work in the city and with his marriage. Both are very unhappy with their lives but most off all the two men work on each other's nerves. One day as Ben hurries to get to work on the small road leading to their house Gus willfully obstructs the way with his tractor. Ben climbs on Gus' tractor and starts a fight part of the machinery falls on top of the men and the next day they wake up in the hospital paralyzed from the waist down. Gus decides to head for Finland in order to claim indemnity from the tractor company named Aaltra. What follows is a roadmovie on wheelchairs through Europe in order to reach their goal.Part of what makes it all so strangely endearing is the fact that the two men are in a wheelchair which makes a perfect excuse for some comic situations. Every simple thing they do from trying to get money or food to innocent remarks made to strangers becomes hilarious because of the way everyday people tend to react to the disabled. Due to the almost universal belief in the goodness of disabled people in general Gus and Ben are able to shamelessly take advantage of even the most helpful and friendly persons they encounter. The fact that the two men aren't in the least sympathetic is exactly what gives the film it's edge. They remain malevolent hostile bastards just as hostile against each other as against the outside world they have to cope with.Considering it's minimal budget the cinematography is great. Beautifully shot in grainy blackandwhite with many extreme long shots many of them without dialog. And KVern and Delpine are talented comedians especially in silent comic expressions but they somehow managed or got the right people to do it for them to give the film a real cinematographic touch. A rare achievement. Aki Kaurismki and Benot Poelvoorde appear in the film in small roles although the latter is tough to spot. You have to be familiar with his legs or voice to recognize him.Camera Obscura  910".

What follows is a roadmovie on wheelchairs through Europe in order to reach their goal.Part of what makes it all so strangely endearing is the fact that the two men are in a wheelchair which makes a perfect excuse for some comic situations. Every simple thing they do from trying to get money or food to innocent remarks made to strangers becomes hilarious because of the way everyday people tend to react to the disabled. Due to the almost universal belief in the goodness of disabled people in general Gus and Ben are able to shamelessly take advantage of even the most helpful and friendly persons they encounter. The fact that the two men aren't in the least sympathetic is exactly what gives the film it's edge. They remain malevolent hostile bastards just as hostile against each other as against the outside world they have to cope with.Considering it's minimal budget the cinematography is great. Beautifully shot in grainy blackandwhite with many extreme long shots many of them without dialog. And KVern and Delpine are talented comedians especially in silent comic expressions but they somehow managed or got the right people to do it for them to give the film a real cinematographic touch. A rare achievement. Aki Kaurismki and Benot Poelvoorde appear in the film in small roles although the latter is tough to spot. You have to be familiar with his legs or voice to recognize him.Camera Obscura  910";

They are both crippled and no longer have much of a life to live so they take to the road and just happen to hookup together for the journey. They each have a separate destination but somehow they are dragged along together many times just because they are both crippled and people mistake them as friends. The movie has very little dialogue and it's humor really comes out of the situations they are put in and what they do in those situations. The humor is definitely dark for example  one big laugh comes when one of them steals an elderly persons' electric wheelchairit's funny because we know they are just trying to survive any way they can and they aren't used to this. There is no music background in the movie so you pay attention to every sound and every camera movement which is very compelling and very unHollywood like. The slow moving story is OK because the characters keep our attention and we pay attention to everything because of they way the movie is made. One character is a motocross enthusiast so we trek to some of their races and the other character doesn't appear to care much for anything until we find out what he cares about at the very end. I won't spoil the ending but it has to do with the manufacturer's of the tractor that caused the injury. The ironic ending is a brilliant bookend to a very unique and slowmoving comedy. The quiet movie will keep your attention and give you a few laughs so it's definitely a worthwhile view if you get the chance at seeing this French piece of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I find myself reaching for the fast forward button right at the beginning of a film I know it won't be the last time. I LOVE Hrithik Roshan so I can even forgive him for this film for reasons explained later in this humble review.The story is of a young college student Hrithik who sees a young girlAmesha in a car and falls in love with her . Hrithik's character goes out of his way to meet her  when they eventually meet at her house his love is reciprocated but the girl is kept under house arrest by her father who has violent criminal connections. Hrithik's character again goes out of his way help her  manages to spirit her away from the house for some time alone. There are some very long dance sequences and ultimately there may be a happy ending but with much violence and upset along the way. And much exposure of Hrithik's muscles particularly toward the end.This review is just my opinion and I always say it is best to make up your own mind if you're going to watch a film so of course people will read it and disagree that's only right. However I feel so sorry for Hrithik in this one. I don't know who choreographed his first dance sequence immediately after the films costume designer kitted him out in some very dainty shorts for him to skip up the football pitch  but they should have been shot with the rest of the criminals in the first gunfight.I can only think after the success of K.K.K.G that someone wanted to make a fast rupee or two out of Hrithik  the choice to do the film was out of his hands. In my opinion he was given poor dialogue poor choreography  poor action to deliver and unfortunately for my number one Bollywood star the end result was poor too.".

Hrithik is good so if you're a fan then see this movie. It's very clichd the typical 'poor boy meets rich girl and rich girls father does everything to get rid of boy' movie which has been done a lot better in many other movies. In my opinion Deewaanapan which basically had the same plot was much better. For one thing the actress didn't annoy me so much with her heavy breathing.

At the end the boy gets beaten up by her family of goons but suddenly does some exercise and beats up all 100 of the goons by himself. He saves the day and lives happily ever after. We have seen this kind of story in a million Bollywood films already. This is one of the worst versions of a off repeated script. Forget fairy tales this is a rough scrap movie with two popular actors casted to make money out of the audience. Do not spend money buying this movie is the advice i will give. Hritek Roshan delivers a disgraceful performance and is one of the most overrated actors in Bollywood two or three good films. Amisha Patel is so sexy with a amazing figure but even she couldn't save the movie from being the Worst film of the year. She gives an annoying performance as the scared girl that keeps heavy breathing all the time. It really got on my nerves. This is a complete nonsense movie with some disgraceful action scenes coming from a good director.".

It looked like she gasping for air her acting sucked. Hrithik of course was great he really fit the part of Rohit. His character was a simple boy in college who is also a great soccer player. The beginning of the movie looked like it was going to be great but sadly i think the only thing great about this movie was when hrithik had that soccer match and he won. The songs were OK i didn't really like most of the songs. Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon in my opinion was way better then this film. I liked Prem Ki Diwani Hoon. Amisha Patel is annoying as usual i like her but yet i can't stand her! But i did not judge the movie because i i'm not sure if i like her or not. The movie was just bad that's all!! the ending i felt was cut off they should have added more to the ending. I actually waited a bit to see if they really ended it like that! i rate this movie a 610!HORRIBLE! i would recommend watching Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon. Because Kareena and Hrithik have a lot more chemistry and the story line is better!!oh and if you stll want to watch this movie even after al the boredom you are going to experience and the fact that this movie is really a smelly cut of cheese!! then go on right ahead because it's your opinion but still take my advice this movie is not worth watching  A huge waste of time if you have time to waste.Please don't buy the movie it's a waste of money. i love hrithik but dang a bad movie is a bad movie and that is exactly what this movie is BAD.BAD BAAAD!!!Awful!!so watch this movie if you dare!! but you couldn't even dare me or pay me to watch this movie again.AWWWWW the HORROR!!! and i am NOT overeacting this movie is a huge BOMB and no one should try to make it explode again!".

The music is just passable nothing special. Hrithik and Amisha are both great dancers and share an impeccable chemistry but none of that could save the horrible plot. How many times are we gonna see people act mean and atrocious and then apologize and everything will be honky dory after dragging us through 3 hours of hell.

He lands both at a mechanic's shop owned by Lalaji Jagdish Sethi. However he's fallen in love with Lalaji's daughter Nikki Shyama and it doesn't go over well with her father. Based on a reference he received from a jailmate he ends up instead working as a cabbie again but his new employer is shady and also employs another woman who has fallen in love with Kaalu. When Kaalu's new employer tries to involve him in a heist Kaalu is faced with a number of dilemmas.This is one of my first forays into classic Bollywood cinema. My previous exposure to Bollywood has been primarily through newer horror and thriller films along with the occasional modern musical. I mention this because it will be difficult at this point for me to say much in the way of comparisoncontrast with other relevant Bollywood films I'm still on the upward slope of the learning curve.What I can say is that I enjoyed Aar Paar quite a bit. Like many Bollywood films it spans a number of genres from musical and romance of course to crime action and thriller. Dutt who also directed and produced the film and cinematographer V.K. Murthy seem to have been heavily influenced by Hollywood film noir heretheir crisp black  white photography often features strong contrasts and heavy shadows with pitch black darks and blindingly white highlights. But even though that style of cinematography is present throughout the noirish crimeactionthriller plot points aren't very much the focus until the very end of the film.Aar Paar is much more about romance especially romance that is not reciprocated or that causes familial problems. On this end it is intriguing and frequently funny with much of the relationship development occurring in beautiful harmonically complex songs sometimes the discolike rhythmic repetitions of modern Bhangrainfluenced Indian pop and film music drive me crazyit was nice to hear music in an Indian film without overly simplistic unimaginative percussion.Kaalu is an intriguing character. While he seems mostly a victim of circumstance there are twinges of a shadier side that continually show through his adopted exteriors. A lot of the tensions in the film arise through two competing milieus trying to bring out one side or another of Kaalu's personality. Nikki and her family represent his sweet innocent side while his underworld boss and his lackeys represent a seedier more hedonistic side. It's interesting that both sides have beautiful women attempting to lure Kaalu into their realm. In between the two we have Elaichi Sandow Jagdeep a street urchin who fulfills a function something like a guardian angel.The least successful aspect of the film was the aspect that provoked me to watch it in the first placethe crimeactionthriller material. Dutt and scriptwriters Nabendu Ghosh and Abrar Alvi provide inadequate exposition and staging to convey the gist of the heist plot. Later during an extended car chase and shoot out there are editing and possibly coverage problems that make it frequently difficult to discern the action. This material isn't a complete failure but it's not nearly as gripping or suspenseful as it should be. However as this material is only a small segment of the film and the other aspects of Aar Paar work extremely well the slight problems did not bring down my rating very much.The crimeactionthriller aspects may have been realized more effectively if they comprised a larger percentage of the film. Dutt almost gives the impression of having to tack them on perhaps because of a studio that demanded something similar to the noirish American films had recently become popular worldwide.In any event Aar Paar is certainly a success overall. Dutt gets maximum mileage out of a couple relatively simple sets interspersed with a few driving scenes mostly process shots. The performances must carry the bulk of the film for its twohour length they do so easily. Aar Paar is well worth watching as an example of the work of one of Bollywood's important classic directors.".

During his time Dutt along with the likes of Raj Khosla and Dev Anand have specialized in this genre and have delivered some of the classiest thrillers in Indian cinema. Yet 'Aar Paar' isn't without its flaws. Some sequences have been dragged on too much and the pacing at some points is very slow. Moreover the Johnny Walker track could have easily been reduced. Most of the songs are a delight. The only one i didn't like was the 'Suhn Suhn' song which is also repeated in a sadder version. Guru Dutt plays his part of the streetsmart driver with ease. Hotties Shyama and Shakila seem to have done an odd switch of roles that had made them famous. Shyama who played a vamp in 'Bhai Bhai' does a fine job as a bubbly down to earth girlnextdoor. Shakila who played a sweet charming girlnextdoor is very convincing here as an alluring vamp. Overall 'Aar Paar' is something that can easily be enjoyed with the whole family. It may not be among Dutt's best works but is nonetheless a fun watch.".

But a weak storyline pulls the film down.The plot just lingers over the characters most of the time and the story does not move forward. There is a hint of a bank robbery coming but all it does is to set the background for the climax. At the end it is difficult to understand what the story was about.Inspite of all this Aar Paar is considered an important film in Guru Dutt's career. Not only because it is technically right most of the time like any of his films but more because in Kaalu he creates one of the most realistic trampwithagoldenheart characters seen in Hindi films. That character is seen in hundreds of Hindi films but hardly any is as real as Kaalu.The film has some great songs ever. 'Kabhi Aar Kabhi Paar' 'Ye Lo Main Haari Piya' and 'Baabuji Dheere Chalna' are timeless. Easily a Hindi film classic.".

It was one of the Forever Classics in the Yash Raj collection and the subtitling was way off. There appear to be at least 3 different versions on DVD hopefully the others are better quality.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not going to go into my entire life story here but I will tell you that i'm a straight person so it may seem a little odd that I'd like to watch this movie. I work at blockbuster video and I was running movies one day when I came across a movie entitled Latter Days. This was intriguing to me because I grew up in a mormon household but am no longer a firm believer. I read that back and was instantly intrigued. I have much respect for both the mormon community and the gay community so watching this was something I had been anticipating for a while. I was quite curious how the director would portray the life or a mormon who is hiding his sexuality. All in all I have to say that this movie is definitely worth watching. There have been some negative comments posted about the quality and about how the dialogue didn't seem to flow amazingly well at times but I didn't notice anything. I was so wrapped up in the plot and the portrayal of the movie that I didn't notice much of anything that was bad. Most of the people that have left comments on here have been gay so I assume that most of the people watching this movie would be gay males and if that be the case it can become very poignant and heart wrenching at times. I know what it's like to be shunned from the people you've grown up with not exactly how aaron does but I have a definite feeling and this movie went straight to my heart. As for recommending this movie I am all for it. Whether you'll enjoy it as much as I did really jumps from person to person but I say that you should go out and rent the movie just to make sure.".

Thanks for making this film and i hope it helps other people. I know of two Elders who did succeed in killing themselves over their gay strugglethat is just so unnecessary. This movie was one of the best gay movies i have ever seen. It is a tale of 2 men it was not about the sex. I laughed and i cried and i related so well to many of the things happening in the movie. You would think that the Church would offer some time of assistance to those of us who havedo stuggle with being gaybut the sad reality is that you are cut off just like the movie depicted and sadly cut off from your family and shamed within the community. If they were truly a church of Jesus Christ then you would think there would be love and compassion and forgiveness shown.".

I am no movie critic and probably see fewer flicks than most people. But I know what I like and I know when something tugs at my soul. Few movies exist that I have wanted to see more than once. This is one and I highly recommend it to anyone who is soulsearching.Maybe it is stereotypical and maybe its not Academy Award material I like few that are but it really touched some hot buttons with me and it moved me to tears in the end. I thought that Cox and company did a great job summing up such deep subject matter in such a short time.For those who think it's hoaky I say relax its just a movie. I lived many parts of the reallife version of this story and it wasn't always pretty. While never a Mormon I have wrestled with the angel for most of my adult life still trying to reconcile my gay being with my spiritual being. Longterm denial of my sexual identity at an early age led me into a lengthy struggle with drugs and alcohol and a neardeath experience 11 years ago. I even looked into aversion therapy once as a way to cure myself from homosexuality. Trust me its better to see this unfold in a movie than to have lived it.While it may be steeped in stereotype and clichs as many critics have suggested Latter Days manages to expose many shallow traits among the major elements in this story organized religion gay culture and even Hollywood itself I love how Cox portrayed L.A. as an additional character in the movie.I thought that the acting was terrific especially Sandvoss as Aaron Davis. The music is as touching as the story I recommend the soundtrack too. I can't speak for most moviegoers but this one will stick with me for a while and few ever do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note This review contains DVD bonusfeature spoilers...Latter Days is one of those films that really can't be taken at face value and to criticize it without knowing its backstory is to do the film a disservice.Director C. Jay Cox discloses on the DVD documentary that the idea for the film was birthed when he ran across an old photo of himself back when he was indeed a Mormon missionary. He wondered what it would be like if his thenself met his laterself and the first conversation in the laundry room was the launch pad for the story. Knowing the film is semiautobiographical allows for forgiveness visavis some of the film's flaws.Posters here have nitpicked the fact that the film is riddled with gaymovie clichs but let's face it the gay culture IS chockfull of clichs. Shallow prettyboys DO run the show so to speak. Because most gay young men have to deal with secrecy and repression before they come out once they do there's a bit of kid in a candy store about the lifestyle. Many will chase the promiscuity until they grow up enough to realize that sex isn't necessarily equated with affection or love. That was Christian's journey in the film and Wes Ramsey acquitted himself quite nicely in taking us along on the trip.As for Steve Sandvoss as Aaron he was incredible. The fact that both of these lead actors are straight is a testament to their skill at their craft.As someone who also had to struggle with the Godvs.gay tugofwar I feel he gave an extremely honest performance. It's so difficult to resolve the conflict especially when you are young. On the one hand you've got all the beliefs of your church being drilled into your head and if your parents are scandalconscious it makes matters even worse. On the other hand you've got these feelings you can't control which can become painful once you realize that this is your truth. It feels like a nowin situation and it's not surprising that many gay youth conclude that suicide is the only escape.Latter Days offers a bit of hope in its message that family doesn't necessarily mean biology. It's easy to see why the cast and crew took this film to heart and the PSA for The Trevor Project  a gayteensuicideprevention group may be a lifesaving blessing for some young kid who finds himself in this seemingly impossible situation.In closing a final plea to Christians who denounce gays It's God's job to judge not yours. Your job is to love your neighbor as yourself. If your venom drives a kid to suicide I suspect the blood will be upon your hand at Judgment Day. If God created everything he created homosexuals too. Maybe he put us here to test YOUR character. Something to think about...If we can overcome the hypocritical divisiveness inherent in organized religions perhaps we will move beyond them and truly discover that God is love. Until then it will always feel like we are living in the Latter Days.Take care all. May you find love and peace in your lives...".

No Latter Days will not be remembered as one of best written films of all time.  But for many of us this movie has provoked a bit of soul searching about the joys and challenges of being gay in America these days. More importantly Latter Days affirms the profound joy and genuine love gay people do discover with one another.The storyline in short a closeted Mormon Missionary from Idaho Aaron Davis moves to LA where he ends up living next door to a hot swinging gay boy Christian who has all the depth of reality TV.  Christian's interest in Aaron is initially motivated by a bet he makes with his friends that he can bag this  missionary man.'   Aaron and Christian are quickly attracted to one another and begin to struggle with their emotions sexual desires and the painful limitations of their respective lifestyles.Wes Ramsey does a phenomenal job as the shallow but beautiful Christian. But it is Steve Sandvoss as the Mormon missionary with everything to lose and for that matter a life to gain who really makes this movie something special and memorable.  I doubt that there is a gay or biman alive who can see this movie and not fall in love with Sandvoss' character Aaron Davis. This is an incredible performance for a first time screen actor!  Sandvoss is totally believable as a sensitive loving spiritual person whose humanity is profoundly more life affirming than his religious mentors or the sophisticated freethinking idealists of West LA.The plot and its various twists sometimes come off as a bit far fetched. That said if you are the kind of person who believes in romance and can suspend belief long enough to allow yourself to get caught up in this film it will leave you with a lump in your throat if not a tear on your cheek. If you are struggling with the challenges of being gay it will remind you that you're OK and are as entitled to love and happiness as anyone in this world. And oh yes.. it will leave you wanting to see more of Steve Sandvoss. Come to think of it I think it may be time for a third viewing.".

I was stunned when I learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after serving on missions. LATTER DAYS exposes the Mormon's persecution of gay members. The film is LONG overdue. It does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals. LATTER DAYS has great heart wonderful original music and an added touch of class from Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and reclaims his very soul.".

This is not perfect it is a movie after all. Though excommunications are held in welllit rooms with nice big desks and chairs it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark cold scene they did in this film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop smoking a cigarette. I thought that was so cool. I mean I believe that angels do watch over us. What is one supposed to do while waiting? Smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting. I loved the irony cause Mormons make such a deal about smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake and cried every time! It blows me away. And I've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. I would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Tower Theatre in Salt Lake will bring it back regularly at General Conference time as a cult movie pun intended but no offense intended.".

I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop smoking a cigarette. I thought that was so cool. I mean I believe that angels do watch over us. What is one supposed to do while waiting? Smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting. I loved the irony cause Mormons make such a deal about smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake and cried every time! It blows me away. And I've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. I would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Tower Theatre in Salt Lake will bring it back regularly at General Conference time as a cult movie pun intended but no offense intended.";

I recommend it to anyone both gay and str8. Religious or not! Supporting costar Jackie Bisset stole the show especially with her one liners. The nude scenes were superbly crafted as well and all in were good taste. Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal deprogramming instituted by the Mormon church to the lead character. It shocked me that this still goes on in the world. Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie tremendously. This is definitely the best gay film since Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie offering that year  The Fluffer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directorwriter C. Jay Cox makes a valiant attempt at creating a gayoriented film for a mainstream audience but he pads his story with so many contrivances that don't allow the film to resonate as it should as a thoughtful treatise on the hostile incompatibility between organized religion and homosexuality. The story focuses on the ironically named Christian a standardissue WeHo partyboy who waits tables at a fancy LA eatery and Aaron a freshfaced Mormon missionary one of four uptight whitecollared boys who plant themselves next door to Christian to spread the word of their religion. This sitcomsounding setup leads to a 50 bet made among the restaurant wait staff to see if Christian can bed Aaron obviously leading to complications that look anything but promising to either the characters or the viewer.Fortunately the film improves marginally once the two get together even though the evolution of their relationship is inevitable according to the conventions set forth by Cox. What is intriguing at this point is that Aaron's selfacceptance as a gay man is not as automatically liberating as one would expect. Instead Aaron challenges the narcissistic Christian for his vapidity and in turn Christian looks inward as he becomes close to a sardonic AIDS patient. The movie resonates most when it deals directly with the restricted attitudes of the Mormon Church as embodied most viscerally by Aaron's mother and when Christian comes to accept his own lifestyle limitations. However Cox layers too many coincidences toward the end and eventually disavows his social commentary in favor of a predictable ending.The music which is actually integral to the plot is unfortunately the type of irritating LAbased pop that distracts from the drama in particular a song performed by Rebekah Jordan playing fellow waitress Julie with lyrics courtesy of Christian's Palm Pilot diary. The performances are variable. Wes Ramsey certainly looks the part of Christian though his stereotypical character doesn't give him much opportunity to provide depth even as his character gets more seriousminded. On the other hand Steve Sandvoss is surprisingly substantive as Aaron bringing a lot of conviction to a role that demands a level of naivet that could be alienating in more cynical hands.In a role directly opposite to the hustler he played in last year's Mysterious Skin Joseph GordonLevitt is disappointingly onenote as Aaron's homophobic colleague but Mary Kay Place brings searing candor to the role of Aaron's intolerant mother especially in her blistering kitchen confrontation with Aaron. In a surprising appearance the stillbeautiful Jacqueline Bisset plays the restaurant owner Lila with effortless worldly lan. The film provides true value for its perspective. I only wish Cox trusted the controversial premise more than he does here. The DVD package has deleted scenes three music videos lessthaninsightful audio commentary from Cox Ramsey and Sandvoss a better makingof featurette and a short film from Cox Reason Thirteen.".

I found this movie very heartfelt and in several areas it made me cry. The reason for this is that too many years ago I knew a young man who went through what Aaron played by Steve Sandvossdoes in Latter Days but unlike Aaron this dear young man did not survive the ordeal. He ended up taking is life after his church his friends and his family disowned him because he was gay. There have been many people who do not think that the things that are shown in the movie really happen in this day and age but the sorry and sad thing is they do. For those of you out their who are gay and young you need to see this movie and if you are a gay Mormon you really need to see this movie. Plus if you get the DVD there is help for you listed in the DVD. Teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing and this movie touches it but that part is hidden to a degree. The acting and the music is excellent. This movie sold out every movie house that it showed but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release so for those who would like to see this movie I would recommend the DVD release. The only people that I know who did not like the movie are members of my own church and they did not see the movie because of the subject matter gays and the LDS Church.

Of course I loved Joseph GordonLevitt but he could be in a cat litter commercial and I would be captivated. And finally felt very motherly toward Steve Sandvoss.

	schema:reviewBody "I wrote this review of Latter Days for my denominational gaylesbian newsletterA man had two sons.  So began the gospel reading the familiar story of The Prodigal Son the day after I saw the film Latter Days.Yes the plot of this movie is easily described  L.A. circuit boy meets Mormon missionary.  You can see where it's going  Aaron Mormon missionary and Christian L.A. circuit party boy  boy meets boy boy gets boy boy loses boy.  Yes a predictable fairy tale gay love story with the requisite pretty boys and erotic yet tastefully done sex scene.  But although Aaron in one of the most powerful scenes in the move tells Christian that there's nothing about you that isn't skin deep this movie proves him wrong.Christian the prodigal son who has abandoned everything about life that isn't about play and pleasure.  Aaron the elder brother who has always done the right thing always forgone whatever his church has forbidden.In the biblical parable it's the father that tries to reconcile these two. However in this story the parents are all rejecting homophobes.  We meet Aaron's parents.  His mother cannot even begin to fathom that another man might love her son she cannot begin to see her son's pain.  His father presides at his excommunication from the Mormon church.  We hear of Christian's father.  Not about to have a sissy boy for a son Christian tells the tale of his father taking him on a hunting trip.  But the trip goes awry and later discovered nearly frozen to death Christian tells of being held in the arms of his unnamed rescuer tells of being warmed in those arms of feeling safe  he doesn't say but I dare add feeling loved by a man for the first time  and Christian reports powerfully that at that moment at the age of 13 he knew if this is what it feels like to be gay bring it on.No there is no loving father apparent in this parable to reconcile these two. It is the power of love itself pulsing underneath the skin which pulls these two together.  In this parable both sons have somehow learned how to love despite the homophobia of their past.But first to reveal that love the veneer that thick skin with which they have both covered themselves which protects them from the love in their souls must be torn off.  Aaron fears what Christian offers.  For him it means losing everything he has ever known his family his church his anchors and guideposts in life.  Christian too is cut deeply by Aaron. Am I shallow? he asks his friends.  They can't even answer the question the answer being so obvious.  He too has a life to leave behind and learns to hurt deeply even as he learns to love truly for the first time.The movie ends with a meal a party as does the parable.  This meal is not hosted by a loving father but by another lost soul who has found meaning in what both Christian and Aaron have brought to her life.  As the woman hosting the meal says to the gathered crowd you are always welcome at my table I know I am witnessing a eucharistic feast.And as I listen to the sermon on this Sunday after the reading of The Prodigal Son I realize why the movie has impressed me so deeply.  It's because I am Aaron.  And Christian.  And both are loved deeply by God. And if I am not both I am not everything God created me to be.And I imagine a table where I am welcome both as elder and as younger brother as Aaron and as Christian. And I say bring it on.".

He and Ramsey are wellmatched and their inevitable sex scene brief but memorable is followed by a compelling sequence in which Ramsey describes a childhood trauma which has defined his life to date.Filmed on hidef video and transferred to 35mm for theatrical exhibition the movie's meager budget places limitations on the scope and grandeur of Cox's ambitions though the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this minor drawback. Jacqueline Bisset shines as a worldlywise restaurateur at the diner where Ramsey waits tables for a living and Joseph GordonLevitt Third Rock from the Sun steals everyone's thunder as Sandvoss' fellow Mormon opposed to his friend's relationship with Ramsey on religious principle... but ONLY on principle. Though a little stilted in places the movie aches with romantic longing and deserves plaudits for its honesty and compassion. Best seen with a crowd of likeminded viewers preferably with a loved one by your side.".

Also the sex scenes were ambitious but the characters were far too uncomplicated and simple. The story was completely predictable with an even more predictable ending. Everyone was talking about how they cried when seeing this movie. It didn't work for me which is surprising cause I cry to a lot of movies ha ha.

There are a number of characters some nice and some not so nice each with their own personality nuances. And most reminded me of people in my own life.The story starts out with several humorous moments and slowly evolves into a heartwarming relationship film. The story progresses without obvious plot turns and never talks down to you. It makes you think a bit while waiting to see what happens. Even when I thought I could foresee something coming I was surprised by how it actually came about.Not many movies make me laugh knowingly at real gay dialogue and then bring a tear to my eye when I feel the characters' pain. I watched the film on DVD and couldn't bring myself to stop watching until it was over. Usually I watch a film in pieces over a couple of days. It's nice to see a film with gay characters that is uplifting but not preachy. I highly recommend this film! And not just for gay audiences. The relationships transcend sexuality.".

Older wise AIDSinfected character? Check.  Idiotic chain of circumstances that link all of the main characters? Check.The dialog was about as well written as George Lucas' drivel from Attack of the Clones.  I burst out laughing several times at what were supposed to be serious moments and felt horribly embarrassed for the actors having to spew the crap written in their scripts.  The actors mostly did a fine job given the material.  The two leads were certainly fun to look at. Sandvoss in particular portrayed what seemed to be a very genuine character.  The sex scene was completely underwhelming from what I had expected from reading the gushing reviews.Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy fun funny nonserious gay romantic comedies.

	schema:reviewBody "I am gay.  My friend Ernie is straight.  Not questioning.  Not bicurious. Straight.  He's probably not entirely your average straight guy.  I'm his best friend.  He is super coolSo when I jokingly asked him to go to Latter Days I was only mildly surprised that he said he'd go.  I warned I thought it was going to be a silly comedy about a gay guy trying to win a bet with his friends about seducing a Mormon Elder.  Boy was I wrong.  Sure it starts out jokey and silly with as little depth as the gay character Christian initially lives his life in.  He and the other servers at Lila's who's owner is played with sterling aplomb by Jacqueline Bisset live and lust in LA.  They go out all the time and seem to spend as much time tanning as working.The four Mormon Elders that move in change everything.  Suddenly a bet regarding Christian's formidable seduction skill.  Almost immediately the tone subtly shifts.  The jokes are gone.  Not that the film isn't funny but the laughter is suddenly more character driven.  And wonder of wonders a bit of actual drama finds its way in.  Like any movie of its type there are always roadblocks set before the young lovers.  But where many films use sudden inexplicable actions by either the principals or some support character to push things along here we have a logical plot that plays out without too many crushing coincidences let us face it romantic films always run on coincidence  Serendipity anyone?. I will tell you I was blown away.  This film has moments of such aching beauty that even my friend Ernie was obviously moved.  It is a very fine gay film that touches and makes universal the desire to find love that gay folks have.  A point I'd like to include.  I know Mormons are for the most part pretty nice folks. I also know they are hated pretty badly and feared by many.  But even I am afraid of anybody and the boards for this movie are full of ugly quotes from such folk who make emotional or physical or spiritual threat to anyone based on their belief system.  I'm not against you buy you're going to die and go to hell because you refuse to change this ugly thing about yourself.  Is to me just as vile as I hate you and I am going to kill you for being different.  And anyone who says those two statements are different in any real way is myopic to the extreme.  Quibbles about the film  The crying jags of several characters sound forced or overthetop.  The sympathetic sister of Elder Davis is shown near the start of the film and then completely disappears.  Where is she when her brother is suffering?  There are many fine performances even among the folks who play the more stock characters.  Mary Kay Place Joseph GordonLevitt 3rd Rock form the Sun and Erik Palladino ER all do a fine job with minimal screentime.The leads which so many complain are not gay in real life do a wonderful job portraying what Ernie says are average guys' who are gay in other words not flamers or such.   Mind you Christian's clothes are either sprayed on nearly see through or just plane stylin'.  But he looks more like a metrosexual than an actual gay guy.  This is not a bad thing. Selfloathing kept to the minimum here and selfdestructive behavior are not the order of the day. And Christian's metamorphosis is believable enough.  The midcoital conversation he has while a guy attempts to distract him is so funny you'll forget two guys are having sex in front of your very eyes.If you are looking for War and Peace or Porky's or even Parting Glances you're going to be disappointed.  But for the kind of movie it is a warmhearted an deeply dramatic romantic comedy it is a delight.  Just ask Ernie.".

Almost immediately the tone subtly shifts.  The jokes are gone.  Not that the film isn't funny but the laughter is suddenly more character driven.  And wonder of wonders a bit of actual drama finds its way in.  Like any movie of its type there are always roadblocks set before the young lovers.  But where many films use sudden inexplicable actions by either the principals or some support character to push things along here we have a logical plot that plays out without too many crushing coincidences let us face it romantic films always run on coincidence  Serendipity anyone?. I will tell you I was blown away.  This film has moments of such aching beauty that even my friend Ernie was obviously moved.  It is a very fine gay film that touches and makes universal the desire to find love that gay folks have.  A point I'd like to include.  I know Mormons are for the most part pretty nice folks. I also know they are hated pretty badly and feared by many.  But even I am afraid of anybody and the boards for this movie are full of ugly quotes from such folk who make emotional or physical or spiritual threat to anyone based on their belief system.  I'm not against you buy you're going to die and go to hell because you refuse to change this ugly thing about yourself.  Is to me just as vile as I hate you and I am going to kill you for being different.  And anyone who says those two statements are different in any real way is myopic to the extreme.  Quibbles about the film  The crying jags of several characters sound forced or overthetop.  The sympathetic sister of Elder Davis is shown near the start of the film and then completely disappears.  Where is she when her brother is suffering?  There are many fine performances even among the folks who play the more stock characters.  Mary Kay Place Joseph GordonLevitt 3rd Rock form the Sun and Erik Palladino ER all do a fine job with minimal screentime.The leads which so many complain are not gay in real life do a wonderful job portraying what Ernie says are average guys' who are gay in other words not flamers or such.   Mind you Christian's clothes are either sprayed on nearly see through or just plane stylin'.  But he looks more like a metrosexual than an actual gay guy.  This is not a bad thing. Selfloathing kept to the minimum here and selfdestructive behavior are not the order of the day. And Christian's metamorphosis is believable enough.  The midcoital conversation he has while a guy attempts to distract him is so funny you'll forget two guys are having sex in front of your very eyes.If you are looking for War and Peace or Porky's or even Parting Glances you're going to be disappointed.  But for the kind of movie it is a warmhearted an deeply dramatic romantic comedy it is a delight.  Just ask Ernie.";

The two come together via one of the lamest of movie gimmicks Christian hopes to win a 50 bet by seducing the amiable yet deeply religious Aaron.The film is fairly predictable and relies on a few too many coincidences though the term miracle is dropped a time or two. But despite the transparent plotting and occasionally lame dialogue the film works. It makes the transition from Christian's superficial world to the complexities of Aaron's spirituality with a good deal of grace. The film seeks neither to romanticize nor demonize either homosexuality or religion and realizes than neither can be easily abandoned nor denied. While the film allows that it is not that hard for Christian to learn to put others before himself it also admits that it is not that easy for Aaron to place his needs before what he has been taught are God's demands.The film benefits greatly from a strong cast including two woefully underused actresses. The always wonderful Jacqueline Bisset as Christian's employer and mother figure provides the film with a degree of dignity while Mary Kaye Place as Aaron's distraught motheris honest in a different direction as she reveals the pain of a parent who sees her son's homosexuality as both a personal failure and a social embarrassment. The irony of course is that the liberal thinking Bisset's open acceptance of others is far more in tune with Christian thought than the woman who places her religion over her God.Also quite effective is Wesley A.

One of the hardest things any actor can do is to express deeply cherished moral beliefs without making them seem like canned platitudes  and that is particularly true when the essence of those beliefs conflict with conventional wisdom.

It's opening sequence slaps the viewer with the bleak unforgivingness of life in the backwoods of the Ozarks.

Reality strikes again when the local sheriff arrives to inform her that her missing methlab running father has an upcoming court date. He used their land and house as collateral for his latest bond. If he fails to show they will lose their home. Instead of breaking down Ree pledges to find him and starts out on a hazardous journey unlike we have seen on screen.This community of mountain people are distrusting of outsiders but stunningly are just as paranoid around insiders and even family members. Their way of life seems to depend on pure independence even though they all seemed intertwined in the same illegal activities and daily quest for survival. Some kind of odd code exists  ask nothing give nothing and get rid of any obstacles.The driving forces of the story are Ree and her constant hope and courage and her bond to her dad's only brother Teardrop played chillingly by John Hawkes. Teardrop tries to toughen up Ree and get her to accept her plight while Ree constantly shows his there is reason to plow forward.The film is very well written and the local filming brings a harsh reality that was crucial to the film's success. Additionally I was stunned at the fierceness displayed by Jennifer Lawrence as Ree. Her performance reminded me of my first exposure to the talents of Meryl Streep The Deer Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood Thirteen. Talk about powerful and exciting ... what she did with this role vaults her immediately into a very small group of actresses who can carry a movie with their presence. I am anxiously awaiting her next appearance  a Jody Foster project.I also want to mention the music in the film. The vocalist Marideth Sisco is also the vocalist in the living room band who makes an appearance in one scene. Her voice truly captures the balance of hope and acceptance of plight.

	schema:reviewBody "It is quite astonishing what people are capable of when their survival or way of life is threatened. In those moments they are somehow able to employ a level of courage perseverance and high intention that they never knew they had. Such is the case for young Ree Dolly Jennifer Lawrence in Debra Granik's The Winter's Bone winner of the Jury Prize for dramatic competition as well as the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Newcomer Lawrence a Kentucky native is completely convincing as the 17yearold Ree who has endured much in her brief lifetime and has plenty of obstacles yet to overcome. Living in poverty in a small house in the rural Missouri Ozarks near the Arkansas border she has to cook chop wood and do whatever is necessary to care for her twelveyear old brother Sonny Isaiah Stone and her sixyear old sister Ashlee Ashlee Thompson as well as look after her mother who is catatonic.Based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell and cowritten by Granik and Anne Rosellini The Winter's Bone depicts how young Ree's life is changed when the local sheriff informs her that her dad Jessup on the run after being arrested for cooking methamphetamines has put the family's house up as bond and that unless he is found and convinced to turn himself in Ree's family will lose their house. Insisting to the sheriff that she will find him the young girl begins a search among friends family members distant relatives and the community of smalltime crooks dope dealers and kingpins that dominate the maledominated rural society. No one wants to talk and Ree is met with silence hostility and even violence. One neighbor tells her that her questioning is a real good way to end up et by hogs. When someone asks her Ain't you got no men folk to do this? the answer is an emphatic no. at times the film seems to be challenging Juno for the most quirky oneliners.Ree's main antagonists are her father's terrifying older brother Teardrop played by John Hawkes and Merab Dale Dickey the wife of Thump Milton one of the local bosses. The performance by Dickey conveys an overbearing sense of intimidation that is both real and frightening. As Ree navigates through this hostile environment we grow to admire her determination and her willingness to confront danger in order to protect her siblings. Winter's Bone is a film about poverty and desperation but it never exploits its characters or engages in manipulation or sentimentality. Though it can be hard to watch at times it is not as some critics have said poverty porn. There are lighter moments as well that include authentic Ozark folk music sung by Marideth Sisco and scenes of Ree teaching her brother and sister to spell count and perhaps more important for survival how to shoot a rifle. She also tells her younger brother about the culture in which they live saying Never ask for what ought to be offered. Though I was riveted by the unfolding story perhaps because of the film's high degree of stylization I stopped short of full emotional involvement and was often conscious of the fact that I was watching a movie. Yet The Winter's Bone is a rich satisfying film that more than deserves the accolades it has been receiving. Though it is stylized it has an authenticity derived from using local residents as actors and from the director having immersed herself in the culture for two years before shooting the film. Jennifer Lawrence conveys a stoic and hardedged individual yet one with integrity who has somehow avoided getting sucked into the soul destructive way of life that seems to be endemic to the area. In Ree Granik has created one of the strongest female characters in cinema in memory one who by her sheer will suggests what could be accomplished if all of us could live each day as if our life depended on it.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is quite astonishing what people are capable of when their survival or way of life is threatened. In those moments they are somehow able to employ a level of courage perseverance and high intention that they never knew they had. Such is the case for young Ree Dolly Jennifer Lawrence in Debra Granik's The Winter's Bone winner of the Jury Prize for dramatic competition as well as the Waldo Salt Screen writing Award at the Sundance Film Festival. Newcomer Lawrence a Kentucky native is completely convincing as the 17yearold Ree who has endured much in her brief lifetime and has plenty of obstacles yet to overcome. Living in poverty in a small house in the rural Missouri Ozarks near the Arkansas border she has to cook chop wood and do whatever is necessary to care for her twelveyear old brother Sonny Isaiah Stone and her sixyear old sister Ashlee Ashlee Thompson as well as look after her mother who is catatonic.Based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell and cowritten by Granik and Anne Rosellini The Winter's Bone depicts how young Ree's life is changed when the local sheriff informs her that her dad Jessup on the run after being arrested for cooking methamphetamines has put the family's house up as bond and that unless he is found and convinced to turn himself in Ree's family will lose their house. Insisting to the sheriff that she will find him the young girl begins a search among friends family members distant relatives and the community of smalltime crooks dope dealers and kingpins that dominate the maledominated rural society. No one wants to talk and Ree is met with silence hostility and even violence. One neighbor tells her that her questioning is a real good way to end up et by hogs. When someone asks her Ain't you got no men folk to do this? the answer is an emphatic no. at times the film seems to be challenging Juno for the most quirky oneliners.Ree's main antagonists are her father's terrifying older brother Teardrop played by John Hawkes and Merab Dale Dickey the wife of Thump Milton one of the local bosses. The performance by Dickey conveys an overbearing sense of intimidation that is both real and frightening. As Ree navigates through this hostile environment we grow to admire her determination and her willingness to confront danger in order to protect her siblings. Winter's Bone is a film about poverty and desperation but it never exploits its characters or engages in manipulation or sentimentality. Though it can be hard to watch at times it is not as some critics have said poverty porn. There are lighter moments as well that include authentic Ozark folk music sung by Marideth Sisco and scenes of Ree teaching her brother and sister to spell count and perhaps more important for survival how to shoot a rifle. She also tells her younger brother about the culture in which they live saying Never ask for what ought to be offered. Though I was riveted by the unfolding story perhaps because of the film's high degree of stylization I stopped short of full emotional involvement and was often conscious of the fact that I was watching a movie. Yet The Winter's Bone is a rich satisfying film that more than deserves the accolades it has been receiving. Though it is stylized it has an authenticity derived from using local residents as actors and from the director having immersed herself in the culture for two years before shooting the film. Jennifer Lawrence conveys a stoic and hardedged individual yet one with integrity who has somehow avoided getting sucked into the soul destructive way of life that seems to be endemic to the area. In Ree Granik has created one of the strongest female characters in cinema in memory one who by her sheer will suggests what could be accomplished if all of us could live each day as if our life depended on it.";

The basic storyline  a teenagers plight to save her dependent family from imminent homelessness because of the actions of an errant and nowabsent father  felt both authentic and compelling as did the way the local community closed in around her meting out both violence and support in equal measure.Using grey and oppressive colour tones the entire film is shot in a bleak wooded landscape where the grizzlebearded men all look like they've just left the set of 'Southern Comfort' and the stragglehaired worldweary lined faces of the women add to the unspoken sense of the harsh reality of life here. I doubt they see many tourists in this neck of the woods and at the same time the film steers well clear of the 'and if they did they'd probably eat them' stereotype. I liked the sparse and effective use of bluegrassfolkytype music which cut through and gave some relief to an otherwise fairly unremitting sense of hopelessness.Although the subject matter is an uncompromising realitycheck to much of the superficial Hollywood drivel that fills our multiplexes this is not a hard watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Debra Granik doesn't compromise in Winter's Bone. Not for a moment does she let a character get an easy way out. Even by the story's end when things seem to at least be stable and at peace things are not entirely happy. How could they be? The story is set in rural Missouri where at best people have a working car and at worst you see that burnt down CrystalMeth house over yonder. What is so absorbing in Granik's film is not just the main character the one character we have to stick with in order to navigate the dangerous and ugly backwoods folk sort of a Redneck Mafia if you will but the locations. A good lot of time is given to these winter locations where broken down tractors shooting squirrels and mountain music performed in living rooms are common not to mention the Meth cooked up every which way. We're transported to a place that many of us i.e those of us who live in suburbs and cities wouldn't want to go near. And yet this is America where good people have to struggle and the bad thrive on fear.The story is something out of a 'noir' story a 17 year old girl Jennifer Lawrence in her breakout performance is told by the local Sheriff Garrett Dillahunt who previously played 'the law' in No Country for Old Men that her father is wanted but also put up the house and assets for collateral and that if he doesn't show in one way or another live or dead the house will be taken away. Ree's mother is in a daze on medication and she has two little siblings she has to take care of so starts a search for her father. Nobody wants to help her really her most sympathetic ally is her uncle who doesn't know where his brother is and doesn't much care there's a great exchange at one point between the two You know you've always scared me. That's because you're smart he says eyes turned down but everyone else is abrasive and could at best care less and at worse tell her to get off the property... or else.There's a pervading feeling of something really really bad going on which Ree can only slightly comprehend. She is smart and resourceful and teaches her little brother and sister to shoot if nothing else for protection that's the subtext anyway in shooting squirrels but she's also not wanted certainly not by the locals who she should count on but look at her as Jessup Dolly's daughter as a threat. More is revealed about what happened to him and the sense of terror is really way up by the third act. Who knows what will happen to Ree or the kids especially if Jessup isn't found in one way or another. The discovery of Jessup as the climax of the picture is filmed in such a way that it is truly gruesome I can't reveal it here but it outranks most horror movies that only come close to the personal terror that is felt by the discovery.Winter's Bone is bleak but not so much so that we leave the theater in all tears or total dread. There's some little moments of hope for Ruby and her siblings and while her conflict with Thump Milton and his clan aka Redneck Mob leaves her scarred and more on her guard and she knows to definitely never trust that Sheriff again what makes it worthwhile is surviving the quest of it the mystery. Nothing feels fabricated in the film many of the actors come right from the region and are nonprofessionals and this is reflected in the material. And for such a hard story of a girl on her own with little resources and backup there's some great talent here. Lawrence as noted should become very hot that is a talenttosee on the radar from this film where her Ree is the hero in more ways than one but from her strength shows her vulnerability from time to time very well there's a scene where she brings her mother out into the woods to ask her what she should do tears in her eyes and I couldn't recall a scene quite as powerful as it since Nicholson's Bobby Dupea had a similar scene in Five Easy Pieces.The other actor who really shines here is John Hawkes. We've seen him in character parts from time to time I first saw him in From Dusk till Dawn as a store clerk and his character is given the most complexity of anyone. While it's arguable that Ree and the other backwoods folk are blackandwhite in their morality even when a woman character finally comes to help Ree in the third act it's by a lot of conditions the aforementioned 'gruesome' scene Teardrop is an unabashed drug addict and will most likely kill if he has to. But he's also compassionate in ways that matter and Hawkes shows this gray area of the character with depth and wisdom he doesn't make this guy a total hick matter of fact no one in the movie is too overthetop just believable enough without being like 'Deliverance but a torn man who has no real future but can be of help to Ree in this time of need. And he also gets an exceptional showdown scene with the Sheriff while in the front seat of his car that is among the best scenes this year in film.This is the indie film that people love to talk about the 'go see this' wonder that will probably barely play 100 or at most 200 screens but lights up with drama and consequence more than most films you'll ever see. Or to put it another way it's what Sundance is good for shining light on real independent product that is about something or someone and isn't tethered by Hollywood conventions.".

	onyx:emotionText "Debra Granik doesn't compromise in Winter's Bone. Not for a moment does she let a character get an easy way out. Even by the story's end when things seem to at least be stable and at peace things are not entirely happy. How could they be? The story is set in rural Missouri where at best people have a working car and at worst you see that burnt down CrystalMeth house over yonder. What is so absorbing in Granik's film is not just the main character the one character we have to stick with in order to navigate the dangerous and ugly backwoods folk sort of a Redneck Mafia if you will but the locations. A good lot of time is given to these winter locations where broken down tractors shooting squirrels and mountain music performed in living rooms are common not to mention the Meth cooked up every which way.

	schema:reviewBody "So by now Winter's Bone has been through the usual waves of reaction to any promising lowbudget indie film. First the positive responses from critics at Cannes then the wave of fauxcontrarians who automatically dislike a thing because it is liked by critics at Cannes wellheeled upper middle class bounders denouncing it for supposedly being poverty porn really just denouncing the audacity of showing poor people of any kind on a movie screen which apparently is just gauche people denouncing it for not matching their memory of growing up because apparently the Ozarks are unchanging eternal and completely uniform and various other forms of bullshtting and nitpickery.On balance though it seems to have survived the inevitable avalanche of nonsense and emerged from it with recognition as an extraordinary and immensely courageous piece of filmmaking. Which indeed it is.The backdrop of Rhee Dolly's story is a rural America ravaged by the global economy in which cooking meth or crank has become the entire economic engine of entire towns. This is a kind of story  and Rhee Dolly's immediate environs the kind of neighbourhood  familiar from across the globe in the past forty years replicated in place after place with faces of every hue and in settings from urban ghetto to the backest of backwoods. There's a reality an immediacy and if one hasn't led too sheltered a life an authenticity to the characters we meet in Winter's Bone anyone familiar with impoverished and ravaged places has met and known many people not unlike this.But that's not to say they don't have their particular culture that sets them unmistakably in their own time and place sternly patriarchal a weird mixture of formally hospitable and deeply paranoid even around insiders and family populated by largely shiftless men and tough wary women who forge their own fatalistic threadbare mutualaid networks. The omertastyle code that flourishes anywhere that people are driven to the illegal economy for their livelihood is visible here almost suffocating presided over by local boss Thump Milton... and it profoundly shapes people's reactions to Rhee who's distrusted by association with a father whom we later learn had broken it. The power of that code is vividly portrayed in Rhee herself who adheres fiercely to it despite rejecting for herself other aspects of her father's lifestyle and whose reaction on learning that her further was murdered for his weakness is not vengeful rage at his killers but shame on behalf of her father. This is a psychologically realistic and admirably unflinching depiction of how insidiously omertanosnitches codes can work in real life.The performances are spare and intense the cast and costumes look authentic to rural America not prettified and gentrified as would be the normal Hollywood reflex and there's a clear sense of a lot going on outside the frame. Winter's Bone isn't obsessed with the grotesquerie of addiction which is hinted at but not seen much in the foreground. It isn't obsessed with other familiar southern Gothic grotesqueries either though Rhee's fiery rejection of a cousin's proposal to take her brother in owing to their impending eviction by the bondsman certainly seems like she's reacting to a proposition from a childmolester heavily hinted also in her later bitter acknowledgment that these same cousins don't want to take her sister in because she don't shine for them. It is in main the story of Rhee's perseverance  both through strength of character and desperation  in the cracks of the meth business and in the face of a visibly broken community and society not a treacly story about the triumph of the human spirit but a hardscrabble story about real survival and all the secrets hypocrisies and untold violences that can come with it.There are some truly incredible standout performances here especially Jennifer Lawrence as Rhee  and really the whole cast of women from the crankcooking hamlet she's trapped in  and from John Hawkes whom you may remember as the mildmannered Sol Starr in Deadwood who is extraordinarily transformed into the manically intense loose cannon Teardrop. And for visceral emotional horror I've seen few scenes that could compete with Rhee's discovery of her father's final resting place and the soulwrenching salvation it offers.It's a slower and less polished style of film than your average Hollywood output but it's gripping authentic unflinching and well worth a watch. And a few rewatches too.".

Those of us yearning for more lowkey and character driven films  let's call them slow burners with a degree of artistry  must look to the indepedents for our kicks. Winter's Bone was one of the leading independent films of 2010. The critics showered it with accolades and awards while small pockets of the public championed it as a understated masterpiece. I don't quite find it the amazing lifechanging experience that it has been hailed as in some quarters but on the whole I'd say Winter's Bone is a unique original wellmade and frequently riveting country noir.In the Ozark Mountains the Dolly family  17 year old Ree Jennifer Lawrence her younger brother and sister and their mentally incapacitated mother  receive word that they may be about to lose their home. The absentee father Jessop Dolly has put up the family home as a bail bond to guarantee his appearance at a court hearing if he fails to turn up the house will be taken from them. Ree desperately tries to locate her father but she is just a young girl treading through a closeknit community where men and elders call the shots and the intrusions of a kid  a female at that  are not deemed acceptable. Aided by her edgy and dangerous uncle Teardrop John Hawkes Ree presses ahead with her search and enrages other members of the family who are determined to keep Jessop's affairs  and indeed his fate  a secret.Winter's Bone is perhaps most effective for its sense of authenticity  the ramshackle houses the perpetually secretive and suspicious characters the harsh living conditions and the extreme measures required to eke out an existence in the Ozarks are all captured very convincingly. The scene where Ree teaches her younger siblings how to kill skin and cook a squirrel would come across as gross and exploitative in most other films but here it's done with a sense of detached matteroffactness which beautifully complements the film's authenticity. The performances by the largely unknown cast are uniformly excellent especially Lawrence as the resourceful girl who breaks every established code of her people to do what's best for her family. There are moments where the dialogue is rather unclear and others where the narrative builds to a head but then stubbornly refuses to provide a payoff. However for most of its duration Winter's Bone is a very surefooted and intriguing film which rises to some particularly memorable moments.".

	schema:headline " Winter's Bone chills you with its authenticity";
	schema:reviewBody "Deepseated suspicions and clan hostilities run deep in Debra Granik's backwoods Ozark country tale Winter's Bone. Taken from the novel by Daniel Woodrell the story involves the odyssey of seventeenyearold Ree Dolly a great Jennifer Lawrence who is desperate to find her wayward Methaddicted father. He's due in court in less than a week and he's already jumped his bail after putting his ramshackle house up as bond. If he doesn't turn up dead or alive the family will be thrown out into the fields. To make matters worse Ree's mother is nearly catatonic and the teenager has to tend to her two younger siblings or else they'll starve. Adding to her dilemma is the fact that her father recently attained notoriety among his clan members as a snitch to the local police. They'd just as soon prefer to see him dead as to give out any information regarding his whereabouts. It doesn't take Ree long to find out that she's up against a proverbial stone wall and that her own life could be in danger just for asking a simple question. Her father's younger brother called Teardrop John Hawkes eventually decides to aid her search but he seems more bent on revenge than anything else. And he obviously knows a lot more about Ree's father's fate than he's letting on. Winter's Bone examines an area of economic plight and downright poverty that hasn't been seen in an American film in years. The picturesque Ozark Mountain scenery is abandoned for a bird's eye view of blownout Methamphetamine labs seedy bars and dilapidated homes. Ree's sole purpose is to provide for her family even if that means taking a vicious beating for asking the wrong questions at the wrong time. Her quest to find her dear old dad takes quite a few tragic detours but what doesn't kill this young heroine makes her that much stronger. The fine cast includes Garret Dillahunt as the local sheriff who's more interested in Uncle Teardrop's violent activities than cracking down on illegal Meth labs. Their faceoff duel near the end of the film is one of the highlights and a pivotal scene. Dale Dickey looking like an Ozark version of Madame DeFarge is the menacing Merab. Her grimreaper face is enough to scare away any stray animal or traveling salesperson. Lauren Sweetser Gail provides some comforting moments for Ree but they're too few to make much of a difference in her tragic search for the truth. Like everyone else in this neck of the woods Gail has her own problems to contend with. Anne Rosellini cowrote the adapted screenplay with director Granik and they're sure to win at least a few nominations when the awards season rolls around. Winter's Bone is one of the best movies of the year and certainly the most original one by a country mile.".

I rate films out of honesty and this is what I honestly think of Winter's Bone.First off I can't deny this film is gorgeously shot. There's some great and nifty camera work in the movie and the scenery is just pure eye candy. I loved the opening shots and ominous dark tone... and then the characters started talking. Seriously the dialogue is so overblown and tacky. I was laughing at pretty much 80 of the lines spoken in the film. How this was up for Best Screenplay is against me.What very little plot there is relies on the protagonist being ten times as stupid as the characters in most movies today. It's about a girl at risk of losing her home searching for her father. What feels like an hour of the film is devoted to silent footage of the protagonist walking through the woods. If you cut half of the walking through the woods out the movie would be an hour long. And again there was a lot of buildup but NO ENDING... it just ends.The actors do a pretty good job given the script but this film is a massive bore. I don't even think hobos with shotguns could save this film. I honestly don't get all the praise this gets.".

Unfortunately in Winter's Bone the incompetent director Debra Granik together with her miserably mundane cast headed by Jennifer Lawrence a wooden heroine John Hawkes a drab evil uncle and Valerie Richards a loathsome Texan stereotype have neglected to put any life heart of poignancy into the material.

Most of today's films are just a rehash of some other financially successful similar film or worst of all sequels. So many garbage films how can you trust someone who watches a lot of today's movies? I watch few newer films and when I do it is something like 'Winters bone' an original stark and realistic film shot on location in the Missouri Ozarks.Ree Dolly Jennifer Lawrence is a 17 year old who is raising her two younger siblings in the absence of her father and the debilitating mental illness of her mother. The Ozark mountains in recent decades has experienced an epidemic of meth cooking and Winters bone takes us inside an extended family that has become deeply immersed in drugs. Ree's father has been running methlabs and is in deep trouble with the law and has apparently hit the road...at least that is one possibility and the sheriff now is telling Ree that if he doesn't show up for a court date Ree and her family will lose their home which dad had used as collateral to a bondsman.This is the setup for Rees journey to find her father and keep her family together. Her uncle Teardrop John Hawkes perfectly cast warns her to stay away from the family and their business but Ree is determined and sets out mostly on foot deeper into the hidden crevices of this area that time has left behind. She is fearless and defiant and Lawrence brilliantly captures the aura of a young woman who has grown up being taught the things that children just are not taught in today's America not just the hard work like chopping wood but shooting and hunting and gutting a squirrel and some touching scenes show her teaching some of these things to her much younger brother and sister. At first I thought she may look a little too clean for the part her skin too clear but she quickly grew on me in what is a fully convincing performance.Winter's bone is much more than the story this is deeply rooted in the location depicted and people who love location photography and the lay of the land a part of America that hasn't changed much in 100 years will appreciate the visual aspects of this film. I was reminded a little of 'Deliverance' or the little known Walter Hill film 'Southern comfort' when watching Winter's bone. To have seen and enjoyed either of those two films is to understand what to expect from this kind of environment. I love unique settings like this a nice piece of Americana full of local flavor and I think the filmmakers understood this well as several of the actors were Ozark mountain locals and they add to the ardent realism of the film.What also shines through is the hope the hope and strength of this incredible 17 year old woman who faces challenges that contemporary women for all their talk of having it all career family. etc could never handle. That's all she knows how to survive against all kinds of odds...it's her bread and butter...and to those who would say don't waste your time on this movie I would say...don't waste your time trying to be a film critic.".

	schema:headline " Adheres too rigidly to the indie formula";
	schema:reviewBody "More poverty porn from Sundance and the indie film circuit a trend which started with David Green's George Washington though some cite Harmony Korine's Gummo reached its peak with Shotgun Stories and seems to be fizzling to a conclusion with Winter's Bone. Typically all these films belong to the Southern Gothic genre involve semi mythic story lines Grecian family tragedies take place in poverty stricken areas involve rednecks or poor characters and hinge around the promise of some third act moment of violence. In other words these films are all designed around their budgets how to make cheap dramatic films which take place in environments sufficiently alien to affluent white audiences and appealing to left leaning American critics. Alternative film has become as formulaic as the stuff it pretends not to be.Which is not to say that Winter's Bone is a bad film  I'll take it over any other Hollywood megaproduction currently in cinemas  but one can't escape how drearily formulaic indie cinema has become. That the only way for budding directors to guarantee critical success let alone distribution is to hop on board the indie conveyor belt. Now every major studio seems to be courting these films releasing redneck flicks like Hounddog Undertow In The Electric Mist and Black Snake Moan and similar fare like Precious Ballast Sherrybaby Million Dollar Baby Napoleon Dynamite and Slumdog Millionaire.All these films serve the same purpose as such reality TV shows as Wife Swap or How Clean Is Your House the horrified bourgeois gazing at the undisciplined classes the films fetishizing hick culture their cameras dwelling on rust junk derelict vehicles poor kids catatonic women grime poverty and destitution in a world populated by bearded gun toting mountain men. Every year Sundance serves up the same thing.The irony is all these Southern Gothic indie films have their roots in those affluencecentric films of the 90s The Ice Storm American Beauty and more recently Revolutionary Road and Little Children. Indie cinema used to be all about rich people moping about then killing somebody. Now it's the same trend only with supremely poor people instead examining what caused this shift will take an essay in itself.But unlike the films of the British and French new wave or the Italian neorealist movement no attempt is ever made to explore the worlds or social context of these poor characters. This is British kitchen sink drama of the 60s stripped of everything but the aesthetics of grime. Critics bought this when Green's grungy George Washington was released but time  and Green's subsequent output which demonstrated him to be completely without a worldview  has revealed the entire genre to be vapid. This is grime as an aesthetic choice and story as nothing but a skeleton upon which to hang the filth. Wow them with poverty porn and then cash in a career trajectory which Green and every successful modern indie director exemplifies Green's last film was Pineapple Express.In terms of plot Winter's Bone is a Southern Gothic thriller which revolves around 17 year old Ree Dolly's search for her methamphetaminecooking father Jessup. Jessup has disappeared failing to show up for a court case and so unless Ree finds him the family home will be repossessed.Ree thus becomes a private investigator of sorts bouncing from location to location all in the search of her father. She confronts family members and inbred cousins who live scattered amongst barns and cabins in the hills. We're treated to banjos gutted squirrels dilapidated homes leaking pipes and an assortment of hicks Ree given the cold shoulder by most. Don't you have any men folk to do this? one of them asks.

	onyx:emotionText "More poverty porn from Sundance and the indie film circuit a trend which started with David Green's George Washington though some cite Harmony Korine's Gummo reached its peak with Shotgun Stories and seems to be fizzling to a conclusion with Winter's Bone. Typically all these films belong to the Southern Gothic genre involve semi mythic story lines Grecian family tragedies take place in poverty stricken areas involve rednecks or poor characters and hinge around the promise of some third act moment of violence. In other words these films are all designed around their budgets how to make cheap dramatic films which take place in environments sufficiently alien to affluent white audiences and appealing to left leaning American critics. Alternative film has become as formulaic as the stuff it pretends not to be.Which is not to say that Winter's Bone is a bad film  I'll take it over any other Hollywood megaproduction currently in cinemas  but one can't escape how drearily formulaic indie cinema has become. That the only way for budding directors to guarantee critical success let alone distribution is to hop on board the indie conveyor belt. Now every major studio seems to be courting these films releasing redneck flicks like Hounddog Undertow In The Electric Mist and Black Snake Moan and similar fare like Precious Ballast Sherrybaby Million Dollar Baby Napoleon Dynamite and Slumdog Millionaire.All these films serve the same purpose as such reality TV shows as Wife Swap or How Clean Is Your House the horrified bourgeois gazing at the undisciplined classes the films fetishizing hick culture their cameras dwelling on rust junk derelict vehicles poor kids catatonic women grime poverty and destitution in a world populated by bearded gun toting mountain men. Every year Sundance serves up the same thing.The irony is all these Southern Gothic indie films have their roots in those affluencecentric films of the 90s The Ice Storm American Beauty and more recently Revolutionary Road and Little Children. Indie cinema used to be all about rich people moping about then killing somebody. Now it's the same trend only with supremely poor people instead examining what caused this shift will take an essay in itself.But unlike the films of the British and French new wave or the Italian neorealist movement no attempt is ever made to explore the worlds or social context of these poor characters. This is British kitchen sink drama of the 60s stripped of everything but the aesthetics of grime. Critics bought this when Green's grungy George Washington was released but time  and Green's subsequent output which demonstrated him to be completely without a worldview  has revealed the entire genre to be vapid. This is grime as an aesthetic choice and story as nothing but a skeleton upon which to hang the filth. Wow them with poverty porn and then cash in a career trajectory which Green and every successful modern indie director exemplifies Green's last film was Pineapple Express.In terms of plot Winter's Bone is a Southern Gothic thriller which revolves around 17 year old Ree Dolly's search for her methamphetaminecooking father Jessup.

	schema:reviewBody "Winter's Bone is about a young woman called Ree. Ree Dolly is seventeen and looks after her mother who's in some sort of a depressed stupor her twelve year old brother Sonny and her six year old sister Ashlee. We begin the movie watching Ree perform her duties and we or at least I start falling in love with her character right away. She really seemed like a good person just trying to do right by her family. Suddenly the law shows up and informs her that her criminal of a father Jessop Dolly signed their house and their land over for bail and if he doesn't show up for his hearing they'll be forced to take possession of the house essentially leaving them all homeless. So she embarks on a dangerous mission to find her father risking her life several times just to save her house and keep her family together.The story and plot is good it's captured well thanks to some great cinematography after a while you really become engulfed by the nature of the film. Both literally and figuratively speaking.The main characters are portrayed rather impressively by those cast. Jennifer Lawrence captured the essence of Ree Dolly impeccably. She delivered an Oscar worthy performance for sure in my opinion. She plays her character very naturally and the love that she demonstrates for her family seems very real and quite genuine. She manages to play a tough and stubborn character without it being immature. It was a mature role to take on at that age and I think she handled it well. John Hawkes who plays her uncle Teardrop also did an incredible job portraying his character. He was really quite cold and frightening. Much like Ree's character he was very stubborn and tough as well. But he also began to display his softer side throughout the film and I found myself rooting for him just as much as I did for Ree. I really enjoyed his evolution from a cold and distant man to a loyal and helpful relative who really seemed to develop a strong attachment to Ree and even to Sony and Ashlee near the end of the movie. The cast as a whole was great including all the supporting roles. I have no complaints about any of the cast or how they portrayed their characters.In summation Winter's Bone is a good movie to watch. It's a good story about love for one's family and determination. It's portrayed and captured well and all involved did a wonderful job. It's a good movie to watch and I recommend it.".

There's Something About Mary I love but let's face it  the humour is quite crass even if the movie does have some heart. So I expected another movie with jokes in bad taste and lots of humour at the expense of conjoined twins. At least this is how the film has marketed it.  However it couldn't be further from the truth. What has been marketed is quite different to what the film is about.Whilst the film does have humour  some movements hilariously funny  this film is at heart a light drama. And this is by certainly no means a bad thing. When I expected lowIQ humour what I got was just a really engrossing tale of two brothers who just happen to be conjoined. The chemistry between Damon and Kinnear is just perfect and the relationship between the brothers no doubt written from experience by the Farrelly Brothers was wonderful.Fox's marketing treatment of the film is appalling. In the trailer Matt Damon's character says We're not Siamese we're American and the trailer plays it like he is stupid. Whereas in fact when watching the film the context is very different  he's reacting with indignation and in defence of their conjoined nature. This is indicative of the entire film. Never is their conjoinednature used for humour in a bad way.Throw away what you've seen in the trailers or what you think the film is about. Go and see this movie that has its heart so very much in the right place  a great antidote to so many Hollywood films that have the soul of a stone. I don't normally get sentimental with films. I'm the type of viewer that laughs when Jack dies at the end of Titanic. But I went away from Stuck On You knowing I'd seen a very special film indeed. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " The Farrellys best since There's Something About Mary.";
	schema:reviewBody " out of Well it had to happen sooner or later. The Farrelly Brothers had to mature somewhat at some point and make a film that didn't rely on sex or grossout jokes. That is apparently the case with Stuck On You the Farrellys latest and tamest but it's also one of their sweetest and funniest films to date.Bob and Walt Tenor Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear are conjoined twins who've spent their whole lives in Martha's Vineyard. Bob is the owner of a burger restaurant and Walt is an actor who performs plays for the town's audience but he has bigger ambitions he wants to be a Hollywood actor much to the chagrin of Bob who suffers from a distinct case of stagefright. But after some discussion and compromise they agree to move to L.A. and start a new life for themselves.Upon arrival Bob and Walt meet the friendly but ditzy April Eva Mendes one of their neighbors in the apartment they've just moved into. Bob even meets his internet penpal May Wen Yann Shih but because he's never told her he has a conjoined twin he has to bring along Walt on their first date together. As for Walt's Hollywood dreams after some initial lack of success he's chosen by Cher herself to costar with her on her new show Honey and the Beaze in an attempt by Cher to sabotage her own series. But the show is an unexpected success thanks to Walt's burgeoning popularity which puts a crimp in his relationship with Bob.Reviewing comedies has always been a bit difficult for me which is why I usually stick to the stuff that I find easier to write about actionadventure horror drama anything but comedy but given all the knocks this film has taken particularly the fact that barely anybody saw it in theaters I felt a slight sense of obligation to mention that Stuck On You is the funniest and most touching comedy I've seen in recent memory.This is not to say that the film always had me choking with laughter though a scene involving a guy in front of his typewriter did get the biggest laugh out of me all year but rather that it consistently delivered smiles chuckles and solid laughs without ever bogging down no easy feat for a movie that runs for just under two hours.Aside from the lack of sexual humor there's a major difference between the style of comedy the Farrellys employ here than in some of their prior films. Whereas many their previous works have often made fun of the people that suffer from certain disorders Stuck On You presents us with two friendly easygoing guys who've grown accustomed to their situation and choose not to see their conjoined liver as a handicap. Rather the film derives its humor from the way outsiders view their condition.In the film's two lead roles Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear boast the kind of comic chemistry that most actors can only dream of. Damon in particular excels by taking the more straight man role where he's not actually aiming for any laughs but still gets them anyway maybe even more than the typically hilarious Kinnear. Watching these two guys stuck together reminds me why I find them two of the most likable actors in Hollywood even when most of Kinnear's characters are generally abrasive losers but not in this case. It is in fact Damon and Kinnear that make the film as wonderfully entertaining as it is. Had not even half of the jokes worked as well as they did their performances would still warrant this movie a passable recommendation.Stuck On You doesn't always juggle its various subplots perfectly while Wen Yann Shih does play well into the film a lot of brief cameos and a wide assortment of characters aren't meshed in as well. Worst of all is Cher who's neither funny nor particularly convincing as the bitch she's made out to be. I have no idea if this says more about her personality or her acting skills.Most of the Farrellys comedies generally tend to dissipate in the last halfhour or so replacing its humor with more sincere attempts at trying to make their irascible andor cadlike protagonists learn a lesson or two. The magic of Stuck On You is that its protagonists are always the same throughout making no genuine it's a miracle! revelations about themselves at the last minute after all brotherly love is still brotherly love.When the last twenty minutes threaten to devolve into sentimental claptrap the Farrellys punch in the necessary humor that defuses any of the building sap spoilerI think my favorite scene in the whole film is when Bob and Walt reunite after parting their separate ways in a scene that's both hilarious and touching making the film sweet without getting too sweet. The Farrellys have made a lot of funny movies but this is the first of theirs I can recommend to just about anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of my top films for 2003. In general I am not a fan of the Farelly brothers but I had enjoyed Shallow Hal and Stuck on You got good reviews from our local paper which is rare. One thing that had impressed me about Shallow Hal is that the things that you would think were completely illogical were addressed reasonably. The most obvious thought with the casting was that Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear are not even that close in age. Sure enough early in the film they explain that Matt's character has most of the liver so Greg's character is aging faster. I don't know if it is scientifically sound but it works in the context of the film. That is one thing that is nice about the movie. The film has plenty of sight gags and easy humor but there are also obscure references and delightful surprises that remind you that the film has a brain. It also has a heart and Damon and Kinnear have a nice brotherly rapport.Of the supporting cast Eva Mendes is easily the most fun and gets the best lines. There are also enjoyable turns with Meryl Streep Griffin Dunne and Cher starts out as her own worst caricature but ends up showing a heart as well. Many other familiar faces pop up including people you have seen as bit parts in the directors' other films.Finally I have to say I was really impressed with the connection between the two bodies. Very realistic looking makeup job.".

	schema:headline " Comedy beyond Something About Mary or Dumb  Dumber  it's very much a human story with abundance of heart";
	schema:reviewBody "The Farrelly Brothers' Stuck On You is sincere drama with lots of heart  of course along with their smart quips and earnest observations not diminishing. I even gone tearyeyed towards the end. Bobby and Peter Farrelly brothers wrote directed and produced this movie and they are never sloppy. There is much attention to detail and exudes empathy and earnestness. I'd say their 2001 production of Shallow Hal with Jack Black and Gwenyth Paltrow contained moments of poignancy also.Watching Matt Damon as Bob and Greg Kinnear as Walt singlehandedly flipping burgers and buns in syncopated rhythm  'tis an acrobatic act in itself! The art of 'Quickie Burgers in less than 30 seconds' is such a theme! The pairing is godsend. Both Damon and Kinnear are talented actors who had many fascinating roles. Kinnear's portrayal of Bob Crane Hogan's Heroes in Paul Schrader's Auto Focus 2002 has pretty much established him  since his debut role in Sydney Pollack's remake of Sabrina 1995 and coming through acting opposite Jack Nicholson in Albert Brooks' As Good As It Gets 1997  as one who can handle roles in depth. Damon besides his writing quality has shown his versatile capability in Ed Zwick's Courage Under Fire 1996 psychologicalmilitary John Dahl's Rounders 1998 intensesuspense Kevin Smith's Dogma 1999 funsatire Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley 1999 multiple personalitymystery Billy Bob Thornton's All the Pretty Horses 2000 romancewestern Doug Liman's The Bourne Identity 2002 actionthriller Steven Soderbergh's remake of Ocean Eleven ensemble castheist and Gus Van Sant's Gerry 2002 mysticalhypnotic which Damon scripted and acted with Casey Affleck  yes he can handle any role indeed.   The story introduces matter of factly the things these two stuck together brothers do in their everyday life  it's down to earth and comes across downright normal. The plot evolves when Walt wants to pursue his acting career just like any Hollywood dreams and Bob wants his brother to succeed. The Farrelly brothers can sure weave a heartwarming story and here they follow through the emotional curve and happenings cause and consequences between these two brothers and their friends and neighbors along the way. It's a thoughtful and creative script and the brothers almost a pun here manage to include a musical too. Cher is in a supporting role playing her fun self. The two corresponding girl friend roles are played delightfully by Eva Mendes as April and tenderly by Wen Yann Shih as May. Veteran actor Seymour Cassel has a riotous time with his wig. There's a heartfelt cameo by Meryl Streep  it's beyond being brief. The use of songs and lyrics was complementary to the various moods at hand. Gilbert O'Sullivan's 1970 hit Alone Again Naturally included.   From the production notes we learned that the conjointness was made possible by a makeup team led by Tony Gardner special makeup designer who collaborated with the Farrelly's before  he enabled Gwenyth Paltrow's 300lbs physique in Shallow Hal. Damon and Kinnear were 'stuck together' 14 hours a day for 3 months. It is amazing how Farrelly brothers and their capable filmmaking friends and collaborators realized this genuinely caring human dramacomedy. It's guaranteed enjoyable movie experience for everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all for the people who are upset at the conjoined twins disabilities being the subject of a movie...if you want to get upset about a movie that makes fun of other people who are abused sad down on their luck and depressed... Then DON'T see Bad Santa! It is a million times more offensive to characters who really need help instead of being made fun of. Second I saw Stuck On You and it is very funny in places. My friend and I laughed out loud a lot he laughed more than I did. It never makes fun of the conjoined twins really just the people they have to deal with to get ahead in life. And their hometown accepts them and then loves them as they grow up dealing with their conjoinededness. It is an affirming movie and is positive about these handicapped characters and we root for them to get ahead and reach their goals. And it does have a happy ending featuring Meryl Streep and Cher. And Greg Kinnear singing!! I thought the ending was great!! Spoiler For the people who commented about how nowadays they can have surgery to fix their disability... The movie explains they can't have surgery because they share a liver and if they go through with the surgery Walt would likely die. And Bob Matt Damon loves his brother too much to take that chance. He also is very afraid to live without his brother. Near the end they do have the surgery and I won't tell you what happened but it is VERY BITTERSWEET it is happy yet sad and made some audience members tearyeyed. It is an emotional scene and thoughtprovoking. If I was in their situation would I have gone through with the surgery?? Funny moments Cher!!! Cher's BOYFRIEND!!! Cher's BIG BEHIND!!! The fight scene in the bar between the brothers and the evil bullies!! The shower scene with the telephone. The cooking a dozen burgers in a couple of minutes scene. ALL of the sports scenes! The slimy creepy manager WAS REALLY FUNNY AND IRRITATING at the same time but he wasn't evil like Alec Baldwin is in Cat N Hat. I really admire Cher for being in this movie it recalls her Mask movie role somewhat. And I loved Meryl Streep in this movie too!!! I think both Cher and Meryl Streep should get supporting actress nominations for their great roles! I thought Matt Damon AND Greg Kinnear both did great jobs. Matt Damon was very sympathetic as the shy half of the disabled duo. And Greg Kinnear was very dynamic he dominated everyone else when he was in the scene. And he sings really good too. The soundtrack was also really great 70's songs that I enjoyed hearing very much! Movie Philosophy This movie is similar to Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber in that disabled people leave their safe homes go on the road to a new place. They meet all kinds of new people they have to deal with and make new friends along the way. Friends who like and love them for their inner selves and NOT what they look like on the outside. I really liked that message alot. It is the total opposite of Bad Santa where a young fat retarded lonely boy with no parents and NO FRIENDS is made fun of and physically and mentally abused because of his outside appearance and disabilities he has no control over. The previews DON'T do this movie justice. They picked moments of the film that weren't the best parts. They should have shown Cher and Meryl Streep in the ads because they are so great! THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE PREVIEWS WOULD INDICATE. JUST LIKE ELF WAS!! This movie has the same happy sentimental feelgood feel and ending that Elf and Bruce Almighty and Finding Nemo had. 3 of the BEST movies of the year. It was an EXCELLENT movie and I highly recommend it to everyone! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm actually a big Farrelly Brothers fan and not just because they're from Rhode Island. So it's with great reluctance that I write a less than stellar review of Stuck On You.It's not a horrible film but like many recent Farrelly releases it's muddled and illustrates a tug of war between the movies the Farrellys want to make the and movies the Farrelly's fans want them to make.Stuck On You tells the tale of Bob and Walt Tenor conjoined twins who live a good peaceful life on Nantucket Island. That is until Walt played by Greg Kinnear catches the acting bug and wants to move to LA. The story and gags from there mostly revolve around a fishoutofwater story but two fish joined at the side and the brothers' ongoing ignorance of their own condition.At one point Bob played by Matt Damon tells Walt that he'll never make it in acting. Why? Because he needs a better tan. Though these aren't the idiot gags that we all enjoyed in Dumb  Dumber. In fact both of the brothers are very bright. Their ignorance is more a function of their being so close physically and emotionally for such a long period of time and because back home everyone accepted them completely. They've become blind to their own handicap.It's a nice message and it is delivered poignantly at times. More often though we're hammered with it over and over again while the Farrellys do their best to make the movie look more like one of their more celebrated more tasteless and funnier movies like Dumb  Dumber Something About Mary or Me Myself and Irene.In all of the latter movies there was no illusion that we were there primarily there for the gutter chuckles but each movie also had characters we really liked. Let's face it. We were all rooting for Lloyd and Harry in Dumb and Dumber even if they were morons.In Stuck On You the main characters are all a lot flatter than what we've seen before. Plus one of the most disappointing aspects in Stuck On You is the poor use of the minor characters. In previous movies we got some of our biggest laughs from the sideline characters while in Stuck On You they're used mostly as window dressing. Eva Mendes is primarily a cleavage delivery device in Stuck On You which is a shame because she's not a bad actress and she could have some comedic chops.How are Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon in this film? They both do as good as can be expected. We're not used to seeing Damon in comedic films his last was Dogma and I think he does comedy very well. I'm reluctant to comment directly on their performances because it's not fair. The characters are flat and that's not their fault.Sadly this isn't a fluke for the Farrellys. It's part of an ongoing trend. Their animated movie Osmosis Joe more closely resembled a featurelength public health announcement starring Chris Rock and Bill Murray. Shallow Hal dealt with superficiality in much heavier dramatic tones than we were led to believe in the movie's trailers.In Stuck On You the Farrellys try to swerve back to their poopandfartjoke roots but deep down you can tell they want to make more serious thematic movies.I would have no problem if the Farrellys decided to do a more serious dramatic film. I would also have no problem if the Farrellys decided to do more lockerroom humor comedies. But I do have a problem with them trying to do both at the same time. It's just not working. NOTE  While I'm not shopping for the DVD I did enjoy Shallow Hal once I realized and accepted that the movie was a lot heavier than the trailers depicted. That said there were a lot of people in the cinema who were expecting something like Dumb  Dumber and they were plenty unhappy about it. I don't blame them.".

I especially like that they have hockey players and other athletes in their movies  Cam Neely in Dumb and Dumber Ron Darling in Shallow Hal and Brett Favre in There's Something About Mary. I don't know why I like that I just do. Also I like the old songs they use  the Cowsills in Dumb Edison Lighthouse in Hal etc.Anywho medically speaking the premise is impossible therefore stupid but if you want realism watch a documentary on the plight of the African fruit fly. Belly laughs are in large supply here. There are some awkward moments or two and I'd have cut some scenes and the movie wouldn't have suffered a bit from a snip here and there.Coming off best is Cher who I am not a fan of but given the sense of humor she has to have I could become one. She practically allows herself to be referred to as a Hollywood hasbeen a joke and a witch. It takes a confident actress to leave herself so exposed and she goes for it and then some. By playing this part she's throwing it back in your face and telling you she's not a joke.I enjoyed all the supporting actors too  Meryl Streep ! Griffin Dunne Luke Wilson Frankie Muniz Jeffrey Ross Seymour Cassel and of course Eva Mendez.I wouldn't want the movie implanted in my brain but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it even though my Mother complained for the first half hour but by the end thanked me for suggesting we watch it. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "You have to give the Farrelly Brothers credit they were able to mine every ounce of 'cojoined twin' material they could get their four hands on. After watching this film it would seem that there is in fact a lot of different ways to tell one joke. The joke comes fast furious and unrelenting throughout the duration of the movie. Amongst many other vignettes of the variations on a theme we see how Bob Matt Damon and Walt Greg Kinnear deal with home life school and dating while being cojoined twins. Mainly we see the advantages through the framework of sports activities where the Bob and Walt dominate their high school football and baseball games. Home life provides some humorous disadvantages when Walt takes his showers Bob is relegated to wearing the gear of the Gorton's Fisherman. As if that wasn't degrading enough for Bob Walt's prolific dating habits provide many sleepless nights for Bob as he has only a thin curtain to shield him away from Walt and his many sexual conquests.Damon and Kinnear plow through these scenes hand in hand and tongue in cheek. It is from their performances that the comedy most often floats higher than the material. Once the movie begins to falter from the onejoke premise it quickly becomes a war of attrition with the viewer. Even though there were times when I could feel my eyes rolling up into my head I would also find myself giggling and rewinding scenes. Damon and Kinnear really put a good face on a lightweight comedy.I also came away from the film liking Eva Mendes. Her role as April the aspiring Los Angeles 'wanna be actress' was a very small role but Mendes makes the most out of it by displaying an innocent comedic flair while being very very easy on the eyes.'Stuck On You' also features two Academy Award winning actresses playing themselves Meryl Streep in an unaccredited role is asked by Walt to remember her visit to Martha's Vineyard from some many years before. Although she remembers her visit it takes a little while for Streep to put the faces of Bob and Walt into her memory. She eventually remembers them as high school football stars from a game she saw while looking for something to do while visiting their hometown. When she remembers this game she becomes very animated and then strikes up an unlikely friendship with Bob and Walt. Streep also shows up at the end of the film to help out in a play that Bob and Walt have put on. Cher on the other hand has a much more meatier role in the movie. She spends most of her camera time making fun of her own celebrity. I find the casting of Cher to be a very inspired choice. There's a similarity between the physical separation after an operation that Bob and Walt try to live through to the mental separation that haunted Sonny and Cher after their painful and public divorce. Cher knows from experience the anguish of being trapped as one half of a whole. I'm sure there wasn't any thought of this whatsoever in her casting I just find it amusing.Seymour Cassel was brilliant as Morty O'Reilly Walt's older than dirt agent. Morty's best line happens near the end of the film when he learns that Eric Estrada has left CHIPS.If you get to see 'Stuck On You' as a DVD rental you must look at the extras. Greg Kinnear's 'Ted Koppel' is by far the best imitation of Koppel going these days. It surpasses the Koppel imitation from SNL's Darryl Hammonds the previous gold standard by a far mark.This movie will surprise you from time to time with its aspirations of wanting to be something more than a juvenile yuk fest but at the same time it will irritate you constantly by falling back down into the repetition of lame jokes. It dances a fine line but overall it comes across as a lightweight comedy with some fine performances that produce many a short giggle. However a bit more quality over quantity would have had me doubled over.810. Clark Richards".

The best reason however is to enjoy the lighthearted interaction of two brothers who learn that nature's cruel marriage of their bodies gave them the best emotional marriage of their lives.

	schema:reviewBody "The Brothers Farrelly without inspiration are just as mediocre as anything else from the Hollywood boredom factory. This picture compares with Shallow Hall in that if one laughs a couple of times it's a lot. The kind of comedy they work on needs a lot of crudity and outrageousness. Well the viewers that dare to pay to see this inane attempt at comedy won't find it here.The best thing going for this movie is Meryl Streep in her brief appearance. Matt Damon and Gregg Kinnear are just wasted. The idea of this odd couple might have sounded very funny when these two were pitching the film but on the screen it falls flat.

	onyx:emotionText "The Brothers Farrelly without inspiration are just as mediocre as anything else from the Hollywood boredom factory. This picture compares with Shallow Hall in that if one laughs a couple of times it's a lot. The kind of comedy they work on needs a lot of crudity and outrageousness. Well the viewers that dare to pay to see this inane attempt at comedy won't find it here.The best thing going for this movie is Meryl Streep in her brief appearance. Matt Damon and Gregg Kinnear are just wasted. The idea of this odd couple might have sounded very funny when these two were pitching the film but on the screen it falls flat.

	schema:reviewBody "Bob and Walt are conjoined twins who have learnt to live together as one and not let the birth defect hold them back.  When Walt decides he wants to pursue his acting career on a bigger stage Bob agrees to move to LA with him.  Laughed out of most of Walt's auditions Bob is close to quitting before Cher picks him for her new TV show hoping her choice of costar will kill the show.  However the show is a surprise hit while Bob's wooing of his internet girl friend seems to be going well despite her not knowing about him being joined to his brother.If you have seen the trailer for this film then you have seen all the funny bits of this film as well as some of the bits that flop.  The plot is stupid in the extreme and worse still can't decide if it wants to be an out and out comedy or a film with a more serious heart.  It tries to be both and it fails miserably.  As a comedy the film simply isn't very funny and the jokes that I did laugh at are basically repeated over and over again with slight variations.  The film holds back from the cruel mocking humour of the Farrelly brothers' better films and gives the characters and the story some dignity at the expense of laughs but not enough dignity to save the story.The subject is interesting and would have been much much better if it had been delivered straight as a drama of sorts  or even a documentary feature one on the DVD would be a good touch.  As a story it doesn't really engage and doesn't have the necessary pathos to really be a good tale.  The comic edge is too clumsy and takes a lot of the potential off the story making characters into jokes rather than people we can feel for or try to understand.  The film's message of understanding and acceptance is left to collapse under it's own lack of development and the film seems to try to just get lots of cameos from stars in there to cover the massive gaps.As the lead pair Damon and Kinnear are pretty poor.  It isn't their faults in fairness they just don't know what they are meant to be doing.  Are they getting laughs from their characters or are they meant to be getting some sort of emotional connection from the audience and drama from the situation? They don't know. I didn't know. And their performances show this.  Mendes looks fantastic  she has great breasts and a great body and is gorgeous  and these assets are the only thing that the film gives her to do.  She has no character no dialogue and almost no reason for being there she is eye candy and it's a condemnation of the rest of the film that she's the best thing in it.  Shih has an OK character and she manages to be both cute as well as painfully vulnerable.  Her thread of narrative is OK and is key to the acceptance' side of the film  shame it doesn't really work well enough.  Aside from the usual line up of weirdoes and disabled characters I have no problem with that  but the Farrelly brothers seem to make a big deal out of it.  Cher is quite good sending herself up but she can't act natural  it's funny having her play it as a bitch but she can't convince. Aside from her there are many other cameos Leno Luke Wilson Meryl Streep Frankie Muniz  none of them really work though.  Streep's big conclusion to the film would have been a nice finish if the film had been funny  it hadn't so instead the musical climax is just dumb and slightly embarrassing.Overall this is not a comedy to me  I barely laughed more than once.  I'm not a shallow person generally but the only good things I found in this film were attached to Eva Mendes'.  The drama side of it has no emotional core and no reason to be taken even halfway seriously.  The end result is a film that wants to make a serious point of sorts but also be taken as a hilarious comedy.  The Farrellys' got it right once or twice since then it's all been pretty average stuff at best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stuck On You is the newest comedy from the Farrelly Brothers whose irreverent humor has brought us some of the most daring and uproarious films of the decade. Yet although the Farrellys are known for their crazy rude slapstick humor by both their fans and enemies Stuck On You is more of a subtle comedy than anything  which is extremely surprising given the directors' history. I think a lot of people will leave this movie holding a different perspective towards the Farrellys. But that's not to say the film doesn't have its flaws as they come in great numbers. The story is just offbeat and entertaining enough to garner it a recommendation if only a slight one.It's a tale of two conjoined twins and their journey to California to make it big in showbusiness. The aspiring actor Walt Greg Kinnear is the brother who wants a career in tinsel town. His twin Bob Matt Damon is joined with Walt at the waistline nine inches across which makes it difficult for them to do anything at all on their own. How hard is it when you both have to go to the bathroom at the same time? someone asks them. It's usually harder when only one of us has to go Walt replies.After leaving their hometown of Massachusetts where they flip burgers at a local restaurant in 180 seconds flat the duo head for the slums of Hollywood soon finding a nice apartment to stay at whilst they find an agent. Love blossoms when Bob finally meets up with a threeyear Internet contact a pretty Asian woman who is very happy to meet Bob and vice versa. The problem is that he has not told her about his condition which presents both he and Walt with a huge problem.Stuck On You is a film unlike any other I have ever seen. The morning after as I type a review I wonder to myself Did I really just see that? It's so strange and unusual and unique that it almost seems like a dream. The same thing happened with Shallow Hal an unfortunately lesser movie which was nevertheless very different from any other comedy I had ever seen. Whereas the Farrellys somewhat poked fun at stereotypes and packed their movies with slapstick humor their latest two efforts have been more bizarre packed with strange ideas and very unusual heroes. If anything you have to give the brothers some credit for achieving pure originality. This is one of the most bizarre comedies I've ever seen. Too bad it's not very funny.I think that's the point. What Stuck On You lacks in laughs it makes up for in heart  this is a surprisingly kind and sweetnatured film which tells us all that you aren't what life makes out of you. It's the complete opposite. Its heroes know this and this is the sort of film that makes you reexamine your own position in life and realize just how appreciative you should be of everything. It's no masterpiece but I think it was intentional that for the first time in the history of their directing careers the brothers Farrelly decided to end their comedy without a final punchline. It's a Farrelly Brothers movie all right but it's a clear sign that they might actually have a bit of brains and respect for life that wasn't necessary in their other movies but actually feels quite welcome here.".

It seems here like the Farrellys who are known for their bad taste wanted to make fun of conjoined twins but felt like it may upset some people so instead they cast them in a loving light but don't know what to do with it. Nice comedy does not work for the Farrellys.Bob Matt Damon and Walt Greg Kinnear have been stuck together for all of their lives. They have simple lives owning and being shortorder cooks at the Quickee Burger. Walt is an aspiring actor and dreams of being an actor in Hollywood. Bob agrees to go with him obviously to Hollywood because Bob's internet friend May Wen Yann Shih lives there also. Almost immediately Cher gives Walt a job but their relationship is soon tested as they continue to live in L.A.As I said earlier the Farrellys don't know what to do with all of their material that isn't offensive and since the essence of them is in their ability to offend people they don't have anything up their sleeves to show us. They could have gone deeper into the relationship between Bob and Walt but they barely go into that and when they do it isn't funny except for the We're Off to See the Wizard' thing. Humor is subjective but I think most agree with me in that most of the movie wasn't funny.Being the movie geek that I am I eat up anything related to Hollywood so I was excited for when Bob and Walt were going there hoping to hear some good Hollywood jokes. Unfortunately about the most of it is Cher yelling at someone. If that makes you laugh then more power to you but I think most people require more. I will admit though that Cher's new boyfriend did make me laugh. For the most part once the scene changes the laughs don't.The effect to make Damon and Kinnear look conjoined looked so fake it looked real. It just looked like some skin attached between the two and oftentimes it looked like it moved around some. Also how did they get separate clothes on? It's a small detail but it bothered me. Back to the Farrellys for a minute more jokes could have been made not at the expense of conjoined twins but just with them something like in Airplane 2 The Sequel.I don't understand why everyone makes fun of Damon's acting he's a solid actor and he wasn't half bad here but Kinnear was his better half. The two played off each well and amazingly enough Mendes wasn't too bad either but it seemed like everything Shih tried to do was fake. Overall if you do see Stuck on You don't.BRBRMy rating 410Rated PG13 for crude and sexual humor and some language.".

But they have been getting softer and not in a good way. Take Stuck On You.It's the story of Bob Matt Damon and Walt Tenor Greg Kinnear conjoined twins remaking their lives when extroverted Walt pursues his acting dreams in Hollywood and introverted Bobby must go along for the ride. Walt finds sudden success while Bobby meets his dream girl but will their new lives break up this inseparable pair?Acceptance is the overriding message of this film and it's a nice message for a film that offers little else. At least I know better than to use the term Siamese twins now. Damon and Kinnear display nice chemistry and I chuckled a couple of times.But the Farrellys seem more interested in displaying their humanity than making a funny film. Bob and Walt emote a lot about their hopes and dreams while everyone who ever sold the Farrellys a pizza is wedged into the background as an extra. You can feel them strain to hit the feelgood buttons and the punchlines.Alas someone forgot the hair gel this time. The toothless gags play off the brothers' conjoined situation but avoid any meanness. Instead it unrealistically tries to play off their situation as no big deal to anyone with half a heart. Like when Walt tells Bob of this hot woman he had drinks with the other night only I couldn't get her alone. She had that friend Ruthie with her like a freakin' shadow. They flip burgers and tend goal in a hockey game I had 11 saves and Bob had 26.The supporting cast is lackluster not helped by a script that presents them as backboards for the brothers' banter or the fact that for so many of them the casting call was the last Farrelly family barbecue. Seymour Cassell as an old agent wears a silly wig while Cher sends herself up as Walt's unhappy costar on a TV detective show.I liked isolated scenes more in the beginning than in the mawkish and excessive second half when the twins cope with sudden success. There's a good scene early on when Walt is scoring with a girl while Bob on the other side of a shower curtain types an email to his pen pal unfazed by the fact his brother's activity keeps him bouncing up and down. Between positions Walt tries to sneak a peak at his brother's email. It's personal Bob says pulling it away.That's a nice moment about boundaries and enough of it shows up now and then for the film to not be a complete drag. You do care about the pair. Damon is good as shy Bob while Kinnear impresses me as he did with Auto Focus by getting the most out of lame dialogue with a raised eyebrow.Then he has to go and do one of his deadon Ted Koppell impersonations reminding you you are really watching a pair of actors strapped to a fleshtone prosthetic. Stuck On You is not a bad idea for a comedy it's just weakly delivered by a pair of brothers who themselves may have been stuck together too long.".

Seymour Cassell as an old agent wears a silly wig while Cher sends herself up as Walt's unhappy costar on a TV detective show.I liked isolated scenes more in the beginning than in the mawkish and excessive second half when the twins cope with sudden success. There's a good scene early on when Walt is scoring with a girl while Bob on the other side of a shower curtain types an email to his pen pal unfazed by the fact his brother's activity keeps him bouncing up and down. Between positions Walt tries to sneak a peak at his brother's email. It's personal Bob says pulling it away.That's a nice moment about boundaries and enough of it shows up now and then for the film to not be a complete drag. You do care about the pair. Damon is good as shy Bob while Kinnear impresses me as he did with Auto Focus by getting the most out of lame dialogue with a raised eyebrow.Then he has to go and do one of his deadon Ted Koppell impersonations reminding you you are really watching a pair of actors strapped to a fleshtone prosthetic. Stuck On You is not a bad idea for a comedy it's just weakly delivered by a pair of brothers who themselves may have been stuck together too long.";

It's one of those movies where you realize in the very first scene that it's going to be a lot better than you thought it would be. The Farrelly brothers' mixture of endearingly oddball characters funny dialogue and an easygoing folkrock soundtrack work as well here as they did in ...Mary and the very underrated Kingpin.The actors playing the twins are an excellent match and Kinnear is good but Damon is even better. I am continually amazed at his ability to play any kind of character whether it's an action hero like in The Bourne Identity or a complete dweeb like in Stuck On You and anything in between and do it convincingly.Cher is also quite a good sport to play herself as such a mean prima donna for most of the movie.I also really like the way the Farrelly brothers like to include handicapped people in small roles of their films without any hint of being pretentious or pious about it. Most notable in this film is Ray Rocket Valliere a mentally handicapped man who gives one of the most likeable performances in the movie.Stuck On You isn't perfect the middle section is a bit dry but for the most part it's a very entertaining very funny and yes even touching film that is never less that fun to watch. In addition to all that there are a bunch of cool uncredited cameos and a GREAT final scene that provides pretty much the exact emotional punch you need it to.And be sure to sit through the credits.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was marketed as a comedy but anyone who went into it expecting Half Baked was probably dissapointed.  Instead of a mindless stonercomedy we get a good solid film that is equal parts dramacomedythriller.  It's the story of a group of pot farmers who after seeing their boss murdered decide to cash in the crop for a cool 3 million. Needless to say things turn out to be a bit more complicated than expected and getting the money takes a back seat to getting themselves out of this bind that they have done such a good job of getting themselves into.The three central characters Jack Billy Bob Thornton Carter Hank Azaria and Harlan Ryan Phillipe are working for Malcomn John Lithgow manning the pot farm when Malcom is killed by his own helicopter pilot. Thinking they know way more than they actually do  they decide to take charge of the situation and finish out the job.  Jack poses as Malcomn none of Malcomn's customers have ever actually seen what he looks like and becomes the natural leader while Carter and Harlan bumble around doing the grunt work.Things go a little over Jack's head when mob boss Gionni the wop played hilariously by Ted Danson enters the picture.  Pretty soon it's paranoia time for the three stooges and their mutual girlfriend Lucy Kelly Lynch fighting off rippers avoiding hitmen and trying to find a buyer all without getting caught by the feds all the local cops are paid off.There are many plot twists in Homegrown and the acting is great from a huge ensemble cast.  Hybrids like this rarely work completely and Homegrown does sputter occassionally.  There are a few scenes that leave you wondering if they are supposed to be funny.  One thing that is highly overlooked and misunerstood about this film is how it makes you feel just like the characters.  It totally succeeds in putting you in the same boat with them and making you feel the same things that they are feeling.All in all  I give this movie a 910 and I highly reccomend it.  It DOES NOT glorify the use and distribution of marijuana many would like to argue that point but merely uses it as a backdrop for what is going on.  Give it a run.  I especially reccommend this one to Billy Bob Thornton fans.  He is so perfect in his role that you can almost smell the weed on him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Homegrown is a very nice and inspirational film about three farmboy dope growers and their community of likeminded folk. After their boss Malcolm John Lithgow is assassinated the hapless and frequently high trio have to try and improvise to get paid.Homegrown is also a strongly feminist movie in the best sense of the word in that all the women are in fact the real actors behind the events as they unfold. What do our three hapless heroes do when they get in trouble and need a place to crash? Lucy Kelly Lynch is the first port of call and she isn't afraid to use sex to get any info she needs. Who is really taking care of business when the community is threatened to be invaded by mafiosi? All in all this is a very inspirational movie. It makes you feel you want to go out and grow some of your own herb. I can see how a lot of people got nervous about a movie where the main characters are pot growers. However if you take into account that pot is just another plant it's hard to see what the trouble is about. The producers tried to sell this as a comedy and there are plenty of laughs but don't wait for canned laughter or any other cues. There are several marijuana inspired songs Bob Marley's Smoke Two Joints and Musical Youth's Pass The Dutchie just to name two.It is more of a capersuspensecomedy movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Homegrown is a very nice and inspirational film about three farmboy dope growers and their community of likeminded folk. After their boss Malcolm John Lithgow is assassinated the hapless and frequently high trio have to try and improvise to get paid.Homegrown is also a strongly feminist movie in the best sense of the word in that all the women are in fact the real actors behind the events as they unfold. What do our three hapless heroes do when they get in trouble and need a place to crash? Lucy Kelly Lynch is the first port of call and she isn't afraid to use sex to get any info she needs. Who is really taking care of business when the community is threatened to be invaded by mafiosi? All in all this is a very inspirational movie. It makes you feel you want to go out and grow some of your own herb. I can see how a lot of people got nervous about a movie where the main characters are pot growers. However if you take into account that pot is just another plant it's hard to see what the trouble is about. The producers tried to sell this as a comedy and there are plenty of laughs but don't wait for canned laughter or any other cues. There are several marijuana inspired songs Bob Marley's Smoke Two Joints and Musical Youth's Pass The Dutchie just to name two.It is more of a capersuspensecomedy movie.";

A film is made because someone decided to try to share this particular story with youNOT because he wanted to add another movie to some given drawershelf in a video rental store nor because he wanted to make things easy for the marketing department.I know the film wasn't wellpromoted but looking at the movie itself I think it's actually a pretty innovative piece of work.What really makes the film work is the ambiguity and ok I admit it PARANOIA of it.If you've found yourself wondering what any particular scene adds to this movie I fear you've fallen victim to lack of imagination. The characters never know who knows what and that is the single most essential premise of the movie. The film uses a far stronger perspective of firstperson perspective than such bubblegum fare as the Matrix. When the hapless dopegrowers meet the first distributor they're looking to do business with they don't know whether he's in on everything. When BB Thornton talks to Sienna he has no idea what SHE knows about the situation...and in fact no matter how you choose to interpret that particular scene you really ought to acknowledge that perhaps the reality cinematically speaking is the complete opposite of what you first thought when you watched it. Almost every meaningful dramatic scene in the film is completely ambiguous in possible interpretation. At least up until the climax.This is a film that truly does get better with repeated viewings IF you have the patience for a movie that doesn't spell everything out for you. If you want a heavy musical score and a didactic moral point stick with Spielberg. He'll never disappoint. If you want to WONDER what the characters are really up to in a film check this one out.The cast is terrific the story is novel if not earthshaking and the polish and presentation are firstrate. It has a few minor editorial flawsI could've done without Lithgow's late appearance or some of the feelgood moments laced into the script early on but I certainly don't think someone else would have done a better job with the concept and script...unless Kubrick or Fassbinder were still alive.8.5 out of 10.".

They witness the murder of the farm's owner Malcolm John Lithgow and they take over the weed for their own.

It takes the drug situation in the United States and instead of giving it a comedic face like in Half Baked it has a true life lesson image like Traffic.

In a way the movie seems a little bit more relevant nowadays as political action committees challenge the government's war on drugs. The best part is really the end scene Saving Grace has a similar ending. Overall it's an OK way to pass time.

The cast is pretty funny but the whole movie seems a little bit like they got together for the weekend to party and just filmed what happened. In a way the movie seems a little bit more relevant nowadays as political action committees challenge the government's war on drugs. The best part is really the end scene Saving Grace has a similar ending. Overall it's an OK way to pass time. Starring Billy Bob Thornton Ryan Phillippe Hank Azaria Kelly Lynch John Lithgow Judge Reinhold Jamie Lee Curtis and Maggie Gyllenhaal.";

Billy Bob Thornton Astronaut Farmer is brilliant in fact looking back the character is fairly similar in the fact he holds the family of pot growers together. Everyone involved in this film should get a big thumbs up.As i say' the final scene is a dream however a nightmare at the same time. I love it when Hank Azaria carter says at the end do you think we should do this every year? I felt my self wishing they would. I'm not going to say this film is good for everyone but as a lover of stoner movies i give it 1010.  My advice have a joint ready kick back and enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "This neglected film noir gem by the great Otto Preminger is better and more poetic than Preminger's previous classic Laura. For one thing Preminger's fluid camera work and long takes here reach perfection pointing them toward his mature long takes and objectivity in 1950s with such dazzling masterworks  as Where the Sidewalk Ends Angel Face Anatomy of a Murder.  Each scene is shot and elaborated with precision with minimum amount of edits to elucidate the emotions of the characters.Also Dana Andrews with all his unique ambiguity and minimalism turns in one of his finest performances ever just a hint of his outstanding performance and probably his best in Where the Sidewalk Ends. Andrews' costars Alice Faye and a sluttish Linda Darnell are great as well. The magnificent chiaroscuro photography by Joseph LaShelle has certain crispness and lucidity that is similar to  Anthony Mann's TMen.Some may find the second half of the film quaintly melodramatic and David Raksin's romantic score is admittedly less memorable than Laura but Fallen Angel deserves to be seen and viewed within its credentials.The effect is haunting and breathtaking.".

There's another lovely understated effort here from Bruce Cabot and still another from Percy Kilbride but in the supporting cast Anne Revere stands out for moving the plot along for creating tangible suspense and for two solid moments of palpable napeprickling foreboding.'Fallen Angel' is just one of the most underrated noirs.

	schema:reviewBody "I agree with virtually all that has been written about this film. It is true that Alice Faye's part seems to be less than fully fleshed out. According to Alice who was a dear friend of our family for many years the reason she left pictures in a huff following her initial screening of the film was because most of her finest scenes were left on the cutting room floor. Zanick perceived an opportunity to beef up Linda Darnell's part by downplaying Alice's character. Zanick was having a romance with Darnell and wanted to give her part more prominence than the writer or Preminger intended. His ploy worked but Alice was indeed so furious at what she perceived as sabotage to her part she left the studio that very day and never returned. Since this left her in violation of her contract Zanick saw to it that Alice was not hired by any other studio. As a consequence she and husband Phil Harris turned to radio in the Phil Harris Alice Faye Show for eight years and it was a major success.When Alice did agree after fifteen years away from the screen to appear as Pat Boone's mother in the remake of State Fair. Again she was disappointed as the director Henry King whom she had been promised would do the film was reassigned and the film given to Jose Ferrer who had never been to a state fair or directed a film. Thereafter Alice appeared only in a few bit parts and left screen roles completely.But I think Alice underappreciated the work she did in Fallen Angel. The critics were not that hard on her but she really wanted to make a major success in a dramatic role and unfortunately that didn't happen. The film however is very much worth seeing and has never been available on video previously. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is so much to say about the way Otto Preminger directs a movie. His previous success Laura 1944 was a blockbuster but lacked the murky influence of film noir that was so popular during this time. Sure there was some film noir technique employed in Laura but not enough. However Laura still holds it's own even by today's standards and the media along with the marketing people have done us all a favor this time!!! in keeping this classic alive and popular.Needless to say Fallen Angel redeems Preminger's ability to present a film in the classic noir of it's time and because of this is competitive with Billy Wilder's Lost Weekend 1945 and Double Indemnity 1944 both huge successes with audiences. But what about Fallen Angel?Despite the cinematography and the super cast Fallen Angel went to the chopping block via the critics. The critics rated this film as mediocre and audiences stayed away. Alice Faye in her only dramatic role left the movies in disgust partly because of what the critics did to this film. Why? From beginning to end the viewer is treated to some of the best cinematography that this art form had to offer. The way sluttish Linda Darnell is depicted before the camera is a treat for the eye and enhances her sexuality. The way Percy Kilbride is smitten with Darnell throughout the movie up to the climax is an essential link to the continuity of the movie as well as with the novel by Marty Holland. The way Charles Bickford sits behind the lunch counter slowly sipping his coffee sending a message to the viewer that something deep inside him is simmering ready to explode. We all know that Bickford along with Kilbride Dana Andrews and Bruce Cabot all are victims to the whims of the dark Darnell.And the way the blonde good and virtuous Faye is contrasted with the dark bad and selfish Darnell is more proof that this film should be marketed for the masses. The plot is strong the camera work of Joseph LaShelle and especially the film direction by Preminger rates this movie as one of the best of it's time. Yes this film rates up there with Laura Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend all three super classics from this era and available on VHS and DVD. Why not Fallen Angel?".

	schema:reviewBody "That's what the fight with her and Zanuck was about wasn't it?? So many want to marginalize the role Alice Faye played in this movie just as Zanuck mistakenly did. She's no Bette Davis for sure but she was effective as the repressed attractive spinster as noted in the commentaries on the DVD notes. I'd say give her credit for her 1st time efforts in such a splendid film noir role for doing as well as she did. Also HER NAME was the attraction at that time she brought in moviegoers by the droves being the top box office draw in 1940? 39 well one of those years. One must recognize the importance of Alice Fayes' efforts to transition in real life from cute cuddly music star to serious movie star to realize why this movie had a dark background in real life and on the screen. While the men naturally gravitate to the darker sexy role of the femme fatale in the movie the stunning Linda Darnell Alice is just as important to realize what she represented during that time in the public's eye and Darryl Zanucks. He was losing his angel she'd had two kids and now with a husband was certainly no longer innocent and virginal. Zanuck for his own reasons wanted her to continue in that vein and considering how much money she'd made Fox with her films much more than Darnell ever made one can see why. But the world had changed and Faye showed more smarts than Zanuck by seeing that when he didn't. Seeing the movie in that vein I was able to detect all the subtle undercurrents previously unnoticed by me. The transition from spinster to a carnal wife in love with a husband is no small role This needed to be explored more in the film I can see why Alice was not satisfied with her scenes being cut it was too rushed and we didn't get to see HER long fall from grace. The missing scene of her singing the theme song!!! That should be included! Where is it?? That would have helped us connect to Faye's character more. We didn't need to see that development of Darnell's character's fall it was obvious right away. All in all this is a very very underrated movie I'm glad to see it finally getting some WELL DESERVED attention. Andrews Darnell and Bickford were superb but the other actors were good too. Preminger is a master.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fallen Angel 1945Incredible IncredibilityThis is a great little film. It seems a hair stiff at times or a bit low budget which it wasn't but mainly I found this to be a gem a true noir with the lead male lost in the world but with a kernel of goodness deep down. Dana Andrews plays an understated paradigm that isn't sassy or diffident the way Bogart is but is just as admirable somehow whatever the petty thieving he is up to.This is the followup of sorts to director Preminger's Laura from the year before reprising Andrews in the main role and using the same photographer and the same composer who contributed another theme song recurring in the jukebox several times. The photography thanks to Joseph LaShelle who later would be cameraman for one of my favorite noir films Road House the great Where the Sidewalk Ends another Preminger movie with Andrews and much later I Was a Teenage Werewolf with Michael Landon is really remarkable with a lot of somewhat longer takes that show off both the consistent acting and give the scenes a sense of flow and lyricism. Even the way Andrews is shown walking has a quality of calm drama and it's partly due to how he is filmed. Watch how perfectly framed the figures are and the shadows and how often something in the background can be seen perfectly while something else is happening closer to us.The title suggests some metaphors and there is a long quote from a poem about fallen angels and it seems that Andrews is that angel a good man who fell and who through the course of events largely out of his control rises up again. Certainly the murder of the loose single woman played by Linda Darnell one of his two love interests he has nothing to do with. He eventually helps solve it. The other love interest a cultured single woman played by Alice Faye and her money he wins over at the end partly because he is in fact an angel of sorts. In some weird sense he saves this Faye character from her own kind of purgatory reading books and festering away for years with her sister at home. If Andrews presents the main theme of the movie the two women present a parallel one one of contrasts largely but also showing how they both improbably fall for the man for similar reasons. He's a nice guy a charmer and damned good looking.Going back to Laura by comparison you'll find the characters here are largely admirable rather than irritating and that the main plot intention isn't for Andrews to solve a crime but to win over one or both of these women. There are some things you have to just swallow like how quickly the love affairs blossom and how easy he seems to get his complex plans in action to get the money. But it's not a documentary and the drama punched up with some amazing visuals is terrific.".

The photography thanks to Joseph LaShelle who later would be cameraman for one of my favorite noir films Road House the great Where the Sidewalk Ends another Preminger movie with Andrews and much later I Was a Teenage Werewolf with Michael Landon is really remarkable with a lot of somewhat longer takes that show off both the consistent acting and give the scenes a sense of flow and lyricism. Even the way Andrews is shown walking has a quality of calm drama and it's partly due to how he is filmed. Watch how perfectly framed the figures are and the shadows and how often something in the background can be seen perfectly while something else is happening closer to us.The title suggests some metaphors and there is a long quote from a poem about fallen angels and it seems that Andrews is that angel a good man who fell and who through the course of events largely out of his control rises up again. Certainly the murder of the loose single woman played by Linda Darnell one of his two love interests he has nothing to do with. He eventually helps solve it. The other love interest a cultured single woman played by Alice Faye and her money he wins over at the end partly because he is in fact an angel of sorts. In some weird sense he saves this Faye character from her own kind of purgatory reading books and festering away for years with her sister at home. If Andrews presents the main theme of the movie the two women present a parallel one one of contrasts largely but also showing how they both improbably fall for the man for similar reasons. He's a nice guy a charmer and damned good looking.Going back to Laura by comparison you'll find the characters here are largely admirable rather than irritating and that the main plot intention isn't for Andrews to solve a crime but to win over one or both of these women. There are some things you have to just swallow like how quickly the love affairs blossom and how easy he seems to get his complex plans in action to get the money. But it's not a documentary and the drama punched up with some amazing visuals is terrific.";

Why do men become obsessed with dangerous beautiful women? Ask your shrink for an analysis. Alfred Hitchcock made the best film on obsession with a beautiful woman Vertigo.

The acting is marvelous especially Dana Andrews Linda Darnell and all those wonderful character actors that Otto Priminger hand picked for their roles. The weakest performance is by Alice Faye but then she is out of her element and badly miscast not at all a good choice for a film noir. Plus my understanding is that Priminger cut many of her key scenes to make more room for the machinations of Linda Darnell.

Now here's where I differ with some viewers I think it was a mistake. Darnell is good as the sluttish caf worker going out with everyone who asks but when we see Faye with her hair down towards the end and playing dynamic scenes we surely realize that without intervention Preminger's film would have been just that little better balanced.

The problem is that while he does marry Faye when Darnell unexpectedly ends up murdered Andrews is the prime suspect. Plus after seeing the investigator in action beating confessions out of suspects he takes off for San Franciscoand his new bride insists on following there.The problems with the film are motivation. While it seems pretty obvious that Andrews is a jerk his plan to wed Faye and use this money to catch Darnell seems overly complicated. Plus he's brandnew in townwhy do all this for two women you barely know? As for Faye she's a real enigma. Why would she ever fall for a man so unlike her and then help him evade the law when he's accused of murderand it seems likely he DID kill the woman on his very wedding night?! Her devotion is slavish and she seems awfully stupid and tough to believe. Had the plot been hashed out moreallowing far more time to pass in getting to know both womenthen it might have made sense. Instead we are expected to believe that after only one week in a small town all this occurs! Now what's to like? Well the dialog is very snappy and typically Noir. Andrews in particular is fully of snappy oneliners and his attitude is perfect. The cop Charles Bickford is also greatbeing ugly and brutala true Noir detective! Really aside from rushing everything too much the film's plot was very good.

We saw it before as part of a Film Noir series so it was a surprise when it was shown on the Fox Channel the other night because it gave us a chance to rediscover this 1945 Otto Preminger movie. The director was lucky in casting Dana Andrews his Laura star in the film.The main reason for watching the film again and again is the sensational cinematography by Joseph LaShelle. This movie will be a treat for those fans who appreciate the fine detail this great camera man created for Fallen Angels. The coastal California town gets a fabulous treatment in the hands of Mr. LaShelle. Also the music score by David Raskin working again with the director is typical of the times where the action takes place.We are introduced to a Eric Stanton traveling by Greyhound bus toward one of the big California cities but not having enough funds he must get off in a remote place. He is perhaps not ready for what he is going to encounter. For better or for worse he goes into the seaside cafe where Stella the beautiful waitress is the 'star' attraction among the male population of the town. One can feel the heat emanating from Stella as well as what effect her presence has on all the men that visit the place.The film shows that most of the story has been modified to satisfy the studio executives because it doesn't make sense most of the time. We are witnesses to political incorrectness when the police chief beats a witness repeatedly in order to extract a confession from him. Also the instant romance between June Mills the spinster church organist and Eric Stanton and their surprise wedding is something one only sees in movies but then again who knows the old maid must have been just ripe for picking.For this film being made in 1945 it has a sexuality that comes across openly whenever we are taken to the seaside cafe and watch all the men ogling Stella the waitress who provokes desire in them. Linda Darnell a gorgeous woman herself gives a powerful performance as Stella. Ms. Darnell clearly understand what makes her character tick. Dana Andrews is also excellent as the drifter who falls for Stella but realizes he must play his cards right in order to get his ticket to a better life with June. Alice Faye in a dramatic role doesn't come as well as the others perhaps because her character is not clearly defined.A film to watch for the great cinematography and as a curiosity piece from Otto Preminger.".

He is perhaps not ready for what he is going to encounter. For better or for worse he goes into the seaside cafe where Stella the beautiful waitress is the 'star' attraction among the male population of the town. One can feel the heat emanating from Stella as well as what effect her presence has on all the men that visit the place.The film shows that most of the story has been modified to satisfy the studio executives because it doesn't make sense most of the time. We are witnesses to political incorrectness when the police chief beats a witness repeatedly in order to extract a confession from him. Also the instant romance between June Mills the spinster church organist and Eric Stanton and their surprise wedding is something one only sees in movies but then again who knows the old maid must have been just ripe for picking.For this film being made in 1945 it has a sexuality that comes across openly whenever we are taken to the seaside cafe and watch all the men ogling Stella the waitress who provokes desire in them. Linda Darnell a gorgeous woman herself gives a powerful performance as Stella. Ms. Darnell clearly understand what makes her character tick. Dana Andrews is also excellent as the drifter who falls for Stella but realizes he must play his cards right in order to get his ticket to a better life with June. Alice Faye in a dramatic role doesn't come as well as the others perhaps because her character is not clearly defined.A film to watch for the great cinematography and as a curiosity piece from Otto Preminger.";

Seen as something of a lesser entry in film noir and on Preminger's CV he claimed to not even remembering the film when quizzed about it once the piece is famous for being the last film Faye made as a major Hollywood actress. Disappointed at how studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck and Preminger cut her role out of the picture they were all about Darnell Faye left the studio the day after a preview screening and did not make another film for 16 years.The plot sees Andrews as press agent Eric Stanton who down on his luck gets turfed off the bus some 150 miles from San Francisco and finds that he is in the small coastal town of Walton. Here he meets sultry waitress Stella Darnell and frumpy recluse June Faye. The former he is very attracted too so is everybody else it seems the latter has just come into a lot of inheritance money something else that catches Eric's eye. Pretty soon his life will be surrounded by love infatuation jealousy and worst of allmurder.More a mystery whodunit than an overtly dark venture into the realm of film noir Fallen Angel is still a tidy and atmospheric movie. One where we can never be fully sure everything is as it at first seems. Especially the three main protagonists where Preminger in spite of not remembering doing so misdirects the audience about the character's make ups. This greatly aids the whodunit structure where the killer is well disguised until the end reveal. Its also nicely shot by LaShelle where the lighting is key for scenes involving the more vixen like Darnell and the more homely Faye the difference and what it says is quite striking. It be a nice narrative line to follow on revisits to the film. The acting is safe with Darnell leaving the red blooded men amongst us happy and wanting more. And in spite of some uneven threading of the plot in the last quarter the end is a triumph and a genuine surprise. 710Footnote The source novel the movie was adapted from was written by Marty Holland. Also the author of The File on Thelma Jordan 1949 Marty was actually a she named Mary of who little or nothing else is known about because after 1949 she upped and vanished never to be heard of again!".

It's certainly not better than LAURA or anything approaching seminal and does have credibility gaps wider than the Grand Canyon unusual for Preminger but I seem to keep coming back to one thing.. this is a satisfying movie! One significant plus is the performances of the three leads.

Alice Faye who was so edited out in favor of Linda Darnell that she basically quit the business for the better part of two decades shines as the closeted church organist with a heart of gold and lust. And Darnell makes the most of her smoulderingly disaffected come hither but don't touch me gazes. As bizarre as it is to think men would order lousy food in the greasy spoon dive where Darnell waitresses day after day year after year in order to be around her this is about the only thing in the entire script which is remotely plausible. Don't examine motives track character arcs or analyze logic and you'll be happier with FALLEN ANGEL. In a movie where the police deputize civilians to beat up witnesses in order to gather information and where some individuals' entire character and identity change at the drop of a hat the charm of this movie is in the gleefully melodramatic yet charming interactions of the love quadrilateral that is Alice Faye Faye's sister Dana Andrews and Linda Darnell. In particular Andrews and Darnell display some good chemistry in their dark and twisted courtship which in 2004 plays as much like a borderline stalking and attempted rape as it does romance. It must have been particularly racy in 1945.Not believable for a second but enjoyable for more than an hour FALLEN ANGEL is worth a look for hardcore fans of crime drama noir and Dana Andrews  Linda Darnell. Possibly the definitive example of bad boy meets bad girl bad boy marries good girl to steal her money to get bad girl bad boy blamed for bad girl's murder bad boy ends up with good girl thanks to bizarre and ridiculous deus ex machina ending out there.

	schema:reviewBody "This is pretty much a lost noir of the 40s not on video and rarely shown on TV.  Too bad because it was Otto Preminger's follow up to Laura and it's pretty damn good.  All the traditional noir elements are in place  a drifter Dana Andrews who sails into town on a bus hooks up with a sultry waitress Linda Darnell and romances an old maid Alice Faye with plans to swindle her and run off with the waitress.  And then of course there's a murder.  The film is brim full of atmosphere  shadowy scenes in the hash house where Darnell works a song that keeps playing on a jukebox a la the Laura theme and by the same composer David Raskin lots of sharp smarmy character actors on the edge of things.  The mystery is fairly compelling and the film stands up very well for something made more than half a century ago.Dana Andrews is rock solid as the shifty drifter who might just might be a little better than he thinks he is.  Linda Darnell is senstational as the waitress hard calculating and incredibly voluptuous.  Her closeups are the equal of Rita Hayworth and Gene Tierney in the forties.Reportedly Alice Faye left Fox after she lost several scenes in the editing room where Zanuck decreed that the film should play up Darnell and her carnal allure.  But Zanuck was right.  Darnell is sensational and Alice Faye is not touching as the old maid.  She's about ten years too old  for the role and looks matronly.  She probably shouldn't be blamed for her misconcieved performance since she was miscast in the first place.  Had Zanuck cast Dorothy McGuire or some other younger woman who had a modest touching quality the contrast to Darnell's sluttishness would have been far greater and audiences would have cared more about what happens to the old maid.  Even with this flaw however the film is a little gem well worth trying to catch.  With a more appropriate actress in Faye's role this might have been a major noir.Great scene  Andrews walk into the diner where Darnell works and hears the film's theme a low sultry love ballad playing on the jukebox for the umpteenth time.  Does that song play all day long? he grouse to Darnell. Bored as hell she rings up a sale on the cash register and without even looking at him snaps back I like it.  Great stuff!".

All the traditional noir elements are in place  a drifter Dana Andrews who sails into town on a bus hooks up with a sultry waitress Linda Darnell and romances an old maid Alice Faye with plans to swindle her and run off with the waitress.  And then of course there's a murder.  The film is brim full of atmosphere  shadowy scenes in the hash house where Darnell works a song that keeps playing on a jukebox a la the Laura theme and by the same composer David Raskin lots of sharp smarmy character actors on the edge of things.  The mystery is fairly compelling and the film stands up very well for something made more than half a century ago.Dana Andrews is rock solid as the shifty drifter who might just might be a little better than he thinks he is.  Linda Darnell is senstational as the waitress hard calculating and incredibly voluptuous.  Her closeups are the equal of Rita Hayworth and Gene Tierney in the forties.Reportedly Alice Faye left Fox after she lost several scenes in the editing room where Zanuck decreed that the film should play up Darnell and her carnal allure.  But Zanuck was right.  Darnell is sensational and Alice Faye is not touching as the old maid.  She's about ten years too old  for the role and looks matronly.  She probably shouldn't be blamed for her misconcieved performance since she was miscast in the first place.  Had Zanuck cast Dorothy McGuire or some other younger woman who had a modest touching quality the contrast to Darnell's sluttishness would have been far greater and audiences would have cared more about what happens to the old maid.  Even with this flaw however the film is a little gem well worth trying to catch.  With a more appropriate actress in Faye's role this might have been a major noir.Great scene  Andrews walk into the diner where Darnell works and hears the film's theme a low sultry love ballad playing on the jukebox for the umpteenth time.  Does that song play all day long? he grouse to Darnell. Bored as hell she rings up a sale on the cash register and without even looking at him snaps back I like it.  Great stuff!";

	schema:reviewBody "Although Fallen Angel is probably the least known and least appreciated of Otto Preminger's film noirs it is nevertheless a very compelling and well paced murder mystery which is frequently cynical and melodramatic but also strong on style and atmosphere. Joseph LaShelle's cinematography creates a moody and oppressive backdrop for the action which is particularly appropriate as it reflects the sense of confinement that exists in its small town setting and also the feelings of despair which frequently feature throughout the story. Predictably the nighttime scenes are the most aesthetically pleasing and there are also some memorable images which stay in the mind for some time after the movie has finished. Their particular strength lies in their ability to capture in one moment such a strong impression of the characters and the time in which they existed. One example is the shot of Dana Andrews standing outside Pop's diner and another is Linda Darnell massaging her foot after returning from an unexplained absence from her job.Eric Stanton Dana Andrews arrives in the small town of Walton with little money and no immediate prospects and goes to Pop's diner where he sees a stunning looking waitress called Stella Linda Darnell and also learns that a touring spiritualist Professor Madley John Carradine is due to appear in a show in the town in the very near future. Eric is an express agent who is very persuasive and unscrupulous and displays these qualities in style as he cons Madley's assistant into thinking that he knows the Professor and then gets involved in publicising the show. Ticket sales are slow because of opposition from Clara Mills Anne Revere who is the daughter of the well respected and now deceased previous mayor of the town. When Eric attempts to persuade Clara to give the show her approval she initially refuses but then changes her mind due to the influence of her sister June Alice Faye who is quite taken with Eric's type of charm.After the Mills sisters' opposition is removed the tickets sell in large numbers and the show is a financial success. The grateful Professor offers Eric a permanent job but he declines because by this point he's become obsessed by Stella and so decides to stay in Walton.Stella has an army of admirers and is also very materialistic so when Eric tries to develop a relationship with her she soon makes it clear that she'll only be interested if he can guarantee marriage and enough money to satisfy her high aspirations. In response he devises a scheme to marry June Mills for a short time so that when the marriage is annulled he could achieve a substantial financial settlement which he could then use to win over Stella. However shortly after having married June Stella is found murdered and Eric becomes a suspect. In order to prove his innocence he then makes his own investigations before discovering the identity of the real killer.The characters in this bizarre story are made believable by some fine performances especially from the supporting cast. John Carradine is excellent as a humorous and very pragmatic charlatan and Charles Bickford is convincing as a retired New York police detective who'd moved to California for the benefit of his health. Anne Revere is good as the sour and sceptical Clara and Alice Faye is subtle in the way that she gradually conveys the fact that there is more to June than first meets the eye.Dana Andrews capably portrays Eric's fast talking ability to manipulate people and also the toughness which enables him to grit his teeth and cope when things don't go as planned. Linda Darnell's capacity to look sullen and disdainful and to act tough and determined was no doubt what made her such a great choice to play the devious and dishonest Stella.This movie is frequently overlooked but is still worth investigating as it has much to commend it and will certainly be appreciated by most film noir fans.".

The Motion Picture Academy Awards were only five years old but still the awards were coveted then because it meant prestige and far bigger salaries and in a director's case bigger budgets to work with. Capra said he tried and failed with a very arty film The Bitter Tea of General Yen which lost money for Columbia and Cohn. He set out try it a different way with a sentimental story from that most sentimental of writers Damon Runyon. The original story was entitled Madame LaGimp and it was about a street beggar who the great city of New York takes to its heart for a brief period with the assistance of a gangster with a streak of sentiment.But this was Columbia the poverty row studio so Capra couldn't get the only old lady movie star around in Marie Dressler from MGM. May Robson was his second choice for Apple Annie the street beggar who has a daughter in a convent school in Spain and engaged to marry into Spanish nobility. As for the gangster Capra wanted James Cagney but Harry Cohn couldn't pry him loose from Jack Warner. He was offered Warren William instead and certainly the dapper and elegant William played a different kind of gangster than Cagney would have. For William's moll Capra's partner and screenwriter for Lady for a Day Robert Riskin persuaded his then girl friend Glenda Farrell to take the part. She Jack Warner was willing to part with.With the great skill that Capra had in casting his films some of the best character actors around like Guy Kibbee Nat Pendleton Ned Sparks and Walter Connolly filled out his roster. A lot of these people would work for Frank Capra again and again.Came Oscar time and Lady for a Day had the great distinction of being nominated for Best Picture Best Director Best Actress and Best Screenplay adapted from another source. This was the first film from Columbia Pictures that was ever nominated for anything by the Motion Picture Academy. May Robson made Capra forget he ever wanted Marie Dressler. Unfortunately she lost to a young actress picking up her first of four Oscars Katharine Hepburn.Riskin lost to the writers of Little Women and the film itself lost that year to the British story Cavalcade. One of the most embarrassing moments in Frank Capra's life occurred when Awards host Will Rogers in announcing the Best Director said come up and get it Frank.Capra rose thinking it was him and the spotlights came down on him. Then there was a frantic buzzing and the spotlight shifted to the opposite side of the hall where Frank Lloyd got up to accept the award that was meant for him for directing Cavalcade. Talk about feeling like a nickel looking for change.However next year Capra's next film It Happened One Night swept all the major Oscars including his first. It sounds like something that only could have happened in a Frank Capra movie.".

I may have to change my mind about Capra or at least see some more of his preCode movies they're terrific! This movie was sweet and touching without being sickening sweet or melodramatic. This movie also has lots of humor and some great dialogue. This 72yrold movie holds up extremely well. I was utterly charmed by this movie.The story revolves around an elderly woman Apple Annie who is quite poor. She sells apples for a living and sends all her money to her daughter Louise who lives in Spain. Annie is ashamed of her lifestyle and she leads her daughter to believe she's a highsociety lady by writing letters on the stationery of a posh hotel. Annie even has a friend on the inside of the hotel who passes Louise's letters that are sent to the hotel to Annie.One of Apple Annie's clients is Dave the Dude the head of a local mob. Before he does any business dealings Dave always buys an apple from Annie for good luck.Well not to spoil the movie too much let me just say that Annie finds out her daughter is coming to town New York and she panics. Her panhandler friends talk Dave into setting Annie up in a suite at the posh hotel so that she can continue the pretense for her daughter's sake. Dave gets most of his mobster and street friends involved in one way or another  the potential is here for great sappiness but amazingly the story unfolds with just pure sweetness and lots of humor that has held up very well over the past 34century.The performances by the lead actors were terrific. May Robson as Annie was wonderful she gave a tender subtle performance as the mother who loved her daughter so much yet was so ashamed of the way she Annie lived. Warren William was terrific as Dave the Dude  I think his was probably the toughest role to play as he had to be a bad guy mob head as well as a softie who went out of his way to make Annie a lady for a day. Guy Kibbee as Annie's husband was superb a common pool hustler who played an uppercrust gentleman. The rest of the cast were pretty good too ... I especially enjoyed the actor who played the dry and sardonic Happy he had some of the best lines in the show.So in conclusion snappy dialogue nice mix of drama and humor and just the right amount of sweetness make for a wonderful preCode movie. If you enjoy old movies this is a movie that you definitely won't be sorry you watched. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie must have played very well to depressionera audiences. The story of an apple seller who has been lying to her daughter who has done well for herself in Europe is sweet heart touching and funny.Great quotable lines in the script well written. The outdoors night photography is luminous everything seems to glow a scene in an outdoor garden with the daughter and her fiancee kissing behind a glass water fountain is beautiful to this day.The ideas of friends and strangers coming to a needy person's aid prefigures such later Capra classics as It's A Wonderful Life. In fact they would make an excellent double feature together. In our cynical times movies like this can be seen as hokey in fact the name Capra was frequently turned into Capracorn even in his day. But the fact that his movies are still treasured and enjoyed today shows that goodness is still an enduring quality and that being drawn to goodness and fairy tales like this gives us hope that those feelings are still in us.Recommended highly.".

Robson was nominated for an Oscar as lead and richly deserved it for her tragicomic characterization.Frank Capra's excellent direction also nominated for an Oscar keeps the plot unfolding with the speed and apparently effortless fluidity so characteristic of the comedies of this period. Capra did not win the Oscar that year but this film launched his series of feelgood dramas and sparkling comedies that netted him three subsequent Oscars.But this is far more than a feelgood comedydrama. It's an excellent movie that stands on its merits outside the genre with a solid supporting cast. Capra's own remake Pocketful of Miracles doesn't meet the standard he himself set here. And although I have tremendous respect for Bette Davis who played the lead in the remake it is the difference between a good performance and an exceptional portrayal. Now that I've seen this version May Robson simply IS Apple Annie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Things aren't always what they seem. A person may appear to be rich happy and enjoying life when in fact they are poorer than dirt have not smiled in days and are just miserable everyday. Apple Annie was a woman who didn't live in the best of circumstances but she made the best of what she had. She sold apples to earn money to send to her daughter living in Spain. Such a kind old woman who is trying her best to survive and she makes that best of her poor little life. She has made many friends in her life some poorer than her and other who are well enough off to not even worry about money. An acquaintance that she has Dave the Dude is a well off man although it is not of total honest ways as he is the leader of a gang but he is always kind to Apple Annie and believes that she is good luck for him. He believes that an apple a day does more than keep the doctor away it keeps the cops away as well as gives him luck in his dealings. Not quite the fairy tale that one would expect but maybe it is. Is it possible that bad guys have good qualities? Can a grown man believe in a fairy tale? Can a lie really turn out to be good or must it be covered up by a string of more lies.In Lady for a Day we see much of a fairy tale made of lies come to life through the kindness of a mobster. Annie is embarrassed about her standard of living and sets up the allusion to her daughter that Annie is a lady of the upper class. She writes letters on the stationery of a classy hotel. She has set up a seemingly harmless lie that she is doing better in life than she really is. This is fine until Louise sends a letter saying she is coming home and bringing a suitor and his father Count Romero. Now Annie finds herself in a bind. She must cover up this lie so that her daughter can keep her lover. Annie fears that if she does not live up to the life style which her daughter thinks she has everything will fall apart.Her penniless friends talk Dave the Dude into setting Annie up in a room at the classy hotel so that she can go on her lie. Dave who is a bad guy in the sight of the law has a touch of good in him. He believes that he can help what he sees as a fairy tale to come to pass. A parallel to Cinderella Dave becomes the fairy godmother that helps dear Annie to live her dream. But this is not a simple answer. Now that Annie has her classy suite in the hotel there is more of the story that she has to fulfill. The story follows a perfect line of events. We see the objective of Annie and the obstacles that she must over come. The action just starts rising from the moment she gets the letter from the hotel manager. She has to find her second husband and even throw a party for the Count before they leave. The point in the movie where I was on the edge of my seat was when we were waiting for Dave and his gangster friends to arrive at this classy party. Leave it to the police to draw out what seems to be a simple gathering to put a stop to the gangster's sinister plans. What a way to bring the movie to a climax. The resolution finally comes after a little added suspense of Dave being arrested almost. The party goes on with a few unexpected guests the police chief and even the governor play in to this fairy tale to help it have a happy ending. And the story ends on what could be a happy note an end to a string of lies but then again it could be just the beginning of a happily ever after marriage.".

The other leads are great and dialog wellwritten.

Of course the daughter has been led to believe that her mother is a high society lady. Not an original story line although it might have been in the 1930's when it came out but like most old movies the predictable outcome is still thoroughly enjoyable because of first rate acting and direction. A terrific cast from top to bottom and perfect way to spend a couple hours. It is a truly feelgood movie.

May Robson was a superb choice to play Apple Annie and her performance is extremely splendid she completely embodies the character of Annie thus making her real and believable. Probably May Robson's best performance ever. No one could have done a better job of playing the lovable old Judge Blake than the wonderful Guy Kibbee. Warren William adequately handles the role of Dave the Dude along with Glenda Farrell as Missouri Martin. A host of excellent supporting actors all give sufficient performances to make this amusing sentimental tale of the greyhaired Cinderella a very pleasurable and entertaining film.

	schema:reviewBody "Born in Australia in 1858 May Robson certainly never envisioned as career in Hollywood films. She had a long career as a stage actress and appeared in about a dozen silent films including CHICAGO with Phyllis Haver and RUBBER TIRES with Bessie Love. Both film survive. She made her talkie debut in MOTHER'S MILLIONS in 1931 and appeared in another 50 films until her death in 1942.Oscar nominated for playing Apple Annie she lost the award to Katharine Hepburn for MORNING GLORY. Robson should have won but her role was really a supporting role in this film based on a short story by Damon Runyon.As the irascible old apple peddler Robson had the role of her career. Seems she has a daughter Jean Parker in Europe. The old lady gets mail at a swanky hotel thru a friend who works there. But when the letter comes that the daughter is coming home with a husband to be and his father a Spanish count Annie is in trouble.Dave the Dude Warren William a gambler won't make a bet without getting an apple from Annie as a good luck token. When she goes missing the Dude sends out a search party locates Annie and learns of her plight. They hit upon a plan to set her up as a lady with the Judge Guy Kibbee as her distinguished husband. Annie gets a makeover and everything is set for the daughter's return.But the stupid cops get wind of what's happening and think there's a big swindle going on. Will the cops squash the charade? Will Annie be exposed as a fraud?Robson and William are terrific. There's also Glenda Farrell as the brassy Missouri Martin based on Texas Guinan who joins in to help the charade. Costars include Ned Sparks as Happy Nat Pendleton Robert Emmett O'Connor Tiny Jones Hobart Bosworth Samuel S. Hinds Walter Connolly Halliwell Hobbes and Barry Norton. A fairy tale to be sure but one with a touch of reality. Director Frank Capra used several reallife panhandlers in the cast. It's also notable that Annie admits she was never married.".

She had a long career as a stage actress and appeared in about a dozen silent films including CHICAGO with Phyllis Haver and RUBBER TIRES with Bessie Love. Both film survive. She made her talkie debut in MOTHER'S MILLIONS in 1931 and appeared in another 50 films until her death in 1942.Oscar nominated for playing Apple Annie she lost the award to Katharine Hepburn for MORNING GLORY. Robson should have won but her role was really a supporting role in this film based on a short story by Damon Runyon.As the irascible old apple peddler Robson had the role of her career. Seems she has a daughter Jean Parker in Europe. The old lady gets mail at a swanky hotel thru a friend who works there. But when the letter comes that the daughter is coming home with a husband to be and his father a Spanish count Annie is in trouble.Dave the Dude Warren William a gambler won't make a bet without getting an apple from Annie as a good luck token. When she goes missing the Dude sends out a search party locates Annie and learns of her plight. They hit upon a plan to set her up as a lady with the Judge Guy Kibbee as her distinguished husband. Annie gets a makeover and everything is set for the daughter's return.But the stupid cops get wind of what's happening and think there's a big swindle going on. Will the cops squash the charade? Will Annie be exposed as a fraud?Robson and William are terrific. There's also Glenda Farrell as the brassy Missouri Martin based on Texas Guinan who joins in to help the charade. Costars include Ned Sparks as Happy Nat Pendleton Robert Emmett O'Connor Tiny Jones Hobart Bosworth Samuel S. Hinds Walter Connolly Halliwell Hobbes and Barry Norton. A fairy tale to be sure but one with a touch of reality. Director Frank Capra used several reallife panhandlers in the cast. It's also notable that Annie admits she was never married.";

	schema:reviewBody "In a way it's a shame May Robson didn't win an Oscar for her performance as Apple Annie in this first cinematic version of Damon Runyon's story. Robson was nominated but lost to Katharine Hepburn for MORNING GLORY. It is without a doubt the defining role in the actress's long and illustrious stage and film career. She spends the first half hour as a loud mouthed street urchin who gives apples and luck to a shady character named Dave the Dude Warren William. But when she finds out her Europeanbased daughter is coming for a visit she confesses to Dave and his cronies that she's been playing a charade pretending in letters to the girl she's a high society woman who lives at a nearby posh hotel.The reason Dave decides to help Annie when the daughter soon visits is somewhat far fetched but it sets the stage for a miraculous transformation. Dave's girlfriend Glenda Farrell gives Annie an incredible makeover while Dave lines up a nice suite for Annie and a phony husband Guy Kibbee to use when hosting the daughter and the daughter's soonto be inlaws. Personally I felt the transformation of Annie was a bit unrealistic. I think Dave's girlfriend would have been a little more tacky and probably would have overdone the makeup on Annie. Also I didn't buy the fact that as soon as Annie has clean skin glamorous clothes and jewelry as well as a spectacular new hairdo that she would all of a sudden talk in softer tones with the sweetest words rolling off her tongue. Probably Annie would still be talking like a sailor and not so easily lose her crude mannerisms. But despite these contrivances the transformation is memorable and it does enable the story to progress to the next level.In the next part the daughter Jean Parker arrives and there is an emotional reunion between mother and daughter down at the pier. This continues as they head back to the hotel. The hoax seems to be working until we find out the prospective groom's father has suspicions about Annie and the others. There is also supposed to be a reception that brings the creme de la creme of upper crust society to Annie's suite which forces Dave and his gang to scramble to come up with acceptable guests. Of course we know Dave won't fail in this endeavor and that Annie will be able to pull her deception off with her daughter's inlaws. If not the story would not have a happy ending. And by the time the film ends we've been treated to what is basically a nice motherdaughter story as well as a sort of Pygmalion for the over60 apple vending crowd.".

Almost 30 years later Capra got a chance to reprise the movie with a new title some other changes and a cast of big name actors.

Warren William does a banner job as Dave the Dude. One thing that stands out in this film over the later version is the costuming and sets. For instance the lineup of chorus girls in Missouri Martin's club and the club dcor and set itself look more like the period of the 1930s around the end of Prohibition.I also like the later film for its somewhat different atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me start by saying that I have never been bothered to write a review on IMDb. Although a fan of the site I skim read reviews often not having the patience to read the long essays that overexcited people write. However I feel it is my obligation to express my opinion on this movie because it is one of a short list of movies that has made an impact on me emotionally. I honestly believe that Christian Bale's performance in this movie was truly outstanding. If Denzel Washington can be rewarded for best actor in Training Day then Bale deserves his just rewards for Harsh Times. His portrayal of Jim David an exarmy ranger is coated in layers of emotional complexity and psychological deterioration. His ability to transform from an honourable courteous officer to a full blown psycho and then back to loving boyfriend and 'amigo' is truly terrifying. Sharing much screen time with Bale is a relatively unknown Freddy Rodriquez. He seems to feed off Bale's character and forces the audience to feel sympathy for him as a childhood friend who can't abandon his crazy best friend. A cross between Benny Blanco Carlito's Way and Ethan Hawke's character in Training Day Rodriquez shows his ability in mixing comedic moments up with emotional intensity and apathy. His friendship with Bale is so unpredictable that as an audience you find yourself laughing with them at one moment and the next on the verge of tears. David Ayer has created a dark moody portrayal of South Central Los Angeles very similar to that of Training Day. It's a bleak bustling environment where the main characters encounter drug dealers gang leaders prostitutes etc. What I found interesting was the way Ayer introduced the beautiful barren Mexican landscape amongst the roughness of LA life. This was to show the personal crossroads Bale's character experiences. The choice whether to stay in Mexico and marry his girlfriend or to satisfy his sadistic urge to kill and work for the drugs squad in Columbia.It's frustrating that Harsh Times will not get the box office recognition it deserves. However through word of mouth and DVD release I am certain that this will become a sleeper classic in the style of Shawshank Redemption. I feel that Christian Bale's performance is as mesmerising as De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver or Edward Norton's character in American History X. His raw approach to the role makes for a startling but very rewarding experience.Overall Verdict A tour de force of a movie with fantastic performances stylish direction and an aftertaste which will stay with you for a very long time. Not since American History X has a movie affected me on such an emotional level. Christian Bale deserves more credit. Much more.....9.510".

	schema:headline " Soldiers of the ApocalypseHarsh Times";
	schema:reviewBody "Harsh Times is an intense film. Keeping you on the edge of finding out how crazy events can become seems to be a staple in the writing of David Ayer. He penned the script for the gritty cop drama Training Day and saw its star Denzel Washington win an Oscar for his portrayal of the conflicted beast at its core. With his new film and directorial debut Ayer has crafted another street drama about people who themselves don't know whether they are the good guys the bad guys or both. Don't be surprised if his work soon creates a second starring Academy Award as Christian Bale is a powerhouse. The raw acting talents of this Brit are unfathomable and thankfully his rejuvenation of Batman has finally allowed those chops to be shown on screen in challenging roles for the masses.Crossing between being the soldiersir yes sir type of man with the gangbanger of his past could be a difficult thing to believe for a viewer. Bale deftly changes personas as if he was flipping a switch. His ability to go from crazed lunatic to apologetic tearfilled and beaten man is amazing to watch. Having a great upandcoming actor to play off of is a plus as Freddy Rodriguez shines in much the same way Ethan Hawke did in Training Dayplaying the straight man whose life is finally on the up and up before his love for a friend drags him back down. The rapport between them is believable and effective in showing us what could be. One of their friends played nicely by Chaka Forman gets it right when he says how Bale's Jim used to be so mellow. His fits of rage and confusion come upon him with no warning showing us what war did to him. Being in the trenches created a man without a moral code one who needs to not think but just do. If one's capacity to kill was always there heshe could probably live their lives being able to turn it off when needed. However if you were not wired that way to begin with the stark contrast could fry their mind into not knowing what it should do. Harsh Times shows us that fall into delusion and selfloathing to the point where thinking doesn't factor in at all action becomes reflex and reflex becomes life. Unfortunately society is not of the shoot first variety like that of a warzone.Ayer has done himself well with this directorial effort. He gets great performances throughout and in multiple languages. Even Eva Longoria was adequate and not a blemish on the film as I initially felt she might be. Ayer shows us all facets of his characters helping to enhance the story. We are privy to the past history of all involved and are allowed to understand each person's motives. Seeing the paradise that Bale has in Mexico adds immensely to the conflict going on inside of him as well. The performance by Tammy Trull is paramount to this fact and her undivided love for her broken man is beautifully expressed. This relationship makes his actions that much more powerfully unfathomable. We have monsters among us in this world and while they can be utilized as a necessity for the survival of our culture hopefully when their jobs are done they can be helped to assimilate back into society without their ambivalence being able to hurt the ones they love.".

As cool as he is this tends to spoil the movie and any suspense of disbelief.I've seen a lot of Christian Bale movies and even so I forgot that it was Christian Bale throughout most of the entire movie. That is an incredibly impressive thing indeed.The movie may not get an Oscar but it is done superbly well and Christian Bale is quite possibly the next Anthony Hopkins.".

As cool as he is this tends to spoil the movie and any suspense of disbelief.I've seen a lot of Christian Bale movies and even so I forgot that it was Christian Bale throughout most of the entire movie. That is an incredibly impressive thing indeed.The movie may not get an Oscar but it is done superbly well and Christian Bale is quite possibly the next Anthony Hopkins.";

As always nothing goes as easily to plan.The two lead actors end up struggling through job rejections life gangs drugs and drinks and also the struggle to move on from their carefree lifestyle when they were young. Responsibility is a difficult option for the pair of them. The problem is exacerbated by Christian Bale's character's flashbacks and hauntings to the war which add a frightening and unstable edge to his character.The film overall takes us on an unpredictable journey following the two men questioning ourselves what we would do if we were in their shoes and watching the pair of them acting and opting for what they do can be unsettling. Acting is great direction is interesting and you will not be disappointed. If you like Crash then in some ways this is in the same vein but not alike to the movie.

I was disappointed that there were only 20 people at the most in the cinema especially as it's the first day. The way the ending is shot is very impressive and moving and stayed with me for ages afterwards. There is a lot of unnecessary swearing but I suppose that is the way Jim and Mike would speak. Also Jim is supposed to be 26 but looks a lot older. I was so impressed and can't wait for the DVD although I won't be surprised the second time round. I recommend Harsh Times very highly it is emotional violent realistic hilarious thought provoking traumatic inspired entertaining gripping original and shocking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me preface this by saying that I am definitely a fan of Bale's previous work particularly American Psycho and I thought training day was awesome. I also live in LA if that means anything. I'm aware of the fact that trailers are often deceiving but judging from this movie's trailer I truly believed that the film showed promise. Knowing this you may be asking yourself how is it possible for a motion picture to contain so much suck in only 2 hrs? I honestly don't know how it's possible but they were able to do it. There's not just one thing that makes this movie unbearable so let me highlight a few of elements that did so. First of all this movie should have been titled something slightly more relevant e.g. stupid people looking for a job in LA or maybe the less wordy jobhunt. Was I the only one who thought from the trailer that Bale was actually going to become a cop? Secondly the most common misconception in criticism I'm hearing is that the acting is bad but the fact of the matter is that all of the actors did a barnone job of portraying stupid unlikable people. I don't consider myself a saint but I could not relate to or even feel sympathy for any of the characters. These are the kind of people who make the world a shtty place to live in corrupt lazy lying drinkingwhiledriving guntoting dopesmoking misogynistic antiintellectual selfish ignorant pieces of sht. These people corrupt the military the police force schoolsystems essentially everything they touch and yet I felt that these characters were being glorified throughout the whole film except for towards the end when Bale goes nuts however it is at this point that I felt Rodriguez steppedup to being the hero. The thing that bugs me the most is that Rodriguez's character was able to run home after literally murdering his bestfriend in the face makeout with Eva Longoria and pretend like everything was going to end up fine. I'm sorry while I don't doubt the rejuvenating qualities of swapping spit with Ms. Longoria I think its effect was slightly exaggerated because I don't really think that it could eliminate the horror of killing your best friend. Most disturbing to me is the fact that people not only enjoyed this movie they loved it! People are already screaming Oscarworthy when the truth of the matter is that at best this movie should have gone straight to DVD and I'm being generous. In all honesty this movie should never have seen the light of day. I highly regret not walking out of the film as did two of my friends who went to the movie with me. Of higher priority than 8 dollars is time and if you value either I urge you to avoid this movie at all costs.".

Definitely not for kids but Christian Bale and Freddie Rodriguez are great  surprisingly humorous at times but mostly just intense and very real. Totally engrossing with suspension of disbelief which is saying something as I am a jaded movie watcher. Awesome acting  subtle with a big emotional range. Bale's schizo episodes remind me of Edward Norton in Primal Fear. Rodriguez is convincing with his acting of conflicting loyalties. Interesting commentary on friendship and being a soldier returning from the horrors of battle. A deep film that also speaks to gender roles  what it means to be a man and loyalties to friends or significant others. Courage ambition base animal instinct hope will love and something about human beings short circuiting when confronted by the viscous inhumanity in war despite all efforts to hold it together. Eva Langoria was excellent in her supporting role.".

The dialog between Bale and Rodriguez was so phony so forced to throw in extra 'street' slang. Basically the impression I got from these two speaking was amateur. Bale is talking like he is some straight up 'G'. I suppose I cannot blame the actors completely for a weakly written script.The plot was a joke! It went nowhere. So Bale was a soldier and then is in Mexico with this girl he wants to marry in the US. Then he hooks up with Rodriguez who is an 'alcoholic bum' who needs to find a job and they cruise around drinking and getting high. Sorry we saw the whole bad ass drinkingsmokingbullying while cruising South LA in Training Day before. Then the movie does a 360 and just loses me goes nowhere.What a waste of two hours. How did someone approve this script? Horrible. If u really want to watch it for yourself go ahead. Don't say I didn't warn you.PS Training Day 910  Harsh Times 110".

It's such a shame that the 3 lead actors Eva Longoria also stars chose to star in such a dull film.

	schema:headline " An engagingly tough watch but a bit too forceful without the depth to support it";
	schema:reviewBody "In Afghanistan US soldier Jim David was on the top of his game and in great demand for his ability to kill. Honourably discharged he is back in Los Angeles and unemployed. He wants to work for the police but usually spends his days with friend Mike getting wasted and into petty crime. Mike is also looking for work to keep his lawyer girlfriend happy. As the two of them drive round the city drinking they get into minor scuffles and confrontations with Mike dragged along as Jim slips between gaps in his personality.The film opens really well and did an excellent job of establishing what I assumed the whole foundation of the film would be. Using night vision really well we find ourselves in Afghanistan and join one soldier as he moves in close to a group of armed men. Baseheavy music kicks in just as he does efficiently killing about 10 of them without flinching. It is slick deadly and very cool and the audience feels the excitement and rush. When we step to the back of Jim's car in Mexico the effect is jarring and it did make me think how anyone can leave that type of life and return to everyday 95 society. And this is really what the film is sort of about as we see Jim losing track of what is permissible in normal life versus what he does for a job. In this area the film was not as good as I had hoped because it doesn't bring this confusion out that well on the screen. The writing suggests it but when it comes to showing it it resorts to quick cuts and flashes of colour to show turmoil in Jim's mind.It is a rather lazy effect and Bale deserves better as his performance is impressive in balancing the three sides of this man. It took me quite some time to get over the wigger talk from him but although I'm not familiar with this culture I did accept that people do talk like this and gradually it became more convincing. His Jim's are very different  in Mexico he is chilled in interviews he is disciplined and on the street he is a lower  but Bale links them finding common ground and moving between them well. It is a shame that Ayer could not help him more by giving him subtler material and direction but Bale shines regardless. Where Ayer does work well is in the relationship between Jim and Mike. He has written convincing men losers no doubt but it is interesting to see the posing and peerpressure playing its part in every scene they share. This is brought out well by Rodriguez who was always good in Six Feet Under and is just as good here. He balances his loyalty to Jim well with his character's own weak spine and only gradually brings out his character's dawning. The film is at its strongest when the two are together and in the same way that Ayer fails to really look at Jim's psychological state he paints a disturbingly real picture of the modern male relationship.This keeps the film engaging and interesting but I wanted it to do the deeper work much better as it is a topical subject with so many people in Iraq etc who will someday hopefully find themselves back home in a country that doesn't really appreciate their action and doesn't really want to know what they did out there. As it is though the characters and the tough grim story drive the film forward well enough but without real insight into Jim it does occasionally feel a bit superficial. Several UK critics embraced this film as if it was the Messiah but some seemed to be motivated by spite because it came out the same day as Snakes on a Plane a film several critics were narked at for not being allowed to see. Instead of being brilliant the film is just good  it does some things well but not all things.Ayer's direction is visually very assured and he uses the close confines of the car well while also giving the streets a rough feel Mexico an idyllic feel and the interviews an efficient atmosphere that all contrast nicely. As writer I did want a much more subtle touch and depth in terms of Jim's mental struggle but although this is basic he has done great with the relationships. Bale and Rodriguez were initially hard to swallow with their very heavy dialect and accents but once in their world you get past this and realise what brilliant work they are doing. With the film very much about them the support cast don't have much to do but still have a good presence. Simmons is always a welcome presence and after being just a sexy wiggle at the start Longoria does good work with her small role.A tough and unhappy film that lacks the depth and insight it needed to be truly impacting this is still a dark and engaging affair that has a strong heart in its lead two characters' relationship and the two great actors that deliver it. Sadly not as sharp as it should have been but an engaging ride nonetheless.".

	onyx:emotionText "In Afghanistan US soldier Jim David was on the top of his game and in great demand for his ability to kill. Honourably discharged he is back in Los Angeles and unemployed. He wants to work for the police but usually spends his days with friend Mike getting wasted and into petty crime. Mike is also looking for work to keep his lawyer girlfriend happy. As the two of them drive round the city drinking they get into minor scuffles and confrontations with Mike dragged along as Jim slips between gaps in his personality.The film opens really well and did an excellent job of establishing what I assumed the whole foundation of the film would be. Using night vision really well we find ourselves in Afghanistan and join one soldier as he moves in close to a group of armed men. Baseheavy music kicks in just as he does efficiently killing about 10 of them without flinching. It is slick deadly and very cool and the audience feels the excitement and rush. When we step to the back of Jim's car in Mexico the effect is jarring and it did make me think how anyone can leave that type of life and return to everyday 95 society. And this is really what the film is sort of about as we see Jim losing track of what is permissible in normal life versus what he does for a job. In this area the film was not as good as I had hoped because it doesn't bring this confusion out that well on the screen. The writing suggests it but when it comes to showing it it resorts to quick cuts and flashes of colour to show turmoil in Jim's mind.It is a rather lazy effect and Bale deserves better as his performance is impressive in balancing the three sides of this man. It took me quite some time to get over the wigger talk from him but although I'm not familiar with this culture I did accept that people do talk like this and gradually it became more convincing. His Jim's are very different  in Mexico he is chilled in interviews he is disciplined and on the street he is a lower  but Bale links them finding common ground and moving between them well. It is a shame that Ayer could not help him more by giving him subtler material and direction but Bale shines regardless. Where Ayer does work well is in the relationship between Jim and Mike. He has written convincing men losers no doubt but it is interesting to see the posing and peerpressure playing its part in every scene they share. This is brought out well by Rodriguez who was always good in Six Feet Under and is just as good here. He balances his loyalty to Jim well with his character's own weak spine and only gradually brings out his character's dawning. The film is at its strongest when the two are together and in the same way that Ayer fails to really look at Jim's psychological state he paints a disturbingly real picture of the modern male relationship.This keeps the film engaging and interesting but I wanted it to do the deeper work much better as it is a topical subject with so many people in Iraq etc who will someday hopefully find themselves back home in a country that doesn't really appreciate their action and doesn't really want to know what they did out there.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of both Christian Bale and Training Day also written and directed by David Ayers I picked up this DVD on a whim without knowing anything about it. Although the Training Day comparisons are inevitable HT is an entertaining and thoughtprovoking ride alternately frustrating brutal and surprisingly moving.Harsh Times follows a few days in the lives of two men Jim played by Bale and his best friend Mike played by Fred Rodriguez. Jim is a white guy who grew up in LA's Latino hood and has now returned after a sixyear stint in the US Army and Mike is his lifelong homie. Both are directionless and spend their days looking for work and getting wasted. Like Training Day the story mostly revolves around two guys driving around in a car and LA is as much a character in the story as Jim or Mike. Ayers himself on the commentary describes HT as a love letter to LA which of course makes us question the relationship.Bale's acting is seamless as the story examines the roles that men play Jim's deference and attention to detail as superrecruit for a job with a federal security company his cruel and almostrobotic violent outbursts his swagger and machismo with his friends and his love and tenderness for his girlfriend in her Mexican home the only place he's at peace. Rodriguez provides an excellent foil as the best friend who's been everything to Jim a home a family an ally and a rival with both men alternately encouraging and questioning each other's actions. The main difference is that Mike while immature which is destructive to his relationship with Sylvia a former homegirlturnedlawyer who's outgrown Mike is not a bad man. His relationship with Sylvia played by Eva Longoria is what raises him to a place he might not have gotten to on his own. Just a side note the postfeminist academic in me wonders why Sylvia sticks around A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle stated by uberfeminist Gloria Steinem also Bale's stepmother. Many of the women in the film are portrayed as these virtuous forwardthinking academic types who seem to choose to stick with shady gangbangers for no reason other than they've been together a long time. Don't they meet any nice boys at school? I'll have to trust that to Ayers' writing logic since it's never answered in the film. Their relationship also provides the standard actionmovie formula that it's the love of a good woman that's the honour and glory of a man. yawn While I was a bit disgruntled with the lack of depth the female roles had I was pleased with the casting choices of sexy curvy Latina womennot a stick figure a facelift or a pair of implants in sight. You almost forget it's LA!Jim by contrast has a dark side that was released in the Army which he's subsequently unable to fully control. Bale draws on his own darkness played so well in both The Prestige and American Psycho. As events unfold Jim's choices lead to a series of exponentially more violent and troubling actions and ultimately a tragic but somehow unsurprising conclusion.In the commentary Ayers notes that even in film actions have consequences. And the actions and consequences in the film have an unnerving way of making the viewer wonder what they'd do differently or what really makes us better than them. From the start you feel that these guys are doomed and you're helpless to do anything but watch the events play out. Although Bale's performance and Ayers' writing create both sympathy and irritation with the characters Harsh Times is neither smug nor heavyhanded as it might be if handled differently. While violence as a social problem can be easily written off as an economic and racial divide this changes when viewed in the context of the lives of real people which the characters in Harsh Times nearly are. The movie is a brutal but cautiously loving portrayal of a man gone wrong and ultimately it's his ordinariness that makes it compellingly uncomfortably real. Harsh indeed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bale's performance like Denzel Washington's in Training Day was downright frightening. He isn't quite psychotic just extremely unstable. The scene between Rodriguiz and Bale in the car near the end of the film was a brilliant showcase of Bale's varying level of sanity. Despite this films dialog dawg dude and hommie were said WAY to many times Bale's performance is not only one of the best of the year but the character of Jim Davis is one of the most impressively written and acted performances in motion picture history. His disturbing yet touching performance in the last 30 minutes of the film are without a doubt one of my favorite performances of an actor. Despite the films many flaws and relatively terrible choice of music despite Graeme Revell's incredible score the film is still a triumph for Bale. I never write reviews but this film sticks in my mind so much more than any one film has in a long time. Not only is this a different film for all of those involved it is a very different performance for Bale. Patrick Bateman will forever be an amazing credential in his career but this film is one of his many crowning achievements. The film itself is a 7 star film but the performance by Bale is that extra three stars. This film stands by so many others that have come out this year that will inspire intense debate. The Departed Babel The Prestige and Harsh Times all have a split audience but to me a true lover of film both old and new they showcase such amazing talent and are definitely my picks for various academy awards. I only pray that Bale will continue to become more popular. And we can all wait and watch in amazement at this man's career. My hope is one day we can see Christian Bale work with Michael Mann Martin Scorcese Sam Mendes Paul Haggis Clint Eastwood Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu David Fincher Steven Spielberg again and so many other brilliant directors before we see the end of him. See this film if you have a strong constitution and can forget Training Day but don't expect to see the best picture of the year  only one of the best performances to ever be filmed. 1010".

	schema:headline " Kitano's very different yakuza film";
	schema:reviewBody "Takeshi Kitano's yakuza related trilogy consists of Violent Cop Boiling Point and Sonatine. All these films are very different together but they still share the usual elements of Kitano Violent Cop is the bleakest Boiling Point is the funniest and also oddest and Sonatine is like the combination of these two previous films and Sonatine is also the greatest in the trilogy and also one of Kitano's most beautiful and greatest films. Boiling Point is very comic but has also some Kitano elements of beauty and peace that we could see in his forthcoming films like Sonatine and HanaBi. Boiling Point tells the story of a baseball team and its relationship with the local ruthless yakuza gang. When couple of the team members decide to get a gun and fight some justice to the situation we meet Kitano's character a little criminal who also has troubles with the yakuza. Kitano's character in this film is the most perverse and twisted I've ever seen! What follows is tragic and comic happenings as these tragicomic people try to get rid of the greedy and exploiting yakuza criminals and stay alive at the same time.There are many fine elements in this film and this is pretty close to Sonatine as both films have peaceful and incredibly beautiful scenes involving sea and flowers. The comic elements are very black and it is easy to see that Kitano was a comedian before starting his masterful directing career. His humor is often cynical ironic and very personal. Just remember the scene at the bar for instance! Kitano's humor demands brains to be fully understood and it is never as easy to laugh at and enjoy as some Jim Carrey farce nothing against Jim though. But Boiling Point is definitely not a mere comedy it is a Japanese yakuza story with comical elements. The yakuza is presented here as stupid and childish bunch of criminals who have to prove themselves that they are bad guys and worth respecting. There is a brilliant scene involving flowers and two machine guns as Kitano and his pal decide to finish the miserable life of one yakuza team! In Kitano's films usually guns are for men like extended penis so important in order to be someone. Violence is usually the only way Kitano's characters are able to communicate together. The elements of beauty are always heart stoppingly effective in Kitano's art and the scene at the flower field is very fantastic and memorable. And this was only the beginning as we witnessed the beauty and power of films like Sonatine and HanaBi couple of years later. Takeshi Kitano is simply one of the greatest artists I know and his cinema is as unique as cinema itself was in its birth over 100 years ago. There is no comparison for his films they are so personal and come straight from the heart of this man.Boiling Point is not Kitano's greatest film but still more than noteworthy. It is tragic funny exciting and challengingly symbolic at the same time and thus as personal as Kitano's masterpieces. There are many great scenes and acts committed by the characters and perhaps the only flaw in here is that the film is little too long and slow at the end part of the film. But once the end scene comes it is again something we could expect from Kitano and is pretty similar to Sonatine's finale.Boiling Point deserves 810 rating as a very interesting piece of Kitano cinema and this is a hint of what was to come from this man couple of years later!".

	schema:headline " Unpredictable";
	schema:reviewBody "34x JugatsuBoiling Point1990 focuses on the theme of rebellion.  The second consecutive film by Takeshi Kitano with an outsider who goes against the system.  Masaki is a reactionary character who is content to be a nobody.  He is an outsider who tends to do things just for the heck of it. Masaki and Uehara have a lot in common because both fight and lose to the system.Uehara is a charismatic anti hero who is in the film for a small period of time.  I only wished that Uehara had more screen time in Boiling Point1990.  Uehara is the meanest and sadistic person in a Takeshi Kitano directed picture.  Beat Takeshi plays Uehara with flamboyant sadism and unpredictable viciousness.  Beat Takeshi in Boiling Point1990 follows in the footsteps of fellow tough guys Lee Marvin Robert Mitchum Charles Bronson Klaus Kinski Richard Widmark Harvey Keitel Telly Savalas and Lawrence Tierney.The act of sodomy by Uehara on his best friend is a shocking scene that attacks the nerves of the viewer.  The images from this scene are off beat and unsettling.  Uehara seems in this scene to prefer being in the company of of his best friend than his girlfriend.  Its scenes like this that gives the film a brutal and dark comic edge.  You will never see a scene like this in a Hollywood picture nor for that matter in an American Independant Film because very few are bold and daring filmmakers.34x JugatsuBoiling Point1990 is the first true Takeshi Kitano film that has his trademarks of off beat images moments of dullness and sudden violence more completely than in his debut Violent Cop1989.  Also the first film that Takeshi Kitano wrote and directed on his own.  Its here that Takeshi Kitano came into his own as an auteur and movie maker.  Takeshi Kitano has a passion for the sport of baseball which is why the main character is a member of his local town's baseball team.  Takeshi Kitano films a flash forward sequence that reminds me of Point Blank1967 the early films of Alain Resair and Nicolas Roeg plus The Limey1999.The acting portion of the film is not a strong point for the director here. Average in fact compared to the other departments of the motion picture. Beat Takeshi takes the cake with his amazing performance as the unpredictable Uehara.  Masahiko ono does alright as the average and lazy Masaki.  The acting from the rest of the cast varies from person to person.A favorite motif of Takeshi Kitano is the scene of people hanging out and playing at the beach.  In his best films there is a scene where the main characters go to the beach to relax and take it easy.  These scenes show the good nature of the characters of Uehara and his best friend when they are not doing bad things.  The beach motif in Boiling Point1990 is for the main characters a place to find peace and tranquility with its calm waves soft sands and cool blue skies.  These scenes make the characters very likeable.A lot of the visual use and motifs from this film is used again in both Sonatine1993 and Kids Return1996.  The scene where Uehara kills his boss with a machine gun is used in the climax of Sonatine1993.  The idea of the person who messes up in life plays an important role in Kids Return1996.  Suicide is a theme that plays a major role in both Boiling Point and Sonatine.  If Violent Cop1989 is the older brother of Fireworks1997 than Boiling Point1990 is the older brother of the masterpiece Sonatine1993.The violence in the film provides an interesting counterpoint to the dullness of life.  Violence at times in here happens without reason or warning.  Violence in the universe of Beat Takeshi is not pleasant nor romanticized but vicious and ugly.  Violence in Boiling Point begins and ends quickly without any regards for the aftermath.  The violent behavior from the characters of the film is something that is in all of us human beings whether we like it or not.The director is a genius at mixing images of humor with images of brutality. The visuals here are much more bizarre than in Violent Cop1989.  Takeshi Kitano is excellent at using images and natural sounds to tell a story. Boiling Point1990 uses images with the same flair and style of the Silent film era.  There are images of beauty and images of ugliness that makes the film fascinating to view.34x JugatsuBoiling Point1990 is the second chapter in the lifelong Beat Takeshi series.  The editing is done at a rapid fire pace.  The scene where Uehara bashes a bottle of beer over and over again is done with humor. Other humorous scenes are the sequence where Uehara asks his best friend to cut his finger for sleeping with his girlfriend even though he told him to do it and the scene where Masaki and his best friend have trouble firing a gun because the safety is off.  Takeshi ends the film with his usual bleak finale.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie about a dorky baseball player that becomes a man. The movie starts out with a baseball game and focuses on this character and shows how he is apathetic towards life a born loser. He sucks at baseball nobody really likes him that much and he has no girlfriend. When he goes back to his job a gangster from the Yakuza Japanese mafia is complaining about the carwash he got. So then the baseball player guy i can't keep all these Japanese names in order tries to hit him but is blocked. THe gangster says he broke his arm and goes to the doctor. Well this doesn't sit well with the Yakuza so they want to carwash owner to become part of his gang. The coach of the baseball team now a bar owner used to be in the Yakuza. He tells them to not give the kid any trouble but to make himself clear he beats the living crap out of the guy that took over his job. Now this movie doesn't have a lot of blood but every scene of violence is brutally disturbing. You don't expect it. The sea is calm and then all of the sudden a 100ft tidal wave destroys the shoreline. Anyway that guy gets paid back by getting beaten so bad he he can't walk. He says he is going to get a gun and kill the yakuza boss but since he can't walk the baseball player and his other outcast friend go to Okinawa to buy a black market gun from the military base. One the way they meet Beat Takeshi and I probably bet they wish they hadn't. The whole middle of the movie deals with their adventures with Takeshi's completely sadistic perverted insane character. Never in a movie has there been a likeable but aslo highly dispicable character all in the same person. He has no morals but he does he hates everyone but he loves his friends. He's a paradox. I guess they put that whole part in as a way to show the two baseball players loss of innosense as they witness multiple acts of gratuitous sex dismemeberment murder and arms dealings.The two guys return to the outskirts of Tokyo and take the gun to the Yakuza headquarters. In attempting to fire it the gun jams and two of the tree guys get beaten severely. The star baseball player then returns and drives a gasoline tanker straight into the headquarters blowing up the whole thing. This movie is unlike any American film. I have recently turned to only watching foreign films because of my utter distaste for hollywood garbage and this film has definately pleased me.".

	schema:headline " Japanese filmmaker Takeshi Kitano directs writes and acts in this gangster comedy about the yakuza the notorious criminal organization of Japan.";
	schema:reviewBody "As always Takeshi Kitano focuses on characters excluded from Japan's 'economic miracle'. His protagonist Masaki Ono Masahiko is a hopeless loser no education he is slow on the uptake no prospects he works parttime as a petrolstation attendant no baseball skills which implies a deficient sense of his place in Japanese society. He imagines crashing a stolen oiltanker into the yakuza headquarters. In his mind this suicide gives meaning and shape to a lifetime of underachievement. Kitano's own extended cameo as Uehara the Okinawan gangster who commands selfsacrificing loyalty from his friend Tamagi despite expecting his to sever a finger submit to sodomy and so on is a creation in the league of French writer Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi a lord of misrule the embodiment of the disorderly underside of orderly Japan. As a controlled musicfree account of violence crime and immorality on the verge of erupting through society's placid surfaces the film is remarkable enough. What makes it phenomenal is Kitano's completely instinctive reinvention of the grammar and syntax of narrative filmmaking unique in the popular cinema of the 1990s. Although it gave Kitano his second director credit Boiling Point has all the hallmarks of a film by a debut director determined to get every idea he has ever had about film life death and baseball up there on the screen. His subsequent films such as Sonatine 1993 and HanaBi 1997 are more mature but cannot recapture the raw aesthetic excitement of these beginnings.".

Completely unmotivated Kazuo's friends and colleagues almost have to force him to participate in local sandlot baseball games and his work as a gas station attendant. After one game in which Kazuo struck out without even trying to swing the bat Kazuo gets into a scuffle with a yakuza who is a member of the Otomo group. Stating that his man's arm has been broken the branch boss of the Otomo group pays the owner of the gas station a visit and informs him that he had better make amends with the injured yakuza. Learning about the scuffle the coach of Kazuo's baseball team Ishida a former high ranking yakuza promises to straighten things out for the younger man. Ishida does in fact beat up the branch boss but the man's underlings soon beat him up. In order to make amends with his coach Kazuo and a friend make their way down to Okinawa to purchase a pistol. However they find a bit more than what they bargained for.After being told to return some money the next day and to cut off his finger Uehara Beat Takeshi takes his frustrations out on a car by repeatedly kicking the door of a car. It is at this time that Kazuo and his friend come upon the scene. Uehara his right hand man Tamagi and his girlfriend Fumiyo take the two men from Tokyo to a bar where amongst the smoke and karaoke Uehara and Tamagi beat up two men brutally. This is just the beginning of a couple of days of violence.Considered one of Kitano's lesser films by many Boiling Point is a slow paced movie that has some explosive bursts of violence. Also this film displays the image of the sea that is a trademark of Kitano's films and like Sonatine Hanabi and much later parodied in Takeshis' the sea is the locale of both play and violence. Also unlike many of Kitano's other violent characters Uehara seems to lack the tender core that made characters such as Hanabi's Nishi likable in his stony way. However in this film Uehara is the type who forces his friend to have sex with his lover and thereafter beats his lover Fumiyo on the head because she should not have slept with Tamagi even though she was told to. Add to this a couple of instances of rape one male and one female the total package is a completely unwholesome character. Looking back Boiling Point is indeed a flawed film but one can see the elements that would one day make Kitano an internationally acclaimed director. Recommended for fans of Japanese film highly recommended for fans of Kitano Takeshi.".

	schema:reviewBody "Slightly crazy star 'Beat' Takeshi was wellknown in the '80s for his role as the host and creator of TAKESHI'S CASTLE the insane game show where contestants injured themselves in a series of weird games. Takeshi made his directorial debut with VIOLENT COP an effective and downbeat thriller and followed up that film's success with this his second outing as director.I didn't enjoy BOILING POINT as much as Takeshi's previous film mainly because of the performance of Takeshi himself. Takeshi appears in an extended cameo in the middle part of the film in a role that has little to do with the main plot in fact his thirtyminute turn is like a 'mini film' in itself a portrait of an insane gangster who dishes out violence to one and all whether it be his henchman his girlfriend or the gangsters who formerly employed him. This is Takeshi gone over the edge he's a sadistic vindictive character and incredibly his cruel exploits are played for laughs particularly his repetitive violence towards his girlfriend. Are we supposed to laugh at this stuff I wonder? Because watching this guy commit rape on his own henchman in the film's most depraved moment and casual violence isn't my idea of fun. I liked Takeshi in VIOLENT COP and BATTLE ROYALE but I couldn't stand him here.It's a shame as the rest of the film is pretty damn good. We witness the transformation of a mildmannered gas station attendant into a suicidal fighter against the mob and the whole film centres around this character of Masaki. Actor Yurei Yanagi who takes the leading role in his debut performance is bloody excellent and a real trooper. Although the film offers the Japanese style of taciturn acting  the male actors rarely show expression on their faces  Yanagi makes us sympathise with his character's plight and indeed actually like him.Although the film is essentially a slowburning revenge flick you'll be surprised to hear that the action and violence is limited. There's only one shootout in the film although there are quite a few beatdowns and other moments of crazy violence. Instead there's an emphasis on baseball with many wellshot matches and characterisation. Many of the incidents within the film such as the car and motorbike accidents and the casual violence meted out by Takeshi himself are played for laughs but the humour value is intermittent not always working. As a result BOILING POINT is very much a cult movie one for lovers of offbeat comedy and bizarre almost surreal antics rather than fans of traditional gangster movies.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps Kitanos Weakest Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I have recently been going through Kitano's films and upon seeing thing I think it's probably the one I like the least. It's kind of a weak film. It has it's moments but as a whole is too slow and bizarre for it's own good.Just like most Kitano films it has his signature style. The sudden violence the comedy all those things but in this film it just doesn't work. I think a big gripe is that the story feels too loose. You kind of get lost as to why certain things are happening or how certain characters know each other. It actually begins to feel like two separate films about 50 minutes in. Personally I found myself more engaged in the story that occurs 50 minutes in then the rest of it. One of the big issues seems to be that Kitano doesn't show up until that later point and it just feels like not enough of Kitano's character. Also the ending doesn't help clarify the film. In fact it makes it more confusing. I won't give it away but it can be interpreted in different ways. But I will say that if you interpret it one specific way it kind of explains the general oddness of the film.Kitano is known for including some strange things in his movies but this one just kinda takes it over the top. While the movie can be quite funny such as a scene involving an M16 hidden in a bouquet of flowers accidentally going off and causing a funny reaction it just feels like it delves too deep into the comedy and it makes any drama feel odd. There's also some confusing things like Kitano's character raping his male friend and then him not really caring the next day. Or Kitano raping a random woman. Some very odd things to include without any reason. There is also a scene where it appears like we are supposed to see the same event twice but it is all done in one take which makes it quite confusing but kind of impressive at the same time. Really strange to see. Although I will give the film credit for somehow making girlfriend abuse funny. It sounds odd but when you see him hitting her you can't help but laughOverall I think this is a weak Kitano film. It doesn't give me enough drama or character development to keep my interest. I think that's it's biggest problem. It's slow but not for the right reasons such as building characters and relationships before the big climax but just feels slow so it can include silly and odd scenes. Only recommended for Kitano fans.".

Pushed to the point of action Masaki and his friend go to get a gun to challenge those thugs in power. This quest brings them into contact with the violent and erratic Uehara who himself is losing to those within the Yakuza holding all the power.I have been using my DVD rental club to catch up on some foreign films recently and part of this has been watching the films of Takeshi Kitano. Doing this has reminded me what an odd but engaging character he is and by extension his films are and I continued to add a few more of his to my list. Boiling Point not sure why other than marketing reasons they settled on that title given that the translation is 3rd and 4th day of a month is sadly not one of his films that did anything for me other than put me off. It is not that it is without anything of note or merit but more that it just doesn't hang together as an accessible piece of film. I say this with the full knowledge that Kitano's films are often an acquired taste and tend towards silence and fragmentation of timelines but here it did feel like a deliberate decision to push the audience away.With the narrative stuttering over the duration it is left to the moments to carry the film and there are not enough of them to go around. Moments of violence sex and brutality are arresting no doubt and it is interesting to have such an abhorrent character as Uehara in a key place but these are scattered and not developed. Instead we have the film generally moving in no specific direction in regards structure or characters and it is hard not to find it all a bit dull. The cast don't help by not making that much of an impression at any point other than scenes involving Kitano. He is not as interesting here as in other films but it is hard to ignore him as a violent force in the film. Alongside him the two boys look dull and uninteresting  a problem for them because they are supposed to be the main characters. As director and writer Kitano may have been making cultural points as some have suggested and that context is required but without the film helping me get it I have no way to get this context and as a result the film just doesn't work for me. I'm not sold on this context argument because it does come from those who will not have Kitano questioned but either way the film is not a success if it cannot even serve those who are familiar with Kitano.Boiling Point is not a total waste of time as it does have moments and things of interest but as a total product it is inaccessible dull and built on a plot that is either uninteresting incoherent or both. Kitano's presence in the second half picks it up a little but nowhere near enough to be worthy of mention alongside the many much better films that he has made.".

Even admirers of his 'Sonatine' and 'Hanabi' might find this offbeat movie a bit difficult to get into. Certain sequences are brilliant and simply unforgettable but as a whole the movie fails to gel and ultimately disappoints. The first hour or so of 'Boiling Point' features an amateur baseball player who crosses some local Yakuza with disastrous results. The main character Masaki Masahiko Ono is deliberately a bit of an idiot and difficult to like. This makes it hard to care about his fate. The movie really picks up when Beat Takeshi's character is introduced. He is completely unpredictable and dangerous and the most repellent role I have ever seen Takeshi play. These parts of the movie remind me more of Takashi Miike's work like 'Dead Or Alive' than Takeshi's subsequent movies. They are very dark disturbing with surreal touches and bits of bizarre humour. Takeshi still remains one of the most charismatic contemporary actors and he displays originality and talent as a writer and director but I found the movie to be nowhere near as satisfying as 'Hanabi' his masterpiece released several years after this one. Even Kitano's previous movie 'Violent Cop' which was much less ambitious and a little uneven was more enjoyable for me than this. So I say newcomers to Takeshi best steer clear of 'Boiling Point' but fans will find it to be fascinating albeit flawed viewing.".

On top of that this movie was frightening. This movie is great and I definitely recommend it. It is definitely a movie you should watch for both entertainment and originality purposes. It is definitely one to see if you enjoyed 'Scream'. The many plot twists and the many scares it will give you makes it an excellent movie.".

It also has the similar prettyteenagerbeingstabbedtodeath feel to it.On graduation night four friends Julie James Jennifer Love Hewitt Helen Shivers Sarah Michelle Gellar Barry Cox Ryan Phillippe and Ray Bronson Freddie Prinze Jr. go joyriding while drunk and accidentally run over and supposedly kill somebody in the street. While dumping the body in a bay the body attacks Barry then falls into the water. The four assume that he is dead but the next summer they get notes saying I know what you did last summer. The next thing you know friends of the four are being murdered left and right and these four become the killer's next targets.The plot is fair but not especially interesting. I found the SCREAM plot to be much better. The acting and character development in SCREAM are better too. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar both do excellent jobs. Freddie Prinze Jr. is the worst actor I've ever seen in my life and Ryan Phillippe does a fair job. Ann Heche is very good in the part that she has.The characters aside from Hewitt Gellar and Heche are very thin and rather boring. The killer himself is pretty interesting and fairly cool. The ending of this movie bites. It's maybe worth a rent but if you want to see a movie of this style I'd recommend URBAN LEGENDS or SCREAM.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the wake of the incredible success of Scream writer Kevin Williamson decided to craft another teen slasher film this one called I Know What You Did Last Summer. The film revolves around four teen best friends Julie Ray Barry and Helen Jennifer Love Hewitt Freddie Prinze Jr. Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar who are involved in a hitandrun on the 4th of July. When they run over the pedestrian on the road they ditch the body to protect their futures. A year later when they reunite over the summer they all must face the secret they hid last year. Because someone knows what they did and is out for revenge.When thinking about it it is surprising that the writer of this film was the same one who wrote the wildly creative and suspenseful Scream. In all fairness I Know.. is more of an adaption than an original screenplay. It is actually based off the book of the same name. I've read that book and it was an awkward translation into a horror film considering the book is actually quite different and more of a morality tale. In the book the characters are stalked by the mystery man but none of them are ever killed or even threatened with death. Honestly this book was not supposed to be made into a horror film. Kevin Williamson is very talented but I think he cares more about the Scream series especially since Scream 2 was released the same year as this film and got lazy.Another reason why IKWYDLS didn't work was the lead actors Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. To be fair Hewitt isn't the worst actress ever. She's had a few good roles but is more eye candy than leading heroine. It seems like she's more suited to comedy because she stumbles at times in this film and doesn't make enough of a emotional connection with the role to make us root for her. While she isn't winning any Oscars soon she's better at acting than Prinze Jr. who is most of the time very stiff and forced which ultimately effects he and Hewitt's onscreen chemistry. Every time he came on screen was cringeworthy and while he's very good looking he was unfit to be the lead male.Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar however do a very good job with their supporting roles. As an onscreen couple they have good chemistry and rapport which they proved 2 years later in the edgy film Cruel Intentions. Also they stand well on their own. Ray is somewhat of an arrogant asshole and Phillippe plays him very well. Gellar manages to make her role as beauty queen with the shattered dream Helen also believable and her chase scene with the killer is arguably the best part of the film. One has to wonder if the film would have been different and more enjoyable if Phillippe and Gellar were cast as the leads and Hewitt and Prinze were given less screen time.All in all it's not the worst horror film I've ever seenthat title belongs to 1999's The Haunting. You might even managed to be entertained if you can turn off your brain for awhile ignore some of the glaring plot holes and sit through Jennifer and Freddie's awkward acting. However in terms of horror films there are plenty of better ones out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the era of teen slashers started to arise from the incredible success of Scream it seemed a lot of them were just so not up to par as Scream was and still are not to this day. Scream was a fast paced amazingly well crafted classic with excellent characters and acting and a wonderful plot. However there are quite a few slashers in that time that have cult followings from horror lovers for they are very enjoyable slashers that tried their best to conquer Scream implacably. I Know What You Did Last Summer falls under that category for me. True this movie did also help in the creation of the disastrous string of teen horrors we have nowadays with clich plot twists and face palming character actions at every turn but it is arguably the most successful and recognized Scream cashin and there is a reason for that.I especially love the cast. Though Jennifer Love Hewitt is no Neve Campbell she and the rest of her costars Prince Jr. Phillipe and the ever so wonderful and amazingly talented Sarah Michelle Gellar all try their best to make the film work for what it is and accomplish that perfectly. Sarah Michelle Gellar's character Helen actually has a very wide fan base and I am a considered fan as well. Her character was superb too bad she was overshadowed by the film's genre by a lot of critics and was ridiculously killed off quite aggrivatingly. Anyway stopping the drooling and praising over Ms. Gellar the plot is fun and probably my favorite we make a pact plot that I have seen. It has some nice kills and though Ben Willis is no Ghostface I make these Scream references for the screenplay was by Kevin Williamson and we all know that is what this film tried to be he is not a bad killer just not a memorable one. He is not as memorable as the film itself for me at least.Anyway the movie is just pure fun with characters that you actually care for and hope to live surprisingly deep characters in fact for such a short running time and the genrebased film that it is. It was a box office success and I can see why definitely one of my all time favorite slashers even if it's not one of the best and does not receive the appreciation it deserves at a lot of times. I assume it is mostly criticized because of the genre it is in like I mentioned and not many critics and general audiences are open to teen slashers I can see why with the ones we have nowadays but this was the 90s an excellent decade for films of any genre and many people should acknowledge that. A classic very underrated slasher that I loved and enjoyed greatly.".

It starred the biggest stars of it's time Sarah Michelle Gellar Freddie Prinze Jr. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ryan Phillipe and surprisingly they clicked pretty well but I think that's because they just all have to play pretty white kids with problems lol.

But later that evening on the way back to town they accidentally hit a man with their car apparently killing him. After thinking things through the group reluctantly decides to dump the body in the sea and swear to take the secret of what they did that night to their graves. One year later a still guiltridden Julie returns from college to her hometown and finds an incriminating message in the mail somebody knows what they did last summer. After rounding up her circle of former friends she tries to figure out who alive could have seen them leave a man for dead. But the events surrounding the accident may be more complicated than any of them had originally thought.Last year screenwriter Kevin Williamson came out of nowhere with 'Scream a selfreferential satire on the teen slasher oeuvre wrapped warmly in classic Wes Craven thrills. Unexpectedly but deservedly a surprise runaway box office success followed. Based on the reception of his feature debut and before Craven and the folks at Dimension came knocking for a 'Scream' sequel due out this winter Williamson took it upon himself to bring author Lois Duncan's novel 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' to the big screen. The end product is a decent teen slasher film but one can't help feeling that Williamson missed a big chance to send up traditional horror archetypes once more.As the world of 'Last Summer' wasn't originally Williamson's own creation it's to be expected that the film not be strung through with the same knowing streak of humour that was the driving force behind 'Scream'. Or maybe it's just that Williamson had grown tired of the same old jokes and opted to shun them out of 'Last Summer' altogether. But through opting to stay within the lines for his latest film Williamson has gutted what made his first so special. Sadly 'Last Summer' does not stand apart from the crowd of horror films that Kevin Williamson so skilfully mocked ten months ago. That said this is perhaps the first slasher film to come out since 'Scream' and against the odds this serves to the film's advantage as it's almost quite enjoyable watching the clichs play out in front of you exactly as predicted.Ironically British director Jim Gillespie 'Joyride' in his first Hollywood production has made a good effort to mimic the works of Wes Craven specifically with the commanding score by John Debney. Marco Beltrami's work on 'Scream' is the template used by Debney here and the versatile composer manages to accentuate the tension well despite signalling some of the scares. However Gillespie makes the mistake of depicting the death scenes too graphically. Gore could have been used well in 'Last Summer' but Gillespie leaves the camera rolling for too long during the vicious attacks on the killer's victims which end up more repulsive than anything. Gillespie ain't no Craven that's for sure.The cast or should I say group of attractive teens that are waiting to be offed? also seem to be taking this project a little too unsmilingly with actors Freddie Prinze Jr. and Ryan Phillippe more concerned with trying to see which one of them can ham it up the most than actually developing characters worth caring about. Jennifer Love Hewitt is decent enough here but her performance never fully convinces. It's up to Sarah Michelle Gellar to strap ably into damsel in distress mode something that the actress should know about starring on Buffy the Vampire Slayer week after week and does more than necessary to make the audience truly feel for Helen Shivers as she laments her shattered dreams. Jamie Lee Curtis you might want to keep an eye on your Scream Queen coronet.The final act of the film is hard to resist as it stages a series of nice set pieces that keep you close to the edge of your seat at all times right up to the agreeably trite sequelfriendly ending. But Williamson needs to learn how to wean the parody away from his screenplays without completely robbing them of any innovativeness. I admire the man for not repeating himself but he seems to have progressed right into a career corner with 'Last Summer'. 'Scream 2' will most likely return him to the top of the pyramid once again but I'd rather not think about what might happen after that. 710 ".

A year later each one of them receive notes stating the somebody knows what they did last summer and as seemingly harmless jokes turn into bloody murder they have to figure out who could've seen them that night and maybe the man they hit didn't die and he's back for bloody revenge.What a film! I remember I was at Hollywood and I had to chose between this movie and Friday the 13th The Final Chapter so I picked this movie and as I pulled out of the parking lot I felt I had picked a dud so I put off watching this for a while and then one morning I decided to check it out and stuck it into by DVD player. From the first shot to the last shot this film is beautifully shot and directed. You get to know the characters and feel like you want to reach into your T.V. set and pluck the characters out of harms way and a lot of that is due the performances of the actors. Jennifer Love Hewitt was the perfect choice to play the heroin and Sarah Michelle Gellar delivers a heart wrenching performance and the audience really gets to know her more than the rest of the cast mostly to Mrs. Gellar's talent. Which brings up Sarah's chase scene. Words cannot describe the shear terror eating away at your body as Mrs. Gellar runs for her life from the killer. The director did an outstanding job with this sequence and it goes down in Chase Scene Hall as number 1. Remember the chase scene in Prom Night? Expect that and much much more and you will be no doubt satisfied. Freddie Prinze Jr. is likable as Jennifer Love Hewitt's character's boyfriend and serves as a great red herring twisted around into s great fake reveal and Ryan Phillipe proves he can make the most unlikeable character likable and you can feel for him when he meets his demise. The rest of the cast are great and are there for fodder or red herrings. The only thing I have to say now is if you haven't seen this go check it out and you will now be disappointed.

	schema:headline " One of the Better PostScream Slashers";
	schema:reviewBody "I Know What You Did Last Summer 1997 out of 4 Jennifer Love Hewitt Sarah Michelle Gellar Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. play a group of friends who are drinking and having a good time but on the way home they accidentally run over a man and kill him. They decide it's best not to go to the police fearing murder charges so they dump his body but a year later they begin getting harassed.Thanks to the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM the horror genre got a boost and soon after one slasher after another was being released. Out of all of them this one here is the best in my opinion because Kevin Williamson's screenplay goes away from all the selfmocking and instead delivers a very good story that works perfect as a drama but it also features the horror elements that slasher fans would come to expect. Throw in a very good cast and some likable characters and we're left with one of the better horror films to come out of this period. If SCREAM was a classic like HALLOWEEN then this here is more like a good stepchild in the same vein as a Friday THE 13TH.The thing I enjoyed most about this was the actual personal story of these four people who find their lives changed over a bad decision. The set up itself is pretty simple but it works extremely well because we've all been young and made foolish decisions and one of the best moments in the film comes when the four teens must decide whether or not to go to the cops. Their reasoning behind it is interesting and their thought process is something you don't typically see in a slasher. The damage that their decision has on their lives is something else brought up in the screenplay that works extremely well. All of this happens before we even get to the horror elements. The mystery surrounding the killer keeps you guessing for certain.The horror elements are all extremely good. I know some make fun of the Captain Gordon outfit but I thought it was rather effective and brought back memories from the giallo days of the 70s when killers wore nothing but black. Another thing that works are the actual chase scenes which director Jim Gillespie manages to build up some nice tension. It also doesn't hurt that you actually like the characters can connect with them and you don't want to see them killed. Hewitt Gellar and Phillippe are all extremely good and believable in their roles as is Anne Heche in her supporting bit. Prinze Jr. is probably better here than anytime in his career although that's not too much support I'm giving him.I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER certainly has a few flaws including the movie getting dragged out in the third party but overall it's a highlight of what the genre had to offer after the success of SCREAM.".

	onyx:emotionText "I Know What You Did Last Summer 1997 out of 4 Jennifer Love Hewitt Sarah Michelle Gellar Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr. play a group of friends who are drinking and having a good time but on the way home they accidentally run over a man and kill him. They decide it's best not to go to the police fearing murder charges so they dump his body but a year later they begin getting harassed.Thanks to the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM the horror genre got a boost and soon after one slasher after another was being released. Out of all of them this one here is the best in my opinion because Kevin Williamson's screenplay goes away from all the selfmocking and instead delivers a very good story that works perfect as a drama but it also features the horror elements that slasher fans would come to expect.

The plot was fastpaced and exciting keeping the audience entertained especially in the parts where horrific pranks and deadly events take place around the four teenagers after they discover that someone learned of their hitandrun accident the year before. How the accident made a negative impact on their friendships were also brilliantly acted out in the movie and then when the teens had to put their differences aside to take on the menace is intriguing to watch.Many horror movies get by with excessive gore blood killings and campy acting.

	schema:reviewBody "The best part of this film comes with the opening credits when we hear Type O Negative's excellent rendition of the cheesy old Seals  Crofts song Summer Breeze.  Unfortunately the song soon ends and the movie starts.This film bears little resemblance to the book upon which it was based which is a shame because the book was really quite good.  The book was about four teens who strike a young boy with their car accidentally killing him. The boys' older brother tracks them down when one of the girls sends flowers to the funeral.  It was a story about taking responsibility for your actions and about the different and extreme ways that guilt and grief affect us all.  The movie version however scraps all that and gives us a hookhanded slasher who cannot be stopped and will not die.  It's Jason Voorhees on the beach.The teens are all flawlessly beautiful and perfectly onedimensional although Jennifer LoveHewitt does try to convey a severe case of guilty conscience and mostly succeeds.  The story quickly becomes ridiculous as crabs are stuffed into the trunk of a car and then inexplicably disappear I suppose if you were H. P. Lovecraft this might be considered scary and one girl is subjected to the spine tingling terror of a professional haircut while she sleeps!  Oh god the horror! The Fisherman wow what a terror inspiring nickname  next we'll have the Mailman or the Burger Chef I guess stalks silently through the film in his yellow rain slicker and floppy hat impaling people on his silver steel hook. And I didn't care about any of the victims.  Granted you're not really supposed to care much about the characters in a film like this but this is far from innovative stuff here there's just nothing to appreciate.  I was bored silly with this one. Give me Friday the 13th any day.".

	schema:reviewBody "I like to say something positive about every film I review so I will get that out of the way by saying that Jennifer Love Hewitt never looked better than she does here. The movie poster made her career along with the scene of her standing in the street and yelling after finding crabs in her trunk now if that isn't subliminal somehow.... The movie picks up when she starts walking around in that little lowcut blue top. If there is any reason to watch the film now it is to watch her fleeting moment of glory before she started putting on weight. She looks mighty fine.Overall this film is ruined by terrible acting and busy direction. We don't get just a scene of the actors walking along  no we first have to see a random fisherman carrying a humongous fish I guess to establish that yes those fishing boats in the background do indeed mean that this is a fishing village. Sloppiness abounds. As for the acting don't get me started. Sarah Michelle Gellar reads her lines like a prim schoolgirl reading cue cards with her perfect little pronunciations that sound like she is trying desperately for that A in elocution. Ryan Phillipe plays his character as if he wants us to throw darts at the movie screen. JLH is mousy one minute and hyperactive the next and Freddie Prinze Jr. shows he is the master at looking blank while everybody else is overacting. Everyone seems to be selfconscious in the extreme straining to create that little extra touch of suspense from random scenes that contain no suspense at all.As for the script I credit Kevin Williamson with creating characters so unlikeable that we begin rooting for the Gorton Fish Guy to finish them off quickly. They hit some poor schnook in the road and only get upset at what might happen to THEM. By the way they know the guy they hit wasn't dead because he moaned and opened his eyes  hello? Are we supposed to feel sympathy for people who don't lift a finger to help an innocent victim they hit and who as events overwhelmingly establish was not fatally hurt? This scene in particular was parodied nicely in Scary Movie but the whole film is ripe for that treatment.So much makes no sense. Ryan Phillipe goes around punching people at random really personifying the Ugly Teen paradigm that is the heart and soul of this film yet the remorseless killer charitably spares his life early in the film  why? Sarah Michelle Gellar lose the Marlon Brando biker hat! The Jennifer Love Hewitt character Little Miss KnowItAll they have a much better name for her in Scary Movie draws instant conclusions from nothing This is his weekend if he's going to do it he will do it now  huh?. The first teen killed I don't get that he had nothing to do with the incident at all and in fact kind of sees through the ugly teens' act why would the killer target him at all much less first? So much makes no sense. Meanwhile the teens walk around in their own little selfabsorbed dreamworld while everyone else is oblivious to everything. Um the world at large really isn't that clueless you know....It's difficult to like a film when you can't like the characters. Ugly teens  don't get me wrong they are pretty boys and girls just ugly in the sense of being utterly unlikeable selfabsorbed and arrogant  are a really shaky foundation on which to build a film. Williamson should have gone all the way and made it clearer they had it coming by giving some insight into the slasher's character and motives. As it is we are driven to try to empathize with characters we also are driven to despise. That internal contradiction ruins the film well unless you really do start rooting for the killer....A wildly overrated film that may please fans of the actors but probably not too many others. May also be good if you want to see arrogant little High School Gods and Goddesses get their comeuppance.".

Many of those people only like the first film and nothing else. While the first movie is my favorite film it's sequel is certainly worthy of the Crow title and upholds the mythology set by the first film.This movie could have been better than it was however. 14 of the movie was left on the cutting room floor. Alternate dialogue. Alternate endings. The very good fightdeath scene of Kali was actually a great scene beforehand. She doesn't die as soon as she is thrown out the window but there is some additionally dialogue that expands both her character and the character of Ashe.When a powerless Ashe falls from grace at the end of the film rather than Danny's ghost telling his father that if you stop now we can never be together Danny tells Ashe that it's time to go but Ashe refuses because he can't leave Sarah to die. With that Danny turns his back on his father and we don't see him for the rest of the film. This scene solifies Ashe's internal conflict in a very tragic heartbreaking manor.What internal conflict you ask? Ashe was torn on whether or not he should complete his mission and join his son in the afterlife or stay with Sarah in the world of the living. You weren't aware of this in the film? It was really only hinted at in the current version. So it all ends happily right? Ashe Sarah and Danny are cross into the land of the dead and we have one big happy family right? Wrong. In the original version Ashe doesn't go back because his crow is too...well dead to carry his soul back to the land of the dead. So he is forced to walk the earth separated from those he really loves.COA was originally a more depressing take on the themes of the first film. There was less similarity in story. Saldy many scenes were cut for no reason and the ending was changed to make the film more hollywood. What could have been a great film with a great story turned out to be a visually impressive film with vague bits and pieces of a story. It didn't have the deep emotional story of the first because it didn't try to. It was a rather depressing drama of a hero who succeeds and fails at the same time. A different take on the Crow.But the complaints of the story being too similar does ring true here. Mostly because the stuff that made it different was cut. The makers were probably afraid of fan backlash. Ironic huh? Vincent Perez was AWESOME as Ashe. I like Brandon Lee better but Perez manages to give a good performance of a man who contemplates what exactly to do with the second chance he's been given. He also has the insanity thing going well for him. He's different from Brandon LeeEric Draven. Standouts from the supporting cast are Iggy Pop and Thomas Jane. Jane's strip club scene was hilarious and Iggy gives a badly written role more energy than it deserved. His scenes with Vincent were great.There were downsides besides the ones I just mentioned. The movie lacked the good action sequences of the first film. There were a few stand outs but that's it. I was displeased that they never showed Ashe's wounds heal up. The final confrontation between Ashe and Judah should've been longer. The CGI in the movie was terrible. Judah should have been savagely picked apart when he was attacked by the crows not disappear into nothing. The girl who played Sarah could get extremely annoying at times and the early scenes that focus on her are quite boring. It takes a bit too long for Ashe to get painted up and start on his mission. Why some of the crap scenes were left in and some of the good parts were cut out is a mystery.Oh and for those who complain about this movie disrespecting Brandon Lee how do you figure that? Really I'd like to know. I've heard that this movie was done for money...all movies are done for money. Yes even the first Crow.All in all COA does have serious problems and an annoying plothole or two but it is far from one of the worst movies ever. See it if you liked the first film and you're looking for an alternative story with the same themes.Current Version6 If the original footage was left intact8.5 or 9".

	schema:headline " Though Hated by Fans This Film is a Compelling and Unique Take on the Crow Legend";
	schema:reviewBody "The first Crow film was a brilliant and Gothic revisioning of a graphic Novel. Eric Draven was played by Brandon Lee who notoriously died during the making of the film. But even though he died his work as the main protagonist was very memorable and chilling and yet sympathetic and beautiful. It would be hard to top something like his performance. This sequel to THE CROW entitled THE CROW CITY OF ANGELS takes place in a warped version of L.A. Death and filth litter the streets and the whole city is cast in an ugly and disturbing color of grotesque characters and dust. The lighting to this film is ugly and dark not unlike CITY OF LOST CHILDREN or NOSFORATU only more natural feeling. The main character of this film automatically achieves a more personal edge to why he would murder thugs because instead of his girlfriend being raped and murdered like in the first one this time it is his son. So the loss of an innocent soul feels more justified by murder of the people who did it. Ashe is pulled out from a watery grave as a walking corpse sent to avenge his son. Unfortunitely there is indeed more to this than what seemed possible because the drug lord Judah has a connection to voodoo powers that could possibly disarm Ashe in his fight to avenge his own flesh and blood. Judah has connections to other worldly forces via a blind woman who he has used to gain power of the city. This film employs negative energy very well and the films setting feels lifeless. This way the film allows us to feel more sorry for the people who live in it by giving us no limits of which the depravity can go. The musical score while it is true it is not as effective as the first one casts just the right amount of a somber spirit and hopelessness. This film is excessively gross and violent but doesn't become a distraction since the whole city is full of gross and violent tone. Fans of the Crow hated this film and I can see why. But I felt that this film's lifelessness worked well due to the constant feeling of depression and hate. Vincent Perez plays Ashe with the perfect amount of sympathy and the viewer can feel sorry for him. However we cannot be scared of him because all of the barely human characters that surround him and much more frightening. When he kills his prey we are delighted and happy that he got his revenge. The first film was a good combination of extremely violent content and gore mixed with morals and feeling. Nobody in this film has much emotion and feeling except for Ashe who truly has more than enough. He is shown as a victim and continues to be a victim throughout because the city is so full of them. He cannot gain anything and he is understandably sad. When it comes right down to it its hard to really compare the two films because the first film is so perfect and so beautiful and the second film when compared to the first feels so flawed and ugly. It is really all up to the viewer to decide. I thought this sequel was great and would gladly watch it again. I'd say anyone interested in the set design process of film making should definitely watch this along with the first film.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first Crow film was a brilliant and Gothic revisioning of a graphic Novel. Eric Draven was played by Brandon Lee who notoriously died during the making of the film. But even though he died his work as the main protagonist was very memorable and chilling and yet sympathetic and beautiful. It would be hard to top something like his performance. This sequel to THE CROW entitled THE CROW CITY OF ANGELS takes place in a warped version of L.A. Death and filth litter the streets and the whole city is cast in an ugly and disturbing color of grotesque characters and dust. The lighting to this film is ugly and dark not unlike CITY OF LOST CHILDREN or NOSFORATU only more natural feeling. The main character of this film automatically achieves a more personal edge to why he would murder thugs because instead of his girlfriend being raped and murdered like in the first one this time it is his son. So the loss of an innocent soul feels more justified by murder of the people who did it. Ashe is pulled out from a watery grave as a walking corpse sent to avenge his son. Unfortunitely there is indeed more to this than what seemed possible because the drug lord Judah has a connection to voodoo powers that could possibly disarm Ashe in his fight to avenge his own flesh and blood. Judah has connections to other worldly forces via a blind woman who he has used to gain power of the city. This film employs negative energy very well and the films setting feels lifeless. This way the film allows us to feel more sorry for the people who live in it by giving us no limits of which the depravity can go. The musical score while it is true it is not as effective as the first one casts just the right amount of a somber spirit and hopelessness. This film is excessively gross and violent but doesn't become a distraction since the whole city is full of gross and violent tone. Fans of the Crow hated this film and I can see why. But I felt that this film's lifelessness worked well due to the constant feeling of depression and hate. Vincent Perez plays Ashe with the perfect amount of sympathy and the viewer can feel sorry for him. However we cannot be scared of him because all of the barely human characters that surround him and much more frightening. When he kills his prey we are delighted and happy that he got his revenge.

Now a sequel was probably inevitable and I remember being largely disappointed by it with its wearily cutup story dour performances and diluted action. Well nothing has changed the second time around. Again I can't knock that killer hardrock  industrial sounding soundtrack haunting score and the dark Gothic embellishment creating an atmospherically catastrophe postapocalyptic Los Angeles. It's dirty smoggy and jarringly bleak. Jean Yves Escoffier's cinematography lenses it with the right freespirited. However there's nothing overly memorable or even powerfully gripping to draw any real emotion and interest form the suffocatingly drab and unimaginative narrative. By following the same patterns of the original's tragedy it doesn't lay any new groundwork. It was a tediously repetitive mess that seemed more fantasybased and conjures up a script that's weakly penned. Vincent Perez's avenging soul is unconvincingly void in a tortured performance which doesn't create much heartache or grace. There's no imprint or witty charisma that Lee evoked. Honestly I didn't feel anything. Richard Brooks flimsily strolls by with no impressionable stance as the head villain. Mia Kirshner gives a sound performance and Iggy Pop delightfully chews up the scenery to spit it out. Director Tim Pope can formulate some flourishing visuals and lasting poses but when it came to setting everything in motion. Flat and unexciting comes to mind. His action setpieces lacked zest and seemed to plod like they're sliced up music video clips. Never did it infuse any real sense of energy thrills and urgency. In the end it feels just like a cheap quick and empty rehash.".

The film is just downright sloppy and very unnecessary given the plot of the first film and how it didn't warrant a sequel in ANY way but you know Hollywood if one film makes a profit they need to try and repeat that film's formula and cash in again.This movie was a lowbudget film roughly 18 million in total cost which doesn't say anything about the quality because Alex Proyas with a simple 15 million managed to make the first film one of the most visually captivating comicbased films of all time. But what the disadvantage this film does have is that director Tim Pope has nowhere near the talent of Proyas. In fact 95 of this film's visual style is a carbon copy of the original film only now most of the city is lit by bright YELLOW lights and it happens to be situated beside the ocean. Other than this the style of this film is a ripoff and being a ripoff fails to captivate the mind of the audience in the same way as the first film.Not to rip on Vincent Perez but his performance as the new Crow was downright despicable a pale heartless imitation of Brandon Lee's critically acclaimed character in the first film. This is probably more the fault of the director and scriptwriters but regardless this comes across more as a perversion of Brandon Lee than of a new character picking up the mantle of the Gothic antihero.The script is one of the cheesiest you'll ever see. There is literally a point where the villain kills and drinks the blood of the crow and then gets the strength of the Crow. This makes absolutely no sense and in no way reflects ANY of the mythos in either the first film or the comic series.The Crow is just too simple of a story to be made into an effective franchise because the formula runs like so guy and loved one are brutally murdered guy kills dudes who murdered him and said loved one leaving a crow emblem at the crime scene then when he's done he dies and joins loved one in afterlife. This is all The Crow is. It was good for one movie but it just cannot be turned into a franchise.Keep in mind I was half asleep when this movie was on TV and even then the time of day when I'm most acceptable of bad movies I still managed to hate this movie with a passion and not because I was a fan of the original or because I had read bad buzz surrounding the movie I hadn't even HEARD of it before that fateful night and for good reason!  but because I honestly and truly could not stand ANY aspect of this film.If you enjoyed the first film and the James O'Barr comic book don't do as I did do the smart thing.

The laws that state all sequels must be inferior to their predecessors are faithfully obeyed here and the result is a rather mundane and disappointing motion picture that flat lines the whole franchise. Here Vincent Perez badly miscast gives a weak performance as the doting single father returning from his watery grave to wreak bloody vengeance upon the gang who killed him and his son. He is aided in his quest by Sarah a doeeyed tattoo artist who fans of the series will note is actually the little girl who was befriended by the central character in the original movie. The film manages to be watchable the apocalyptic cityscapes work quite well however a maker of music videos directs CROW  CITY OF ANGELS and it shows in every frame. The film totally lacks the edge of raw emotion and inner pain that made the original movie so effective. All you are left with in the end is a gothic reworking of the DEATH WISH movies with nothing to redeem it once you get tired of the garish purple yellow and green colour schemes. The main merit of this poor film is the raw performance of legendary rocker Iggy Pop as a cocainesnorting villain. My rating  5 out of 10.".

The laws that state all sequels must be inferior to their predecessors are faithfully obeyed here and the result is a rather mundane and disappointing motion picture that flat lines the whole franchise. Here Vincent Perez badly miscast gives a weak performance as the doting single father returning from his watery grave to wreak bloody vengeance upon the gang who killed him and his son. He is aided in his quest by Sarah a doeeyed tattoo artist who fans of the series will note is actually the little girl who was befriended by the central character in the original movie. The film manages to be watchable the apocalyptic cityscapes work quite well however a maker of music videos directs CROW  CITY OF ANGELS and it shows in every frame. The film totally lacks the edge of raw emotion and inner pain that made the original movie so effective. All you are left with in the end is a gothic reworking of the DEATH WISH movies with nothing to redeem it once you get tired of the garish purple yellow and green colour schemes. The main merit of this poor film is the raw performance of legendary rocker Iggy Pop as a cocainesnorting villain. My rating  5 out of 10.";

Ash perez is wonderful as the main character not letting you forget for a moment what drives him in his revenge. But what amazed me most is that as Ash goes through his victims one by one his ways of dealing with them is not just fearsome but...beautiful.

	schema:headline " I always loved this film. Give a chance.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a longtime fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film The Crow City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place a different man and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them.First off there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy postapocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple watered down versions of this story. In The Crow City of Angels Ashe Corven Vincent Perez and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying.The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Prepunisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo the energetic and comical bad guy Spidermonkey Iggy Pop as Curve along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as Tbird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve Iggy Pop. Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected.I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crowlike movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them.What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography lighting coloration production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized strikingly visual and mesmerizing.My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.".

The original Crow was geared more towards the action the vengeance and the intensity of the unfolding story of Eric Draven's revenge. Brandon Lee was very much an action star who had quite a legacy given to him from his father. He was the perfect candidate for a film like the Crow because they wanted to blow people away with the theatrics of it all. City of Angles does just the opposite. Vincent Perez is a silky smooth romancer not an action hero just look at the guy he has an innocence about him that institutes sympathy for his character while Lee being very much an opposite is a hard edged man with a mission that gets your adrenaline going as you cheer on his character. Also the whole look and feel of the film is very different from the first. The Crow was very dark and shadowy it had a sort of cool as in temperature feel to it like the scene where Eric saves Sarah from the car and they talk on the curb for a bit you could almost feel the coldness of the environment the film portrayed beauty through a realistic and stark cold darkness. The Crow City of Angels was lighter and more mesmerizing and dreamlike. The environment feels like something from an elaborate dream and that's a huge reason why this film does not fail because its atmosphere is very captivating. It's warm and refreshing. This feel goes great with the second film because it's more of a romantic style while the first film was more of an actionvengeance movie which is why it's so awesome.City of Angels is an atmospheric movie rather than a thriller that adds a new flavor to the Crow series by using the same base with a different formula.The only way to really enjoy this film is to watch it with an absolutely open mind free of any wandering memory of the original film. Vincent Perez is not Brandon Lee Los Angeles is not Detroit Sarah is all grown up now Tim Pope is not Alex Proyas A son is not a fianc' and The Crow City of Angels is not a sequel it's a new chapter in the life of a series.The Crow and The Crow City of Angels are two branches from the same tree they may look similar they may act similar but at heart they are two separate things.".

The film is not a sequel as it has totally new story and characters and only similarity to Alex Proyas' original seems to be the revenging dead guided by a crow. This time Ashe Vincent Perez and his son are killed by some hooligans and their sick leader and soon Ashe comes back to life with a crow guiding him. He meets a beautiful girl Sarah Mia Kirshner and most likely falls in love with her. He starts to kill the guys who killed him and his son and he does it with skill as always. The film is set in some hellish netherworld where evil is everywhere and also the criminals who killed our hero are very bad and evil if not too believable all the time.The atmosphere of the film is occasionally pretty impressing and the presence of evil and feeling of depravity is powerful. Mia Kirshner's character brings some positivism to the story and she is among the few positive characters in this film. There are couple of great visuals and styles like fast editing and impressive cinematography techniques and there is also dust and colorful smoke everywhere. These create great atmosphere for the film and that's almost all this film managed to give me.The bad guys are bad and one is played by Iggy Pop. They should have been little more believable as now they become little irritating and stupid as usually in these movies. Also it would've been nice if the film had had some spirit and message under its surface now it's just empty revenge story without any point.The film is also often little slow moving and even boring. In fact I felt myself almost uncomfortable during the last scene at the street when nothing seemed to happen or happen logically or satisfyingly. The film has too many easy conclusions and that makes the demanding viewer feel stupid and willing to stop the viewing. It is great that there are still those visual elements and angel like Mia that keep the film together and made it possible to watch without falling asleep.The tone of the film is pretty depressing as this tries to be as rough and violent as possible but still I think the first film is far more impressive. Crow 2 is also dark dirty and gritty but not as rough experience as all the adverts said on the DVD cover not that I believed them but still. However I found these mentioned merits from this film and so give this 410 and recommend mostly for fans of exploitationtrashhorror cinema in other words for those who have used to seeing not so great movies and movies that most people cannot even sit through. There are also many great bands in the soundtrack of the film.".

Then I got older and realized a few things.It's not as good as the first one. But what sequel is? And let's face it the title will always make us think of Brandon Lee.The biggest complaint about the movie seems to be Vincent Perez can not replace Brandon Lee. It's true. He can't. No one can. The thing you absolutely have to keep in mind is he is not supposed to replace him. He plays a completely different character in a very different storyline. There are similarities of course but the story is different.MILD SPOILERS AHEADVincent Perez in his American debut plays Ashe Corven a man who along with his young son is in exactly the wrong place at exactly the wrong time witnessing a brutal murder. As the only witnesses they are silenced by the killers with Ashe begging them to spare his son the entire time.Sarah the young girl from the first movie played by Mia Kirshner is now an adult living in Los Angeles. She recalls vividly what happened years ago in Detroit and doesn't think it will ever happen again. That is until a crow shows up at her apartment to lead her to Ashe who has arisen and will need her help.The two form a bond and she tells him why he was brought back to avenge the deaths of himself and his son Danny along with all the others that have been killed by the gang who killed them.Things get complicated however when an attraction begins to form. Once Ashe's mission is complete he will be sent back to the land of the dead. And he will never rest or be reunited with Danny until it has been done.It gets even more complicated when Sarah is targeted by the same gang for helping Ashe.Despite the bad reviews the cast gives a worthy performance. Perez brings Ashe's emotions to life in a way that many could not. He also did most of his own stunts which give the scenes a more realistic look. It makes one wonder why exactly he has not become a popular actor in the U.S.A.Mia Kirshner plays a believable version of Sarah. Not the same as her predecessor obviously as the character has changed with the years.All in all if you can remember that Ashe Croven and Eric Draven are two different characters you can enjoy this movie very much. If not well then you will probably be among those who are not overly fond of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "CALLAS FOREVER is a beautifully written tenderly directed and acted tribute to the immortal Maria Callas by a man who knew her as well as anyone  Franco Zeffirelli. The fantasy of placing Callas on film for posterity in the last year of her life the year she died of heart failure when her voice was gone but her artistry remained is the means by which Zeffirelli memorializes the Diva and in every way he succeeds.The year is 1977 and Maria Callas Fanny Ardant is in seclusion in her Paris apartment grieving over 1 her beloved Aristotle Onassis who left her for Jacqueline Kennedy and then died and 2 her disastrous farewell concert in Japan which ended her magnificent career with a flop. No longer able to sing she lives in the past listing to her old recordings and taking pills. Only her constant maid Bruna Anna Lelio is allowed to comfort her with occasional visits from her warmhearted publicist Sarah Keller Joan Plowright.In Paris for the promotion of a punk group Bad Dreams is Larry Kelley Jeremy Irons who has just met and bedded a young artist Michael Jay Rodan Kelley had been Callas' agent in her heyday and Michael has been creating paintings inspired by her recordings. Seeing Michael's obsession over Callas whom he has never seen perform forces Kelley to visit Callas their devotion to each other is 'rekindled' and Kelley proposes a film version of Callas not only to bring her out of her depression but to capitalize on the fact that present and future generations should have a filmed account of the penultimate opera singer of the 20th century.Callas is recalcitrant at first not wanting to produce a fraudulent film made using her old recordings dubbed onto the sound track of a current staging but she finally resolves her hesitancy by granting the filming of 'Carmen' a role she recorded but never played on the stage. Thus the project is launched and Callas is revitalized and happy again being satisfied with the miracle of technology that allows her to invest her energies in the acting of Carmen while consenting to lipsynch to her old recordings. She even has a say in the casting of the other roles especially Don Jose  Marco a very hunky Gabriel Garko a former model and Mr. Italy!. She retains her temper tantrums and demands for perfection that hallmarked her real career doing her own dancing having a say about costumes etc.The film is eventually finished and the result is magnificent. There is even some intrigue when Marco shows more than a little interest in her a hint of the Strauss MarshallinOctavian encounter. But alas at the end of the film Callas is forced to admit that her youth cannot be regained and decides the film is a 'fraudulent work' is not compatible with her life's devotion to truth in music. She asks Kelley to destroy it. How these two come to grips with their individual lives Kelley's Michael has left him and he is once again as alone as Callas is finessed by one of the most tender endings on film.Fanny Ardant is a miracle as Callas she inhabits her physically understands Callas' facial features as she lipsynchs her operas and seems to be a reincarnation of the Diva. Jeremy Irons gives one of the finest performances of his rich career as the aging gay agent and Joan Plowright adds just the right amount of lightness and grace as Sarah Keller  wise acerbic yet supportive of both Callas and Kelley.

	onyx:emotionText "CALLAS FOREVER is a beautifully written tenderly directed and acted tribute to the immortal Maria Callas by a man who knew her as well as anyone  Franco Zeffirelli. The fantasy of placing Callas on film for posterity in the last year of her life the year she died of heart failure when her voice was gone but her artistry remained is the means by which Zeffirelli memorializes the Diva and in every way he succeeds.The year is 1977 and Maria Callas Fanny Ardant is in seclusion in her Paris apartment grieving over 1 her beloved Aristotle Onassis who left her for Jacqueline Kennedy and then died and 2 her disastrous farewell concert in Japan which ended her magnificent career with a flop. No longer able to sing she lives in the past listing to her old recordings and taking pills. Only her constant maid Bruna Anna Lelio is allowed to comfort her with occasional visits from her warmhearted publicist Sarah Keller Joan Plowright.In Paris for the promotion of a punk group Bad Dreams is Larry Kelley Jeremy Irons who has just met and bedded a young artist Michael Jay Rodan Kelley had been Callas' agent in her heyday and Michael has been creating paintings inspired by her recordings. Seeing Michael's obsession over Callas whom he has never seen perform forces Kelley to visit Callas their devotion to each other is 'rekindled' and Kelley proposes a film version of Callas not only to bring her out of her depression but to capitalize on the fact that present and future generations should have a filmed account of the penultimate opera singer of the 20th century.Callas is recalcitrant at first not wanting to produce a fraudulent film made using her old recordings dubbed onto the sound track of a current staging but she finally resolves her hesitancy by granting the filming of 'Carmen' a role she recorded but never played on the stage. Thus the project is launched and Callas is revitalized and happy again being satisfied with the miracle of technology that allows her to invest her energies in the acting of Carmen while consenting to lipsynch to her old recordings. She even has a say in the casting of the other roles especially Don Jose  Marco a very hunky Gabriel Garko a former model and Mr. Italy!. She retains her temper tantrums and demands for perfection that hallmarked her real career doing her own dancing having a say about costumes etc.The film is eventually finished and the result is magnificent. There is even some intrigue when Marco shows more than a little interest in her a hint of the Strauss MarshallinOctavian encounter. But alas at the end of the film Callas is forced to admit that her youth cannot be regained and decides the film is a 'fraudulent work' is not compatible with her life's devotion to truth in music. She asks Kelley to destroy it. How these two come to grips with their individual lives Kelley's Michael has left him and he is once again as alone as Callas is finessed by one of the most tender endings on film.Fanny Ardant is a miracle as Callas she inhabits her physically understands Callas' facial features as she lipsynchs her operas and seems to be a reincarnation of the Diva. Jeremy Irons gives one of the finest performances of his rich career as the aging gay agent and Joan Plowright adds just the right amount of lightness and grace as Sarah Keller  wise acerbic yet supportive of both Callas and Kelley. The scenes of Paris are correctly nostalgic the sets for 'Carmen' by Carlo Centolavigna create a gold standard for all future true productions of 'Carmen'. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.Zeffirelli has succeeded in giving us a memorial to Maria Callas and for that the opera world will be forever grateful. The passages of the many arias used in this film are among the finest versions Callas recorded. Everything about this work is brilliant and it deserves the widest audience possible. Grady Harp";

The director Franco Zeffirelli based much of it on his own 25year friendship with the lady herself. Still this is anything but a straightforward biopic.

A tragic cross between Garbo and Norma Desmond she spends her life popping pills fighting off bad dreams and listening to recordings of her voice at its glorious peak.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is very beautiful. It's plot is essentially a fantasy by Zeffirelli revolving around the idea of Callas starring in a film production of Bizet's Carmen at a time when her life was drawing to it's close and her magnificent voice had been reduced to a painful echo of it's former glory. This setup is completely imaginary  Zeffirelli of course being intimate with Callas having worked with her on a number of productions  and although Callas is at the focal point of the story one can safely assume that this movie is as much about Zeffirelli himself as it is about the great diva. The film's main characters  the aging artist the agent the film critic  are mainly used to explore themes familiar to those living the life of artistic creation the fading of creative powers the meaning of integrity in art the influence of money and publicity love and the beauty of youth. This is Zeffireli speaking here making use of one of the most expressive voices ever heard to express feelings of his own.It is is better not to approach this movie guided by expectations of absorbing revealing biographical elements. Though Ardant convincingly depicts the arrogance and overbearing personality which were often present in Callas' behaviour  with a few very convincing tantrums thrown in  there is a sentimentality projected that is more of a wishful thinking than factual characterization one can hardly imagine Callas enjoying herself in an impromptu picnic in a park surrounding herself with nothing but carefree informality.  But the movie is very strong on most aspects the directing is fabulous both in it's pace and in it's settings and the acting  Jeremy Irons in particular  is truly exceptional. And then it's the music  wonderful singing from Callas' voice coupled with scenes from a very spirited production of Carmen where Ardant gives a convincing performance in a very demanding part. For some people the movie will prove somewhat unsatisfying the more so if one focuses exclusively on Callas at the cost of ignoring other nuances and ideas and the sheer pleasure of listening to the music and singing. But it is definitely recommended to watch and for opera lovers it is a must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "By 1977 as the movie begins Maria C. had become very much an icon so the movie's emphasis on her large gay following is defensible I suppose though Jeremy Irons' paramour is simply too goodlooking for the part. There was a film called Beethoven's Nephew a few years ago with a similar issue. Serious problem arise with casting attractive males in movies when they really have no qualities apart from their looks. The Jeremy Irons character is a promoter who comes up with a thoroughly whackedout idea for making money off the diva in what would turn out to be the last year of her life. He talks her into it  restaging Carmen for a movie and having her lipsync to a tape made 20 years before  and what we see produced is certainly knockdown gorgeous Zefferelli directed this after all but still it is an absurd humiliation for the woman. Fortunately she comes to her senses at the end and gets the film quashed. All this really happened incidentally. But the whole experience saves her life in a sense bringing her out of wasted years of drugs and a curtained existence in an elegant Paris apartment to an acceptance of her age and an understanding of her place in high musical culture. Fanny Ardant doesn't really look like Callas in the movie though in the promotional stills she seems to. She can certainly act though and makes an archetypal largerthanlife woman believable and thoroughly sympathetic. Joan Plowright is miscast but the movie is strong enough to bury the memory of her part. There are scenes involving a board of directors that are just peculiar apparently there is a parallel universe out there where corporate boards meet at the top of tall buildings to talk about the investment opportunities of aging opera stars. Fortunately those sequences are brief.Some very nice touches appear having to do with Aristotle Onassis who arguably destroyed the greatest opera singer in the 20th century then dumped her. Coming to understand the depth of that betrayal is a painful undercurrent for Callas in the film. For me one of the most intriguing scenes has to do with a handful of master classes Callas gave in New York at the very end of her life. I don't remember why but I had a recording of some of them several years ago lost now alas. They were notable mainly for the uncanny perfection of Callas's examples when she would sing bits of arias for the students following some young voice's painful attempt at the same piece. In one of the class's recreations in the film while very brief Callasasteacher rises to the kind of intellectual and emotional profundity that oneinamillion teachers ever achieve. I was simply knocked out. Fanny Ardant does her very best work here and the sequence is the emotional highpoint of the film. I had tears in my eyes during the scene something that usually nothing less than a hobbit will inspire in me. The very end of the film is moving and utterly satisfying  bittersweet tragic beautiful more Puccini than Verdi.".

I can't imagine Maria Callas in the 1970's even considering doing what the film suggests. By 1965 it was painfully obvious that Callas despite her glamorous image and appearance could never even at age 41 have reconstructed her once fabulous voice a voice which in its prime could accomplish miracles. In any case it is folly to suggest that Callas would have elected to do a film version of Carmen  a role she never cared for with a dubbed recording she had made years earlier. I could see Norma Tosca or Traviata but never Carmen. Larry Kelly actually died several years before Callas so his presence here is pure fiction  which is what the film actually is. As a way to pass 108 minutes the film is adequate but if you're looking for a documentation of Maria Callas in her final years you will have to keep looking.

	schema:headline " A truly great movie without a general release";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never been much interested in Zeffirelli as a film director. Of his 22 directing credits I have only seen four others 3 of Shakespeare and 1 film of an opera based on Shakespeare. But he has come through with a great one here. It has a 2002 date but is just now getting a limited release in the U.S. Zeffirelli directs his own story and screenplay of a fictional account involving opera legend Maria Callas sort of a whatmighthavebeen scenario based on his memories of his long professional association and personal friendship with Callas. The story takes place in 1977. Jeremy Irons plays a music promoter who is based loosely on Zeffirelli himself. When he flies into Rome his job is managing PR for a heavy metal rock band. He tries to get in to see his old friend Callas but she has barricaded herself inside her apartment being a long time in grief over the loss of her singing voice and the loss of Aristotle Onassis. Irons finally does talk to her and convinces her to take part in a comeback of sorts. Callas had recorded Bizet's Carmen but never performed it on stage. She agrees to appear in a film of Carmen where she will lipsync to her older recording. This sets up a number of professional personal and ethical minefields for all involved. In the person of the great French actress Fanny Ardant we see all of the diva's depth of emotion her temperament her grief and her great talent. Callas was the whole package her voice was an astounding musical instrument but she was also a consummate stage actress who could deliver a powerful characterization with both her body and her voice  her singing was much more than just technical skill. Ardant embodies this temperamental talent to the max. Irons does his best work in years. In a parallel construction as Callas' life begins to come together again Irons' life falls into crisis as he struggles to save his career and his new relationship with a handsome young artist. The film features a lot of Callas' music often in quite long excerpts which is beautiful and devastating. More importantly we get to see several long scenes from Carmen  the movie within the movie  and it looks wonderful. I really really want to see that movie! I went to this at a local art house on Stupor Bowl Sunday afternoon. They had booked it into their smallest auditorium and were only running three shows that day. The house was packed! My Lovely Wife and I showed up  as we thought  a little early but had to sit apart. A friend went the next Wednesday night and it was packed again  Wednesday night! At my showing as well as my friend's nobody left when the closing credits ran Callas singing Casta Diva there was tremendous applause and at the Wednesday night showing my friend heard several gasps of astonishment. A week later I am still all goosepimply from the thought of the experience. See it. You won't regret it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have never been much interested in Zeffirelli as a film director. Of his 22 directing credits I have only seen four others 3 of Shakespeare and 1 film of an opera based on Shakespeare. But he has come through with a great one here. It has a 2002 date but is just now getting a limited release in the U.S. Zeffirelli directs his own story and screenplay of a fictional account involving opera legend Maria Callas sort of a whatmighthavebeen scenario based on his memories of his long professional association and personal friendship with Callas. The story takes place in 1977. Jeremy Irons plays a music promoter who is based loosely on Zeffirelli himself. When he flies into Rome his job is managing PR for a heavy metal rock band. He tries to get in to see his old friend Callas but she has barricaded herself inside her apartment being a long time in grief over the loss of her singing voice and the loss of Aristotle Onassis. Irons finally does talk to her and convinces her to take part in a comeback of sorts. Callas had recorded Bizet's Carmen but never performed it on stage. She agrees to appear in a film of Carmen where she will lipsync to her older recording. This sets up a number of professional personal and ethical minefields for all involved. In the person of the great French actress Fanny Ardant we see all of the diva's depth of emotion her temperament her grief and her great talent.

	schema:headline " Diva Fantasy Salvaged by Real Opera Production and an Inspired Ardant";
	schema:reviewBody "Gallic actress Fanny Ardant is an inspired choice to play Maria Callas and with her uncanny physical and likely temperamental resemblance she plays the legendary soprano with real brio and scenerychewing style. I would not have expected anything less in such a fanciful telling of a whatif scenario that sprouted out of director Franco Zeffirelli's fertile imagination. Zeffirelli is no stranger to the extravagant and visually resplendent as he helmed the Burtonsatplay 1967 The Taming of the Shrew and the muchbeloved ageappropriate 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet. His longtime professional relationship with Callas provides the basis for this fantasy where in 1977 she is drawn out of selfimposed exile and into the limelight one last time by a fictitious concert promoter Larry Kelly who had long ago decided to forego opera for the more lucrative world of punk rock. Sporting a silly ponytail Jeremy Irons portrays Kelly as a predictably irascible character who mercurially worships and degrades her as the circumstance dictates a variation on the character he would play in Being Julia. This time his character is gay of course probably to avoid any element of romance that would detract from Callas' obsession with preserving her legacy.Kelly's idea is to film her while acting out famous operatic roles on a sound stage and lipsynching the words whereupon sound engineers would graft her recordings of some 22 years earlier onto the sound track. The series is to be called Callas Forever and starts with Bizet's Carmen. After a rapid series of contrived scenes that resuscitate Callas from her Paris apartment seclusion back to international press attention the film finally catches fire with the scenes that create the opera production itself. This is where Zeffirelli really shines as he makes Ardant look and act strikingly like Callas at her most passionate and charismatic. She is of course adored by her colleagues in particular an admiring young tenor playing Don Jose as embodied by Gabriel Garko and seems on the brink of a renaissance. Alas it is the completion of this production that inspires Zeffirelli along with cowriter Martin Sherman to take the plot to the height of soap opera banality. Basking in her newly reborn confidence Callas wants to take on Puccini's Tosca with her real voice an idea supported blindly by Kelly but rejected by her backers. Instead of being crushed she seems resigned to her legacy and insists that her Carmen be destroyed as she deems it a fraud.That she comes to this realization after the fact is one of the central conceits of the film since it implies she has been cavalier about the efforts around her who did believe in her but I suppose that is what diva behavior is all about. After all at the beginning Callas is portrayed as a pillpopper who feels sorry for herself as a hasbeen her voice shot during an infamous tour in Japan and as the rejected paramour of Aristotle Onassis who cast her aside to marry Jackie Kennedy. Throughout the movie she is haunted by her former voice with ghostly visions of her stage triumphs. These kinds of excesses seem appropriate to this kind of tribute film but it all feels so predictably overthetop. Sadly Joan Plowright stereotypically plays a music journalist as a wisecracking truthbearing confidante that Thelma Ritter would have played with greater aplomb in the fifties. There is a persistent clunkiness to Zeffirelli and Sherman's screenplay and an overall lack of subtlety that can only be blamed on Zeffirelli's heavily ornate Baroque filmmaking style. The DVD is short on extras as there is no audio commentary track but it does include a brief makingof featurette additional interview excerpts with Zeffirelli and the principal players and several trailers including the one for the movie.".

I went into the theater knowing only the title the two lead actors and that it had something to do with South America. Two hours later I was a puddle of tears both from the subject matter and from the knowledge that I had just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece. It is perhaps the most intelligently spiritual film I've ever seen. The cinematography is gorgeous throughout the settings are stunning the acting is topnotch across the board the musical score is breathtaking and the screenplay is brilliantly eloquent. Roland Joff did a fantastic job directing The Killing Fields but this one is even better. I just watched it again on DVD and nearly 25 years later the film has not aged or lost any of its power. Still one of the greatest and most underrated films of all time.".

I went into the theater knowing only the title the two lead actors and that it had something to do with South America. Two hours later I was a puddle of tears both from the subject matter and from the knowledge that I had just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece. It is perhaps the most intelligently spiritual film I've ever seen. The cinematography is gorgeous throughout the settings are stunning the acting is topnotch across the board the musical score is breathtaking and the screenplay is brilliantly eloquent. Roland Joff did a fantastic job directing The Killing Fields but this one is even better. I just watched it again on DVD and nearly 25 years later the film has not aged or lost any of its power. Still one of the greatest and most underrated films of all time.";

	schema:reviewBody "After hearing a quick clip from the soundtrack recently I decided to have another look at 'The Mission' which I hadn't seen for more than ten years. Interesting viewing in these days when epics abound Lord of the Rings Gladiator Troy etc.The first thing that struck me was the intelligence of the script which often seems an afterthought in today's big budget jobs. Robert Bolt weaves an intriguing web of characters mercenary slavetrader starcrossed lover papal emissary and man of faith. The passion of Robert de Niro's Mendoza beautifully contrasts the quiet firm conviction of Jeremy Irons' Gabriel. And the moral dilemma facing the Catholic Church whether to abandon influence abroad for the sake of power at home is ably brought to life in the tortured mind of Ray McAnally's Altamirano. This man sent from Rome by the Pope himself has the power of life and death over the Guarani Indians and the Jesuit priests who have dedicated their lives to Christian service in the deepest regions of the South American rainforest.The film isn't perfect by any means I would have liked better representation of at least one Guarani character but the integrity of Joffe's direction and Chris Menges' spectacular camerawork make this one film you have to see. And there's that lovely soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.We may be more sophisticated these days in terms of technology sound engineering and special effects but the lesson from 'The Mission' for today's directors has to be it's the story stupid.".

Its theme is as relevant today as it was in the 1600s  what are  the consequences of my actions and what price must be paid by me and by others as a result?  The film depicts several characters with whose choices the viewer can identify  the missionary the repentant killer the papal legate  and gives no easy answers to the choices that confront them.  But the fact that there are no easy answers doesn't let them off the hook.  In the end they all have to take responsibility for what they do or fail to do.The magnificent visuals of the Iguassu Falls and the moving score by Morricone surely his best all contribute to an unforgettable picture.".

I don't have any idea where to begin checking off the pro's  cinematography? stupendous acting? heartbreaking subject matter? moving soundtrack?  I don't think it's possible to do that with The Mission  one needs to absorb it as a whole.  An entire masterpiece.I was one of the fortunate ones to see this movie in a theatre back in the 80's  we were visiting friends in another city and for lack of anything better to do that evening decided to see this film. To say I was moved would be such an understatement as to be ridiculous. It is the saddest commentary on what horrors have been perpetrated in the name of God....I have seen this movie several times since then and own it now but I am always very careful whom I see it with and when I see it.  You need to have a block of time set aside when you can completely immerse yourself in this film. Unplug the phone put the kids to bed make sure the dog doesn't have to go out. If you don't pay attention  from the very beginning to right after the credits  you will miss something important.  Prepare yourself emotionally for The Mission. Step into it live it let it speak to you. Feel the struggle of all involved.I love this movie. infinity out of 10".

This is one of the prettiest films you will ever watch  guaranteed  and please see it on widescreen DVD. The Mission won the Oscar for Best Cinematography in 1986 and that award was welldeserved. There is just one stunning scene after another.The story is very interesting too a supposed truelife account what happened back in the 1700s when a few dedicated priests tried to bring Christianity to the natives. It shows what occurred when a combination of the Catholic Church and the Portugese slavetraders and politicians attempted to put a halt to their missionary. This is a drama not an action film but the movie has extended violent ending and sometimes is shocking in that finale.Jeremy Irons as the dedicated Jesuit who heads the mission and Robert De Niro in a surprise role as the killer slavetraderturnedrepentant priest are both excellent in their leading roles. It was interesting to see a young Liam Neeson too.To some the story might be a bit slow I found it very involving. After several viewings I began to fully appreciate to lush score by Ennio Morricone. This is simply one of the prettiest and classiest movies I've seen and it's highly recommended.".

Hailing from the Protestant part of Europe I had never even heard about this aspect of Jesuit missionary work before but as I researched the matter I became fascinated. So when I heard that a movie had been made about this topic I went to see it as soon as possible. Knowing how the film industry tended to treat historical events I was somewhat suspicious but I was pleasantly surprised. This movie instantly became one of my all time favourites. I think the subject matter is handled sensitively and sensibly and the cinematography is stunning. What also impressed me was the clever way in which this story which in reality spanned several generations was compressed into a period of about ten years without becoming unbelievable. Even in a two hour movie there is a limit on what one can touch on but I think that a good balance between dialogue adventure action and character development was struck. Even so if the movie would have lasted another hour I would still have been happy perhaps even happier.".

	schema:headline " Final Victory in Might or in Love? Unique profound unforgettable movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Father Gabriel If might is right then Love has no place in this world...The movie by Roland Joffe was not popular in my country when it was released since such movies were censored by the communists. When however the situation changed in 1989 I remember that I saw THE MISSION for the first time on Polish TV in 1995 as a part of cinema's 100th anniversary celebration. The movie moved me so much that I have come back to it several times since then. Each time I see it I find something new in the film. Therefore I consider THE MISSION one of the very best films ever made a film where history meets single individuals where sadness is conquered by joy and disbelief and skepticism by profound thoughts on humanity.The content of the film though historical applies perfectly to modern times. The universal struggle of two spirits the one of might and the one of Love has always been noticeable wherever and whenever people live. Let us look briefly at the gist of the content the Jesuits build a mission in the core of a jungle in South America they understand the heart of the Gospels Love without looking for reward. Yet the politics of the conquerors Spaniards and the Portuguese steps in and destroys the mission... However not everything dies even though goodness seems to be conquered... This story presented here in a condensed way but developed in the film is so powerful that it leads to reflections what in fact reigns in our lives why good people have to suffer why we are forced to do what we hate it is so effortless to destroy while to build requires so much strength why the world turns our good deeds into evil etc. This aspect is the pearl of the film and the feast for the soul even though such thoughts require some courage from an individual. I reflected on the fact if I am willing to support the weak or if I rather choose might which is my master I attempt at in my actions? It's strange but we will never get to know our personalities completely... And that is what the film also shows. Altamiro Ray Mc Anally for instance is a person of different psychological states hard to evaluate.The performances are exceptionally powerful which makes THE MISSION a very nice piece of film art. Jeremy Irons gives a very powerful performance as Father Gabriel expressing all values a good Christian should own goodness gentleness patience courage and purity. He has this blink in his eyes that makes his portrayal particularly memorable. Robert De Niro... I would say frankly that this is his very best acting. People concentrate on different films when they hear of De Niro's performances particularly in Michael Cimino's THE DEER HUNTER 1978 or in Martin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR 1991. Some of them skip THE MISSION. Yet his portrayal of Rodrigo Mendoza is a masterpiece in its own. This role is difficult to portray since Mendoza is a man of two contradictory spirits from a slave trader to the devoted Jesuit. Nevertheless De Niro does a marvelous job. One moment caught my attention from the first view of the film Mendoza's death and this nostalgic look at Jesus in the Eucharist even while writing about this moment a tear appears unintentionally in the eye. Ray McAnnally portrays Altamiro a bishop who is forced to do what he actually does not intend to. He seems to be touched by the mission and in spite of that he finally allows for slaughters. In the final shot he expresses one thing powerfully a face of a man whose conscience will forever suffer. Thus we have made the world...thus have I made it which are his words said at the end by him clearly show what kind of person he was.Another powerful aspect of the film is music. Ennio Morricone is famous for having written music to many films but here in THE MISSION he did something absolutely sublime. I bought a CD listening to music alone and it was an unforgettable experience for me. People who heard it and did not see the film asked me where I got such wonderful tunes. Indian rhythms combined with Christian spirituality and ecclesiastic chorus  UNFORGETTABLE! I promise you that having seen this film you will never forget among other things these lovely tunes.The filming locations which obviously constitute an additional aspect in any film add a thrill and authenticity to everything. It is hard to imagine other places in THE MISSION. The movie is shot mostly in the places where the historical events took place. We see the mighty Iguazu waterfalls the jungle where Guarani Indians live the city of Cartagena in Colombia as well as the hills of the BrazilArgentinian border.What more is there to say? I think that most readers will agree with me that THE MISSION is a masterpiece a film that opens people to new horizons of understanding the profound thoughts that are there in our lives if we are willing to reflect on them or not. Speaking religiously Christ has once died on the Cross but then all was conquered by Love.The final scene gives an answer to Father Gabriel's thought that I entailed at the beginning. A silent sunny day in the jungle... we see a small group of Indian children who have survived the destruction. A little girl picks up a violin that she finds in the river and they begin to row a small boat towards the future... Father Gabriel you are right. It seems that Love perhaps has no place in this world and might may seem to be right but it is always Love that wins since the spirit of the dead will survive in the memory of the living.".

Chris Menges' sumptuous photography is a feast such that  for once  the Newsweek quotation on the video cover is superbly apt a sweeping spectacle'. The whole film is breathtaking from the depths of the jungle to the indian villages from face closeups to broad panoramas the visual effects are so powerful that I just cannot think of any other comparable film. Add to that fine interpretations carefully considered and delivered performances by all concerned with Joff's exquisite direction and you have a guarantee of a magnificent production. But that is NOT all there is to this great film Ennio Morricone's music reaches its greatest power its most poignant intensity its most gratifying melodic line right here in The Mission' surpassing everything this Italian composer had ever done before  even with his great friend Sergio Leone. Here Morricone reaches symphonic levels in a wealth of melodic harmonies such that what is supposedly only' a visual attraction  a film  becomes also a delight to the ears bringing a lump to my throat at various moments through this genuinely mighty film. You might wish to compare this film with 1492 a Conquest of Paradise' 1992 in which the best of Vangelis can be heard but even so I rate The Mission' just ahead of 1492'. Both films highly recommendable.".

But that is NOT all there is to this great film Ennio Morricone's music reaches its greatest power its most poignant intensity its most gratifying melodic line right here in The Mission' surpassing everything this Italian composer had ever done before  even with his great friend Sergio Leone. Here Morricone reaches symphonic levels in a wealth of melodic harmonies such that what is supposedly only' a visual attraction  a film  becomes also a delight to the ears bringing a lump to my throat at various moments through this genuinely mighty film. You might wish to compare this film with 1492 a Conquest of Paradise' 1992 in which the best of Vangelis can be heard but even so I rate The Mission' just ahead of 1492'. Both films highly recommendable.";

This is the story of how two opposing views of justice and redemption fail at the same time in the same place succumbing together to the stupidity of humankind. You can see it as a dark end but on the other hand it's very real. The Mission is always there to remember us that individual efforts to fight justice are valuable but insufficient to tackle political games. Any application to our current state of the world is not a coincidence. On top of that it is a beautiful master piece for photography and music. I have not been able to contain my tears even once since I saw this movie for the first time. But it feels good.".

Robert DeNiro is more interesting. After killing his brother in a duel he changes from brutal slavetrader to an expiating Jesuit. One of the best sequences is when native Indians recognize DeNiro. It looks first as if an Indian would kill him with a knife but then he cuts the rope with that DeNiro carried a heavy ballast of weapons and armings. DeNiro cries and laughs simultaneously because he is redeemed. This goes right through your heart. Chris Menges cinematography is wonderful.

	schema:reviewBody "The Mission is a drama about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in 18th century South America.It stars Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons together with Ray McAnally Aidan Quinn Cherie Lunghi and Liam Neeson. It was written by Robert Bolt and directed by Roland Joff. The film examines the events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 when Spain ceded part of South America to Portugal and turns this episode into an allegory for struggles of Latin America. Two European forces are on hand to win the South American natives over to imperialist ways. The plunderers want to extract riches and slaves from the New World. The missionaries on the other hand want to convert the Indians to Christianity and win over their souls. Mendoza is an exploiter dabbling in the slave trade. But after he kills his brother Felipe in a fit of rage he seeks redemption and calls upon the missionaries to assist him. After repeatedly climbing a cliff with a heavy weight as penance Mendoza finds redemption and becomes a devout missionary at a settlement run by Gabriel. The missionaries want to promote a new society in which the natives will live together in peace with the Spanish and the Portuguese. But this concept frightens the royal governors who would rather enslave the natives than encourage peaceful coexistence between the Europeans and the Indians. They order the mission to be burned to the ground. But this event causes a rift between Gabriel who wants to pray and pursue peaceful resistance and Mendoza who wants to take up arms and fight the Europeans.Featuring a majestic score by Ennio Morricone and lush Oscarwinning cinematography by Chris Mengesthe Mission is shot through with piercing haunting imagery pictures of enduring imaginative force.Alsoit is a rich and thoughtprovoking. It contains moving images of despair penance and redemption that are among the most evocative ever filmed.The performances are also great especially that of De Nirowho effective as a callous soldier who kills his own brother and then turns to a missionary to oversee his penance and conversion to the clergy. The narrative and dramatic forces at work in this movie should be more stirring and powerful than they are but unfortunatelyit lacks doesn't as it is too detached for the viewer to feel concern with the events and characters in the story.But that doesn't take that much from it as it remains a brilliant and excellent film.".

The Indian's are mesmirised and emerge and befriend him. The Brother thinks If I had an orchestra I could have subdued the whole continent. The other scene is where the former Slave driver who repents after killing his brother whom he loved above all else goes with the Brothers up to the settlement of the Indians whom he was taking away to slavery on sugar plantations. The former slave driver has been forgiven his sins but he nevertheless feels the need to do a private penance of dragging the battle armour of his previous life with him through the jungle. When the brothers come upon the Indians the slave driver fully expects them to kill him for his deeds but instead they cut away the bundle of armour he is dragging and welcome him to them. This echoing of divine Love by the Indians enables the former slave driver to believe in his redemption and to be born again at one with God. The mission is a film that you won't forget.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a true masterpiece. I easily place it within my top 100 films of all time. The story is very human and while some reviewers think this picture is a critique of faith particularly the Catholic Church I do not agree. Yes colonialism had its problems and was a flawed vehicle for the Gospel but the Indians came to beautiful faith genuinely. Also the priests had an abiding love for these Indians as people not as mere numbers to add to their scrolls. Real faith is not something which can be forced. And in the end of the movie the Indians and priests give one of the most compelling and loving scenes of martyrdom I have ever witnessed on film. Yes it is sad how they are cut down but they gain far more than they lose and in doing so show that true faith cannot be destroyed. I should state that I'm a Protestant but I have known priests and the character Jeremy Irons plays reminds me of several dear priests I've encountered. DeNiro gave probably the best performance of his career in this film the only other contender would be Deer Hunter. The scene when they reach the top of the mountain and the Indian cuts off the dead weight of the armor symbolic of the guilt and anguish he'd be carrying over his brother's death and DeNiro breaks down and expresses sorrow and finally joy it is truly sublime! Ennio Morricone's music beautifully complements the film both in pacing and detail and shows his preeminence amongst film composers! I should also comment on the film's lush cinematography. No wonder it won an Oscar for it. You are transported into the heart of the jungle. I recommend this film in the strongest possible terms. Please see it and you will not regret the time spent!".

	schema:reviewBody "Father we think he's done this penance long enough. But HE doesn't think so John! This movie captured some beautiful moments in a person's conversion! I especially love what I consider the culminating scene of the entire film wherein the Guarini see the man that enslaved and killed them and instead of doing the same to him they set him Free from the burden of his past sins! What a beautiful irony and the symbolism is exquisite! This was beautifully done by Joffe and the gift of crying for his sins and the utter abasement of his soul before God and all is shown so well! It was really a very touching scene when Jeremy Irons' character then rushes over to hug and comfort this wretched soul! Then the way Joffe shows DeNiro working amongst the people he had sought to enslave and their acceptance of him as a new manstunningly portrayed! The healing laughter of the children playing jokes on him and laughing at him...something that his former pridefilled self could not tolerate is so well done. I cannot help but to think that Joffe must've prayed about the making of this movie to do such a good job on these above mentioned scenes.Unfortunately I do agree with other reviewers that the movie went downhill from there. But as a former missionary myself I can avow to the fact that this film is very much alive in the hearts of thousands of brave missionaries throughout the world not just Catholic priests and nuns but the protestant missionaries too who also love this film and they will talk of the beauty of this film for many years to come!".

I especially love what I consider the culminating scene of the entire film wherein the Guarini see the man that enslaved and killed them and instead of doing the same to him they set him Free from the burden of his past sins! What a beautiful irony and the symbolism is exquisite! This was beautifully done by Joffe and the gift of crying for his sins and the utter abasement of his soul before God and all is shown so well! It was really a very touching scene when Jeremy Irons' character then rushes over to hug and comfort this wretched soul! Then the way Joffe shows DeNiro working amongst the people he had sought to enslave and their acceptance of him as a new manstunningly portrayed! The healing laughter of the children playing jokes on him and laughing at him...something that his former pridefilled self could not tolerate is so well done.

Another strong part comes from Ray McAnally in the ambiguous part of Cardinal Altamirano. Its a landmark film all in all and deserves a 9 out of 10.".

What this movie speaks about are forgiveness  self forgiveness  love  the true love that we will never understand  and most of all the path  the path we should choose some day. assuming you are not going to give up living it if you know what I mean.  Are you gonna fight for them like Rodrigo Mendoza? Or are you gonna be with them and love like Father Gabriel? The movie does not answer after all who can? This movie isn't about the obvious war which is just a background story but about the parallel conflict between Rodrigo Mendoza and Father Gabriel which represent unending war in our conscience.I know exactly why the Godfather has highest rating and I appreciate it so much. But having The Mission so underestimated with Robert De Niro acting Just watch him at the waterfall! and the music.... the music.. and so much love so much human. I don't know should they really be gangster movies to make us feel the Thing? I am very disappointed. Way to go Human Being.".

	schema:headline " Roland Joffe's follow up to the masterful The Killing Fields is wellcrafted and often easy to admire but ultimately comes up a bit short.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating  12 out of  Back in 1984 Roland Joffe accomplished the near impossible his major motion picture debut The Killing Fields defied every expectation typically associated with neophyte filmmakers and what Joffe delivered was one of the most powerful and moving films I've ever seen. So it's no surprise I highly anticipated his followup film The Mission and it's obvious that by bringing back the same team producer David Puttnam cinematographer Chris Menges and editor Jim Clark they attempted to capture the proverbial lightning in a bottle a second time. Unfortunately the end product isn't quite cinematic magic.Set in the 18th century Jeremy Irons stars as Father Gabriel one of several Spanish Jesuit priests including Liam Neeson assigned to convert the Guarini tribe of South America into Christians. His efforts are gradual but successful. Converging with this story is Rodrigo Mendoza Robert De Niro a slave trader who seeks penance after killing his own brother in a fit of rage. For all the Guarini that he has killed or sold off into slavery they still show compassion and forgiveness towards him and he is accepted into the mission even converting into a Jesuit priest under the guidance of Father Gabriel.The priests and the Guarini natives eventually find themselves in heated discussion with politicians and slaveowners who are debating over whether the mission should fall under the rule of Portugal thus endangering all the Guarini with the possibility of being made into slaves. Determined to prevent such an action at any cost Mendoza takes up his sword once more coming into conflict with Father Gabriel's peaceful approach.The Mission was released in 1986 with little success in theaters despite garnering a respectable 7 Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Since then it's developed a devoted fan base who consider it among the most underrated films of the decade. As much as I'd like to I can't quite agree. Though a respectable and often beautifully crafted effort the film ultimately comes up short in human interest and emotions with Joffe often favoring lingering shots of lush jungle scenery and needlessly overlong political machinations involving secondary characters whom we couldn't care less about.The film is divided into three acts the first involving the spiritual transformation of Mendoza is easily the most compelling. Despite De Niro's occasionally stilted performance his delivery of some of the dialogue particularly Are you laughing at me? still makes me cringe his emotional torment is heartfelt and absorbing and his acceptance into the mission is genuinely moving. It's almost all downhill from there.The buildup in the second act is initially effective with the heated debate over the Guarini engrossing but the conflict eventually loses steam when we're subjected to dull endless dialogue that grows inadvertently confusing even as it intends to clear up the matters at hand. It's also in the middle segment the film loses its human focus and all that's really left is the question of will they or won't they fight.The third act is the inevitable battle and while there are a few powerful moments amidst the chaos the sequence is a badly choreographed mess. The editing also feels a little rough with quite a few scenes feeling like they clocked in a little too soon the sudden transition after Irons' God is love! line is disjointed to say the least. The Guarini are never developed beyond the typical noble savage portrayal so it's difficult to feel for their plight beyond the fact that their forced subjugation and mass slaughter is a heinous crime. I wanted to feel more for them but they're merely a backdrop for the more seasoned cast.As Father Gabriel Jeremy Irons is superb unquestionably one of the film's consistent bright spots. It's unfortunate he's never that welldeveloped in any of the film's separate acts but his performance alone is able to draw us in even if the script lets him and the audience down. In supporting roles Ray McAnally and Liam Neeson are excellent though a bit limited in screen time. For Neeson this was more of a hint of greater things to come.Ennio Morricone's score deserves a special mention whatever emotions Joffe is unable to convey on screen Morricone's music can conjure in just a few notes. It's one of the most beautiful scores I've had the pleasure to listen to especially in segments with oboe and flute. The chorus in the background is perhaps a bit much but an overpowering score can do wonders in a film otherwise unable to muster all the intended emotions.Joffe's work in the film is still overall quite solid but he completely lost his footing soon afterward losing a grip on his career with a long string of critical and financial disasters including Super Mario Bros. The Scarlet Letter and Goodbye Lover. I'm convinced The Killing Fields was not a fluke but the sign of a genuine auteur who showed his prowess thanks to a brilliant script and cast. Blend those two elements with his natural skills and I'm sure we'll get a film worthy of mention alongside his debut. Let's just hope this happens sooner rather than later.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a sad fact of life that hunter gatherer cultures even when slavery is not in the mix will always give way to societies higher up on the sociological scale. No one says its right it just is. The Mission deals with the tragedy of such a situation in South America in the 18th century.Slavery was in the mix here however practiced in the open by the Portugese and winked at by the Spanish where their king's writ ran. The area were concerned with in South America in 1758 is that area of the Amazon headwaters where the boundary between Brazil and Peru is not really to clear. Christianity was a both a savior and destroyer of animist Indian tribes back then in both American continents. It certainly did have as a message that their culture and beliefs were altogether wrong and have to change. But there are also numerous recorded incidents where priests and we are talking about the Catholic Church here put their lives and reputations on the line to defend these primitive societies from the evils of the civilization they were bringing.Such an admirable priest is Jeremy Irons in The Mission. He's aided and abetted by Robert DeNiro a former slaver who became a monk renouncing civilization after killing his brother Aidan Quinn in a fight over a woman. The tribe they are working with and actually gaining trust and even some converts has been earmarked to be captured and used as slave labor over in Portugese territory.The Mission is told in flashback as Cardinal Ray McAnally is writing a report to the Pope of what is happening in South America. And in many ways what is still happening there.The Mission got seven Oscar nominations including best picture and won the Oscar in 1986 for best cinematography. The performances are some of the best that all the principal players have ever given on screen. The story is a tragic one but with a message of hope that there are indeed people like Irons and DeNiro for whom the positive aspects of their religion is not just platitudes.The best way to see The Mission is back to back with At Play In The Fields Of The Lord which is a 20th century look at the same problem. Both films are among the best made in the past 30 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw The Mission when I was sixteen years old and Ennio Morricone's haunting score as a backdrop to the visual leitmotif of Iguau Falls captured by the cinematography of Chris Menges's persist as some of my favorite cinematic moments. Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons successfully portray Jesuits in Paraguay prior to the Charles III's expulsion of the order from the Americas in 1767. The movie succeeds on various levels and perhaps is the best movie that Hollywood produced in the 1980's apart from Amadeus and the Last Emperor.This movie summarily is a morality play in which passive and violent resistance are contrasted. Robert Bolt the script writer avoids subscribing to either approach but intelligently constructs a plot in which the conflict centers around whether violence against repression or passive resistance are a priori. In the end neither of these approaches is sufficient and the Portuguese army slaughters the Guarani. I can't help but think that liberation theologians like Archbishop Oscar Romero who the Salvadorian government murdered influenced Bolt's consideration of this topic.As I perused other user comments I believe critics of this film are turned off by the jolted dialogue and the underdeveloped characterization. In truth the dialogue is relatively sparse compared to other Hollywood movies and relies upon visual and musical motifs to communicate developments in the plot and charactersour indebtedness to Shakespeare's dialog driven plays perhaps prejudices us against other forms of communication. The use of apt imagery with terse but effective dialogue results in more than adequate character development in the Jesuits.The movie does not develop the Guarani and can be accused of reifying these people as noble savages. However the movie is about Jesuits and both native and nonnative laymen are backdrops to the development of the conflicts exhibited in the priests played by DeNiro and Irons.I certainly recommend this movie as a great drama that presents interesting questions in a formally pleasing way.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw The Mission when I was sixteen years old and Ennio Morricone's haunting score as a backdrop to the visual leitmotif of Iguau Falls captured by the cinematography of Chris Menges's persist as some of my favorite cinematic moments. Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons successfully portray Jesuits in Paraguay prior to the Charles III's expulsion of the order from the Americas in 1767. The movie succeeds on various levels and perhaps is the best movie that Hollywood produced in the 1980's apart from Amadeus and the Last Emperor.This movie summarily is a morality play in which passive and violent resistance are contrasted. Robert Bolt the script writer avoids subscribing to either approach but intelligently constructs a plot in which the conflict centers around whether violence against repression or passive resistance are a priori. In the end neither of these approaches is sufficient and the Portuguese army slaughters the Guarani.

	schema:headline " The greatest movie about the three universal languages of the soul faith love and music...";
	schema:reviewBody "Goethe said Religious worship cannot do without music. It is one of the foremost means to work upon man with an effect of marvel. I don't think there is a more eloquent movie moment to illustrate that statement than the scene from Roland Joff's The Mission where the Guarani Indians find Father Gabriel Jermeny Irons in their territory.The previous Jesuit priest who tried to convert them ended up tied in a cross and sent to his death in the vertiginous Iguazu falls probably the film's most spectacular and defining shot. Father Gabriel traveled to the same falls to pursue the quest of his illfated predecessor. He won the hearts of the Indians through the simple use of an oboe. The Guarani captivated by the music couldn't believe that an instrument capable of such a divine sound would bring a bad omen for the tribe. The Guarani didn't speak Spanish Father Gabriel didn't speak their language yet but what are words except the language of the mind and how useless can they be when music the language of the soul can be understood with no need for translations. The Mission Golden Palm winner of 1987 relates the epic SouthAmerican journey of the Jesuits in the middle of the 18th century. And much more it's served by one of the most beautiful scores ever written from Ennio Morricone which conveys the transcendental aspect of music as a universal language a key for people's souls. It's true that by depicting the martyrdom of the priests who fought for the indigenous people's right the film can be perceived as a celebration of religion. But religion comes from 'relegere' which in Latin means 'uniting' uniting people under a same faith even nobler because it relies on values such as love equality and justice. It's significant that Father Gabriel doesn't convert only the Indians but also a mercenary and slaver named Mendoza Robert De Niro who thought himself beyond any redemption after having killed his brother in a duel.Mendoza follows Gabriel to the Christian sanctuary along with Father Fiedling Liam Neeson. He pulls a heavy bundle containing his armor and sword what's left from his previous life and after crossing the falls and getting to the Guarani territory Mendoza finally measures the accomplishment and finds himself among brothers. He bursts out crying and his tears strangely mix up with the kind of smile only De Niro could make communicative and poignant in the same time. Mendoza takes vow and becomes a priest trading his sword to a Bible. If one thing The Mission is a hymn to universal brotherhood and only our in our faithless era one could take it as proreligion film. How can it be proreligion when the same Guarani will end up massacred by the slavers who believed in profit today's very religion?The Mission is set during that specific time where Catholicism became the scapegoat of all the European revolutions where the same people who justified racism or slavery blamed everything on the Church. The Guarani sanctuary would be left to the Portuguese disposal after a territory transfer and a Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano Ray McAnally a former Jesuit himself was sent to examine the situation. Although he's amazed by the success of the Jesuit Mission he is confronted to a dilemma if he yields to the Spanish plantation owner Cabezo Chuck Low one of Mendoza's collaborators who doesn't even believe that Indians are human beings there's no doubt that the whole tribe will be enslaved. If not he'll create one terrible schism within the Catholic Church as the Jesuits would have dared to interfere with the Portuguese interests  represented by Don Hortar Ronald Pickup. The choice is obvious and so is its bloody aftermath no one could have expected anything from Hortar or Cabezo when the pure voice of a little Indian singing had not effect on them even inspiring an abject comparison to savant parrots. Mendoza dealt with them and reconsiders his Jesuit vow when he understands that only the language of weapons can fit the men whose souls cannot be touched by the divine grace. And whether the fight is already lost doesn't matter they all obey to a mightier authority than plantation owners or politicians. When Altamirano tries to reason Gabriel so he can reason the Indians the Guarani leader questions his authority isn't he representing God and how can even God be a matter of reasoning. Only God can know where the truth lies religion is not a democracy but at least everyone's equal under God.Naturally the marching civilization annihilates the Guarani just like the Conquest of the West destroyed the Natives and like many countries till now use the content of their civilizations to justify the fight against religious obscurantism in the name of modernity while maybe religion is still trying to protect some of the best of Human civilization. As the film concludes. The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. Faith like music speaks for something hidden in the soul that no one can't reach the belief in people's inner goodness that no one is beyond any redemption that's what Catholicism is about and I'm not even Catholic but within my own religion I can respond to a film like The Mission and that's what Ennio Morricone's music accomplishes and what makes it one of the greatest score ever made. It's too magical for words and too divine to belong to one religion.And it's so close to Heavenly perfection that any flaw right or wrong which a critic would find on the editing the storytelling or the directing is immediately redeemed. I wouldn't believe a film capable to transport my soul with such a mesmerizing music would have anything to be criticized. I guess my reaction was similar to the Indians when they listened to the sound of Gabriel's oboe ".

What starts out as a seemingly typical romance drama shot in venice turns into a much different and tragic love story. Lynne Frederick's performances is outstanding even in this small but powerful drama. She appears nude in several scenes that are romantic and erotic. The first scene in which the two lovers meet is perhaps the best. Great use of symphonic music to convey the eye connection between two strangers. At times a fairy tale while at other times gritty and brutally realistic. Give it a chance if are able to locate it on the internet sites.".

	schema:headline " Lynne Frederick is stunning but the film borders on the sexploitation side";
	schema:reviewBody "The basic plot of the film is decent a love story followed by tragedy and a loyal loving husband waiting 40 years to be reunited with his wife. The use of music was successful in aiding the plot and giving it a relevant atmosphere. However the presentation of the plot is disastrous and superficial. Anna Lynne Frederick falls in love and pursues David Mark Burns who is 18 years her senior in real life and looks even older than that in the film. The storyline fails to explain Anna's attraction to David which is contradictory to the social norm of the boy chasinggirl paradigm instead of the other way around. Anna is portrayed as a rich college girl who enjoys car racing partying with her peers drinking alcohol from victory cups and flirting with older men whom she knows nothing about. David is a workaholic architect who considers his career his mistress and his source of pride.The sex scenes are gratuitous adding nothing to the plot. There are several of them interrupting their honeymoon outings and a couple as flashbacks. We already know that married couples have sex on their honeymoons and those prolonged sex scenes are not only gratuitous but make for an uncomfortable viewing especially with company. The amount of fondling that Mark Burns deals to the private parts of Lynne Frederick's body is distasteful and could be classified as softcore pornography. Sex sells and it seems to me that the makers of the film wanted to make a profit by playing on the sexual fantasies of men especially older men wishing to be seduced by a beautiful 20year old Lynne's age during filming. A better storyline would have served the film better. Lynne Frederick is famous for her fairytale princess look which conveys a sense of youthful innocence see her performance in Phase IV. Her heavy eye makeup during the sex scenes actually hid that natural innocence look since I assume it would not be compatible with the distasteful scenes. It is unfortunate for Lynne Frederick to have been a working actress in the exploitative mess of the early 70's. I recall that she was only 15years old when they were filming No Blade of Grass her debut film. In that too is an exploitation scene where her character is raped. The camera was almost touching her bosom as the rapist exposed it and fondled it with his mouth. They never heard of a nudity clause back then and I doubt that parental consent was required for an actress under 18 to simulate sexrape and go nudetopless for the camera.Overall this film serves as an example to those who say that sex scenes detract from the plot of a romantic film.".

Stallone does such fantastic comedy and has such an exquisite sense of timing and delivery it's a wonder anybody lets him do action movies. He missed his calling. Look for Ornella Muti Princess Aura from Flash Gordon as the superb dignified and fierytempered Sophia as Snaps' wife and source of fear for the entire cast and Tim Curry as Dr. Poole in a genius turn as a mildmannered professor discovering love for the first time.

That's all the bad stuff I could think of to say about this movie. The rest is all good.People tend to react with disbelief when they hear about a comedy starring Sylvester Stallone. While I'm not sure about the range of Sly's comedic abilities Oscar proves that he CAN do comedy and given the right part can do it very well.Sly plays Angelo Snaps Provolone a mob boss who promises to his dying father to give up the crime racket for good. The movie focuses on the morning in which Snaps is preparing to join the ranks of a bank administration at noon. During that morning his daughter gets engaged... three times. She also reveals that she's pregnant... except she's not. Snaps repeatedly loses and regains 100000 dollars... and a bag of women's underwear. And then there's his other daughter who's not he thinks really his daughter. Behind him all the way are his flunkies reduced from robbing banks to scooping melon balls and incapable of breaking the habit of calling him boss if their lives depended on it.Kudos for expert scene theft go to Peter Riegert as the shifty Aldo Marisa Tomei as the spoiled brat Lisa Provolone Martin Ferrero and Harry Shearer as the Finucci brothers and Tim Curry as the unctuous Dr. Thorntone Poole.The critics panned this movie. Rent it anyway and find out just how wrong they were.".

Unfortunately the audiences teamed with the critics and Oscar was a major flop when it was released in theaters but became huge succesful on video and found its audience there even if it's still largely underrated nowadays.Oscar is a delightfully wellstaged and nicely paced 'comedy of errors based on the 1967 French film of the same name starring Louis de Funs but with the setting moved to 1931 during the Depressionera in New York City telling the story of a Mob Boss Angelo Snaps Provolone Stallone trying to going straight after a promise he made to his dying father Eduardo Kirk Douglas but it won't be an easy task...This was the first John Landis' film after the major Box Office hit of his Coming to America '88 starring Eddie Murphy and probably the expectations were higher for the director to deliver another audience friendly contemporary comedy but Landis took a risk honoring and resurrecting a dead genre and glad he did so.The performances are all top notch well directed by Landis and perfectly adequate to the characters they're playing the settings and the tone of the movie Sly Stallone is a great comedy actor he have the right delivery timing funny expressions and truly dominates the central role of the film with the great support of Peter Riegert and Chazz Palminteri as his not so bright henchmen Ornella Muti  Marisa Tomei as his dominating wife and spoiled teenage daughter Landis' usual collaborator the veteran Don Ameche as Father Clemente Tim Curry as the linguistic Dr. Poole Vincent Spano as the greedy accountant and the duo Harry Shearer  Martin Ferrero playing the tailors Finucci Brothers which are hilarious. Kirk Douglas joined the cast in the prologue alongside Yvonne De Carlo God Bless Lily Munster !! in her last screen role offering a memorable cameo.In short this is one of the funniest comedies ever put onscreen people shouldn't listen to Stallone's haters or the snobbish movie critics who probably didn't even get the movie. For fans of a good farce this is the movie to watch i give it a solid 9 stars !!".

	schema:reviewBody "Oscar is a hilarious movie that keeps you laughing throughout. You even feel quite exhausted after it's all said and done since there's so much going on. The great thing about the movie is being surprised minute by minute. The basic story is about Snaps Provolone a powerful Chicago gangster that is feared by many. However Snaps is about to go straight because he promised his dying father on his deathbed that he would go legit. However it's not going to be easy. In only 24 hours of trying to be straight everything goes straight to hell and everything that could go wrong does. And that's when all of the fun begins. This is a terrific comedy that can be enjoyed by just about everyone. Sylvester Stallone can really be a card and is hilarious when given the right opportunity. His facial expressions and outbursts are truly unforgettable.John Landis scored big with his spoof of high finance magnates Trading Places and revisits similar terrain in Oscar only this time the big money was made in the crime syndicate field. Landis shrewdly sets his satire in the Depression period to provide for the same kind of contrast between rich and poor that he showcased in Trading Places when Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche wagered to see what will happen when poor African American Eddie Murphy is allowed into their world to make business decisions. This is filled with hilarious dialogue and is delivered perfectly by everyone. Yes even Stallone. And you felt so proud when Chazz was ahead of everyone else after not knowing a thing about a thing.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

The basic premise is a Gangster in the days of prohibition who is trying to leave his life of crime while many crazy events try to thwart his attempt.";

	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie so much. It has everything a comedy of errors should have and John Landis did a great job directing this. The script was very good indeed. A little predictable at times as a lot of the jokes are repeated but it is all very solid and I loved the playlike structure of the story. The bag routine had me in stitches the only other time that has happened to me was in Clue which is also a mustsee. This movie is laden with cameos from famous faces such as Don Ameche Eddie Bracken and Kurtwood Smith. Who can forget that priceless cameo from Kirk Douglas. Sylvester Stallone is surprisingly good here much better than he was in Stop Or My Mum Will Shoot which I won't describe other than to say it is easily forgettable. In fact this is by far and away his BEST comedy. The Don't call me bossline is just as funny as the bags routine. Ornella Muti and Marissa Tomei play fiery young women amusingly and Peter Riegert plays Aldo to perfection. Vincent Spano plays a suitably ambiguous character but the acting honours without doubt belong to Chazz Palminteri and Tim Curry. Chazz Palminteri is just so adorable as Connie and the way Provolone treated him was quite horrible.It's like disarming Germany. Tim Curry doesn't appear until halfway through and whilst he is not as funny as he was in Clue his turn of Dr. Poole is genius especially when his grammatical errors get misunderstood. Also superb were the lush and beautifully rendered costumes and sets asides from the acting and the costumes Elmer Bernstein's score was a treat. From the charming puppet sequence featuring Largo Al Factotum from Rossini's masterpiece Barber of Seville to the love theme to the wedding scene I loved it. Also it was so musical with what the actors were doing on screen. A mustsee and for those of you who haven't seen it are seriously missing out and those of you who hated it need your heads examined for I know a good comedy when I see one and this is it! NOTE in the United Kingdom it is very hard to find and it has never been shown on TV. But I did manage to get it on DVD before it became literally nonexistent. 1010 Bethany Cox.".

Seeing the boys grow up being so fond of each other surely was nice to watch! As the boys grow older and become men they also sexualize their relationship which came I have to admit that a too late and b too suddenly. One would think that adolescent boys start 'playing' a little earlier than these two did. Anyway that was the only thing that really startled me for a moment. Other than that the film was a great watch which surely had to do with the sheer beauty of the two main actors especially Joao Gabriel Vasconcellos who played the older adult brother 'Francisco'. The chemistry between the two guys is wonderful and you want these two men to love each other forever.I can highly recommend this film.

	schema:headline " A sweet innocent beautiful but flawed love story";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why mutually consenting sex between brothers near the same age is a big deal. It's not as if they would produce deformed offspring. That particular taboo makes no sense to me. I'm not advocating gay incest but horror at the idea of sex between brothers  even in a movie and even among gay men  mystifies me. I've never been at all attracted to my own brother but two brothers' falling in love in a movie does not make me the least bit uncomfortable. I don't feel compelled to try to twist it into something else that's more acceptable.People who say it's easy to forget that Francisco and Thoms are brothers in the latter half of the movie must be TRYING to forget it because the movie never stops affirming the fact that that's what they are. Fighting that battle while trying to enjoy a movie must detract a lot from the enjoyment.This is a flawed but interesting and unusual movie and I can understand why even the many positive reviews it gets have trouble describing it. It has been called a fairy tale because Francisco and Thoms seem to live in a dream world as cut off from the real world as Sleeping Beauty in her castle. But aren't all young lovers like that? Isn't that what love and hormones do to young people? Doesn't the rest of the world tend to fall away when the beloved comes into view? That's how it was when I was young.So to say that this is a fairly tale is simply to say that it is a love story. It's an unusual love story but fundamentally it is just like any other romance movie. If anything its depiction of the allconsuming ecstasy of young love is MORE realistic than most movies are not less.Others have emphasized the parents' evident oblivion or even acquiescence to what is going on under their noses but that seems to me like just another symptom of the irrational taboo I mentioned earlier. It's like What those boys are doing is WRONG! Why don't their parents stop it? But again I ask Why? Who is hurting whom? Nobody that I can see.When they're children they simply love each other and love to be together and they are freely affectionate with each other. Is that bad? Why? Should the mother slap her son when he kisses his younger brother on the head or puts his arm around him or holds him while they sleep? Why? Is fighting better? Is sibling rivalry better than sibling affection? Evidently it is to many people.Neither of those is what I see as a weakness in this movie. It's true that the movie is unreal but what seems most unreal to me is not the brothers' relationship with each other or with their parents. That's just an extraordinarily loving and mutually accepting family which is almost never seen in a movie or in real life but should be everybody's ideal of what a family ought to be. If that's not the unconditional love people rave about nowadays I don't know what is.What seems most unreal to me is the other adults' relationships with each other the fantastically loving relationships between exes and inlaws and friends who are NOT in love with each other who are NOT caught up in the heady ecstasy of hormones and young love. That excess of affection is just plain weird.Another weakness I see is in the dialog. The core story about the brothers is fine  it's a love story  but what people say to each other is stilted and awkward not at all the way real people talk. It's like the way people talk in TV commercials. And the problem is not just in the English subtitles which actually are very good what they're saying in Portuguese sounds just as phony.And the final weakness I see is in the direction. The director seems to be trying to make something besides JUST a love story but what that other something is never comes clear. It feels as if he is intentionally trying to make it an allegory or an epic myth or a ballet or something else abstract that wrestles constantly with the extremely simple love story which the movie actually is.The scene in which the adult brothers slowly undress for the first time as they face each other across the room is particularly strange like something out of a kabuki performance. That obscure tension between what the movie is and what the director is trying to make it be doesn't ruin the movie but it IS distracting.All four actors who play the two brothers as children and then as adults are very good and very beautiful inside and out. What the director did an EXCELLENT job of is getting straight actors which I assume they all are to be so convincingly loving toward each other. Every affectionate gesture every touch every loving look is totally convincing. That could NEVER happen in an American or Canadian movie or even in a European movie and I've never seen it in any other movie from Latin America. It is a unique and astonishing accomplishment.The director also gets credit for the movie's other great accomplishment which is simply that it got made. A movie about love passion unshakable devotion loyalty innocence tenderness and limitless generosity between two men is rarer than hens' teeth. The scene in which they exchange wedding rings alone together at home is one of the sweetest sexiest scenes I have ever seen. I have never seen any other movie that even comes close to the love between these two men and I have seen hundreds and hundreds of gay movies. This is far from the best of them but it is the most wonderful.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't understand why mutually consenting sex between brothers near the same age is a big deal. It's not as if they would produce deformed offspring. That particular taboo makes no sense to me. I'm not advocating gay incest but horror at the idea of sex between brothers  even in a movie and even among gay men  mystifies me. I've never been at all attracted to my own brother but two brothers' falling in love in a movie does not make me the least bit uncomfortable. I don't feel compelled to try to twist it into something else that's more acceptable.People who say it's easy to forget that Francisco and Thoms are brothers in the latter half of the movie must be TRYING to forget it because the movie never stops affirming the fact that that's what they are. Fighting that battle while trying to enjoy a movie must detract a lot from the enjoyment.This is a flawed but interesting and unusual movie and I can understand why even the many positive reviews it gets have trouble describing it. It has been called a fairy tale because Francisco and Thoms seem to live in a dream world as cut off from the real world as Sleeping Beauty in her castle. But aren't all young lovers like that? Isn't that what love and hormones do to young people? Doesn't the rest of the world tend to fall away when the beloved comes into view? That's how it was when I was young.So to say that this is a fairly tale is simply to say that it is a love story. It's an unusual love story but fundamentally it is just like any other romance movie. If anything its depiction of the allconsuming ecstasy of young love is MORE realistic than most movies are not less.Others have emphasized the parents' evident oblivion or even acquiescence to what is going on under their noses but that seems to me like just another symptom of the irrational taboo I mentioned earlier. It's like What those boys are doing is WRONG! Why don't their parents stop it? But again I ask Why? Who is hurting whom? Nobody that I can see.When they're children they simply love each other and love to be together and they are freely affectionate with each other. Is that bad? Why? Should the mother slap her son when he kisses his younger brother on the head or puts his arm around him or holds him while they sleep? Why? Is fighting better? Is sibling rivalry better than sibling affection? Evidently it is to many people.Neither of those is what I see as a weakness in this movie. It's true that the movie is unreal but what seems most unreal to me is not the brothers' relationship with each other or with their parents. That's just an extraordinarily loving and mutually accepting family which is almost never seen in a movie or in real life but should be everybody's ideal of what a family ought to be. If that's not the unconditional love people rave about nowadays I don't know what is.What seems most unreal to me is the other adults' relationships with each other the fantastically loving relationships between exes and inlaws and friends who are NOT in love with each other who are NOT caught up in the heady ecstasy of hormones and young love.

In my eyes the filmmaker is a dreamer. Not a realist. And it was refreshing and fascinating to watch as the story unfolded. It was profound.The story begins with a boy at the age of six who is escorted by a nurse to see his newborn brother. Immediately the filmmaker is setting up the rules of his idyllic world. And the rules are consistent throughout. The father is nowhere to be seen. In fact there are no adults other than an impartial nurse who leads the boy to the person who will ultimately be the love of his life.The six yearold brother looks into his baby brother's eyes through the viewing window and a profound connection is formed. The filmmaker makes his first point. Could this mysterious thing we call love start even before birth? In most of the best love films that I've seen and I've seen plenty when two lovebirds meet the love of their life they have that experience of haven't we met before? Or I feel like I've known you all my life.I won't go into the whole story but I was fascinated by the filmmaker's decision to leave as much conflict out of the picture as possible. He showed us hints of potential conflicts but wisely didn't emphasize them. It was a brave choice. Abranches' vision would prefer to keep the boy's perpetually in the womb of their mother. Which is another important theme throughout the story.Abranches give us a vision of his Garden of Eden before the fall and the Great Conflict. Before Adam hid himself in the bushes when God walked the grounds and he asked Adam why are you hiding? I'm naked. And God became angry who told you thou wast naked? What kind of world would that be like? I can only imagine but I caught a glimpse of it up there on the big silver screen. I highly recommend From Beginning to End.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Aluzio Abranches From Beginning to End revolves around the relationship between two young half brothers whose intense childhood bond eventually leads to a sexual relationship. Told as a fairy tale romance FBTE skirts the issue of incest by simply showing parents with concerned frowns and while an overwrought musical score plays not so much in the background.While the topic of incest is complicated this film is not. The director has chosen to tell the story from an unrealistic point of view that denies reality first from parents who express little concern to an insulated world that apparently has no schools or friends. The boys who are quite innocent express their bond in an endless display of affection and mutual protection. Their journey into adulthood is oddly told by a series of deaths in the family culminating in an erotic undressing after they are finally alone together to consume their longing. Tensions arise when the younger brother is invited to train for the Olympics in Russia for three years. The last part of the film deals with their separation for the first time and how each deals with the absence. In this fairy tale world there is always a happy ending.The adult brothers played by athletic and modelbeautiful Joao Gabriel Vasconcello and Rafael Cardoso are so ridiculously attractive that it is easy to dismiss or even remember that they are related. Director Abranches never detours from his fairy tale letting the easy sexiness and apparent attraction of the characters make it all seem downright reasonable. This is a world where not an eyebrow is raised as the two seemingly oblivious to any concern for the outside world are always physical. In only one scene they ask a swimming trainer if their constant petting bothers him the answer is of course not. The mother beautifully played by Jlia Lemmertz is aware that the affections the boy have for one another seem to be suspicious but in the fairy tale world of brotherly love mothers and fathers never comment. In fact the mother makes a ghostly return to join the boys for a swim of the coast of Rio.Watching FBTE the idea of incest was almost put on the back burner because of the lack of tension and the nearly soft porn charisma of the leads. That this film is about two half brothers that are in love gets lost in the foggy haze of steamy sex and presumption on the part of the director that we can be pulled in by attractive men and a loud musical score. It could be the story of two boys growing up together but in this instance they are related. It is of note that on the same evening on the Sundance channel a film called Savage Grace a 2007 film by Swoon director Tom Kalin would be aired. On the completely other end of the moral spectrum Savage Grace is difficult painful and almost nauseating as mother and young son have intercourse. But the two films are reminders of just how complicated the subject of incest isthey are not all alike. FBTE doesn't judge the subject so much as punctuate it with beautiful examples making it a fairy tale a poem a love story easy to watch frankly erotic but empty. The ultimate question to be asked is it it a good film? Does it entertain inform and enlighten? Yes if only because we are in new territory and the characters are so free from a any burden living in a world that can only be dreamed of.".

There is also a certain amount of sadness eminent from the fantastic performances from Rafael Cardoso and Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos. Both these men light up the screen and their chemistry was incendiary with a very fierce dynamic relationship that takes twists and turns in many directions but ultimately leaves you yearning for what was once between them. The film is pretty much about life changes and how some of the best times are hard to let go as mere memories. Both brothers in their own way must deal with life's changes and its unexpectedness. Very poetic and always eloquent in its storytelling dealing with such difficult subject matter was flawlessly handled sensitively in the very capable hands of Aluisio Abranches. Brazil should be proud to have this film. It represents very well the beautiful people of Brazil their culture and it give you great insight of a culture that is filled with traditions as well as strong family and community ties. As the movie beautifully unfolds we explore and observe a relationships and how difficult it can be to let go of the tie that binds.".

	schema:headline " A Sophisticated Beautifully Realized and Courageous Film from Brazil";
	schema:reviewBody "FROM BEGINNING TO END Do Comeo ao Fim is the work of writerdirector Aluzio Abranches who was born and raised in Ipanema Rio de Janeiro Brazil. He graduated in Economics before going to the London International Film School in 1983. His first feature film 'Um Copo de Clera' 1999 was acclaimed in several international film festivals. In 2002 his second featurefilm As trs Marias The Three Marias also was selected to various festivals abroad. His latest movie 'Do Comeo ao Fim' From Beginning to End tells a story about two male halfbrothers who fall in love. The movie caused tremendous controversy as some people loved the delicate relationship between them and others who were outraged by the suggestion of incest. Nevertheless it is undeniable it was groundbreaking for the homosexual Brazilian cinematography being selected to over 25 international film festivals many of them dedicated to the gay pride and film production.Though the feelings of viewers continues to be quite mixed hopefully in time the film as an art work will be better appreciated. It is an exquisite study of family in a different light than any other film has probed. Julieta Jlia Lemmertz is currently married to Alexandre Fbio Assuno and they have a child Thoms who according to the narrator  the half brother Francisco from Julieta's previous marriage to Pedro Jean Pierre Noher  was born with his eyes closed and kept them closed except for looking at his new brother. Into this loving atmosphere the two brothers are close enjoying each other's company in play and adventures and proximity. Francisco as a child is played by Lucas Cotrim and Thoms as a child is played by Gabriel Kaufmann. Thoms idolizes his big brother and Francisco looks to Thoms for secure love. The boys visit Pedro Francisco's father in Buenos Aires at Christmas and Pedro discusses with Julieta that he is concerned that the boys are too close a fact that Julieta acknowledges but assures Pedro that this is normal in boys their age. At home in Rio de Janeiro Alexandre poses the same concern but the two young boys are so happy and successful in school and sports that the subject is dropped. Pedro dies then Julieta dies and the two now grown young lads have only their shared father Alexandre to parent them. As young very handsome athletic men Francisco now played by Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos and Thoms  Rafael Cardosa are left alone in their home and their relationship deepens into a physical one. The lads deeply love each other and their physical love is as wondrously portrayed as their love as half brothers. They exchange rings. They both are dedicated swimmers but Thoms is better and is offer to go to Russia to train for the Olympics. The idea of separation deeply troubles them both but Francisco's love for Thoms sees the importance to his brothers career and off Thoms goes to Russia. While the lads are separated they yearn for each other Francisco attempts to assuage his longing with a young girl but his commitment to Thoms is stronger. The film ends in a statement of commitment and love between these two extraordinary men.The physical aspects of the relationship are beautifully captured in the sensitive cinematography by Ueli Steiger the acts are passionate but visually subtle. The musical score by Andr Abujamra adds another realm of power to the story's character. Each of the actors in the film is excellent. It is rare that broken family stories have been shared with such grace and delicacy. And both Vasconcellos and Cardoso seem to have a fine career ahead of them.FROM BEGINNING TO END should not be labeled as a gay film even though it allows the viewer to see the power of same sex relationships in a beautifully described new light. This is simply a fine film and Aluzio Abranches deserves kudos for his accomplishment. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Do Comeo ao Fim  FROM BEGINNING TO END  CATCH IT  B  Brazilian movie Do Comeo ao Fim is a visual treat along with moving performances by Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardoso. This movie talks about the taboo topic of half brothers falling in Incestuous relationship  Love. Though the movie deals with sensitive and hardcore subject matter but the movie not for a second seems like anything different than a Love Story. I loved what one of the reviewer mentioned on IMDb that this movie reflects the Dream World where the Incestuous Love between Half brothers is nothing more than merely LOVE. The movie starts off with Francisco  Thoms when they are young kids. From there the whole beauty of caring for each other was represented in a very decent way plus how the mother  Francisco's father started to feel that they are more closer than they are suppose too. I loved the way movie was progressing but then suddenly the death of Pedro Francisco's father  10 years later the death of their Mother changed the movie into another direction. The movie didn't show how the boys dealt with these feeling as teenagers because I believe that's the toughest part or Maybe as I have mentioned before the director was living in Dream World. so from there we were left with Intimate Love of Francisco  Thoms. The Love scene between Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardoso was pasteurized exquisitely  the dialogues were splendidly powerful. After that movie went off to Love  Long Distance relationship between Francisco  Thoms which was heartfelt to watch because of outstanding chemistry between Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardoso. Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardoso are exceptionally gorgeous and their chemistry and performance was very natural  touchy. There was not a second when I felt like they were merely two actors playing falling in Love because the way they behave around each other  looked at each other it was all LOVE. Lucas Cotrin as young Francisco  Gabriel Kaufmann as young Thoms were treat to watch. They were funny caring  shared an awesome chemistry. Jlia Lemmertz looked elegant  exquisite if I was the director I would have loved to see the whole family dealing with this issue but somehow Director lived the Dream Charming World. Fbio Assuno Jean Pierre Noher and Louise Cardoso were good in their parts. Overall watch it for Erotic  Intimate chemistry between Joo Gabriel Vasconcellos and Rafael Cardoso along with Stunning Cinematography.".

Their parents realize how peculiar their sons relationship are and then they are just fine with it. For a moment you think there will be a struggle at least a internal one just for a brief moment their mother shows some concern but she seems to eventually just let it go. This becomes the movie biggest mistake the lack of conflict. The story jumps from where the boys are around 10 years old to where they are already grown men. That's when the movie loses itself. It just jumps the most critical and interesting part of what could have been their teenage years. The discovery of sexuality the actual realization of the boys feelings. How does it feel to realize at age 15 that you're not attracted to girls but you are deeply in love with your brother? What if he feels the same how you both would deal with it? With your parents with your friends with the world? But mostly how each one of them would deal with themselves the inner crisis that I imagine someone in this situation would experience. It just lacks conflict at any kind. Their parents their friends and everyone around them seem to be just OK with the fact that two brothers are in a relationship like it's a daily situation we're all used to. It's like they live at their own magic world. But the movie has its pros. The story is told in a beautiful almost poetic way. The scenarios are beautiful and so are the main actors that have by the way great chemistry. The music is also beautiful.I liked the ending although incest is still a taboo I do believe as cheesy as it sounds true love conquers all and I would love to see the boys ending up together but first I would like to see some real conflict as it would certainly happen in a situation like this in real life.".

So why don't we take a break and look deeper into their love? And their love is pure and beautiful and still young just like the actors.The pace of the movie maybe a little bit odd though.The movie spent quite some time to develop their bond then after some drastic changes in the family we see in a short symbolic scene how they grew into a much closer sexual relationship. But I guess since the director is not going to judge the right or wrong of brother sleeping with brother there is also no point going to depth how they wanted to sleep with each other right?The rest of the movie then go to how the brothers struggle with their love and there are small hints that they are aware of their relationship will make some people uncomfortable.I guess the direction of the movie is not easily acceptable by most viewers but can you complain two extremely hot young men having a happilyeverafter ending in a modern day fairy tale?I can really take a break for some fairy tales with some hot stud.".

It does tackle the issue of incest and homosexuality but there is a reason why it's not elaborated upon. It's a utopia of what can happen when we are not guided by social norms or rules and regulations and let emotions flourish. The love and innocence that both leads share is beyond the fact that they are brothers and in fact there is a scene when they are together that the mother returns as a ghost and is hugging them both as if she approved. If you expect conflict or plot then I suppose it is not the best movie for you but if you can appreciate the simplicity of life and this movie then you will love it. The characters are not well developed but it goes hand in hand with what the movie has to offer. The father of the youngest is shown to be aware of the situation and yet he makes nothing of it. It's a simple movie yet poetic it goes beyond controversy conflict and is a surreal eden of what the true bonds of love can be. It is love at first sight that breaks beyond social norms it's the simplicity of love at its finest".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably the most romantic and clearly romanticized love story I've seen between two men. The brothers thing made it interesting and edgy but the love between them is so much bigger than their blood relation. This is not an after school special about being gay  the word gay is never mentioned and the relationship is never really challenged even by outsiders in the town. Which in itself is an interesting statement.You have to see it as a piece of ART  an exploration or a what if? scenario and not a typical Hollywood hero's journey.Neither struggle with being gay or being attracted to each other  they are just surfing the experience of profound romantic love. I think what makes it different from other approaches to the subject is that it asks the question What if you fell in love with your brother and that was not a problem? What I found interesting is MY OWN expectations about how people in the film should react to the relationship. I was actually confronted that they didn't feel ashamed or conflicted about their own relationship.Obviously there would be more of a panic if the story were between a brother and sister but if you take out the possibility of sexual conception you can focus on the idea that traditional sibling boundaries simply never existed between these brothers. It also helps that the actors are gorgeous. It's not exactly Philadelphia or Schindler's List but I found the film sweet fascinating romantic  a pleasant surprise.".

	onyx:emotionText "Probably the most romantic and clearly romanticized love story I've seen between two men. The brothers thing made it interesting and edgy but the love between them is so much bigger than their blood relation. This is not an after school special about being gay  the word gay is never mentioned and the relationship is never really challenged even by outsiders in the town. Which in itself is an interesting statement.You have to see it as a piece of ART  an exploration or a what if? scenario and not a typical Hollywood hero's journey.Neither struggle with being gay or being attracted to each other  they are just surfing the experience of profound romantic love. I think what makes it different from other approaches to the subject is that it asks the question What if you fell in love with your brother and that was not a problem? What I found interesting is MY OWN expectations about how people in the film should react to the relationship. I was actually confronted that they didn't feel ashamed or conflicted about their own relationship.Obviously there would be more of a panic if the story were between a brother and sister but if you take out the possibility of sexual conception you can focus on the idea that traditional sibling boundaries simply never existed between these brothers. It also helps that the actors are gorgeous. It's not exactly Philadelphia or Schindler's List but I found the film sweet fascinating romantic  a pleasant surprise.";

I basically bought the ticket for the eye candy factor and unfortunately eye candy is all this film is and eye candy can be pretty damn boring. The brothersinlove are gorgeous successful and oh so deliriously happy. All the time. Well except for a couple of brief funeral scenes where they get to 'emote' unconvincingly. Actors would have come in handyIn the first half the brothers are 12 and 6 or whatever and we get to see over and over how close they are perhaps too close. The mother and fathers the brothers are halfbrothers. Copout! express concern but being the sophisticates that they are decide not to interfere with their sons' growing intimacy. The mother and one of the dads die yaddayadda and it's fifteen years later and the brothers are living a life of bliss in the family home which has the exact same furniture from fifteen years before and everything still looks brandspanking new like it was just delivered from RocheBobois that morning. They even have the same damn Volkswagen Beetle in the driveway. Anyway what's a love story without conflict adversity and drama right?. Well get ready for this younger brother gets an opportunity to train for the Olympics in Russia he's a swimmer natch which would mean the brothers' first separation!. Oh well woe is effing me! Rich beautiful people suffer too I guess. The older brother the doctor natch. is so consumed by younger bro's absence that he goes to a dance club and drinks a bit more than he should and flirts with a woman!!! He even gets into a heavy petting session with said woman until his guilt and a suddenly noticed engagement ring I forgot to mention that the brothers got engaged to each other before the big separation puts a halt to the only potentially interesting development in the film. Anyway the big problem is solved with a plane ticket to Russia and a surprise reunion. The End.I feel better now thank you!".

	schema:reviewBody ".....The Heart Loves Who the Heart MUST Love! A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY INVOLVING HALFBROTHERS  AN EXPLANATION ABOUT THIS FILM'S BEGINNING Concerning The Eyes Thing in the film's first 2 minutes there is a reason for the opening BlackWhite scene....and it has nothing to do with equipment failure....and everything to do with a newborn baby's failure actually unwillingness to open his eyes. Until 2 weeks later when he is shown to...and becomes aware of his older brother's presence that's the eyeopening trigger. Let's just say about this that there is some foreshadowing here of the depth of the brotherly Relationship which is to come. NOTENow is a good time to advise that you read a marvelous 35 year old novel by Spanish author Agustin GomezArcos entitled The Carnivorous Lamb included in some Gay MustRead recommended works. Here you'll also find a detailing of the deep and physical love which develops between an older and younger brother. It is a beautiful read...and also begins with the Eyes Thing. Perhaps Writer  Director Aluisio Abranches is himself a fan of this book. TIME PERIODS GIVEN US ARE 2 The brothers' early lives growing closer together as children and young teens....Then later on their adult Relationship when the younger is perhaps 20 and the older in his mid20s or so.GENERAL OBSERVATIONS It was UNexpected and a problem for me that so much time is devoted to family life in the film's first half.....particularly since it is problemfree I rated film lower for this. Oh and for those of you inclined to do the blameitontheMother thing for the type Relationship you'll be seeing...just don't. As well both the older brother's father mother's divorced Ex and the younger brother's father mother's current have close relationships with the boys...and with their mother a woman who is indeed a lynchpin in the boys' lives. Moving on we are given many many scenes of the children's innocent physical closeness and touchingI can recall no shots in which they were not shown together. One scene particularly comes to mind A quiet time with 3 of them relaxed on a sofa the younger boy asleep against his brother's side and under his arm the mother holding her eldest's hand while stating to him her love for them both....but then suddenly asking how things are going with the son he responds as if thinking her meaning involves school. Then she corrects her question saying she means....how are things going for himself. After receiving his answer of no problems she continues to press and does so by asking that question which so many sons would just as soon never came up IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL ME? For me it is easy to surmise that at his then age of 14 or so the real meaning behind her question would likely escape him....for he eventually responds in the negative. Still the subject of this Closeness between the 2 boys comes up again and is discussed between the mother and her Ex...though no course of action to confront it is ever arrived at by any parent.NEVERTHELESS Be that as it may Closeness usually has to lead somewhere....does it not? So....following their mother's unexpected death when the brothers are likely in their early and later 20s respectively IT HAPPENS. We've reached a point where we are made witness to a most unusual and sexually provocative scene. A scene in which....while alone in their home....standing before and facing one another....they begin a slow and sensual disrobing one item at a time....each one's eyes intently locked on the other as if caught in a spell.....until finally they step into each others arms. You WON'T forget this shot...probably one of a kind. AND don't dare push that button and go away!....for immediately following and without giving you time to cool down you'll be treated to a stunningly beautiful bedroom lovemaking scene. One in which love each for the other is declared. Then in their afterglow we are given a mantra for this unusual love of theirs a love which in reality harms no others. The younger brother states to his beloved...and us I LOVE YOU BECAUSE TO UNDERSTAND OUR LOVE THEY'D NEED TO TURN THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN! ....There is little else for this viewer to say...other than there has never been a more beautiful painting of 2 men together than the camera gives us in this scene. I won't even tempt you with descriptions of the bathroom scene which follows....other than to say HOT!!.NOTABLE Both adult leads are beautiful men.....well chosen for their roles. Particularly Joao Gabriel Vasconcellos as elder brother Francisco who makes us feel his love and his loss.....but also Rafael Cardoso as the adult younger brother Thomas who lightens our hearts as he does Francisco's. The 2 young actors pictured in earlier childhood do a bangup job as well.  Older stars portraying both the fathers and especially Julia Lemmertz as Mom have wellknown careers in their country's TV  Cinema areas.  Cinematography is also praiseworthy. AND NOT SO NOTABLE An apparent storyline gap of near 15 years presents a potential problem regarding the manner in which the lovemaking scene described above was set up. To me the brothers' actions appear as if they are beginning their sexual activity for the very first time tho I admit the possibility it's a ritual they enjoy when initiating sex. Certainly with the closeness shown between these 2 young lads and where it leads it is hard to conceive that their mid and late teen years together were not sexually active.FINALLY I'll conclude here and allow you to find for yourself what the effects of a possible long distance separation will be upon our lead characters....and what you might see their fate to be at film's conclusion.".

I know this movie is about two brothers who are in the middle of this passion but that is beside the point. Being related only emphasizes the insularity of the two boys' love its uniqueness. This movie is really about a love so ideal that it TRANSCENDS convention and conflict. Thomas and Francisco were meant to love each other and nothing else seems to matter. The details of life  friends family career arguments jealousies  are dealt with superfluously marginally. It doesn't matter compared to the opera that is the love between the two men. The only tension that can threaten that type of love is separation its effects beautifully displayed by Francisco. The ending could be no other. The '8' comes from the conventions of storytelling in a movie  characters and scenarios that add the mundane details to a love that soars above them.

All the film had told me so far was that these two young brothers were very close and some of the adults in their lives thought they were too close. That could have been established much more effectively in about five minutes. Fast forward fifteen years the boys are in their early twenties their mother dies and they decide that is the excuse they have been waiting for to have sex. Really? I stopped watching and came here to see if anyone else shared my impression and found a few who did. And even the praise of the reviewers who loved it confirmed my sense that this is not worth watching. The dialogue and music are slow and dreamy the photography misty and glowing the acting solemn and earnest. And nothing happens. I fastforwarded through the second half just to see if there was anything erotic I'm gay and even the sex scenes were boring. The guys are attractive but again nothing happens.So they have a sexual relationship so what? There's no tension no drama no reality. The fact that they are brothers never really seems like an issue so they could be any two codependents addicted to the idea of love. They live in a dream world where no one else ages and no one disapproves of anything. Everyone is very serious and earnest and honest and loving and it's all sickly sweet and empty. It's a fairy tale so if you like fairy tales about incest you might enjoy this. Otherwise don't waste your time.".

This was Sid James' last Carry On film and he is sorely missed as he was a great comic talent. Of course Joan Sims and Kenneth Williams also give their all and they are always fun to watch also. Enjoy the foolishness the sexual innuendos the sharp one liners. If you like British comedy you'll like this. Its not the best Carry On but its fun it makes you laugh and thats as good of an endorsement as you'll ever need.";

	schema:reviewBody "England is rife with lawlessness and highway robbers but the Bow Street Runners are on the case  using all manner of traps and tricks to round the criminals up. However one robber has evaded captured and succeeded in even giving Sir Roger Daley a bloody nose in front of his own men. Thus Captain Fancey is assigned to go undercover and catch the famous Dick Turpin and bring him to justice. However the cunning Dick is not going to be caught that easily and for years has moved incognito under the alias Rev Flasher.Although the better entries in the Carry On series tend to be the costume spoofs this is not one of them. The story is a reasonable stab at having a frame for the jokes to roughly hang within but the problem is that the material just isn't there to deliver the goods. The humour will appeal to some because it is broad and the usual doubleentendre stuff but for me it was lacking in any wit or intelligence and just felt like someone had collected up all the rejected gags from other films and put them together in a script of sorts. So yes some of it is funny but mostly it is uninspired and far from being the series at its best.A lot of it seems to rely on the actors being a draw in themselves and it shows because most of them force their personalities forward in place of good material. James is the most obviously guilty of this as he overdoes his trademark laugh and is larger than the character. Windsor likewise just trades on her body and giggle Williams is soso but cannot raise the poor material he is handed and he can't rely on Jack Douglas for any help. Bresslaw at least gets a different role from his usual ethnic facepaint stuff but Jacques Connor and Sims all seem stuck with nothing to do in minor roles. They all appear to be trying but none of them can make the material more than it is  lacklustre.Overall this is a broad and crude affair that might please some Carry On fans but will be far too basic to be of interest to the majority of viewers. The cast are all trying hard but really the material isn't there for them to work with and the whole thing ends up being disappointing even by the standards of Carry On movies.".

I usually agree that this film is a bit of a hit and miss but i think now that is it very good up there with Carry On Henry for historicals not Cleo though.Sid James is looking older but he can still pull it off. Critics may say that James was too old to be lusting after someone of Barbara Windsor's age but the situation the characters are put in two highway manwomen you can believe this girl would have a relationship with the elder man because of the work they do together. So i think they work well together in this film.This is the only film i can think of in the series that starts of pretty dull then gets funnier towards the middle and end. Very good ending with Hattie Jacques on the organ pumping for all she's worth.Kenneth Williams and Jack Douglas have good chemistry but it's really just the same characters Williams and Peter Butterworth played in Don't Lose Your Head. The premise of the film is very similar!As for the rest of the cast Peter Butterworth shines in the drag sequence as he ogles over Joan Sims' bosoms. Ms Sims doesn't get much to do but she's always funny and my favourite of the team. Kenneth Connor is excellent as the ageing Constable such a great character actor. And Hattie Jacques excells as Miss Hoggett the nosey housekeeper. Very good in the sequence where she is listening at the door.The Carry Ons never felt the same after Talbot Rothwell left. There was something no quite right about Behind England Emmannuelle or Columbus. I don't think anyone could recapture his style he was born to write Carry On humour.The team was also breaking up at this point. Obviously the style was getting tired and in reality Peter Rogers and Gerald Thomas should have called it a day after this one. The one's that followed were good in places but never hit the mark.".

Set in the 1750s this one tells the story of Captain Desmond Fancey's attempts to apprehend the notorious highwayman Dick Turpin. Turpin's crimes all take place near the villages of Upper and Lower Dentures so he heads there with his sergeant. Not knowing what Turpin looks like they wish to remain incognito and inform nobody but the local rector or their true identity of course the rector is none other then Dick Turpin! In the course of their investigations they learn that Turpin has an unusual birthmark but its location which isn't hard to guess means the sergeant ends up following anybody heading to the pub's gents for a quick examination! Turpin is keen to be rid of the two London policemen so manages to trick them into getting arrested for his crimes by the local constable unfortunately he writes to London to inform them of 'Turpin's' arrest so the real Turpin must come up with another plan.I was quite surprised at some of the film's content as I didn't expect to hear so many dick jokes or to see Barbara Windsor in a see through top on Sunday afternoon television! While there were a few too many such jokes some earned a snigger and there were quite a few more wholesome laughs. It also helped that there was a decent story and the fact that nearly all the Carry On team were present and on top form. Sid James was great as TurpinReverend Flasher as was Kenneth Williams as Capt. Fancey. Other regulars present included the aforementioned Barbara Windsor Hattie Jacques Joan Sim and Kenneth Connor although the last of these had certainly slipped in the rankings being reduced to the small role of the local constable rather than being one of the top names he was in the earlier films. The only character I wasn't amused by was Jack Douglas's Sgt. Jock Strapp although I'm not sure if that is down to the acting or just the character. If you are a fan of the Carry On series this is worth watching just don't expect the innocence of the earlier outings.".

Great Britain and France were not getting along particularly well at the time but Sims and her girls speak a universal language to those who listen.This was Sid James's farewell big screen appearance the cap of a grand career that started in British music hall.

The story is thin and there are a lot of innuendos and some of them are very smutty. But with the costumes and sets and such as good as they are the film looks really good and the music is quirky and energetic. The script is funny and well delivered on the whole while the film is well paced. Carry on Dick is probably chiefly memorable for being Sidney James's last Carry On. He is very good as TurpinReverend Flasher if occasionally overdoing it with his trademark laugh. He is well supported by Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jaques but Barbara Windsor gives one of her best performances and even Jack Douglas is good. In conclusion entertaining I think and on a side note it wasn't the same when Talbot Rothwell left and James died the writing became crass and most of the entries then were woeful I felt. 710 for Carry on Dick.

The team had certainly pushed the boundaries this is more smutty then usual jokes galore about diddlers and bid Dick. It's still mind by today's standards though. Laughs galore Sid and Kenneth Williams are hilarious the timing and delivery impeccable as always. Williams and Jack Douglas make a fine duo it's the facial expressions from the former that get the laughs. Barbara Windsor is excellent in this film but it's the interaction with Sid James that I find fascinating you can see the real life closeness that existed between the pair very strongly.Whenever I watch this one I always think how underused Patsy Rowlands was too often only having minor roles but wonderfully talented. Hattie Jacques is underused here the delivery is fine but her part was poor.Great production values fabulous costumes and a funny and in keeping score. Kenneth William's wig is a character in its own right.It's a must for Carry on fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Caught a preview screening of this movie tonight in NYC. I am 26 years old now so I was in 8th grade when the original came out.Thought the first two were awesome but thought the third noticeably drifted away from what made the first two special.A little too much Stifler.For American Pie 4 when I saw the preview I was excited to see them all back together but I didn't know what to expect. I know Hollywood loves destroying sequels and I didn't know how they were going to create a story line out of characters that really haven't been together in forever.Fear not. I though this movie was almost as good as the original. Two hours of nonstop crackingup but none of it was forced. They brought back all the characters but in a way that didn't seem thrown together or ingenuine. It was about 2 hours and 15 minutes long but not once did I think this was dragging. They did a nice job explaining where everyone has been and it didn't really seem awkward.The best part of it is the story is about all 5 of the original guys and their relationship with women and sex at their current juncture 31 years old. Each have their own issues too married have kids hate their jobs hate their lifestyle etc. and the movie is kind of about them all resolving their that over the course of a reunion weekend. It's the American Pie which is most similar too the first one. All the old couples from highschool OzHeather KevinVicky JimMichelle rehash their past feelings.Another great thing about the film is that Stifler's character is written back in the style of American Pie 1 and 2 which I loved. His part is not over bearing like the Wedding. Kevin Finch and Oz play much bigger roles than they did they did in the third.There a couple new characters but none of them are annoying or take up too much of the story all those parts are well cast. Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mom are hilarious on screen together. Jim's Dad is the funniest he has ever been but again not in an over the top way. All in all it's a wellwritten wellrounded film with some good plot twists. Tons of references too the old films. Literally all of the obscure characters from the first two make an appearance at some point.BOTTOM LINE 910. If you are a fan of the American Pie films especially 1  2 your going to LOVE this movie. Worth the .".

	schema:reviewBody "I was 16 when the original American Pie came out. It was a film that spoke to me greatly. It was my generation's Ridgemont High you might say. The sequels too were enjoyable. But to say that the series didn't wear itself thin might be an understatement. And don't even get me started on the direct to DVD creations. However American Reunion surprised me with a couple entertaining trailers and nostalgia grabbed me by the balls. Having had the opportunity to see an early screening I am happy to say that this is the series I remembered it being.There's nothing too outside the norm for an American Pie series film. We find the original cast living life over ten years after the original film. Jim and Michelle are having a few marital issues and raising a kid. Stiffler is working a job as a temp dealing with an ahole boss. Finch has become a mystery of sorts. Oz is a big shot sportscaster with a supermodel girlfriend. And Kevin is a stay at home husband slash architect. The group returns for their high school reunion and reconnect with each other and their fellow classmates. But this is a film that is as much about the audience seeing it as it is about our favorite foursome. As stated the film isn't remarkable in the plot sense. Unlike the previous films there isn't a big endgame to cling to. There's no goal of losing virginity like the first film finding true love like the second film or having a successful wedding like the third film. Instead these characters just deal with being back in their hometown and their own individual issues.If anything the film is highly nostalgic. It's filled with characters and situations reminiscent of the previous films. It still manages to surprise with many of it's shenanigans from the boys having to get out of some awkward tight spots to Jim once again finding himself in extremely embarrassing situations. Heck we even get a few truly surprising moments that are also very laugh out loud. But for the audience that grew up on these films it will be like a trip down memory lane. It's fun seeing all your favorite characters return from the underused ones to all of the main cast. Even seeing characters like Oz or Vicky whose real life counterparts haven't had much of a career since the American Pie film are pleasant to see again. And they all do a great job of reprising these characters. Best of all the film is hilarious with plenty of laugh out loud moments.My biggest qualm with the film is it's lack of a strong central plot. Nostalgia only goes so far and there's really nothing to cling to here in terms of something these characters are working for. By comparison there was the ever present goal of the guys losing their virginity. Here their personal issues seem meager. Yes Jim and Michelle are having issues but you never really feel like it won't work out. Knowing these characters you already know they love each other. The same goes for most of the others whom you always feel will come out on top. This despite a few surprises. And with the whole movie revolving around the up coming reunion an event which doesn't seem to have much affect on the direction these characters take there's never a real sense of character growth. Instead you're just hanging out with the boys again watching them get into trouble.But this is okay. It's okay because the movie is funny. Much of what happens resembles the kind of humorous situations from the other films. There are some truly laugh out loud moments and the surprises will have you howling. Despite my nostalgic interest in the film I found some genuinely fun and surprising moments. For fans this should be a no brainer. The film is definitely worth the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening last night at the Mall of America in Minnesota. This movie will not disappoint anyone who is a fan of the original movies or the characters. It has all of the grossout humor sexual tension and most importantly the heart. It doesn't break in any new ground but gives great closure to all of the characters. The laughs also are spread out well from start until during the credits. In face I think the first 3 minutes was the funniest I've ever seen in a movie. Even my wife who is just a casual fan laughed more at this movie than any other comedy I've taken her to. Stifler is back!!".

And you know what? It was amazing!Simply because they made it as good as the original and the second movie. I liked the first two but I personally think that the third one drifted away from the original theme a bit I also liked how they made Stifler return to his original state. Crazy as always doing things the way he wants to do. The other thing that I found good was that they briefly showed what everyone does after high school and at what position they are at the moment.All in all great film what else could you expect from these guys I'd say go see it definitely worth your time!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw an advance screening of American Reunion in Chicago tonight. Sean WIlliam Scott and Jason Biggs both attended and spoke with the audience before the movie and were very grateful and genuine about the movie. And were very funny too. This was the perfect way to end the series. And I hope they do end it here because it was perfect. NOT that I wouldn't see American Old Folks Home but let's not let it get to that. All the characters were just as great as they were in the first 2 films. Oz Kevin Finch Jim and of course the man who comes with most of the laughs Stifler are all back. As well as pretty much every single speaking roll from the original movie. I will say this is as good if not better than the original. The story is great and very realistic to what most of us are going through today. We hate our jobs we're married or in some kind of middle aged rut. We still just want to be the kids we were in high school but it's hard because as much as we don't like to admit it we have all grown up. Never fear though with all the boring life stuff the gang is all back and come with many many fun moments and get themselves into quite a few pickles. I'd say as many as the first 2 movies combined. But it doesn't feel forced or like they threw it in the movie just because they felt they had to. Everything flowed naturally and kept me and the entire audience laughing from beginning till the credits rolled. All of the characters end up in a great place at the end and I can thoroughly say that this will be a classic. No doubt about it. Ton of laughs it had heart makes you feel like you can relate to these guys more than ever. I've grown up with these guys and we all have friends like this. I was sad it ended so soon even though it was over 2 hours. It was still sad to see the guys go one last time. Overall American Reunion was on par if not better than the original. The original will always be a classic in our eyes but this will be a close second.To the next step1010".

To this day it and the two true sequels remain some of favourite comedies. Sure the American Pie 2 and American Pie Wedding weren't as good as the first but they all provided copious amounts of goodspirited yet raunchy and filthy laughs with characters you really liked. After a slew of shockingly bad directtovideo sequels I was extremely excited to see the gang return for one final film in American Reunion. These are characters that have been gone from the screen far too long if you ask me and their return although not as good as the first is still a hilarious trip down memory lane.It's been awhile since the gang have been together 13 years to be exact which is the year their high school reunion takes place. Jim Jason Biggs is married to Michelle Alyson Hannigan with a son Oz Chris Klein is a sports news reporter and engaged to model Mia Katrina Bowden Finch has dropped off the radar Eddie Kaye Thomas Kevin Thomas Ian Nicholas is married and an architect and Stifler Seann William Scott is a PA at a big firm. When they meet up for their reunion they are once again up to their old shenanigans.Writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg stick to the same formula which made the others so successful and it worked. The situations these guys get themselves into are weaved into the story well nothing seems forced. All the actors do a fantastic job of bringing these characters back to their old selves it's like they were born to play these roles. Obviously the movie is somewhat predictable with certain characters ending up with another person. By the end American Reunion has come full circle and for the people who grew up with American Pie as a teenager it is nice to see it wrapped up as well as it has been.35".

The boys are back for another crazy sexual and over thetop adventure.Since the last film in 2003 I thought they wouldn't be able to perform as well together. But from start to finish they played their roles as if they never left. This movie will definitely keep you laughing especially if you are a long time fan. Not to mention Jim's dad finally got the screen time he deserved. Now I don't think it was as good as it could have been. The plot as mentioned in other reviews was plain. But all in all It was an amazing sequel to the series. Better than the first? I don't think so. But as good as the first? YES!I do recommend watching the last three American Pie movies before going to see this. You will understand the movie much clearer and not to mention the little surprises will have you rolling on the floor laughing.Cons It wasn't dirty enough. The jokes were hysterical but I wanted more! I wanted more F bombs sex jokes and pie humping! But I guess that is what the previous Pie films were for If you are a fan you will enjoy this film. You will NOT be disappointed.1010 stars".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review American Reunion";
	schema:reviewBody "It was 1999 that American Pie launched what would be a series of teenage sex comedies given a relatively cost effective formula loaded with nudity and toilet humour that exploded at the box office and made everyone sit up to take note which of its cast members would go on to make it big. The film spawned two more films that would culminate in a wedding before going direct to video in the many spin offs lie Band Camp Naked Mile Beta House and Book of Love that had very little links to the main characters. It's almost a decade already and it's perhaps time to put those spin off films to rest and bring back the original cast and their characters to the big screen in a logical reunion. And why not given that the individual cast members never really made it to the big league that coming together in a show of unity may rekindle memories of an audience who grew up with them from 1999's original and in some ways provide one last shot in the arm for their individual careers.And so it's a warm hello to old friends with whom we have last left off without much of a closure for all the characters and like a real reunion we discover just what our friends have been up to during the course of their absence in our lives. Some are successful others not and some are depending on what definition you're using. There's Jason Biggs as Jim Levenstein who's still married to Michelle Alyson Hannigan with a kid in tow and having trouble with their nonexistent sex lives Oz Chris Klein being a successful television sports anchor and celebrity with a model girlfriend Katrina Bowden Kevin Thomas Ian Nicholas who's also happily married but dreading a very routine lifestyle filled with TV and more TV who would have thought Finch Eddie Kaye Thomas being very much of an all round adventurer and Stifler Seann William Scott the jock who well according to unwritten rules finds himself in between jobs getting really nowhere in his career and still bearing a grudge towards Finch for nailing Stifler's Mom Jennifer Coolidge.Some things never change too as we usually find out during meet ups with old friends old flames and once rivals that when we rekindle the past we'll at times tangent into the what ifs. And there are plenty of such situations that make up the narrative of Reunion with Jim having to fend off the advances of his neighbour Kara Ali Cobrin whom he babysat a long time back and is now a nubile 18 year old eager to lose her virginity to Jim and both Oz and Kevin discovering old feelings with their exes Heather Mena Suvari and Vicky Tara Reid.

	onyx:emotionText "It was 1999 that American Pie launched what would be a series of teenage sex comedies given a relatively cost effective formula loaded with nudity and toilet humour that exploded at the box office and made everyone sit up to take note which of its cast members would go on to make it big. The film spawned two more films that would culminate in a wedding before going direct to video in the many spin offs lie Band Camp Naked Mile Beta House and Book of Love that had very little links to the main characters. It's almost a decade already and it's perhaps time to put those spin off films to rest and bring back the original cast and their characters to the big screen in a logical reunion. And why not given that the individual cast members never really made it to the big league that coming together in a show of unity may rekindle memories of an audience who grew up with them from 1999's original and in some ways provide one last shot in the arm for their individual careers.And so it's a warm hello to old friends with whom we have last left off without much of a closure for all the characters and like a real reunion we discover just what our friends have been up to during the course of their absence in our lives. Some are successful others not and some are depending on what definition you're using. There's Jason Biggs as Jim Levenstein who's still married to Michelle Alyson Hannigan with a kid in tow and having trouble with their nonexistent sex lives Oz Chris Klein being a successful television sports anchor and celebrity with a model girlfriend Katrina Bowden Kevin Thomas Ian Nicholas who's also happily married but dreading a very routine lifestyle filled with TV and more TV who would have thought Finch Eddie Kaye Thomas being very much of an all round adventurer and Stifler Seann William Scott the jock who well according to unwritten rules finds himself in between jobs getting really nowhere in his career and still bearing a grudge towards Finch for nailing Stifler's Mom Jennifer Coolidge.Some things never change too as we usually find out during meet ups with old friends old flames and once rivals that when we rekindle the past we'll at times tangent into the what ifs. And there are plenty of such situations that make up the narrative of Reunion with Jim having to fend off the advances of his neighbour Kara Ali Cobrin whom he babysat a long time back and is now a nubile 18 year old eager to lose her virginity to Jim and both Oz and Kevin discovering old feelings with their exes Heather Mena Suvari and Vicky Tara Reid. Stifler faces challenges at work especially that threatens to cancel his attendance at the school reunion ball while Finch seems to get onto a real relationship with Selena Dania Ramirez.There's also the return of the evergreen favourite Jim's dad Eugene Levy now a widower but still finding time to talk about sexuality very openly to an always embarrassed Jim and that of a slew of supporting characters from the earlier films that I will not name to contain the surprise.

I'm not going to go much into the plot except that it's simply a reunion as all the characters are here to return which it what you'd expect coming into this.

Can Jim stave off the advances of young Kara? Will the other guys meet up with their old flames? Will Stifler cause more trouble with his high school pranks?Yes.This is a wholly predictable and unimaginative retread of an American classic American Pie which first hit theaters 13 years ago.

Thus I was very pleased that American Reunion presented as a tremendous movie in it's own right whilst having everything that made the first 2 movies lovable and providing a lot of interesting story lines that make plenty of room for great jokes and heart felt moments.All in all I highly recommend anyone watch the movie. I understand that some people have different opinions and have certain boundaries when it comes to grossout humor but I definitely think the heart felt moments certainly outweigh the rest while still being wildly hilarious and clever.

	schema:reviewBody "Really it's important to say that I actually was a big fan of all of the previous American Pie movies but this latest establishment did absolutely nothing for me! The first American Pie movie made back in 1999 was one that changed the genre or at least sort of brought back the teenage sex comedies by making it fun and daring again. The series in my opinion continued in good form until this movie. Out of all the American Pie movies this is the absolute most redundant and less innovative one.It's maybe also partly because of it that ever since the first American Pie movie tons of similar movies got made and the bar got actually raised and the genre reinvented again by a couple of other genre movies. This movie does absolutely nothing to try to raise the bar again or become a relevant movie within its genre. Or maybe I'm just getting too old for these sort of movies and type of comedies but I highly doubt that since I actually do like to watch genre movies like this one from time to time such as most recently Project X for instance.The main premise itself actually sounded quite good and promising having a reunion with all of the characters from the first movie in it 13 years after the first movie and 9 years after American Wedding. But the thing is the movie does absolutely nothing with its concept.I don't feel that any the characters have progressed at all. They are still all the same and don't look to have matured very much. It would had been interesting to see how their lives progressed and eventually ended up all but the movie really doesn't know how to handle this. What's the point of having the characters look back while they haven't changed one bit. It already makes the main idea and concept of the movie an incredibly flawed one but there are far more problems with this movie.It just simply isn't a very well written or made movie. One of other problems with its story is that it wants to have far too many subplots in it. It also makes a movie called American Reunion shockingly little about an actual reunion. It doesn't even ever look or feel that some of these guys hadn't seen each other for years. It's just the same old same old with as a difference that we get to see a bunch of 30year old's doing teenage stuff which isn't all that compelling or tasteful in my opinion. It certainly also makes the comedy of this movie more lacking as well.And because the movie tries to focus on so many characters and their story lines none of them ever work out well enough. The movie doesn't develop or resolve any of them properly or satisfying enough while the movie obviously did had some good ideas in it. Another thing with this movie is that you first need to have seen at least the very first movie. This is not a standalone movie. It very much is a sequel that relies a lot on it that its viewers are already familiar with all of the characters and what happened to them in the previous movies. It actually is important to watch the previous three movie just prior to this one or else you will miss a lot. Literally almost every character from the first American Pie movie pops up into this one even if it's for just a couple of seconds. And even while I was a big fan of the first movies I had absolutely no idea any more who all of these people were or why they were relevant for this movie at all.A disappointment really and that is coming from a person who loved the first American Pie movies!510 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

On the whole 'American Reunion' is certainly a delight.";

It's a shame then that the material they're working with is halfbaked.

The breakout star of the film was Stifler played by Sean William Scott whose offensive and rude behavior was uproarious and solidified Stifler as one of the funniest characters in recent memory. The film went on to gross over 235 million dollars and was a surprise hit. In the two subsequent sequels not including the direct to DVD films the characters aged but never matured always finding themselves in precarious predicaments and as they grew up we grew up right along with them. In the newest film American Reunion the whole gang returns home to East Great Falls Michigan to celebrate their 10 year high school reunion 13 years later. The writing team of Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz who'd done a more than admirable job on the Harold and Kumar films were given writing and directing duties on American Reunion. I give both men credit for not trying to do too much and by sticking with the formula that made the prior movies so successful because if it's not broke don't fix it. Schlossberg and Hurwitz do a perfect job of putting the characters into situations many of us are all too familiar with some due to getting older and others due to our own stupidity. Unlike The Hangover 2 which recycled the same plot from The Hangover American Reunion continues the process of advancing the characters further into life. Yes some of the jokes are rehashed but sometimes no matter how much someone ages they never grow up. I'm pretty sure everyone has a friend like Jim that did something when he was younger that was so ridiculous that he'd never live it down ours goes by the name of Shmo and he's proud to be that guy. There's the friend that's a jock like Oz that would do anything to impress a girl the friend like Kevin that's the pretty boy and thinks he's destined to be with that one girl the friend that's the most mature of the bunch and acts a lot older than he actually is much like Finch and then there's Stifler the one guy that all he does is bust balls endlessly and is easily accepted as part of the group. I'd be willing to be I just described a good number of guys that hung out together growing up. Some of us even had a cool dad like Jim's played by Eugene Levy in every American Pie film including the direct to DVD movies. Although it took years for me to realize it Eugene Levy is the moral compass of the franchise and gives a rock steady as well as laugh out loud performance each time out. Similar to the previous three films the strength lies in the believability of what the guys go through reminiscent of experiences most lifelong friends may have gone through in life. That's not to say that everything that happens in the films is plausible but it is sure as hell funny watching it all unfold. American Reunion is vulgar crude filled with dirty jokes nudity and all kinds of raunchy behaviorand I love every single last minute of it. Next year will be my 20th year high school reunion of which I won't be going. I had a number of acquaintances while in high school but no one that I'd call a true friend. The true friends I've had in life I'm happy to say are now lifelong friends of mine. The time we spent together were great and over the years we've made a lot of memories some low key ones such as sitting up all night playing video games or poker and other outrageous drunken ones.okay there were a lot of drunken ones in which I was always the sober guys. In all the years that have passed my core group of friends has always remained close and I'm thankful that we've all stayed in touch over the years. It's movies like this and the others in the franchise that stir up memories and conversations that throughout the years are worth remembering enjoying and laughing about 13 25 or even 50 years later.

Jules Stein's music is not the kind that one keeps repeating after viewing the film.The only thing that hasn't kept well is the Technicolor.

	schema:headline " A great star impeded by poor material and inappropriate makeup";
	schema:reviewBody "If anyone wants to understand why the old movie studios could not withstand the competition from television they should study Tonight And Every Night which exemplifies what was wrong with the old Hollywood studio system.The film stars Rita Hayworth one of the most charismatic and talented actresses ever to appear in movies. She is dressed by Jean Louis and photographed by Rudolph Mate. Apparently Columbia and Harry Cohn thought that was enough. It most certainly is not! The screenplay is utter rubbish. There is almost no story the dialogue in places is embarrassing and the scenes where Lee Bowman pitches Rita Hayworth are so badly written  and make the Bowman character so unappealing  that it is impossible to believe any woman would have found the man attractive. The only interesting aspect to the story is the unrequited love Marc Platt's character has for Rita's showgirl and the way he reacts when he realises there is no hope for him. Unfortunately the screenplay does not develop this and instead lumbers towards a clichridden happy resolution between Rita and Lee Bowman.The songs have very little melody despite having been written by Jule Styne one the great tunesmiths of 20th Century popular music. Even worse the dance numbers do not give Rita a chance to shine. All Jack Coles' routines are energetic jitterbug affairs with arms and legs all over the place.

	onyx:emotionText "If anyone wants to understand why the old movie studios could not withstand the competition from television they should study Tonight And Every Night which exemplifies what was wrong with the old Hollywood studio system.The film stars Rita Hayworth one of the most charismatic and talented actresses ever to appear in movies. She is dressed by Jean Louis and photographed by Rudolph Mate. Apparently Columbia and Harry Cohn thought that was enough. It most certainly is not! The screenplay is utter rubbish. There is almost no story the dialogue in places is embarrassing and the scenes where Lee Bowman pitches Rita Hayworth are so badly written  and make the Bowman character so unappealing  that it is impossible to believe any woman would have found the man attractive. The only interesting aspect to the story is the unrequited love Marc Platt's character has for Rita's showgirl and the way he reacts when he realises there is no hope for him. Unfortunately the screenplay does not develop this and instead lumbers towards a clichridden happy resolution between Rita and Lee Bowman.The songs have very little melody despite having been written by Jule Styne one the great tunesmiths of 20th Century popular music. Even worse the dance numbers do not give Rita a chance to shine. All Jack Coles' routines are energetic jitterbug affairs with arms and legs all over the place. There is not one elegant routine in the movie not one moment of grace and poise.

	schema:headline " Good musical tragedy set during the Nazi blitz of London showcasing Rita Hayworth Janet Blair and Marc Platt.";
	schema:reviewBody "Another film showcasing two of Columbia's musical stars Rita Hayworth and Janet Blair in this Technicolor yarn about a London theater that continued performances even during bombing raids during the early part of WWII. Of course when this picture was being made late in the war England was still being bombed but by V1s and V2s not by planes. Rita had recently starred in the Technicolor musical Cover Girl with Gene Kelly. Prior to that she had starred in the musical Technicolor My Gal Sal  while loaned to Fox and a couple of BW musicals as Fred Astaire's dance partner. In this film while Rita is still the star the younger Janet Blair is a strong second lead as her virtual sister in the theater troupe. They sometimes solo dance or sing sometimes sing as a duo and sometimes lead a troupe of dancers. Janet's musical forte was singing having once been a band singer while Rita was primarily a dancer her singing being dubbed as usual.Dancer Marc Platt is also featured at times having been included in the original Broadway Oklahoma. He would much later be one of the brothers in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and be included in the film version of Oklahoma. Marc's introduction to the film troupe is quite comical. He claimed he was self taught dancing to radio music while working at a loom in a cotton mill! Thus a radio is turned on and he improvises dance to various quite different types of song and even a harangue by Hitler! The dance supervisorFlorence Bates as Ms. Tolliver is impressed but thinks him too much of a loose cannon for her shows. He also initially despairs at the prospect of many repetitive performances. But with the persuasion of Rita and Janet he and Ms. Tolliver finally reach an agreement for a role for him.Although 30 years older than Rita Florence Bates had been in films for only a few years previously being a math teacher lawyer and businesswoman. She naturally acquired many roles as authority figures or aunts until her death.'Professor' Lamberti'  an aging vaudeville performer does his antiquated comical xylophone routine with Rita sometimes parading in the background in place of his usual striptease girl.The final key player is Lee Bowman as Rita's eventual love interest displacing Marc who had secret hopes of marrying her. Bowman has been dismissed by some reviewers as inappropriate for his role having been left at the alter by Rita in favor of Gene Kelly's character in the previous Cover Girl. Cast as a handsome dashing RAF squadron leader he does seem too mild mannered to ring true besides lacking any hint of a British accent. Perhaps we was a Canadian strangely being assigned to Canada at film's end? But his father shows up wanting to meet Rita. Too bad John Sutton wasn't available as a more convincing genuine RAF man as in A Yank in the RAF. Bowman's romance with Rita seems problematic. At first Rita resisted his advances then suddenly changes her mind as they kiss. By film's end  she's in a quandary whether to marry him and move at least temporarily to Canada or remain as the star of the theater troupe after the sudden deaths of Janet and Marc in an air raid.The fictional Music Box Theater takes on the fame of the actual Windmill Theater noted for not cancelling its shows during bombings except when so ordered by the government. The Windmill's shows were largely patterned on those of the Parisian Folies Bergeres and Moulin Rouge which usually featured nude females. Not so in this film where the productions are typical American stage shows and there is nary a pretense of British accent heard except by a few minor players. And yes the big map of Great Britain in the background does suggest that Wales is a province of England. Maybe they assumed that most Americans thought that G.B. and England were the same?The film begins with a song and dance to What Does an English Girl Think of a Yank? with Rita and the other 'girls' initially dressed in drab schoolgirlpresumably capes and high hats. When a bevy of dancing US sailors show up they quickly discard this garb revealing short skirts underneath each girl with a different color and dance en mass with the sailors. No Janet Blair here because her character is deceased according to the later story this being 1944 not when the rest of the story takes place retrospectively in the early war years. Wellregarded Jack Cole was the chief choreographer as he was in Rita's other musicals Cover Girlalong with Gene Kelly Gilda and Down to Earth. Apparently he was Rita's dance partner in this first number. All the dance numbers were filmed first as Rita was pregnant and they didn't want it to show. The next big production number to You Excite Me provides Rita's best dancing exhibition in my opinion along with a backup malefemale chorus in Moorish?I think garb. Later Janet and Rita in colorful long johns sing The Boy I Left Behind while lounging on their beds. Janet later has her long solo with the title song later followed by the too brief Anywhere. The final dance production is done to Cry and You Cry Alone featuring Rita Marc and a chorus with masks. Rita then cries alone on stage in the final rendition of the title song after her stage pals die in a bombing and she chooses not to accompany her husband? to Canada.".

Because it is a dance hall the singing and dancing that occur look like scaleddown versions of a Ziegfeld Follies showexactly the sort of stagy musical I dislike. However due to a nice romance between Rita Hayworth and Lee Bowman though it does develop way too quickly and a few good songs particularly the emotional and heartwrenching one at the conclusion the film is an amiable timepasser. However for fans of STAR WARS I do recommend you see this film just for one musical number featuring Miss Hayworth.

The film runs 162 minutes not 158 as stated on the IMDb title page. The old version was very good and this newer version makes the film even better. Either way you have a solid war movie.For men  and that's who will primarily watch this movie because it's a guy's flick with no romance and no women leads  this keeps the action coming but without overdoing it. You can different kinds of action scenes too not just people shooting at one another.I also appreciated the photography. It's a good visual movie. The added footage looked sharper and clearer than the previously shown but either way it was nicely filmed and directed. Of course the director is the famous Sam Fuller who did a number of tough film noirs among other things.Speaking of tough the person who makes this movie a notch above average is Lee Marvin. He is just excellent as the toughontheoutsidebutsofthearted underneath commanding officer known only as The Sergeant. With his deep voice and weathered face Marvin makes for an effective leader of tough guys. The language was much milder in here than you find in more modern films although it can be crude in a few spots. There are no fwords and about seven usages of the Lord's name in vain. However there are a number of sexual references some crude but hey that's guy talk. All the young soldiers were good too. It was especially interesting to see babyfaced Star Wars' star Mark Hamill playing one of the soldiers in the unit called The Big Red One.The story with narration by one of the soldiers tells of Marvin and his handful of men who travel and do battle from North Africa to Sicily then Italy the beaches of Normandy on D Day and into Germany in addition to a few other memorable stops such as an insane asylum.It's long but I never found it boring and the men never stay too long in one spot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Less than 5 years after the Vietnam War officially ended Director and acclaimed but aged film writer Sam Fuller attempted to recount the experiences he encountered while serving as an infantry soldier in the European Theatre of WW2.

As his career ended and the world changed he decided to make a go of his life long pet project... to make a film about the REAL story of WW2 about his own experiences in the Big Red One or The First Infantry Division.Too ahead of it's time to be appreciated during it's birth and too dated to be appreciated in hindsight.Some of the other user comments suggest this film is inferior to modern war films.

The Big Red One tells the story from a WW2 Vet's point of view Sam Fuller and is wonderfully acted by a WW2 vet Lee Marvin. Perhaps the last film to have such credits.Sure The Big Red One is cheesy and harkens to a time when war films were more about the characters then the violence. Still there is something charming about the scripting and Lee Marvin holds the movie together while being surrounded by actors who were trendy on the cheap for 1979. The film also has technical inaccuracy as in the Sherman tanks used as Panzers. However the real strength of the film is in the script and not in the battles. It breaks ground in it's defiance of films like the Sands of Iwa Jima. The soldier is not a clean sterile fighter for the holiest do goodynest army of all time he is a human being locked in a battle for survival and most importantly he hasn't lost his sense of humor or his libido.Regardless of it's dated almost 70's TV movie feel I must mention that this film was first to show DDay in a light other than that cast by The Longest Day and uses some very clever cinematography to illustrate the violence. Sam Fuller consciously decided to make the battles less violent and choose to focus on the characters instead depicted the main characters as cynical and the fallen as humorous tragically short lived figures. This film also was first to introduce words like replacement nonComs and Krouts to the war movie dictionary. It has the entire bangalore scene from Saving Private Ryan although merely a concept compared to SPR and shows North Africa Italy France Germany and a concentration camp. Before this film WW2 was only depicted in such an epic manor that Bible films are seemingly tame.THE BOTTOM LINE This film was one of the last war pictures to emerge from the dying studio system and is comparable in the way of battles to The Green Berets Longest Day etc. However it shines in the script category. and was first to show soldiers as young clumsy men and not heroes. It attempts almost too much and that is it's strongest limitation. Still a must see for war movie fans who can appreciate the older films. 710.".

However I was about 15 when I saw it and many teenagers of my generation still enjoyed feature films about the second world war . Alas a lot has happened in the film world not to mention my life so when I saw it again at the weekend I was very much underwhelmed by the movie First of all I found it rather disjointed and episodic . In many ways THE BIG RED ONE laid the foundations for BAND OF BROTHERS but whereas that acclaimed mini series dedicates the first episode to jump school training followed by nine one hour episodes from June 1944 to the Summer of 1945  this movie has a running time of less than two hours featuring a timeframe that lasts from Spring 1942 to May 1945 which seems a bad idea with hindsight Cut to Algeria 1942  cut to Sicily 1943  cut to Normandy 1944 etc . Also THE BIG RED ONE lacks a budget big enough to make the film convincing  Well it was made by Lorimar the company who brought us DALLAS . No matter where the action takes place the landscape resembles sunny California especially the beaches of Western france which looks suspicously like the same place BAY WATCH is filmed  every expense has been saved where location filming is concerned . Im also surprised I didnt notice something from my first viewing and thats the German tiger tank not being a tiger tank at all but it being an American Sherman  and strange that you never see two tanks side by side . No doubt the production team couldnt afford to hire more than one tank . And looking back on this film 20 years later after seeing APOCALYPSE NOW  A BRIDGE TOO FAR  CROSS OF IRON  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN  THE THIN RED LINE and BLACK HAWK DOWN I cant say the battle scenes in THE BIG RED ONE are all that impressive to me in 2003.THE BIG RED ONE  does have a few good points . First of all it does make mention of the British contribution to the war which is something you dont see in American films in recent times . Theres an interesting subplot  Though its painfully underwritten  about Mark Hamills character being a coward . Theres also a great line about it  Being okay to kill sane people but not insanes ones ?  . But the best part of the movie is a moving segment featuring Lee Marvins tough Sarge befriending a child whos just been liberated from a Nazi death camp  though once again this is skated over far too quickly in a film thats got too many negatives and not enough positives . As I said I waited 20 years between seeing it for the first and second time and could happily wait for another 20 years before seeing it a third time".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film quite a few times and have always been somewhat puzzled about it. There was no doubt that it had some of the most emotive scenes of any war film but seemed fractured. At times there seemed to be far more realism in it's morality than other films which was understandable since Sam Fuller actually served with The Big Red One at this time so much of it is a first hand account of events and attitudes. I have now read some of the background to the making of the filmI think in the L.A. Timeswhich now makes sense of the flaws in the film. Apparently Sam Fuller's budget was cut to the minimum by the studios after a regime change and the original screenplay as shot was hacked to death by the same studio against Fuller's wishes. This was not the film he wanted to make but he made it. And it was not the film that he shot as is indicated by the very complete screenplay notes he made. I think it is Richard Schickel the noted reviewer of Time magazine who has laboured to find the missing outtakes and to put the film together in its complete form with over 40 minutes added to the length. Apparently this more complete cut significantly improves the film and adheres to Sam Fullers screenplay more accurately. This new cut is now playing to limited audiences and hopefully will be available on DVD. It must be emphasized that this is not the film that Fuller originally wanted to make as the budget was cut by 75. Some of the comments made by other reviewers on these pages are valid as to authenticity specifically in battle scenes. But Fuller did not have the budget that both the Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan had. It will be interesting to see the new cut. Hopefully it will flesh out what could have been one of the greatest Second World War films.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the past several months I've clicked by on television and seen that The Big Red One was on and I would check it out for a few minutes or so here and there as it were. I knew though once it became official that the New York film festival was premiering it that the reconstructed version of Samuel Fuller's epic was going to be seen as no longer being truncated. When it was over I felt as though like with his other films I've seen Pickup on South Street and Shock Corridor to a degree that I'd seen something special a work of art that's told with such straightforward precision it elevates the B genre. There is something about war that is like life usually a contradiction. There are scenes and instances in Fuller's film where confusion occurs and tragedy comes about as if it's springing out of nature. But what Fuller captures as well is the camaraderie so to speak of the platoon the humor the understanding of one another that strengthens when other soldiers come and go without much notice. And the strengths and humanity of the sergeant here portrayed in a performance that could possibly be better or at least on part with what was in The Dirty Dozen comes through clearest of all. The Big Red One at its extended length is one of Fuller's triumphs as a storyteller infusing his own experiences in the first battalion the cigar that reappears with one character signify who he made as his kind of alterego as well as others he fought with stories he heard etc. While it is a film that lends itself partly to the ideals of the oldfashioned WW2 films it's very modern in its personal take on the situations battle sequencesoutcomes and the dynamics of the characters. To put it another way what Oliver Stone was to Vietnam Samuel Fuller was to WW2 to an extent. Though his version of for instance the invasion of Omaha beach doesn't have the grainy documentary feel of Saving Private Ryan the realism and suspense and chaos it all there. Fuller's experience as a journalist  his sense of detail and pacing in the scenes  is what gives that sequence involving Marvin and his men among others such truth. Along with the Israeli cinematographer Adam Greenburg who would go on to lens the first two Terminator films The Big Red One brings forth numerously unforgettable images. The climax in and of itself in which the quote I mentioned is put to the test for Mark Hammil's Pvt. Griff is extraordinary. The shots the faces and usage of light and the acting by him and the others brought to me some of the strangest emotional reaction not as in crying but empathizing I ever felt in a war film. In that respect the film in scenes like that and in the little moments with the four horsemen and their episodes are on the level if not superior to the emotional connectedness that Spielberg or Stone achieved.The script is a feat as a story of the steadfast progression of the soldiers from North Africa to Germany. However without the cast it might have faltered. Marvin pulls off a rounded character by the end and is successful in his own right but the four privates are the show. Most of the time if not all through Ward and Di Cicco not very well known actors to me before viewing this film are very dependable for some comic and sensible interludes. Carradine's Zab Fuller's reincarnation is in a performance of insight amusement and is a crucial piece to the film. It is Hammil then that comes away as most rewarding. His character is given a brilliant arc as the sharpshooter and in the cremation scene he proves he is far more valuable and compelling an actor most would give him credit for. My advice to people who think he can only play Skywalker and the occasional voiceover work is that this film is a mustview.I can say in wrapping up this review that there was not much at all to nitpick or complain about with this film long length and all. There may or may not have been truth to the Englishspeaking Germans but that didn't matter to me. When some of the dialog was not entirely clear as well that was not a problem. Almost every frame in particular a few key long shots on the beaches and some closeups of faces and eyes in the third act are like carefully molded sculpturespaintings of the condition of war. Bottom line I can't tell whether or not the film has bettered from the additions but I do know for certain I would not want to sit through a truncated version when these forty or so minutes fit in so well. So whether you've seen the original 1980 version or not when this new version comes to DVD it's for certain to be a collector's item.".

	schema:headline " Among the greatest WWII epics";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people hate The Big Red One. They call it farcical uneven clichd. They find it farcical I believe because the film revels in the absurdity of war rather than gloss over it. They would rather watch a film like Saving Private Ryan which ignores absurdity in favor of violence. These people find it uneven because the important scenes like the DDay and North African invasion take only a minute or two to conclude while other scenes less typical of a war movie spread out before us. They call it clichd because the movie is unsubtle in its treatment of character development and plot.I cannot agree with these beliefs. The Big Red One is not only one of the greatest WWII films it is also one of the greatest war movies.Sam Fuller's film which was butchered by the studio is the picaresque tale of 5 members of the First Infantry known because of their shoulder patch as the Big Red One. The film moves from one story to the next without spending too much time on any particular tale.The individual vignettes as they must vary in quality but on the whole are excellent. The Big Red One stirs within you a desire to run right out and tell your friends about this amazing scene or that.There's the soldier who loses his testicle the birthing scene in the belly of a tank Lee Marvin in Middle Eastern garb traipsing across a beach soldiers dug into holes over which a Panzer tank division travels the entire Mad House segment... The list goes on.Some people dislike the absurdest nature of several of this film's stories but for me those surreal touches make this film great.Without them and there are a lot you would be left with a very normal and very boring film. Using bandoleers as stirrups is genius as is the woman faking crazy as she whirls through a monastery slicing German throats.The performances are solid for this type of film but if you are looking for subtlety go elsewhere. Each character is drawn in broad strokes you never learn too much about them but you learn enough to understand who they are and why. Lee Marvin as usual is amazing. He is one of the great gruff actors of our time bringing a special intangible quality to every film in which I've seen him. He makes every movie he's in better just by showing up. There are too few actors about whom you can say that.Like the acting the direction is masculine but for a war movie that's a compliment. In some ways Fuller's direction here and in his other films reminds me of Hemmingway's writing  terse and effective. Both men believe in an economy of shots or words depending on their medium but through that economy they attain a muscular sort of poetry akin to the beauty of a horse's rippling muscles as it races on a plain. Fuller's direction here though not his best when compared to Underworld USA or Shock Corridor is still better than most especially considering that this was his first film in several years.All in all I find the Big Red One to be an exemplary war movie even in its emasculated format I cannot wait to see the restored 140 minute print which should improve upon scenes that feel to brief in this version. It's certainly no Apocalypse Now but it puts to shame most World War II epics before or since.".

	onyx:emotionText "A lot of people hate The Big Red One. They call it farcical uneven clichd. They find it farcical I believe because the film revels in the absurdity of war rather than gloss over it. They would rather watch a film like Saving Private Ryan which ignores absurdity in favor of violence. These people find it uneven because the important scenes like the DDay and North African invasion take only a minute or two to conclude while other scenes less typical of a war movie spread out before us. They call it clichd because the movie is unsubtle in its treatment of character development and plot.I cannot agree with these beliefs. The Big Red One is not only one of the greatest WWII films it is also one of the greatest war movies.Sam Fuller's film which was butchered by the studio is the picaresque tale of 5 members of the First Infantry known because of their shoulder patch as the Big Red One. The film moves from one story to the next without spending too much time on any particular tale.The individual vignettes as they must vary in quality but on the whole are excellent. The Big Red One stirs within you a desire to run right out and tell your friends about this amazing scene or that.There's the soldier who loses his testicle the birthing scene in the belly of a tank Lee Marvin in Middle Eastern garb traipsing across a beach soldiers dug into holes over which a Panzer tank division travels the entire Mad House segment... The list goes on.Some people dislike the absurdest nature of several of this film's stories but for me those surreal touches make this film great.Without them and there are a lot you would be left with a very normal and very boring film. Using bandoleers as stirrups is genius as is the woman faking crazy as she whirls through a monastery slicing German throats.The performances are solid for this type of film but if you are looking for subtlety go elsewhere.

	schema:reviewBody "Films about the Second World War were not particularly common in the postVietnam aftermath of the 1980s but 'The Big Red One' is one of the few exceptions. War films tend to fall into two categories. The first such as 'The Longest Day' or 'The Dambusters' concentrates on a single battle or episode in the war's history. The second such as 'In Which We Serve' or 'Twelve O'Clock High' or to take an example from another war the more recent 'Master and Commander' follows the fortunes of a unit of fighting men over a longer period. 'The Big Red One' is a film of the second type and details the experiences of a platoon of the First Infantry Division of the US Army. The title refers to the numeral which formed that division's badge. It concentrates on the veteran Sergeant and four of the soldiers fighting under him as they fight their way through the European theatre of war. Although other members of the platoon are killed these five survive the war unscathed. We first meet them during the North Africa campaign of 1943 and follow them through Sicily France Belgium and into Germany. The film which ends with the liberation of a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia in 1945 does not have a coherent plot but rather consists of a series of short vignettes illustrating each phase of the war. This is not a traditional bigscale war film. Despite the fact that the featured platoon takes part in a number of major battles it appears to have been made on a relatively smallscale budget. The battle scenes are too smallscale to be convincing and are unrealistic in comparison not only with recent films such as 'Saving Private Ryan' but also with others of the same period such as 'Cross of Iron'. While the scenes of say the DDay landings are not too bad at other times the action sequences have a nearfarcical quality. Particularly risible was the scene where our heroes attack a Germanheld lunatic asylum a suspiciously Mediterraneanlooking building even though it is supposed to be in the Belgian Ardennes and Stephane Audran playing a resistance fighter who has infiltrated the building posing as one of the inmates waltzes around slitting the throats of the Nazi soldiers. At no time is any serious attempt made to conjure up a realistic atmosphere we always have the impression that we are watching actors on a set rather than soldiers on a battlefield.The lack of verisimilitude might not matter if we were presented with characters we can sympathies with but the soldiers in this film are a fairly unsympathetic lot with the partial exception of Mark Hamill's Private Griff a semipacifist who is suspected of cowardice by his colleagues. We see Lee Marvin's sergeant explaining to him that soldiers don't murder they kill. We then see a stereotypically brutal Nazi officer explaining exactly the same thing to his men. If however the idea was to make a pacifist point about the moral equivalence of the two sides this idea is not pursued particularly at the end where the final scenes in the concentration camp highlight the evils of Nazism. Incidentally Marvin who was in his midfifties when the film was made and looks older seems to old to be playing a frontline soldier shades of John Wayne in 'The Green Berets'. What saves this film from a lower mark is director Sam Fuller's eye for a striking visual image. Particularly memorable are the shots of the dead soldier's hand and wristwatch sticking up out of the shallows off the Normandy beaches or the battered wooden crucifix which appears both in the main body of the film and in the blackandwhite prologue about the sergeant's First World War experiences. One might in fact ask how the crucifix has survived on the battlefield when all around has been destroyed but this does not lessen the power of the image. These do not however compensate for the film's unconvincing action scenes and its inadequate characterisation. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "The Big Red One is a nickname given to the 1st Infantry Squadron's on World War 2. The film is brilliantly scripted and feels very realistic in it's depictions of World War 2 battles. There's a reason why the film is realistic. It's based on actual experiences that the WriterDirector Sam Fuller went through during his time in the war.The movie follows several soldiers in The 1st Infantry. Lee Marvin brilliantly plays The Sergeant. Four soldiers under his command played by Mark Hamill Robert Carradine Kelly Ward and Bobby Di Cicco have been named The Four Hoursemen and they become well known among other soldiers. Despite being in a position and squad where most troops come in and die before others even know their names these four manage to live through the most dangerous situations and missions. Most of the time without even getting a scratch on them.There's no big overall story in The Big Red One. It's made up of many different combat scenes that The Sergeant and his men fight in. The DDay footage is almost as realistic and frightening as those shot in Saving Private Ryan and this was made 18 years earlier. There are some very dramatic and intense scenes in this film but it avoids making the viewer feel  too depressed or saddened thanks to a lot of light humour throughout the script.Although The Big Red One is not well known it easily ranks up there with Saving Private Ryan Apocalypse Now and Tora Tora Tora as one of the greatest war films of all time. I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone reading this. The Big Red One does not disappoint. It gets a perfect 10 from me.".

Some of the scenes like those in the asylum are simply ludicrous and overblown.

Just about any made for TV series or movie about WWII comes off more convincing than this turkey. This was a major motion picture wasn't it?? It simply defies credulity that there could be a single good review of this travesty on here.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've always felt that The Big Red One is at the top five of Lee Marvin's best films. It's also one of the best war pictures ever made.The Big Red One is a product of the personal vision of director Samuel Fuller and his experiences in World War II. In the film Fuller's character is played by Robert Carradine who narrates the film. Carradine is one of four soldiers the others being Mark Hamill Bobby DiCicco and Kelly Ward. The four of them are part of a rifle squad and were together from the landings in Morocco against the Vichy French through North Africa Sicily and the European Theater until V.E. Day.The sergeant of this squadron is Lee Marvin every inch the professional soldier. I'm sure it helped that in World War II Marvin did serve in the Marines in the Pacific theater and had the role of sergeant down perfectly due to his life experience. He really does become the experienced noncommissioned officer who shepherds the young soldiers of our greatest generation through war.These guys are not heroes by any means but they are doing a necessary job and being led by the best when it comes to their survival.My favorite scenes are when the U.S. Army's First Division liberates a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia towards the end of the war. The young men of the squadron see the reason for their trip overseas up close and personal. Particularly touching is the dialogless scenes involving a young boy with Lee Marvin. The boy and Marvin's expression say more than all the talk any writer could have given them. It's what movies are all about.Mark Hamill straight from his iconic role as Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars gets billing second to Marvin. His performance is good but it doesn't stand out from the others. My guess is he was contracted to do this before Star Wars was out and the success of Star Wars mandated elevated billing for Hamill.The Big Red One is one of the best war films ever done. It will be an enduring classic and actually should be viewed in classrooms for the young of every subsequent generation who want to know what the European theater of World War II was all about. And it is an absolute must see for fans of Lee Marvin.".

The story line was thin and the film just looked cheap. Basically it is an insult to the real soldiers of the 1st Division. There's not much to say about this film that is positive.Also I have never seen Eucalypts in Europe. Eucalypts are Australian Gum Trees seen also in California where the film was obviously shot.

The characters are undeveloped cardboard cutouts and most of the action sequences ring hollow all in a film that was made in 1980! Sam Fuller was way passed his best not that i'm certain he was ever up to much. Just think of an action film like 'The bridges at TokoRi'made 26 years earlier and how much more realistic and adult it is!Now it's worth pointing out that there are several interesting sequences in this chaotic mess of a film including the whole concentration camp scene and the scene in the insane asylum but even these are marred by a clumsy approach. It seems to me that Fuller had a stubborn strangle hold on all aspects of the films production and this is what damages what is a promising albeit ambitious proposition. It has always seemed strange to me that a veteran should want to describe his experience of war perhaps only an old man with emotions blunted by time could attempt this and perhaps he would have to do it in such a way as to avoid dealing with his real feelings. This may be the reason for the films curious lack of character development and emotional detachment as well as the perverse machismo displayed especially the scene involving the homosexual orderly in the hospital.In conclusion I think this very self conscious film tells us more about war than one might at first imagine albeit through the distorted lens of a veteran and outdated film maker.".

However no bullet can hit the five main characters. In one scene it shows part of the reason they may get away with this. They deliberately put the replacements in harm's way while they sit back and relax. Still they are vulnerable at times but the movie suggests that they are super human. In fact if they are such Supermen why do they even bother with other soldiers? Why don't these five just go ahead and conquer all of Europe in one day? The characters aren't very identifiable.

Then the Americans are fired upon accidentally by the French U.S. has sporadic firefights with the Germans later they dig in and tanks run over their foxholes killing some men? two guys get out of foxholes one of them Hamill and run for the hills and then everyone is out of their foxholes and THEN I don't know what the fk is going on...just a lot of nonsense. THEN they are on the beaches and Mark Hamill's narration kicks in and states that there are only four guys left in their unit or something like that....Nest scene their on a boat to Sicily. Blah blah blah. I'm not going to review every inch of this film. I saw this for the first time 15 or so years ago but recently watched it again and had to put in some words. I loved the Dirty Dozen but did not like Lee Marvin in Red One. He seemed far away like on autopilot for this role. The good I have to say is that although somemost of the battle scenes were off they were still entertaining and for that I give this movie a 5. It's 108 AM now I can't sleep and had nothing better to do. I think I'll watch All Quiet On The Western Front 1930 talkie version the acting and battle scenes are more realistic than The Big Red One made 50 years later.".

First off as many have said this film tries way way way too hard to be meaningful and poetic. It falls flat on its face looking very cheap and clich. The movie is directed like it is an episode of C.H.I.Ps. There is so much winking at the camera and being tongue in cheek. The so called humor also is unbelievably stupid. The acting was very bad and it was terribly castedLee Marvin was at least bearable. None of the characters were interesting and the storyline was so disconnected since the movie just appears like a bunch of separate vignettes. Back to the directing it is shot like a 60s filmI have nothing against 60s movies and it just does not fit the script which is wretched and this movie could have worked better as a 30 second Go Army ad on the TV. The ending of this movie relates to my titling of the summary. When Lee Marvin liberates the concentration camp he comes across a dying young boy and carries him on his shouldered. We slowly see the boy keeling over as her dies on Lee Marvin's shoulders as he walks on. This could have been a GREAT and touching scene but then of course we get cut off by Robert Carradine's annoying narration and the rest of the scene gets cut to the crappy storyline. The other parts of the liberation are done so poorly that let's just say the victims of this terrible war would be rolling over in their graves. If I am to go on I will probably kick my foot through the computer screen. Oh yeah the movie is tedious and boring.I will never get that two and a half hours back.".

The other parts of the liberation are done so poorly that let's just say the victims of this terrible war would be rolling over in their graves. If I am to go on I will probably kick my foot through the computer screen. Oh yeah the movie is tedious and boring.I will never get that two and a half hours back.";

	schema:reviewBody "I attended the World Premiere of Whip It at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. This is quite an impressive directorial debut for Drew Barrymore who also stars.Barrymore works with a Shauna Cross script based on her own novel Derby Girl and an allstar cast featuring Ellen Page Marcia Gay Harden Daniel Stern Kristen Wiig Landon Pigg Jimmy Fallon Eve and Juliette Lewis.Page is Bliss Cavendar whose mother Harden sees her daughter in gowns and crowns as she continues the family tradition of winning beauty pageant trophies. But Bliss' chance encounter with a group of roller skating girls plants other ideas in her head. Austin Texas happens to host a roller derby league it's not too far away and Bliss finally sees a way out of her town and gown. This sets up a family confrontation that is the stuff of classic comingofage stories.The film starts out slow then whips into action its brilliant ensemble cast hitting its stride and functioning like a winning roller derby team without the bruises. Then just when you think Whip It is headed into sports romcom clich territory surprising twists keep it original and refreshing. But despite the multitude of talented actors Page clearly carries the film on her diminutive shoulders and is easily in control of the material.Production values are naturally first rate with a vivid color palette and inyourface costumes that are occasionally and appropriately over the top. Cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman and editor Dylan Tichenor work perfectly in sync by reflecting both the snail's pace of Bliss' home life vs. the secret one that flies on wheels around the Austin track. Camerawork places the viewer directly into the action. Despite having been filmed primarily in Michigan due to favorable tax credits the Austin scenes are prominent placing its landmarks in a warm affectionate light. One benefit of a big budget is the ability to purchase music rights and the result is a killer soundtrack that will have the audience singing along. Be sure to stay for the second of the two closing credits songs the best ever cover of one of the greatest rock 'n roll love songs of all time The Association's Never My Love. Fox Searchlight scores again with Ellen Page just like they did in 2007 with Juno. Unlike that at the time dark horse this is no little indie. This is classic Hollywood comedy. Whip It is another crowd pleaser to add to this year's mustsee list.".

Upon our arrival our expectations were not high as none of us were fans of Drew Barrymore.Once the movie began however our opinions quickly changed. Drew Barrymore may not be the best actor but she definitely has chops at directing. Whip It is the tale of a girl who hates life in a small town so she decides to rebel by joining a roller derby team with often comedic results. The movie is much better than plot may sound. It has some clich moments but definitely beats the standard chick flick.The film had a very unique feel shifting between humorous and hipsteresquire scenes. This also was probably my biggest problem with the movie. The comedy often reminded me of something out of an Owen Wilson film but then the dramatic scenes reminded me of something more hip than Juno. That being said the movie was much funnier than the average chick flick.Ellen Page is superb as usual taking on a somewhat different role than what I've seen before. It's impossible to compare her to her role in Juno as in Whip It she plays a much more introverted but still conflicted girl.Andrew Wilson was probably the funniest character in the movie. I'm actually wondering where this guy came from. The other two Wilson brothers are huge and this guy just comes out of nowhere. Hopefully we'll see more of him as he is just as funny as Owen and Luke.Drew Barrymore had a very small role in the movie. The few scenes she is in are certainly not ruined by her. Landon Pigg should probably stick to music or maybe even quit that because he sucks at that. He is not an actor and that was prevalent throughout the movie. Jimmy Fallon provided a solid array of oneliners as the quirky announcer for the games.The rest of the cast was solid including Marcia Gay Harden as the strict but loving mother. Juliette Lewis is good as the overthetop intense player who takes things way too seriously. Alia Shawkat I couldn't stand but I just can't stand her in general.This movie definitely goes far beyond what any average chick flick would. In fact it's hard to classify it as such as I found it good and I'm a dude. All things considered it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of hip movies or just comedy in general.".

	schema:reviewBody "Drew Barrymore's directorial debut is a little gem. It could have been called Juno on Skates such are the comparisons but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Sure Bliss Cavendar is almost identical to Juno MacGuff and not just because Ellen Page plays them both it follows a similar 'finding oneself' story arc there are eccentric yet lovable parents and it prides itself on the unique dialogue flowing throughout however Whip It has something up its sleeve to give it its own recognisable edge  rollerderby. Fun doesn't come any thicker faster or sillier than rollerderbying. Barrymore understands this and appropriately places the underground sport front and centre. The editing is occasionally too quick meaning you can't always see what is going on but you are caught up in the atmosphere so much it doesn't really matter.Beneath the action is a comingofage tale that wears its heart on its sleeve and bears all. Despite being slightly predictable and clichd real life rollerderby competitor Shauna Cross' screenplay adapted from her own book makes up for it with razorsharp dialogue I can grow the balls and genuinely intriguing characters. Not to mention the comedy littered throughout never laughoutloud moments but you'll be chuckling from start to finish. The romance subplot could have been left out though it doesn't hold your interest like the other story elements and feels slightly unnecessary.Undeniably cute once again Ellen Page stamps her Alist spot with another splendid oddly appealing performance. Page's serious acting chops are matched by her superb comic timing as she proves that she is one of the finest young actors coming through today. The huge supporting cast is letdown by noone Kristen Wiig the pick of the bunch her deadpan humour is hilarious and she is surely another actress we will see more of in the future. A special mention to Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern as well they play Bliss' old folks with warmth and likability never allowing them to become the typical misunderstanding parents you often find in these movies.A laughaminute affair with a bigger than average heart. Throw in a terrific little indie soundtrack and you have yourself a mustsee movie.4 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Ordinary 3  Good 4  Excellent 5  Classic".

I saw this movie yesterday at TIFF and the screenwriter was there for the QA. This story is taken from her experiences discovering roller derby and many of the characters are based on real people. The writer is also from Texas and grew up near Austin where the story is set. Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden are excellent and the motherdaughter scenes are very real. Ellen Page did all her own stunts  learning to skate which adds a lot to the movie. Many of the older actresses did many of their stunts as well so the wipe outs and the scrapes and bruises are real!! Kristen Wigg is also great  one of the first times I've seen her be a real person on screen instead of just a funny character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whip It and Bend It Like Beckham are so similar but so much different. Both tell the stories of teenage girls who sneak away to participate in sports Soccer and Roller Derby. Both girls have crushes and relationships with the opposite sex both end differently.The main difference in Whip It which makes the film really stand out is the relationship with Bliss Cavendar Ellen Page and her mother Marcia Gay Harden. This is the main theme of the movie and is beautifully developed. Drew Barrymore said she was drawn to the script because of motherdaughter theme. Drew and her mom have had problems and wanted to do the story because of it.Bliss grows up in a small town Bodine in Texas which is on the outskirts of Austin. Watch for the part when Bliss and her friend Pash dance to the Dolly Parton song Jolene and change the words to Bodine. One day while shopping in Austin she picks up a flyer for the local Roller Derby team the Hurl Scouts. Bliss talks her best friend. played by Alia Shswkat into driving her into Austin to watch an actual game. She is invited after the game by Maggie Mayhem to attend a tryout to make the team.Drew said she was attracted to the sport of Roller Derby by the crowd. When she attended an event she looked around and saw yuppies blue collar workers teenagers families and just a wide range of people. All drawn to the sport of Roller Derby.The book was written by Shauna Cross who based her experience on her career with the LA Derby Dolls. Shauna skated with them as Maggie Mayhem played by Kristen Wiig. Shauna was looking for a tennis partner and searched Craigslist for one and found an ad for Roller Derby which started her career.Drew made some additions to the script. A fan of the hockey movie Slap Shop and the characters the Hanson Brothers she came up with the Manson Sisters for Whip It. They play silent but deadly teammates on the Hurl Scouts. A little hard of hearing or not caring to they walk by the white board with a play diagrammed look and just keep walking. They are played by LA Derby Dolls skaters Kristen Krissy Krash Adolfi and Rachel Iron Maiven. Adolfi and Piplica are teammates on LADD's Tough Cookies on whom the film's fictionalized Hurl Scouts are based. Landon Pigg goes from musician to his first acting role as Bliss' love interest. I think this is the only scene of making out under water I have ever seen.If some of the blood and bruises look real .. they are !! Most of the actors did their own skating and had their share of mishaps. Bliss Ellen Page was trained by LA Derby Doll's Axle of Evil. Drew suffered a huge bruise on her thigh while wrestling with one of the trainers. During the training some of the actors would yell out I am hurting and the trainers would yell back Keep Skating.The movie scenes of Roller Derby action look extremely real as Drew used hand held cameras for a lot of the action. A huge crane in the middle of the track took shots from high above and also went down close to the action.The moral of the movie per Drew is finding yourself to get out there and do things to improve yourself and to pick yourself up and keep trying.I highly recommend this movie to one and all.".

She was not quite as sarcastic and she did not try to be as cool as she was in Juno but she is still a little annoying for some reason. Drew Barrymore's performance was really disappointing to me. I felt she did very little and her role was almost a cameo. She just pops up from time to time says very little and tries to act tough. Also let me ask you this? Does Ellen Page look 21? No she looks like she is 14. How in the world are her teammates surprised when they find out she is only 17? Also being a person who has roller skated for over 30 years I guess I found it hard to believe that Bliss would be the fastest person out there when they were doing time trials. She looked slow and awkward. They guy that Bliss falls for looks like a loser. My wife was like why is she even bothering with that ugly guy? I didn't get it.I hate to bash this movie because I was really looking forward to seeing it. However I am finding it hard to say something good about it. Juliette Lewis actually gave one of the best performances in the movie. She is one of the few who actually pulled off the edgy tough rollergirl persona. This movie was nothing special and the box office returns will show it.".

I say disappointing because it really looks like they filmed the rough draft of the screenplay. It could have been so much more with a little effort and work on the script. Entertaining for all the other reasons! First this is Ellen Page's film ... she not only carries the Hurl Scouts into the championship game she also carries most every scene in the film. She gets some nice support work from Alia Shawkat as her best friend Pash as well as the lost Wilson brother Andrew who makes for a very interesting Roller Derby coach! Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern star as Page's mismatched parents. Harden is the one time beauty pageant queen pushing her daughter that direction while Stern is the sports loving dad seemingly stuck with two daughters and a very controlling wife.Nice to see stuntwoman supreme Zoe Bell get another real acting gig after stealing Tarantino's Death Proof and Juliette Lewis really chomps down on her role as the jealous oldtimer in the league. Sadly Kristen Wiig has little to do here and Jimmy Fallon is just way over the top as the ring announcer. Singer Landon Pigg has an odd turn as Page's first love interest  mostly wasted screen time that could have been better spent.Would have really enjoyed a bit more character development as there are certainly no shortage of potential jackpots.

	schema:reviewBody "When drama is rushed it can feel like the slowest thing in the world. The characters never get any time to breathe. The turmoil that they go through feels so compact tidy and meager that it's like your watching nothing at all. The quest for life's answers in the missunderstood teenager way with the mandatory pushy mother and the quiet but understanding father seems like a subject done before. This movie is way too bland stale and unbelievable to really find the heart. I compare it to Bend it like Beckham but without the good funny or interesting parts. I liked the idea of this film it had potential. Ellen Paige is great as always but the rest of the cast could have been exchanged for puppets and no on would have been able to tell the difference. I thought the ending too obvious and forced compared to the rest of it and needed a more inspired and extended premise and execution for fullest success. It seemed rushed and inconsistent with the buildup to it. The movie is too be frank about a bunch of girl riding around in circles on rollerskating. And just as exiting as that sounds.".

	onyx:emotionText "When drama is rushed it can feel like the slowest thing in the world. The characters never get any time to breathe. The turmoil that they go through feels so compact tidy and meager that it's like your watching nothing at all. The quest for life's answers in the missunderstood teenager way with the mandatory pushy mother and the quiet but understanding father seems like a subject done before. This movie is way too bland stale and unbelievable to really find the heart. I compare it to Bend it like Beckham but without the good funny or interesting parts.

Her life consists of working at the Oink Joint restaurant and entering beauty contests to please her mother Harden. Along with her friend Pash Shawkat she dreams of escaping to a better life. Then one day during a trip out to Austin the girls get wind of Roller Derby a sport for girls played on rollerskates. Intrigued they go and take in a match and Bliss is hooked straight away it's tough competitive and even edgy. Telling a lie about her age Bliss decides to try out for the Hurl Scouts and gets a place on the team as Babe Ruthless. Thanks to her ability the Scouts start to turn around their season however with a new boyfriend on the scene and her parents unaware of her secret life Bliss' new found happiness could come crashing down around her.In spite of some favourable critical assessments Drew Barrymore's directing debut barely made a dent at the box office. Just about making its money back on World gross the figures would lend you to believe that the film simply isn't very good. Plot synopsis doesn't suggest anything out of the ordinary yet another comingofage teenager picture and one that is sports based and even more formulaic than that the sports team at the centre of proceedings is an underdog too! Throw into the equation that it's a female based movie and it's not really a film crying out for all demographics or is it? Barrymore herself was very disappointed with the marketing for her movie the general feeling being that it was sold as a girls sports love story type picture. She's absolutely right it was marketed badly and it barely had a run on the big screen in most countries. Which is a shame because Whip It is a smashing film a picture that's vibrant funny and not without dramatic worth and yes it's accessible for any age sex or gender persuasion. Cross' script is fresh and free of filler and the cast all turn in jolly good shows ranging from the excellent PageGay Harden to the engaging ShawkatLewisWiig and the funny SternFallon. OK so it's not perfect Barrymore is no Tony Scott when it comes to shooting action some of the actual derby matches are confusing and not flowing and maybe a bit more backstory flesh for the other Hurl Scouts wouldn't have gone amiss? But these are minor itches at the beginning of what is hoped to be a long career in directing for Madame Barrymore.With names like Jabba the Slut Smashley Simpson and Iron Maven it's evidently a film full of fun vim and vigour. But as great as that is girls in skirts on skates belting each other around a track the comingofage drama at its core should not be understated either. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I got curious about this movie because I've been interested in roller derby while the last time I roller skated was around time when I was 710 oops because the movie has so many women on it and lastly because Zo Bell is in the film. It's always a pleasure to see her work on screen whether it's acting or stunts.While I've never been into sports or sport films I loved Whip It! The matches between the leagues were so intense and thrilling! I'm so delighted because of how many women were in this film not just the characters but the director and writer as well. And there are so many different kind of female characters in the story all having their own ideologies all having different personalities. There are characters who are so typical good characters but they are still interesting. There are assertive women violent women competitive women mean women nice women mothers daughters... So many different kind of characters. It's almost rare because so many films have around 80  male characters. The structure of this film may be quite predictable but the other qualities of Whip It make up for that  the story is emotional in many different ways and it's just fun to watch. And after all isn't most of Hollywood pretty predictable these days? And the story has many different levels it's not just about the sport. It's about the main character Bliss growing up it's about her relationships with her parents her friends the friends and rivals she makes while playing roller derby. And while the main point of the film is Bliss finding her passion and what makes her happy the story doesn't forget all the other details that push her forward or pull her back.The music was well chosen. It keeps the viewer psyched and the songs work when you're listening to them outside of the movie. I have several of them on my playlists.Simply put Whip It is an amazing movie. It touches thrills and delights. There's only one thing I'd change and it would be deleting most of the useless heterosexual romances and add some women loving women there. It would suit the film and make it so much more better but I'm happy with what I got.".

I loved the funny names of the skaters.Things I didn't like Much like Arnold Sylvester Stallone or Tom Cruise Ellen Page plays the same character in every movie. The I'm too smart for you precocious teenager I'm from the bustling metropolis of Bolene Texas. Why didn't she have a Texan accent? Ellen's character is supposed to be a super fast skater but Ellen Page can NOT skate! She looked like she was about to fall down in every skating scene. The food fight scene and underwater scene were completely gratuitous. The underwater love scene seemed like it was done just so they could say Hey. This is the first completely underwater love scene in history. It was completely unromantic. So much time was wasted on stupid stuff that could have been better used.

	schema:reviewBody "This film and its companion piece The Four Musketeers is the finest adaptation of the Dumas classic.  It perfectly captures the blend of romance adventure and comedy inherent in the novel.  There is some modification for modern viewers but the spirit and attitude of the era is preserved.Michael York gives one of his best performances as the young naive D'Artagnan.  He appears to be a bit of a bumbling idiot at first but one soon learns that a keen brain lies behind that bumbling exterior.  This portrayal was criticized by another filmmaker who adapted another of Dumas' tales.  Judging by how far that director strayed from Dumas it's understandable how he missed noting that Dumas portrayed D'Artagnan in the same manner at the beginning of the novel.  D'Artagnan grows with his experiences and becomes a leader of men by the end of the novel one who has confounded Cardinal Richelieu at every turn and preserved the honor of his Queen and country.Oliver Reed was perfectly cast as Athos the melancholy drunkard.  Athos is a man who has endured great pain and betrayal in his life and finds his only pleasure in drinking and brawling.  He is the wise counsel to the young D'Artagnan and the mysterious side to the Musketeer triangle.Frank Finlay a wonderful character actor brings a wonderful arrogant bluster to Porthos a gentleman a braggart and a fool.  Finlay also has a nice turn as the jeweler O'Reilly showcasing his versatility.Richard Chamberlain is Aramis the future priest and great lover.  Aramis gives an air of spiritual devotion while romancing his mistresses.  Like many clergy of the upper classes he sees no conflict in these attitudes or his profession as a soldier.  Chamberlain brings great subtlety to Aramis. His part is not as big as the other two but he says much with body language and attitude.  He more than holds his own with the stagetrained Brits.Charlton Heston brings a deep menace to Richelieu quite the opposite of his previous heroes.  He shows the devious nature of the Cardinal and the intelligence of a man who knows he has lost but will have other battles down the line.Faye Dunaway is the beautiful and vicious Milady.  She is the deadliest of D'Artagnan's adversaries she charms with her beauty and grace as she prepares her dagger unseen.Christopher Lee is D'Artagnan's rival Rochefort.  Lee is always good even when the film isn't.  Luckily this film is up to his abilities.  His cool demeanor is backed by a strong sword arm.The cast is rounded out by fine character performances from Roy Kinnear as Planchet JeanPierre Cassel as King Louis XIII Geraldine Chaplain as Anne of Austria and Spike Milligan as M. Bonacieux.  Raquel Welch gives a surprisingly deft turn in the comic role of Constance.There is plenty of action romance drama and fun for fans of each.  The sum of those parts results in a classic that outshines all other attempts at Dumas.  It is a swashbuckler to rival any Errol Flynn movie a romance equal to a MerchantIvory production and a comedy to rival Monty Python.Forget Gene Kelly the Ritz Brothers and Charlie Sheen and company.  These are the true Musketeers.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE THREE MUSKETEERS Richard Lester's comic take of the oftfilmed Dumas adventure story is not only terrific escapist fare with a brilliant cast but stands as the most faithful adaptation of the Musketeer saga.The very length of the novel with it's many plot twists had resulted in various truncated adaptations over the years with MGM's 1948 allstar production the only previous attempt to film more than the first half of the book. Lester however backed by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind and Wolfdieter von Stein and working from a unrepentantly bawdy script by legendary scribe George MacDonald Fraser tackled the novel headon with extraordinary results. The novel's hero young master swordsman D'Artagnan portrayed by Michael York at his most boyish is clearly the product of an impoverished Gascon household unable to read or write but filled with dreams of heroism in the elite Musketeers and fighting frequent duels. Quickly embarrassed by the smoothly villainous Rochefort Christopher Lee and ridiculed by the mysterious Milady de Winter the lad reaches Paris with a broken sword but his idealism undimmed. With a borrowed sword he then blunders into a series of challenges from the three title characters emotionally scarred alcoholic Athos Oliver Reed comic buffoon Porthos Frank Finlay and dandified ladies' manpriest wannabe Aramis Richard Chamberlain. When the Cardinal's Guard attempts to arrest the four as Athos and D'Artagnan begin their duel the Gascon displays such extraordinary skill with a sword that he is happily welcomed into the band of rogues who help him procure a servant the wonderfully comic Roy Kinnear and lodgings at the home of an old reprobate Spike Milligan and his beautiful if klutzy young wife Raquel Welch in her finest comic role who the boy immediately lusts after. The four friends then embark on a series of hilarious swashbuckling escapades.Meanwhile intrigue runs rampant in the Court the Queen Geraldine Chaplin carries on a clandestine affair with the British Prime Minister the Duke of Buckingham Simon Ward under the oblivious eye of her husband Louis XIII JeanPierre Cassel while evil Cardinal Richelieu Charlton Heston who is marvelous 'against type' plots to publicly embarrass her and reveal her involvement thus provoking a war with England and the elimination of France's Protestant faction. The object of betrayal is a multijeweled necklace a gift from Louis given by the Queen to Buckingham with two jewels stolen during a tryst by the Cardinal's agent Milady de Winter. The task of recovering of the necklace and replacing the missing jewels is given to D'Artagnan and his Musketeer allies who 'sacrifice' themselves to help the Gascon reach England.Climaxing in a wild freeforall at a Royal Ball love triumphs Richelieu is temporarily thwarted Milady swears revenge against  D'Artagnan and he becomes a fullfledged Musketeer joining his love and three recovered friends to celebrate. This constitutes only the FIRST half of the novel and movie and the filmmakers decided to end the picture at this point releasing a sequel THE FOUR MUSKETEERS a year later which would cover the darker remainder of the story. While it was a wise decision no one had informed the cast that they were in fact making two movies and not one at the time of filming and the stars quickly filed suit against the Salkinds. After a brief but highly publicized court case the cast were compensated and the second equally enjoyable MUSKETEER film was released.THE THREE MUSKETEERS and it's sequel THE FOUR MUSKETEERS were triumphs for Lester the Salkinds and the matchless ensemble of actors. The films have achieved legendary status over the years and taken together stand today as one of the finest comic adventures ever made.If your experience of the tale is only the more recent Disney version do yourself a favor and catch the Lester films. You won't be disappointed!".

Authenticity seems to have been very important to the producers as well as staying true to the novel.Sadly a film like this wouldn't be made these days. First off the fighting would be punchedup with a lot of wire work. And of course Hollywood would change the story to eliminate much of the sleeping around characters do today's movie heroes in this type of movie aren't usually sexually active. They would also provide some creative story editing so that a certain character who dies in the novel would survive so as to supply the requisite happy ending.

I was stunned at the cinematography yeah a film buff even at 12.  After leaving the theater I went to a nearby bookstore and bought my first copy of the novel.  Wow how impressed was I when I realized that Richard Lester and George MacDonald Fraser stuck to the concept of the novel.  The novel incase you haven't read it is funny and fun.  The first half of the book... kept me at edge of my seat.  When I recently reread the novel my wife would tell me that I would wake her up sword fighting in my sleep.  Anyway back to the movie.  Michael York as D'Artagnan was fabulous. He embodied the dweeb that we all now and love as the future Commander of the King's Musketeers.  Oliver Reed gave the best performance of his life as Athos.  Richard Chamberlain as Aramis... the Musketeer who wants to be a priest was entertaining and a delight.  And Frank Finley as Porthos and later came to realize that he was also O'Reilly... Buckingham's jeweler was tremendous.  Richard Lester should have been nominated for an Academy award for his direction of this masterpiece numerous members of the cast including Christopher Lee as Compte Rochefort Charlton Heston as Cardinal Richelieu Raquel Welch as Constance Bonaciuex Spike Milligan as Monsieur Bonacieux Roy Kinnear as Planchet Simon Ward as the Duke of Buckingham Faye Dunaway as Milady de Winter and of course JeanPierre Cassel as Louis XIII should have been nominated for some kind of award.  The casts portrayals were direct from the Dumas novel.  The sword play in the movie is the best that I have ever seen in a movie.  There is none better with the possible exception of the Four Musketeers... the rest of the novel.If you have never seen the movie... go and get it.  Watch it.  Wait for it on TCM or FCM and tape it.  Once you see it you'll want to add it to your collection... or check out ebay if your local stores don't carry it.  I bought mine on ebay and watch it at least 3 times a year. D".

At that point I hadn't read the novels but unusually I think no less of the films now that I have.  In their broad slapstick style of humour they perhaps reflect the times in which they were made rather than Dumas but there is no lack of the original's tragedy in the scenes of Athos' past and D'Artagnan's disillusion.  George Macdonald Fraser's script is as fine as you'd expect of the writer of the 'Flashman' novels and the choreography of the fight scenes has been justly praised. The foils were apparently as heavy as their Seventeenth Century counterparts and the actors' agony was increased by filming in the hot Spanish sun....When I watched these films again a few weeks ago I was also struck by the beautiful cinematography with the scene in the snow and the climactic fight in the convent particularly wellframed.  For me this is as nearperfect an adaptation of the adventure novel as is possible combining romance humour tragedy and action with wonderful production values and a terrific script. Few other films and no other version of the 'Musketeers' reaches this standard.  Messieurs York Reed Finlay Chamberlain Heston Ward Lee Milligan and Kinnear plus Mmes Dunaway Chaplain and Welch will forever be associated with their characters for me.  Brilliant stuff!".

For me this is as nearperfect an adaptation of the adventure novel as is possible combining romance humour tragedy and action with wonderful production values and a terrific script. Few other films and no other version of the 'Musketeers' reaches this standard.  Messieurs York Reed Finlay Chamberlain Heston Ward Lee Milligan and Kinnear plus Mmes Dunaway Chaplain and Welch will forever be associated with their characters for me.  Brilliant stuff!";

Lester and his cohorts have created a film in which almost every frame resembles a museum painting come to life and gone berserk.Lester is better with style than relating a narrative. I found it impossible to completely comprehend the story line here and I think if you asked most people what the movie was about they'd tell you there was a lot of swashbuckling and general mayhem and lunacy but I doubt they'd give you much of Dumas' story. When the style is this good however a little fuzziness on the substance is not a fatal flaw. Still it might keep this picture from being an alltime classic rather than just a most enjoyable film.Lester is such an auteur that his direction is the main focus of this film even with such an allstar cast. It was a wise decision actually it seems like a nobrainer to divide what was originally shot at one time into two films this one and 'The Four Musketeers.' There really can be too much of a good thing and even at under two hours 'The Three Musketeers' threatens to be overwhelming. But on balance this film is great entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Richard Lester hit it right on the nose! Dumas's book THE THREE MUSKETEERS is generally regarded as a kind of classic adventure but it's more than that. Throughout all the romance and swordplay it is humor not adventure that prevails. D'artagnan is even introduced as Don Quixote at eighteen which is clear indication of humorous intent. Lester's popcomedies like THE KNACK and A HARD DAY'S NIGHT made him perfect for directing this film. George MacDonald Fraser's screenplay for THE THREE MUSKETEERS preserves the original dialogue with all its humor and adventure to the letter even though this is only half the book. This gave Lester free reign to fill the picture with physical comedy and sight gags particularly in the swordfights. The heights of such humor show in a scene where the musketeers fake a duel in order it steal food. Michael York excels in the role of D'artagnan using sword skills picked up while making ROMEO AND JULIET. The lategreat Oliver Reed is a suitably drunken overpowering Athos. Another highpoint is the film's villain. Charlton Heston's restrained performance brings the puppetmaster Cardinal Richelieu to life and far better than Tim Curry did in 1993. He can break a man with a word and we believe it. Raquel Welch brings her usual talents to the role of Constance. Perhaps the most important of all is Bonnie herself Faye Dunaway as the Countess DeWinter. Dunaway brings to life all the character's cold allure that appeared as good on the screen as it did on the page. The action is well choreographed and satisfies and the humor is good. This combines with sequel THE FOUR MUSKETEERS with the same cast and director to form the perfect film version of a wonderful novel. If nothing else it at least beats the Disney version into the morgue. Not To Be Missed!".

It was then that I watched Oliver Reed breathe a whole new life into the character of Athos with the help of a magnificent supporting cast.  I have to say I never fell off the couch laughing at the Disney version the way I did during the scene at the inn where Porthos and Aramis are attempting to pull Athos out of the well.  Moreover I never felt as though I understood the characters very well until I watched Lester's interpretation and compared it with the text of Dumas.  He could not have chosen a finer cast of actors for his movie  Reed is superb as the quiet thoughtful leader Finlay is outlandish as Porthos Chamberlain brings a flair to Aramis and York seems completely immersed in D'Artangan.  Yet great casting aside the movie would be nothing if Lester had not incorporated the reality of life at court during the Musketeers' time period  the laziness and sheer excess dogs as chess pieces on the palace lawn wine fountains and palace games.  The fight scenes are also to be commended.  They are not the overlychoreographed dances of Disney's The Three Musketeers but rather have a harsh reality to them.  Reed's fighting style is particularly allout  he uses his entire body as a weapon.

This tale gets told again and again in Hollywood but leave it to a European to do it right.  The cinematography sets and costumes are all fantastic but they aren't all clean and impossibly perfect like the 1948 Gene Kelly or 1993 Kiefer Sutherland versions.  Lester infuses this familiar story with an energy and tone that made his work with the Beatles successful. Yes The Three Musketeers is an intriguing adventure but the humor in their friendship that's what draws me in again and again.  And what an amazing cast he had to work with  all the Musketeers are perfect especially big Oliver Reed who can be silly witty and scary all in the same scene.  The supporting cast is full of great actors including Charlton Heston having fun at being evil here Christopher Lee gets to mix deadpan humor in with his menace Raquel Welch cast as beautiful but clumsy really enabling her to be a character and not just a live mannequin Spike Milligan doing what he does best and most wonderfully Faye Dunaway seductively evil my favorite kind!.  And of course holding it all together as D'Artagnan is Michael York who never found a greater role.Besides handling the shifts in tone well Richard Lester also had the great rare luxury of breaking Dumas' large novel into two seperate movies which he filmed simultaneously.  This really allows for greater character development and a truly epic scale. All of the other film versions try to cram all of that plot into 120 minutes.  Not only is it impossible in the 1993 version they simply change it completely using only the basic idea of Dumas' book but it makes this huge complicated story with many threads seem contrived and ridiculous the 1948 version has such dramatic and sudden shifts of tone  from wacky comedy to romance to heavy drama  that it can confuse and lose the audience.This is great moviemaking.".

And a new DVD release under the title The Complete Musketeers contains a pristine widescreen transfer and choice of pan  scan in the same package for both films that does justice to THE definitive version to the Alexander Dumas novel.It's a shame that many people don't realize that similar to the approach to filming the 'Lord of the Rings' 'Three Musketeers' only covers the first half of Dumas' novel. 'Four Musketeers' covers the 2nd half. It is really one movie that clocks in at about 3 hours and 35 minutes and that's the way it was filmed. Only a late?decision prompted the producers to split one long movie into two shorter ones a move the same producers repeated for 'Superman' and 'Superman II'...Hhmmmm...while trying to deprive the participants payment for the 2nd movie. Doesn't matter because the end result is top quality entertainment.I was lucky to have seen both films on the big screen as a double feature back in 1976...the way it's meant to be experienced. Fifteen years later I read the novel a modern translation that eased the pain of reading 19th century writing without losing any of the story's scope. And the cast of the movie is so perfect that it was a no brainer to visualize the actors as the characters. Many lines in the film were lifted from the book and those that weren't were in total sync to the way the characters behaved.Unlike all other Hollywood interpretations this FEELS like someone just plopped the camera into the middle of 17th century Europe. It's rich detailed and gives an uncompromising view of royalty power and unscrupulous behavior that is a riot.And there are so many subtleties that demand repeat viewings. Sorry...but you won't find spoonfed information on class conflicts prejudice against gascons or society customs they're all there but the casual viewer will miss it the first time. And no overly cute one liners that plagued the inferior 1993 version which I couldn't finish watching...miscast and too short to do the book properly.Minor spoilers One scene begins with a closeup of a fancy dish of delicacies being nibbled by French royalty you assume they're out enjoying a royal picnic until way in the background you see three figures dangling from a hangman's noose under a giant oak tree while the women are all giggles and gaiety in the foreground. Another scene shows a pail of brown slop being dumped out of a 2nd story window onto the head of an unsuspecting villager sitting on a bench...then you realize the contents of the slop bathrooms weren't the same back then. These scenes come fast and they're gone before you know it.You'll also be rewarded with the background dialogue delivered by the extras so you'll have to split your attention from what you're seeing to what you're listening to...and it's well worth it. Sometimes it's all too tempting to flick on the close caption on your TV to fully appreciate the rich dialogue.Director Richard Lester deserves high praise for his irreverent approach that succeeds at slapstick comedy in one scene and jolts the viewer back to the deadly dilemma in the next.And that allstar cast! They ARE the characters.Minimal special effects! What you see is what you get...and what you get is phenomenal!This deserves to be in almost everyone's DVD library. NOTE Be sure it's the recent release of BOTH 'The Three Musketeers'  'The Four Musketeers' that's in ONE dvd package unlike the 2 separate dvd releases from 4 years ago that had no bonus material. This has enough extras to satisfy. Also I found this totally by accident because the retail store listed it in the 'Comedy' section instead of ActionAdventure and listed it under 'C' for the title 'The Complete Musketeers' that's at the top of the package. Go figure!9 out of 10! This rating is for BOTH films.And don't miss Oliver Reed's foretelling philosophy on how to make the future look 'rosier' after his All for one and one for all! division of their newly acquired bag of money from the Cardinal's guards.".

The acting is superb and the characters are brought to life by Michael York Oliver Reed Richard Chamberlain Faye Dunaway Raquel Welch Charlton Heston and Christopher Lee.  The fight choreography developed by fight director William Hobbs is well done and entertaining.  But one of the more interesting side notes is the backgrounds to the main film depicting the royal and street life of France.  Not only is it well researched it adds a dimension to the movie that is lacking in other versions.  The movie does an admirable job of recapturing the spirit of Duams' tale and by separating the movies the full story with all of its twists and intrigues is brought full Force.  I also recommend the sequel The Four Musketeers.  Highly enjoyable!".

	schema:reviewBody "Alexandre Dumas's classic The Three Musketeers seems to never lose its appeal it gets another cinema version every generation. In the seventies Richard Lester shot such a long film that producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind decided to release it in two parts. This film only takes us to the point of the affair of the diamond studs.Michael York is one truly bumptious Gascon in his interpretation of D'Artagnan. Apparently it's a French mantra that people from Gascony are braggarts and quick to fight. I don't know how well that point is known outside the French speaking world but it's in the strength of Dumas's tale that we Americans even those who haven't studied The Three Musketeers in high school of college English can appreciate that fact. Because of that fact he manages to make all kinds of enemies the wrong ones and the right ones. Fortunately the right ones Athos Porthos and Aramis Oliver Reed Frank Finlay and Richard Chamberlain all recognize York's worth and he becomes a companion of The Three Musketeers. The King's own guard fighting against the encroaching power of France's prime minister Cardinal Richelieu.Charlton Heston adds to his collection of real historical characters portrayed on film with his interpretation of Richelieu. He was hardly the villain in real life that he is here. As he said on his deathbed that he had no enemies but the enemies of the state. Richelieu was in fact a great French patriot though as a Cardinal was not terribly pious or scrupulous.Richelieu was also not a tall man and the six foot two inch Charlton Heston had to stoop over a bit when playing him. Note that carefully when you watch Heston especially in his scenes with Christopher Lee as Rochefort. Lee does not lack in the height department either.Three women have substantial roles in The Three Musketeers. Raquel Welch makes a sexy Constance not quite the innocent that June Allyson played her as in the MGM version with Gene Kelly. Geraldine Chaplin is serene and beautiful but tragically unloved except by Great Britain's prime minister the Duke of Buckingham Simon Ward France's mortal enemy. Milady DeWinter played by Faye Dunaway is as deadly and beautiful as Lana Turner was in the Gene Kelly film.Personally I've never thought that Hollywood ever got The Three Musketeers quite right. It will never happen I'm sure but I'd love to see the operetta that Rudolf Friml wrote the music for made into a Three Musketeers film. Still this one isn't too bad with an accent more on bawdy comedy than anything else. The followup Four Musketeers takes a more serious turn.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the Salkind's producers and director Richard Lester a marvelous adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's venerable classic cloak and dagger novel. We are in 1500's France. It's the history of the gascon D'Artagnan Michael York new musketeer that is earned the trust of Athos Oliver Reed Porthos Richard Chamberlain and Aramis Frank Finlay and of the Queen of France Geraldine Chaplin for which it recovers the necklace given to her lover English Duke of Buckingham Simon Ward. D'Artagnan and the musketeers makes to fail the plot for to compromise the Queen giving letdown to Cardinal Richelieu Charlton Heston and to perfidious Milady Faye Dunaway. Unconventional and amused adaptation of the novel of Dumas signed from George MacDonald Fraser that it stirs gag exited from the slapstick tradition D'Artagnan passes under a tree they jump twenty persons down and nobody succeeds to take it to realistic notations able to destroy heroic mythology of the book of Dumas not is a crash in which the duelists they respect the rules the film was turned in Spain with to the successive The Four musketeersThe Revenge of Milay exited but the following year. This movie is a superproduction realized with funds Panamanians in which they melts perfectly the thoughtless sense of humour and calligraphic reconstruction of age the costumes are wonderful than women hair styles. The Lester's direction gives to movie a pleasant climax free and easy that balances the visceral intensity of the story placed in this violent and dangerous historic period. This show was a funny mix of action adventure and comedy He respires a welcome breezy spirit adventurous watching the vicissitudes of D'Artagnan and her fellows between duels with swords betrayals conspiracies and love affaires. The choreography of the battles and duels by William Hobbs is marvelous and Michel Legrand's score also combining elements of authentic Renaissance music is a solid and right job for this film. The allstar cast is a very shining list of major stars of the 70's including Christopher Lee as grim Compte Rochefort wonderful Raquel Welch as Constance Bonaciuex Spike Milligan as her comic husband Roy Kinnear as Planchet Simon Ward as the Duke of Buckingham JeanPierre Cassel as Louis XIII. All the players gives the stunning performances especially Michael York as superb D'Artagnan Oliver Reed as charismatic Athos and great Charlton Heston in a unusual for him role as the evil Cardinal Richelieu. He was clever deliciously treacherous without overacting. There are the amusing performances by Frank Finlay as funloving hedonist Porthos an absolutely comic Spike Mulligan but especially by amazing Raquel Welch as York's beautiful but clumsy love interest. The splendid Raquel never was a great actress but was known mainly for her provoking beauty here surprisingly she demonstrates a unsuspected comic talent she's certainly in her finest role. On the other end of the spectrum is an icy Faye Dunaway as the calculating and seductive wicked and vicious Milady.The Three Musketeers was scripted contracted and filmed as one enormous movie but was divided into two features to be released 8 months apart. The Salkinds are afraid of the movie's too long duration for the film's commercial success had been better to have two movies shortest. Salkind's flippant decision to split their show into two features causes few problems to the tale's unity but this choice he showed winning because The Three Musketeers and the sequel The Four Musketeers Milady's Revenge were been triumphs for Lester and the Salkind's. The split works quite well although same incongruities Faye Dunaway's presence as the evil Richelieu's accomplice is the most lopsided hardly showing up in the first movie and dominating the second but finally the two chapters of the story have different tones with a meet fun tone of the first giving way to more serious plot developments in the second when Milady tries to take one's revenge towards D'Artagnan and the musketeers.The Lester's Musketeers films are very and original fine entertainments.".

Unconventional and amused adaptation of the novel of Dumas signed from George MacDonald Fraser that it stirs gag exited from the slapstick tradition D'Artagnan passes under a tree they jump twenty persons down and nobody succeeds to take it to realistic notations able to destroy heroic mythology of the book of Dumas not is a crash in which the duelists they respect the rules the film was turned in Spain with to the successive The Four musketeersThe Revenge of Milay exited but the following year. This movie is a superproduction realized with funds Panamanians in which they melts perfectly the thoughtless sense of humour and calligraphic reconstruction of age the costumes are wonderful than women hair styles. The Lester's direction gives to movie a pleasant climax free and easy that balances the visceral intensity of the story placed in this violent and dangerous historic period. This show was a funny mix of action adventure and comedy He respires a welcome breezy spirit adventurous watching the vicissitudes of D'Artagnan and her fellows between duels with swords betrayals conspiracies and love affaires. The choreography of the battles and duels by William Hobbs is marvelous and Michel Legrand's score also combining elements of authentic Renaissance music is a solid and right job for this film. The allstar cast is a very shining list of major stars of the 70's including Christopher Lee as grim Compte Rochefort wonderful Raquel Welch as Constance Bonaciuex Spike Milligan as her comic husband Roy Kinnear as Planchet Simon Ward as the Duke of Buckingham JeanPierre Cassel as Louis XIII. All the players gives the stunning performances especially Michael York as superb D'Artagnan Oliver Reed as charismatic Athos and great Charlton Heston in a unusual for him role as the evil Cardinal Richelieu. He was clever deliciously treacherous without overacting. There are the amusing performances by Frank Finlay as funloving hedonist Porthos an absolutely comic Spike Mulligan but especially by amazing Raquel Welch as York's beautiful but clumsy love interest. The splendid Raquel never was a great actress but was known mainly for her provoking beauty here surprisingly she demonstrates a unsuspected comic talent she's certainly in her finest role. On the other end of the spectrum is an icy Faye Dunaway as the calculating and seductive wicked and vicious Milady.The Three Musketeers was scripted contracted and filmed as one enormous movie but was divided into two features to be released 8 months apart. The Salkinds are afraid of the movie's too long duration for the film's commercial success had been better to have two movies shortest. Salkind's flippant decision to split their show into two features causes few problems to the tale's unity but this choice he showed winning because The Three Musketeers and the sequel The Four Musketeers Milady's Revenge were been triumphs for Lester and the Salkind's. The split works quite well although same incongruities Faye Dunaway's presence as the evil Richelieu's accomplice is the most lopsided hardly showing up in the first movie and dominating the second but finally the two chapters of the story have different tones with a meet fun tone of the first giving way to more serious plot developments in the second when Milady tries to take one's revenge towards D'Artagnan and the musketeers.The Lester's Musketeers films are very and original fine entertainments.";

There are still some variations but for the most part this succeeds very well even improving on things occasionally. It retains the adventure and epic nature of the story but has been sprinkled with delightfully subversive humor and occasional slpastick. It's a mystery as to why this sumptuous heavilydetailed dazzling film did not receive any Oscar recognition especially for the magnificent eyepopping costumes and the rousing score spirited score which Legrand came up with in ten days! The settings are perfect. The flavor and feel for the times is unusual and intriguing. A game crackerjack cast is one of the best in history. York does a memorable job as D'Artagnan all wideeyed eagerness and full of dashing adventure. He is ably supported by the famed trio of musketeers each with his own traits and look. Reed is a pure delight with his boozy surly attitude and roughhewn good looks and those gorgeous eyes Chamberlain is appropriately demure and chivalrous and Finlay is physically amusing and witty. Cassel is perfect as the selfinvolved King and Chaplin is surprisingly effective as Queen Anne. Welch does her most charming and effective work as the gorgeous and wellendowed klutz Constance. On the villainous side is the imperious imposing Heston as Cardinal Richelieu and his henchman Rochefort played to perfection by Lee. Finally the monumental Dunaway as the iciest most profoundly wonderful Milady de Winter ever shown. The entire cast is excellent but the one that lingers most in the memory is Dunaway though her real showcase is the second film. The film is peppered with a host of interesting British character actors and oddly amusing voiceovers to bring comedy to some of the more mundane moments. The film caused quite a stir when it was released because the actors had signed on to do one movie but the producers decided to fill it out into two! A lawsuit finally resolved some of the financial issues of that but the mess of having one great epic story divided into two halves remains. The films make so much more of an impact if viewed backtoback yet because they have each been padded with lengthy sword fights to each have an appropriate number of thrills it becomes oppressively long that way. The best case scenario would be a reedited three hour version but that isn't likely to happen. The previous versions and remakes all have certain flaws which keep them at a lower level of excellence. Though it was not in the book the wrestling match between Dunaway and Welch and the entire sequence with the diamonds is a highlight. Just a glimpse of the set and costumes for the masquerade ball is worth the price of rental or purchase. This is a splendid thoroughly enjoyable film.".

The story should be familiar but the casting writing direction music and spontaneity is unlike any other musketeer movie I've seen. I believe this film's rise or fall depended on who the creative team was and no better man could have been chosen than Richard Lester. Lester has not done any movies lately but he was one of the most talented directors of the midsixties and early seventies. He was a master at comedy see his tow movies with the Beatles for other examples and one of his trademarks was that during any scene where the focus was supposed to be on the main actors he would concurrently have extras muttering funny asides to the audience. One of his favorite actors to do this was the late great Roy Kinnear whose observations alone require multiple viewings of this movie even with the subtitles on! On to the actors then. Screenwriter George MacDonald Fraser noted that no other writer in the history of the movies had better actors to bring his scripted characters to life. and it is hard to make any argument against the cast. Could there be a more worldweary Athos than Oliver reed? Or a more dynamic D'Artangen than Michael York? It's always easier to play a villain but Charlton Heston Christopher Lee and Faye Dunaway did fantastic jobs nontheless. The only actor that seems a bit misplaced is Richard Chamberlain. Not that he didn't do a wonderful job as Aramis but the script seems to have left him with little to do especially for an actor of his talents. Lee mentioned that all of the actors did nearly all of their own stunts and that is quite amazing considering the stunts and that Lee was past fifty when he did this!

Can't say I ever remember seeing a film from Norway but this is a delightful charming touching little film that most people will find entertaining.  Two grown men are released from a state home and setup in their own apartment in Oslo.  Watching their somewhat torturous adjustment to normal life is both painful and amusing.  Lead character Elling stumbles upon his innate talent of writing poetry but his fear of recognition forces him to be quite creative in finding his audience.  Roommate Kjel is a sweaty mechanic with a heart of gold and stated desire to meet girls.  Their journey is intertwined with guidance from a previously famous writer their social case worker and a pregnant neighbor.  Many laughs throughout but also a nice message.  Go ahead ... answer the phone.".

	schema:reviewBody "I doubt how many North Americans have heard of this Norwegian film but I'm glad I discovered it. I've watched it twice and been very entertained by it. One warning for those inspired to check this out the first half hour can be a bit boring but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with a very funny charming film.The story centers around two guys who are released out of a state mental hospital and given an apartment to live in with a probationtype officer keeping tabs on how they're adjusting. At first it's tough as they guys are kind of clueless on how to do things on their own particularly mama's boy Elling who is even afraid to use a telephone. His roommate is a big oaf whose main concern in life is to have sex with a woman.In time these guys learn nicely how to adjust. Even better they make a friend or two and help those people with their problems. That's where the charm of the film comes in. Most of the humor is provided by Elling who narrates the film with some wonderful dry humor. At first his whining gets annoying but after he calms down in his new surroundings he's fun. His roommate winds up as a straight man for his jokes. The roommate Kjell Bjarne is a big help to everyone including a pregnant abandoned lady. He's an oaf but one with a big heart.This is really different and nice story. It's not for kids with a dozen or so s and f words but kids wouldn't like this film anyway. The movie will leave the rest of you with a smile on your face.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the opening credits we learn that the title character was a momma's boy. When she dies he is about 40 and he has to be be forcibly removed from the house actually he's huddling in a closet by the police. He is taken to a mental institution where he has a roommate named Kjell Bjarne who is a very large man who is obsessed with food and women although he is quite naive about the latter and unfamiliar with personal hygiene. Elling makes up stories mostly about women which Kjell Bjarne initially takes as the truth and when he finds out that they are fiction he asks Elling to continue telling them.Very shortly into the film Elling and Kjell Bjarne are given a small government paid apartment in downtown Oslo. They are put under the occasional care of Frank sli a social worker who lets them know that they need to take care of themselves or they will be sent back to the mental institution. But this is much more easily said than done. Elling's first trip to the grocery store which is made under extreme duress is a complete fiasco. And both of them are afraid to answer the phone.There are a couple of other significant characters who enter the story a bit later although in the spirit of not giving away too much I won't go into any more detail.I found this film utterly charming both times I have seen it most recently on 722002. The first time was at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival where it was my second favorite film of the 43 I saw there. There isn't anything flashy about it and it might move a bit slowly for some but it is very well made and acted by all concerned and the story shows the trials and the joy of everyday life and of friendship. It  was one of the final nominees for the best foreign language film Academy Award for 2001. If you don't set your expectations sky high I think you will be very pleased that you saw this little gem.Remakes According to IMDb this film is scheduled to be remade by Trigger Street in 2003. Trigger Street is the production company of Kevin Spacey although there are conflicting rumors as to whether or not he will be part of the cast. While I'm glad that this will probably result in more exposure for the the original film and this wonderful story it's sad that American audiences have to see an English language film with recognizable actors before they'll even notice a film.".

I think Per Christian Ellefsen's performance as Elling was pretty much the best acting I've seen in my life. Sven Nordin reminds a little bit of Gerard Depardieu and the character he plays reminds a tiny bit of Lenny of Of Mice And Men but more intelligent. It's the story of two men who are apparently too old to start their own lives but virtually have to do so by all means as a result of their lives up to date. Neither of them is substantially retarded or mad just a little bit overeccentric which makes things harder for them. One day the competent authorities of the Norwegian government decide to release them from their captivity in the institution and give them a chance to live a real life on their very own and social worker Frank is there to assist them. It won't be easy for the two sociallyimpaired men but it will turn out to be easier and nicer than they especially Elling fear.The rest is for you to watch in the film. And by all means watch it! Per Christian Ellefsen's acting is absolutely fascinating and everything is well put in the scenario. A beautiful film from a beautiful country.".

And with good reason. Elling was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and that probably gave a lot of promotion. Several other Norwegian films have been nominated for the same category but no one has had such a great success outside Norway as Elling.Elling follows the two characters Elling and Kjell Bjarne as they are released from an institution and moves into their own apartment. Both have serious social problems so their new life is gonna be quite a challenge. As the days goes by they meet a couple of other people witch brings Elling and Kjell Bjarnes relationship to several test.Based on a book by Ingvar Ambjrnsen Elling is a well written and very charming movie. The dialog is well written and perfectly delivered. It is a movie out of the ordinary and something for everyone to enjoy. No matter country or generation. The lovable characters of Elling and Kjell Bjarne is excellent portrayed by Per Christian Ellefsen and Sven Nordin. Peter Nss does a good job in the directors chair and Lars LilloStenberg gives the movie a nice score. All together this make up a great funny charming and lovely movie. Elling is a comedy yet it is also a drama. The characters and the actors who brings them to life is just hilarious yet their social dysfunction is a rather serious problem and you kind of feel bad for them and wish them to get better. Elling might have the biggest problem as he have to deal with his jealousy when Kjell Bjarne meets someone else. The interaction between the characters and Elling jealousy is very well captured and that's partly what makes this a great movie.If you ought to see one Norwegian movie Elling should be it!

Elling goes crazy and becomes socially awkward and is forced to live in mental center. There he meets his roommate and longtime friend Kjell Bjarne who has a disorder where all he thinks about is women and sex. Eventually the end up being released from the mental hospital and are forced to live with each other. Every once in a while they have a social worker who checks in on them to see if they are capable of living on their own. They face many different obstacles in their time together along with overcoming their mental disabilities.Per Christian Ellefsen portrays Elling as a quiet neat freak. I feel Elling has the most difficult adapting to daily life and the outside world. Having his character be a neat freak compels his disability. He is the probably the most difficult character to figure out because you really don't ever understand what his emotions are. Although there are scenes where one may be able to understand his character but I feel the director made it too difficult for viewers to understand whom Elling really was. Kjell Bjarne on the other hand is a man who is trying to break out of his element and reunite with the outside world. I feel the director made his character better noticeable because I feel his character was simpler. I'm still confused though why does he always insist on hitting his head on tables and pounding his fist on walls. One could say he is a very angry person but I don't feel that at all. His love for his girlfriend abolishes this idea of him being angry.The main theme that I took from this movie was the idea of family. The idea of Elling and Kjell being together demonstrates how the director enhances this theme of family. Considering this is a Norwegian film and the value of nature is portrayed in many films does not seem to be an important theme for this movie. Most of the movie is filmed in a big city. I was expecting more scenes involving the aspects of nature to be enhanced in this movie. There is a scene where they all go to a cabin and this would contradict my previous statement but this scene doesn't play a significant role in the movie.The movie is considered as a comedy and I would have to disagree. There were times where only a few times where I would laugh but overall I wouldn't say it is a comedy. Maybe I don't have a sense of humor or maybe Norwegian comedies are different compared to American films but I feel the movie was more considered as a drama rather than a comedy. Elling is supposed to be the main character and one would think if the movie was supposed to be a comedy the main character would be the most funny. I believe Kjell is bar far the funniest actor just because he is a slob and doesn't know when to change his underwear. Elling to me is more serious all the time and even though his seriousness can sometimes to funny in order for a movie to be considered as a comedy the main character has to always be funny.Overall I really enjoyed the film because I feel the message from the movie can be seen around the world. There are many different people who have difficulty associating them with the outside world. I myself have difficulty talking to complete strangers and this movie has made look at things differently. I also feel the location lighting etc. was very well used to enhance the director's purpose of the movie. I wouldn't say this was the best movie I have ever watched before which is why I only rated the movie and 8 out of 10. I wouldn't say this is the type of movie someone would want take a date too but if someone wants to watch a movie on a rainy day and curl up on the couch this would be a perfect movie for this situation.".

	schema:reviewBody "This comedic story centers on the lives of two middleage men Elling played by Per Christian Ellefsen and Kjell Bjarne played by Sven Nordin who have recently been released from a state institution after two years and are being placed back into society in Oslo Norway. Elling has previously led an extremely sheltered life for 40 years in an apartment with his mother up until her death. Dizziness and anxiety are his two main enemies while engaging with the larger society and he initially struggles with everyday tasks such as answering the telephone and buying groceries at the supermarket. His roommate Kjell on the other hand is a rather large and more outgoing fellow who is woman deprived and sexobsessed. While Kjell initially takes the lead engaging with society Elling soon musters up his confidence and joins him with the help of their newfound friends Frank Jrgen Langhelle their social worker Reidun Marit Pia Jacobsen their pregnant upstairs neighbor whom Kjell takes a fancy to and Alfons Per Christensen a famous poet whom Elling befriends. The duo discovers that not only can they take on the everyday challenges in society they can master them! Director Petter Naess whose other notable works include Absolute Hangover 1999 Only Bea 2004 and Mozart and the Whale 2005 derives his film direction from a theater background. One primary theatrical influence present in Elling 2001 is the use of extended scenes which is made possible by Naess extensively rehearsing with his actors. As a director Naess is known for highlighting themes of mental illness and relationships both of which are heavily present in the film. Elling received international success and praise resulting in an Academy Award nomination.The principal theme in the film is the formulation of relationships resulting in an unconventional family unit first between Elling and Kjell with the eventual addition of Reidun and Alfons. Elling highlights the growing national trend in Norway of the diffusion of new family formation patterns. The primary relationship is between Elling and Kjell who are first brought together as roommates at the state institution. They rely on their daily interactions and routine and become baffled at the obstacles ahead of them as they leave the institution together. The first major sign in Oslo of their undeniable dependence on one another as well as their strong dislike of change comes when they are shown their individual bedrooms within the apartment by Frank. Upon Frank's departure they immediately move their beds together into one room and place them in the exact same setup they had while living in the institution. A second relationship in the film develops between Kjell and Reidun much to the immediate dismay of Elling. When Kjell starts spending more time in Reidun's apartment Elling acts out in defiance as he feels that his close friend is moving on without him. Not wanting to be alone Elling seeks companionship elsewhere in the poetry world leading to his friendship with Alfons. Eventually all four spend a weekend at Alfons's cabin cementing their separate and combined relationships as an unconventional family unit.The second theme in the film deals with societal independence and the overcoming of social uneasiness and anxiety it brings for Elling and Kjell. Part of their deal with Frank is that they must interact with society which includes my favorite scene of Elling learning to answer the telephone. The two of them have to learn to break out of their outsider image and feel a part of society. This is done through the discovering of hobbies. For Kjell his confidence shines as an auto mechanic as he works to repair Alfons's vintage car. Elling gains confidence through his revelation as a poet which leads him to go to a poet's meeting and later spread his poetry anonymously as the mysterious Poet E.Poetry for Elling is a way for him to explore and eventually express the self which becomes the third main theme of the film. Both lead characters struggle to release their emotions. When Kjell gets frustrated usually because he can't talk to women he bangs his head against the wall whereas Elling yells at others and at one point shakes Kjell's toolbox and has to be carried back to bed like a child in order to calm down. Their gradual gain of selfexpression is primarily conveyed through cinematic techniques such as the comedic script playful background music often in the form of carnival music and straight on camera shots which lend to the portrayal of honesty of the two leads.Elling draws attention to the formulation of friendships and makeshift families among strangers societal independence and with that overcoming social uneasiness and anxiety and the exploration of selfexpression. These themes along with Naess's simple yet efficient directing style shed a muchneeded light on the lives of institutional residents and their shift into society. The script lacks mention of clinical jargon allowing the viewer to avoid immediate stereotyping and instead relate and sympathize with Elling and Kjell. In the end Elling wins the hearts of its viewers by allowing its audience the opportunity to laugh with the characters and enjoy the breadth of humanity.".

I read the brief description on the DVD jacket and decided it sounded amusing enough to spend the 3.50 to take it home for a few days.  Of the three movies my wife and I rented we watched Elling last honestly not expecting much from it.Through the course of the movie I howled with laughter gritted my teeth with anger and blushed with embarrassment.  I found it impossible to not get emotionally attached to the characters.  The actors especially the two lead roles gave impecable performances.  They did wonerful jobs of portraying the personalities of their characters rather than just playing themselves with a different onscreen name see Ben Affleck Jennifer Anniston Tom Cruise Hugh Grant Sly Srallone etc. etc. It was the kind of movie that once it endsyou feel a sense of loss as you wish the characters were real people so that you could go visit them on Saturday and catch up on the latest developements in their lives. see Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump Audrey Tautou as Amlie Poulain James Earl Jones in anything he's ever played. I watched this movie three times in two days and still felt regret for having to return it to the video store.  It is a wondefully involving film that is supperbly directed and perfomed and leaves you feeling uplifted and cheerfulif only for a moment before you turn on the news and sink back into the reality that is life. When you watch it don't be afraid of the pause button as you will want to read ALL of the subtitles for there are some brilliant bits of dialogue that are easily missed if you don't read fast enough That is of course unless you speak Norwegian!.  I also suggest renting it when you have lots of time to spare not only to allow time for the pause and read technique but to watch a few more times straight through to get the full effect of the delightful direction and performances as they are intended to be enjoyed. I could go on and on about Elling but I will stop here just short of saying it's a wonderful movie I highly recommend renting it and I gaurantee you will be glad that you did.".

	schema:headline " A comical film in tune with Norwegian society";
	schema:reviewBody "Ring.. Ring.. Ring.. Elling pick up the phone! Everyday tasks some as simple as answering a phone we tend to take for granted. For Elling played by Per Christian Ellefsen and his roommate Kjell Bjarne played by Sven Nordin they do not have this luxury. In the beginning of the Norwegian comedy film Elling directed by Petter Naess Elling and Kjell Bjarne meet while living in a Norwegian assisted living home. Elling and Kjell Bjarne are eventually given the opportunity to move into their own apartment in the heart of downtown Oslo. Upon their release the audience is introduced to Frank Asli Jorgen Langhelle who plays the role of Elling and Kjell Bjarne's social worker. It is Frank's job to slowly ease the two friends back into society. Some of the lessons learned throughout the film include how to properly use a phone where to find a grocery store how to go out to a restaurant and how to interact and have relationships with other people. Naess does an excellent job of keeping the audience entertained and attached to the main characters Elling and Kjell Bjarne throughout the film.There are four main themes in Naess' Elling which relate directly to Norwegian culture. The first major theme the audience encounters is dealing with mental illness. In directing this film Naess purposely did not give the audience any sort of diagnosis on the mental state of either Elling or Kjell Bjarne. This was most likely done so the audience would be less able to relate to the characters' illness. It seemed as though Naess would rather have his audience focus on the other themes in the film rather than psychiatry. In Norway cases of depression are extremely high and effects of this are displayed in Elling and Kjell Bjarne as well. For instance in one of the opening scenes of the film Elling and Kjell Bjarne are laying in bed and Kjell Bjarne reveals how frustrated he is that in all his life he has never had sex with a woman. The audience can see Kjell Bjarne has developed a sense of loneliness and tell there is missing something in his life. Elling seems to have more of an anxiety problem. When they first moved into the apartment Elling is asked to go shopping for food and ends up having an anxiety attack. Naess does an excellent job with the sound to enhance the anxiety scenes. For instance when Elling is walking to the store the background noise cars music etc. is elevated dramatically. I found this to be a very effective way to help enhance the situation.Another major theme touched upon by Naess concerns the Norwegian welfare system. In Norway the tax burden of gross domestic products GDP is 45. Due to this all Norwegian citizens and residents have their health care insurance coverage paid for. This theme reoccurs over and over again in the film as Elling and Kjell Bjarne continuously go out and spend what they call the state's money on food supplies and even phone sex calls. Frank is portrayed in the film as a tough love social worker. It is his job to check up on the two men every so often and to make sure they have enough money from the state. Closely related to the welfare system another main theme of the film is the Norwegian political system and more specifically the Norwegian Labor Party. Several times throughout the film the audience sees pictures of Gro Harlem Brundtland Norway's first female prime minister hanging up in the background. Usually these pictures are accompanied by a red rose which is the symbol of the Norwegian Labor Party. Although Elling never actually says it directly in the film it is implied he views Brundtland as a motherly figure. Brundtland helped with creating a better welfare state in Norway when she was leader of the Norwegian Labor Party and because of this Elling is able to enjoy all of his' benefits without having to work. The last prevalent theme I wish to discuss is the substance use and abuse seen throughout the movie Elling. As I mentioned before there are very high taxes in Norway and taxes for alcohol and tobacco tend to be on the upper end of the scale. It is very expensive to buy alcohol and tobacco and because of this Norwegians are forced to get creative if they want to save their money. At one point in the film we see Frank Asli rolling up his own tobacco to smoke so that he can avoid having to buy cigarettes. In terms of Alcohol Norway puts a higher price on driving under the influence. As a penalty for a DUI in Norway the driver is forced to pay a fine based on their income. Tickets can get pretty expensive for those with well paying jobs. There are also more DUI checkpoints in Norway as well and this is evident in the film when their new friend Alfons Jorgensen Per Christiansen gets randomly stopped on the way to his cabin. Even though Alfons had not been drinking he was still stopped by the police just to be safe. One aspect of this theme I found unnecessary is when the audience is introduced to ReidunMarit Pia Jacobsen we find her drunk and falling down the stairs. Reidun is a pregnant lady who lives in the same apartment building as Elling and Kjell Bjarne. She is a smoker and a drinker even though she is pregnant. I don't think it is a good portrayal of Norwegian society and could have been left out in an otherwise excellent film. Overall I think Elling is a light hearted and excellent Nordic comedy. The acting is superb and the themes for the most part are a wonderful portrayal of Norwegian society. Naess does a wonderful job and I would recommend the movie Elling to anyone looking for a relatively clean Norwegian film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just wanted to make a comment on what Andres Rais wrote on the 30th of April 2004. I am from Norway currently studying in London and it made me really sad to read Andres' opinion. I do not mind that he didn't like the film but I was shocked by how defiant he was to believe that Norway is like what is depicted in the film. He said that he could not believe Norway was a country where you could just walk so freely from place to place that people helped each other out and so on. He also thought it was strange that there were no burglars or rapists in Elling. The truth of the matter is that Norway is a safer country than other countries. I've noticed that clearly in my studies meeting British people who are unnerved just because I go by myself in the evening to the supermarket or back to the flat after clubbing. Norway has a very small population only about 46 million people.  I am not used to this paranoia! But OF COURSE we have burglars and rapists in Norway all countries do. Does that mean that we have to be reminded of that fact in every film we see. We have the news and the papers for that. I really sympathize with Andres life has obviously not been easy for him. How else would you get such a cynical view of the world. This film was not used as governmentpropaganda it was a film based on a series of books that are deeply loved in Norway! Simple as that.".

	schema:headline " A SexCrazed Virgin and an Agoraphobic Poet";
	schema:reviewBody "Elling a comedy directed by Peter Nss tells the story of an unlikely friendship between two middleaged outcasts in Norway Kjell Bjarne Sven Nordina sexcrazed virgin with a heart as big as his massive frameand Elling Per Christian Ellefsenan agoraphobic amateur poet who is learning to cope with the death of his mother his sole companion for the past forty years. The two men meet in a fashion as unconventional as their personalities in the bedroom of a state institution. As their relationship develops and they are released from the institution they are set up in an apartment under the supervision of the surprisingly blunt social worker Frank sli Jrgen Langhelle. Here the two men learn everything from grocery shopping to conquering the colossal task of answering the phone. When Kjell Bjarne strikes up a romance with their lonely neighbor however Elling faces his greatest trial yet complete independence for one night. The results of this test and the many unexpected challenges of life that these friends face make for an hour and a half of absolute delight. As we follow their extraordinary story these bizarre heroes are able to make the seemingly mundane both fascinating and heartwarming. The chemistry between Ellefsen and Langhelle is tremendously funny and unwittingly charming persuading us to root for the underdog with absolute ease. Both originally stage actors it is clear that these men have mastered their craft. Their believable portrayal of such unbelievably kooky characters make Elling more than just another feelgood film it shows us how to connect with those who are disconnected. Ellefsen whose character's stuffy upbringing comes out in pompous commands to his oafish friend manages to win us over us with his puppylike helplessness juxtaposed with an excessive pride for accomplishing what we would consider to be everyday tasks. Nordin on the other hand instantly warms every heart in the audience with his selfless spirit using his brute strength rather ironically to help anyone in need.The true success of Elling is that it wasn't originally intended to be a film. Ingvar Ambjrsen first brought the story of Elling and Kjell Bjarne to Norway with his novel Bjdre I blodet Brothers in Blood from which director Petter Nss adapted the play Elling. From here the story evolved into the feature film which surpassed its previous record of success. The usual traps of stagetofilm adaptations of awkward dialogue and unnatural movement treating the set as a stage are a nonissue for Nass. The dialogue is clever but convincing and the actors move about the space as if it really is their home. Even the minor characters' reactions to Elling and Kjell Bjarne add to their believability as they echo what we are feeling in the audience. Jrgen Langhelle's Frank sli as the social worker embodies our astonishment and slight frustration with Elling and Kjell Bjarne's ineptitude while the retired poet played by Per Christensen expresses our sympathy for them. It is not in other words an intensely dramatic play shoved into the confines of a movie screen.Using the technique of voice over Nss was able to capture the intimacy of the original novel. He uses firstnarration so that Elling's life is not some freakish spectacle for strangers to gawk at but rather a story he wants to tell the world. Avoiding dramatic closeups the film never feels invasive. The camera movements sound production and lighting are all discreet so that the focus is never shifted from the story. Elling conveys what is often lost in big screen production the beauty in the subtleties of life. As Kjell Bjarne realizes the exhilaration of love our hearts beat flutters with anxiety too. Elling learns to trust himself and the world around him and we wish he were in the theater sitting next to us. Elling is a story about the adventures of a sexcrazes virgin and an agoraphobic poet it's true. But they are more than just outcaststhey are artists as their discoveries allow us to rediscover the wonders of living right along with them.".

	schema:headline " There's some Elling in everyone.";
	schema:reviewBody "Elling is a film with the potential to resonate in a variety of audiences with people from all over the world from various cultural social and economic backgrounds. It deals with universal issues that are not restricted to Oslo Norway or anywhere else in the world for that matter. Director Peter Nss does an excellent job of portraying common issues of anxiety shyness and confusion in social situations in his characters Elling and Kjell Bjarne. Elling and Kjell Bjarne can teach us a thing or two about the way we think about society and the world today and maybe even something about ourselves.It's important to note that while both main characters are socially inexperienced neither of them has a documented disability of any kind. All we know is that they lived extremely sheltered lives and now that they are adults they must learn to fend for themselves as everybody else does. They're normal people just like everyone else they've just been sheltered and are therefore nervous about stepping out into the world outside. Everybody gets nervous in new situations. Most people don't experience it to the same extent as Elling and Kjell Bjarne but it's something most people can relate to on some level.Society today often looks down on people who are unable to cope with certain social situations or who can't live on their own unless they have some sort of disability. It seems that we tend to think that they are less deserving than socalled normal people. The film does a good job of portraying them as portraying them as normal people with a variety of social anxiety issues due to their sheltered lives. We are meant sympathize and relate to the characters as opposed to look down on them. The film seems to be a realistic portrayal of the welfare system in Norway and might be very different to what an international audience is accustomed to.After living in an institution for a few years Elling and Kjell Bjarne are given an apartment and a stipend funded by the Norwegian government in order to assimilate into the world outside the institution. They're trying to prove that Elling and Kjell Bjarne can live on their own and become fully functioning members of society. Their social worker Frank Asli can be rather harsh and demanding but he succeeds in helping Elling and Kjell Bjarne adapt to the world outside their institution so one could say that his methods are effective. In Norway's welfare system everybody is given a chance to live the fullest life possible and programs are often funded by the state in order to provide equal opportunities.It's important to note that the institution placed Elling and Kjell Bjarne in an apartment together so that they can help each other with their issues. They each have their own strengths and can help each other with different things. At first Kjell Bjarne is more comfortable going out in public so he does the shopping and eventually gets Elling to accompany him to the caf for pork and gravy. Elling struggles with going out in public until he finds something that he can do for himself when he decides to go to a poetry meeting. He wants to prove to Kjell Bjarne that he can do things on his own too. Elling wants to be the more responsible sophisticated one. They set examples for each other to follow and each one wants to be able to do what the other one can so they essentially end up teaching and learning together about their new world in Oslo.Elling is a film that almost everyone can relate to. Almost everybody gets nervous in certain situations whether it's public speaking flying going on a ship or just going to the grocery store. Because Elling and Kjell Bjarne have no documented ability it's easier for the audience to relate to the characters and to see a little bit of the characters in themselves. It's easy for the audience to laugh along with the characters as they adventure in their new world. It can also provoke thoughts about the way that society deals with people like Elling and Kjell Bjarne how people view them on the street and how the government treats them. In the film they receive support from the government and reactions to the welfare system in Norway can vary depending on where a viewer is from. Perhaps one of the most important aspects of the film however is the importance of working together as a team. Elling and Kjell Bjarne are in this situation together and they eventually are able to overcome their differences to work together and begin to find their place in the world.".

	schema:headline " A simple interesting storyline? Yes please!";
	schema:reviewBody "Elling is the lighthearted story of two roommates living in downtown Oslo. Elling is a self proclaimed mama's boy and has been for forty years. When his mother dies however the state comes to bring him to an institution. There he and Kjell Bjarne a kind but womenobsessed man first meet as roommates. After two years there they are moved by way of welfare to an apartment in Oslo. As the two men struggle to get accustomed to life very much on their own tensions sometimes rise and angers flare. However the men discover many advantages to life on their own as well as developing their friendship further and further. Elling is upbeat throughout its plot and a fun film to watch.One of the major themes presented in this film is that of anxiety over feelings of personal safety. Elling has great anxiety and dizziness problems when he leaves their new apartment. After years of staying at home with only his mother for company he also shuns talking on the phone and doesn't like to answer the door when visitors come. This desire to keep entirely to himself and Kjell Bjarne seems to rise from a fear of the unknown a fear of being unsafe and not entirely in control. One of Elling's proudest moments is when he is able to use a public bathroom. He says of this personal triumph some people go skiing to the North Pole while I have problems just crossing a restaurant floor. Kjell Bjarne also struggles with this but to a much lesser extent. Kjell Bjarne sometimes is okay with not answering the phone such as when they first move in and he has a fear of talking to women. However he has a very kind heart and has a weakness for helping people which leads him to make some new acquaintances. The characters both are able to overcome much of their anxieties by the end of the film.Another theme in Elling is that of companionship. Elling and Kjell Bjarne develop a very caring relationship. Throughout the film however their friendship must survive jealousy and an unhealthy dependency. Elling gets jealous easily and they both rely heavily on each other. Like any truly lighthearted film however Kjell Bjarne and Elling make it through with their relationship all the stronger and healthier.Throughout the plot the theme of finding one's place in the world is present as well. This appears in the effect of welfare support the call of fame and the search for meaningful relationships. Elling and Kjell Bjarne were able to stay in the apartment as well as getting a stipend for food and other needs from the state's money. And while the welfare system isn't glorified the message of the film seems to be in support of how effective welfare can be in helping people. It is implied that both having their own apartment and having a figure to practically drag them to a more social and less closedoff lifestyle is extremely responsibly for the roommates' progress. Elling also feels the call of fame after he discovers how much he likes writing poetry. He debates claiming glory for his poems yet he ignores this impulse instead anonymously sending his poems to random people through sauerkraut packets. In this he finds happiness not in the possible fame he gives up. This shows a lot both about his character and about the cost of fame. Kjell Bjarne and Elling also search for meaningful relationships throughout the film. These relationships help the characters seeming to send the message that relationships help to shape and support people. Alfons Jorgensen and Reidun Nordsletten both contribute to the story by helping Elling and Kjell Bjarne to overcome some of their obstacles.The plot of this story was delightful and clear. It was very characterdriven and without much action yet it was charming. Unlike another very popular Norwegian film Hawaii Oslo the storyline was straightforward and chronological. The tone of this story was warm and uplifting. The use of light colors and upbeat music with little special effects dramatic camera angles or ominous color contrasts set the stage for the simple storyline. This simplicity was abundant throughout the film and mirrored the theme of safety which is faced by the characters as well as bringing a sense of sympathy and closeness with the characters and their trials and triumphs.As the tag line says They're packed and ready for the greatest adventure of their lives. All they have to do is get out of the house IMDb.com. This is one adventure which is purposeful delightful and a great hit and not to be missed!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this for the first time last night on Channel 4. I've never sought out the film before because I assumed that it would be an uninvolved telling of an uninteresting piece of British history. I was wrong.The piece works on several levels as they say. First the period evocation is excellent. I became interested in this era after reading an interesting book on slum landlord Peter Rachmann a few years back he is a minor character here. Christine Keeler was a figure who inhabited both the pot and ska parties of London's impoverished immigrant community and the bedrooms of the most powerful men in the land and this breadth and contrast gives the film sufficient scope to successfully capture the energy and feel of the time.Second the handling of character development is exemplary. The film surprises you by gradually shading in the relationship between Keeler and Stephen Ward until their completely believable 'love affair' becomes the focus in the moving finale. Joanne Whalley and John Hurt are both exceptional as Keeler and Ward turning in subtle and detailed performances. These characters are contradictory and ambiguous the kind of complex human beings who could quite easily be reduced to type by lesser actors.Third the film is made with real heart and intelligence. It is sympathetic to its characters and it strives to understand them and thus help us to understand them. The director Michael CatonJones frames and cuts with brilliant understatement making potent and witty use of contemporary music throughout. I really didn't expect the seamless technique and lowkey accretion of detail employed here and it kept me fascinated.The tone of the picture is just right. A kind of compassionate sadness. We come to feel the real injustice of the moral and social hypocrisy bought to bear without being assaulted by it and as noted before the ending is powerful and affecting. It would appear that tabloid scumbags were as pernicious an influence then as they are now and the observations thereon are as relevant as ever.If I had to find fault with the film it would be this Ian McKellen models perhaps the least convincing bald pate in the history of cinema as John Profumo. So much so that for me it impacts negatively on his otherwise notable performance. Its a minor flaw all told.I was surprised. I was impressed. I was moved. If you happen upon the film sit down and watch it. You will be rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewed from the 21st century the Profumo affair seems much ado about nothing a sex scandal of an altogether more innocent age. Put to one side the marginal security issues and all that is left is a bit of bad behaviour among the aristocracy and to be frank if you choose not to shoot these people you can't really expect for anything more. It did leave one serious casualty however Stephen Ward procurer of girls to the upper classes who committed suicide after being abandoned by his friends when the going got tough. 'Scandal' tells his story and manages to be reasonably sympathetic to Ward Christine Keeler the girl who slept with Profumo and even to some extent the minister although the facts don't quite seem to support the continuing strength of the bond between Ward and Keeler as depicted. The portrait of the early 1960s is well judged without the film ever feeling overly historical and there are interesting insights into the semiprofessional sexual relationships between the smart set and the girls on the make they adopted. But the best thing about 'Scandal' is really the acting. A distinguished array of British character actors perform their turns impeccably and Joanne Whalley while never quite looking eighteen is a dead ringer for Keeler and always nice to look at. But in his own way John Hurt who plays Ward is also great to look at in his case because of his straightforward excellence as an actor. In his hands Ward is an essentially mediocre man and yet charming far from wicked and ultimately tragic. In some senses the whole affair provided a template for the subsequent portrayal of the private lives of politicians by the press to the extent that today it would hardly make the waves that it did at the time. But this film goes far beyond historical reconstruction and is well worth watching in spite of the relative triviality of the events is portrays.".

So it has a lot of nudity to spice things up man the sixties were a decadent time! good acting and brilliant soundtrack of theme songs just recreates the times for you. John Hurt as the ambitious 'doctor' is excellent as is Bridget Fonda.

	schema:reviewBody "If Scandal 1989 was not a fairly accurate recounting of Britain's John Profumo Affair the characters and events would be too weird to be considered plausible fiction. Defense Minister Profumo's attempt to refute allegations of his involvement with Christine Keeler ultimately brought down the 10 year Conservative Party government back in the mid1960's. Scandal recreates these events and gives the viewer a glimpse into the personalities and possible motives of the main players in this political soap opera.But recreating history is a secondary consideration in this film whose theme is about individuals who live in a fairy tale world until they fall victim to the grim forces that take life more seriously. The main player is Stephen Ward John Hurt a osteopath and recreational artist whose main goal is to be part of the right crowd not so much immersed in this kind of society as in a position to observe it closely for his amusement. His method for doing so involves discovering ravishing young women from the poor side of town and doing a Henry Higgins number on them. The film begins with his discovery of Keeler Joanne Whalley who he begins grooming and introducing to prominent members of his incrowd. The two soon fall in love but theirs is not a physical relationship. Stephen delights in seeing his protg work her magic on men in authority. This eventually leads to their doom since no one quite understands such an unconventional relationship they have no credibility when an attempt is made to make Stephen a scapegoat for the government scandal.In retrospect the process of attacking Ward to contain the widening scandal was one of the two most shameful abuses of the judicial system in post war Britain. Coincidentally Hurt played the victim in the other one as well 10 Rillington Place 1971 in which Hurt is wrongly executed for a murder committed by his landlord the now notorious serial killer John Christie.Scandal is a powerful and arresting film with solid performances. Whalley has the biggest role and is a bit too intelligent looking to be completely believable as a character like Keeler. But she is so nice to look at that almost anyone would willingly trade credibility for sceneryand she is otherwise entirely convincing in an excellent performance. I first noticed her in Willow the film she made just before Scandal. She had a secondary part but her scenes were the most memorable in the entire film. Hurt somehow sells you on the fact that his character derives an innocent joy from simply seeing a beautiful young woman walking down the street on a nice day.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

I thought that Roland Gift was OK as Johnny edgecombe  although at the time I thought he was supposed to be Lucky Gordon.I thought that Leslie Philips was going to be a disaster as Lord Astor but he was excellent.The problem of having lived through the period is that when it is portrayed on film you can see all the mistakes in fashions and background. This film is no exception.The music is quite apt  in one case see below spot on  and I thought that the truly appalling rendition of She Wears Red Feathers in the night club scene was very atmospheric.Someone else pointed out the scene as the girls are dressing while The Shadows play Apache.

Her affair with then Minister Of War John Profumo the scandal that followed and the effect it had on those involved is the subject of Michael CatonJones' 1989 film Scandal. CatonJones with the help of a first rate cast and script brings to life the scandal that brought down the British government.The film's cast is fantastic to say the least. Leading it is John Hurt as OsteopathPlayboy Stephen Ward and Joanne Whalley as the infamous Christine Keeler. Both are well cast Whalley being a very good physical match for Keeler especially and both give what seem to be honest performances as people who find themselves going from the time of the their lives to the worst moments of it. Right behind them are Bridget Fonda and Ian McKellen as the other two major players in the scandal Mandy RiceDavies and John Profumo respectively. The supporting cast includes Jeroen Krabbe as Soviet naval attach Eugene Ivanov Jean Alexander as Keeler's mother Leslie Phillips as Bill aka Lord Astor and James Villiers as an MP. The cast is fantastic and helps to sell the realistic recreation of the scandal.The realism is also helped by the production values as well. The production design of Simon Holland and the costumes of Jane Robinson bring to life the late 1950searly 1960s world of the film from lurid clubs to country estates and the halls of government. Mike Molloy's cinematography is key to much of the film as it often gives the viewer a feeling of being a fly on the wall of the events taking place. There are moments also where it gives the viewer a feeling of what it must have been like as the scandal grows and the world closes around some of the characters. Angus Newton's editing helps that as well even though the film itself seems to be just a bit too long. All of this under the superb direction of CatonJones makes the film's recreation of this world seemingly complete.That wouldn't the case though without the script. Drawing from a number of different sources listed towards the end of the film's end credits Scandal traces the journey from 1959 to 1963 as what starts out as Ward's attempt to introduce the beautiful young Keeler to his friends in high places leads to a scandal that destroys the sitting British government. The script by Michael Thomas is more then just a simple accounting of the scandal though. It is a study of the different people involved in it and how by accident more then design then found themselves caught up in it. Scandal takes the viewer into a world of sex booze and above all else hypocrisy. This is no better illustrated then in a scene early in the film where a group including Ward and Keeler are in a nightclub surrounded by scantily clad women celebrating the victory of the Conservative government in the 1959 UK general election. The result is an eye opening journey into the human side of an infamous political scandal.From its first rate cast production values direction and script Scandal is a fine example of history being brought to life on film. It is a journey into a world of sex booze and hypocrisy that bred an infamous scandal that brought down a sitting British government almost fifty years ago. It is also a journey into the human cost of that scandal told in a way that is haunting realistic and perhaps even truthful as well.".

His role in this film was of Stephen Ward the scapegoat of the whole Affair and this film portrays it from his side well he doesn't fail in this film either! Joanne WhalleyKilmer has an uncanny likeness to the real Miss Keeler too and in some parts it was hard to tell them apart. There are real locations used throughout the film too i.e Lord Astors house and the great pool!!!! There are some saucier scenes in the uncut version but either version contains enough plot etc and i don't feel it spoils it if you are viewing a edited version. This film is definitely well worth a look!".

The film tends to meander with incongruent scenes of WhalleyKilmer's affairs with a couple of drugdealing black men. WhalleyKilmer is quite alluring and it is not hard to believe that men would risk their careers for dalliances with her. Hurt is fine as a doctor who introduces the girls to the ministers.".

This movie gives some hints to understanding sexual background of current political figures and possibly explains some mystery deaths around the Crown for example the Russian oligarch Berezovsky.

	schema:reviewBody "John Profumo Minister of War in the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan was forced to resign in 1963 when it was discovered that he had lied to the House of Commons about his affair with Christine Keeler a modelcumdancercumgeneralgoodtimegirl. More than fifty years on the Profumo Affair still remains Britain's most notorious political sex scandal. It even rated a mention British politician sex in Billy Joel's We Didn't Start the Fire. Other British politicians whose careers were ended or damaged by scandal Tony Lambton Jeremy Thorpe Cecil Parkinson are now largely forgotten figures. David Mellor remains in the public eye but more as a radio personality than as an expolitician and few people today remember exactly why he was the subject of so much tabloid gossip in the early nineties.Profumo's name however lives on possibly because the affair in which he was involved may actually have altered the course of history. In the general election of October 1964 the film wrongly gives the date as November Macmillan's successor Alec DouglasHome was very narrowly defeated by Labour's Harold Wilson. Had his party not been embroiled in a lurid scandal the previous year DouglasHome might well have stayed in power and British politics in the late sixties could have been very different.In many ways the main character in the film is neither Profumo nor Keeler but Stephen Ward the man who first brought them together. Ward was and still is a controversial figure. I have never really bought into the theory that he was the innocent scapegoat of an Establishment frameup and I certainly would not agree with the reviewer who compared Ward with Timothy Evans. The comparison may have been suggested by the fact that both men were played by John Hurt Evans in Ten Rillington Place but the two cases were very different. Evans who was hanged for a murder he did not commit was the victim of an appalling miscarriage of justice. Ward who committed suicide during his trial may well have been guilty of the crime of which he was accused living off the immoral earnings of a prostitute. Keeler admitted accepting money from the men she slept with and then passing it to Ward she always denied being a prostitute but in the eyes of the law she probably was.Even if Ward was technically innocent of the charge he was nevertheless a rather louche sleazy character. The son of a clergyman he worked as an osteopath a profession which brought him a decent living but nevertheless had a sideline as pimp to the British Establishment organising orgies and assignments for highclass gentlemen with lowclass morals of whom Profumo was one. He assumed that his friends in high places would protect him from the law and that if friendship proved insufficient his power to blackmail his clients would do the trick. After Profumo's downfall and the disgrace of several other personalities in the wake of the scandal however there was nobody left to protect him and he no longer held any secrets which had not already been revealed. The Establishment had no need to frame an innocent man they merely flung a guilty one to the wolves.Both main female characters Keeler and her friend and fellow goodtime girl Mandy RiceDavies are played by actresses who seemed destined for stardom in the late eighties and early nineties Joanne Whalley and Bridget Fonda. Neither really fulfilled their early promise despite their good looks Whalley's marriage to a major star Val Kilmer and Fonda's status as the heir to one of America's bestknown acting dynasties. Fonda does not seem to have made any films since 2002 and although Whalley is still on the scene she does not really count as a big name these days.Both however are very good here. Whalley plays Keeler with a beguiling mixture of seductiveness and feigned innocence. She had what was probably an unusual experience for her playing a woman who was more beautiful than she was whatever else Keeler might have been she was a striking beauty and had her name not been tarnished by the scandal might have become one of Britain's leading models. Fonda's RiceDavis is a brash and cheeky youngster able to raise a laugh even in the formal setting of a courtroom with her famous line Well he would wouldn't he? when it was put to her that Lord Astor an associate of Profumo had denied sleeping with her. Fonda also copes well with the challenge of a British accent.Hurt manages to raise a certain amount of sympathy despite his obvious sleaziness for Ward a man who seems firmly in control and then suddenly finds his world collapsing about his ears. Ian McKellen is smoothly repellent as John Profumo a man brought down as much by his arrogance as by his lust. Scandal is an entertaining history lesson but it is also a study of the temptations and pitfalls of power. 710".

Ian McKellen is smoothly repellent as John Profumo a man brought down as much by his arrogance as by his lust. Scandal is an entertaining history lesson but it is also a study of the temptations and pitfalls of power. 710";

The script is oddly coy and cagey when it comes to key points in the pliot and the whole Lucky Gordon episode is a mess. A fine performance by John Hurt goes some way towards salvaging something. But miniskirts in 1963? And while the end theme is pretty good the lyrics are abysmal! Hurt's final scene with the falling cigarete though is splendid.".

	schema:headline " A good film but it never reaches the level that it should";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1987 book Honeytrap by Anthony Summers and Stephen Dorril this is quite a good film treatment of the Profumo affair which rocked the British establishment in 1963 and severely discredited the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan. It is reasonably historically accurate but neither the script by Michael Thomas nor the direction by Michael CatonJones making his debut are as strong as they could be. Given the subject matter it could hardly leave out sex scenes but some of them were a little over the top.The film's strength lies in the acting. John Hurt gives a brilliant performance as Stephen Ward the social climbing osteopath and artist who uses girls such as Christine Keeler and Mandy RiceDavies to increase his status by introducing them to prominent men. In Keeler's case the fact that he introduced her to both the Minister of War John Profumo and the Russian naval attach  spy Eugene Ivanov was the source of the trouble. In the film Ward is not depicted as being a very good man. In fact he is a rather unsavoury sort whom my mother would describe as a dirty devil. He seems to care about no one but himself. Keeler is fond of him but I think that his affection for her is limited to what he thought that she could for him. However he is never as interesting or compelling a character as he could be as the writing is somewhat lacking. That said the film did a good job in eliciting sympathy towards the end when his friends abandon him and he is put on trial for living off immoral earnings or to put it more simply being a pimp. In the film's final scene Ward's suicide is depicted when he takes a drug overdose no longer able to cope with the pressure of the trial and the constant hounding of the press. He was found guilty in absentia shortly before his death but the result has been severely criticised due to the lack of evidence against him and it is currently under review. There was plenty of blame to go around but the bulk of it was shouldered by Ward which was unfair. On the other hand Profumo was able to rebuild his reputation to a certain extent due to his charity work. The cynical part of me tends to think that that was the main reason why he did it.I had never seen Joanne Whalley in anything before but I was very impressed by her performance of Christine Keeler the last surviving major participant in the scandal. The film depicts Keeler as a troubled young woman barely more than a child when she meets Ward and moves in with him. Ward does not force her into having relationships with numerous men but he does subtly manipulate her into doing so. She was hardly a naive person in spite of her youth but she trusted him more than he deserved and he let her down. I can't blame her for going to the press in the circumstances. Ian McKellen is extremely good as Profumo whom the film does not hesitate to portray in a very negative light but he has surprisingly little screen time. Bridget Fonda has seldom been better than as Mandy RiceDavies who delivered the immortal line Well he would wouldn't he? during Ward's trial even if her English accent does occasionally slip. It also features great performances from the perfectly cast Leslie Phillips as Lord Astor Jereon Krabb as Ivanov Deborah Grant as Profumo's heartbroken humiliated wife Valerie Hobson the former film star best known for her roles in Bride of Frankenstein and Great Expectations 1946 Daniel Massey as Mervyn GriffithJones Iain Cuthbertson as Lord Hailsham Jean Alexander as Mrs. Keeler Alex Norton and Paul Brooke as the police officers and Trevor Eve as the American erstwhile matine idol David Fairfax Jr. who is no way shape or form based on Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Showing that it really is a very small world both Hobson and Fairbanks Jr. appeared in the 1937 film Jump for Glory.Overall this is a good film but it never reaches the level that it should. When I taught a constitutional law tutorial on ministerial responsibility last year I described the Profumo affair to the students none of whom seemed to have heard of it as a real life Cold War thriller involving a showgirl a Minister of the Crown a Soviet spy and a film star. Sadly this film is not as exciting as I made the real thing sound.".

	schema:headline " See This Movie! It Is Beyond Belief!";
	schema:reviewBody "After years of hearing about this I finally tracked down a pirate cassette of this unbelievable film. Oh My God any fan of bad movies must see this for the thrill of a lifetime!This is the film that dares to ask the question what happens when a director of bloated epic dramas tries his hand at screwball comedy?' Now ask what happens when he and most Hollywood are desperate to get with it' and you'll be approaching the bizarre truth of Skidoo'. If you thought Otto Preminger couldn't get any worse then Hurry Sundown' this will prove you quite wrong.I'm tempted to compare this film with late 60's wrecks like Casino Royale' but it's really in a different league. Its more like a big budget Love American Style episode or a middleaged embarrassment like The Mother's InLaw'. Perhaps there was once a scenario lurking at the bottom of all this or someone had a screenplay and it blew away. Either way the whole thing appears to have been edited with a lawn mower.But incoherent structure is only part of this remarkable cinematic experience it also contains the wackiest cast of middleaged actors ever all of whom should have known better. Beyond embarrassing for all concerned which is why it's so great to watch. Everyone on screen just looks confused as if Otto's only direction to them was act crazy now'. Burgess Meredith chews at his small part like bubble gum even out doing himself in Hurry Sundown' or 'Such Good Friends'.  Carol Channing is the real mind blower here! I thought I would die when I saw her groovy striptease but then I saw the film's climax where she leads a hippie flotilla in a freaked out royal navy uniform as they board Grocho's yacht while Carol sings the ridiculous theme song. Your life as a film fan is incomplete until you've watched this scene and played it back to make sure you really saw it. Jakie Gleason's acid freak out is even better than Vincent Price's in The Tingler'.This film had a big budget but from the jailhouse freak out scene it's pretty clear that no one working on this acid movie had any idea what tripping was like.

It all ends with Grocho in his last film getting stoned with Austin Pendlton in his first film as drift away in a lifeboat with a tiedye sail. Then Otto Preminger announces the film is over as Harry Nelson sings the entire credits!What could they have been thinking? This has got to be one of the biggest missteps in Hollywood history. The film seems to have barely been released. I've only read one contemporary review of it and that one describes Carol Channing as a walking sight gag'. It seems that everyone involved with this film sobered up and decided to quietly bury the evidence. Even today few bad movie fans know of Skidoo' since it is not shown on TV and has never been released on video. Reportedly Preminger's daughter controls the negative and is sitting on it to protect here father's reputation. I found a copy of the film's soundtrack album in a thrift store a few years back and it too is a dusey. Once you've heard Ms. Channing scream Skidoo skidoo do what ya wanna do' over  over again you may never been the same. Seek out Skidoo' it smells like pumpkins!".

	onyx:emotionText "After years of hearing about this I finally tracked down a pirate cassette of this unbelievable film. Oh My God any fan of bad movies must see this for the thrill of a lifetime!This is the film that dares to ask the question what happens when a director of bloated epic dramas tries his hand at screwball comedy?' Now ask what happens when he and most Hollywood are desperate to get with it' and you'll be approaching the bizarre truth of Skidoo'. If you thought Otto Preminger couldn't get any worse then Hurry Sundown' this will prove you quite wrong.I'm tempted to compare this film with late 60's wrecks like Casino Royale' but it's really in a different league. Its more like a big budget Love American Style episode or a middleaged embarrassment like The Mother's InLaw'. Perhaps there was once a scenario lurking at the bottom of all this or someone had a screenplay and it blew away. Either way the whole thing appears to have been edited with a lawn mower.But incoherent structure is only part of this remarkable cinematic experience it also contains the wackiest cast of middleaged actors ever all of whom should have known better. Beyond embarrassing for all concerned which is why it's so great to watch. Everyone on screen just looks confused as if Otto's only direction to them was act crazy now'. Burgess Meredith chews at his small part like bubble gum even out doing himself in Hurry Sundown' or 'Such Good Friends'.  Carol Channing is the real mind blower here! I thought I would die when I saw her groovy striptease but then I saw the film's climax where she leads a hippie flotilla in a freaked out royal navy uniform as they board Grocho's yacht while Carol sings the ridiculous theme song. Your life as a film fan is incomplete until you've watched this scene and played it back to make sure you really saw it. Jakie Gleason's acid freak out is even better than Vincent Price's in The Tingler'.This film had a big budget but from the jailhouse freak out scene it's pretty clear that no one working on this acid movie had any idea what tripping was like. Imagine Peter Lawford Burgess Meredith and Slim Pickens all acting kooky and pretending to freak out. It all ends with Grocho in his last film getting stoned with Austin Pendlton in his first film as drift away in a lifeboat with a tiedye sail.

Clearly this wasn't it as the films he went on to do became far slower and subdued.  Too bad really as there's some great stuff herein.  An excellent cast weaves its way through a confusing plot as follows Jackie Gleason has retired from the mob and lives happily enough with wife Carol Channing and turtlefaced lackey Arnold Stang the latter of whom gets iced and prematurely I say  let Stang stay in the picture! when George Romero and Frankie Avalon try to persuade Gleason to pull a hit for the mob leader God'  Groucho Marx living in luxury on a boat with skinny Donyale Luna.  Gleason finally agrees and disappears to prison cellmates with a peacespeaking mad scientistlooking Austin Pendelton. Meanwhile Channing pretty teenage daughter Alexandra Hay and her hippie boyfriend John Philip Law who goes by Stash' all become close friends when mom lets his hippie commune live in their house.  Channing and Fay go separately to seduce Avalon to find out to where Gleason has gone.  In prison Gleason accidentally lets on to his hit potential squealer and squeal he does Mickey Rooney at the time in his sixth decade of filmmaking! and further blunders when he writes a letter home and licks one of Pendelton's LSDsoaked envelopes.  After a mesmerizing yet stupid trip sequence Gleason decides not to make the hit and goes into conference with Pendelton.  It's right around here that things get very manic with an acid party in jail on the day that warden Burgess Meredith stops by to eat with the prisoners.  Gleason and company make their escape while everybody's tripping their ears off including tower guard Harry Nilsson and switchboard operator Slim Pickens and the cast assembles for a bizarre conclusion on Marx's boat. No easy whodunit this.  That Paramount would make a production with a cast and crew like this clearly indicates that the ruleless environment of 1968 sent the studios scrambling.  Furthermore the gimmick of presenting some of Hollywood's best known faces feigning acid trips acts as evidence that in the ensuing hubbub producers showed heart in making vehement attempts to pander to a difficult target audience.  Two serious low points may leave people with a rotten taste in their ears Channing has a musical number near the end of the film that advocates a freewheeling hippie lifestyle and Nilsson sings each and every word of the credits down to the copyright.".

Those two alone as parents might make anyone want to join a commune.Cesar Romero and Frankie Avalon bring a message from God or at least that's what syndicate boss Groucho Marx. Groucho wants mob informer Mickey Rooney killed but Mickey's in prison. Never mind the mob can do anything bust Gleason into prison and bust him right out once the job is done. But Rooney won't let people near him but since Gleason's an old friend he'll be vulnerable to him. Which is what Groucho is thinking.Since Gleason balks Groucho captures Alexandra Hay and brings her on his yacht from where he runs things. At that point with Marx having him by the short hairs Gleason agrees to the contract.The big idea is to get the entire prison tripping on LSD so no one will interfere. But of course things do go wrong as you'll see if you care to watch the film.No matter how many big names were packed into Skidoo nothing could get this picture off the ground. Otto Preminger packed the film with a whole lot of people he had used in previous films like Peter Lawford Burgess Meredith Slim Pickens but all to no avail. The jokes fell flat as a punctured souffl the situations were just not funny in fact even Groucho apparently wasn't in the mood to adlib any of his patented humor.In fact Groucho playing a character called God WAS the funniest thing in the film. It has serious theological implications for those of us who thought George Burns or Morgan Freeman was God.In its own way Skidoo was as big a disaster even bigger than Plan Nine From Outer Space. And Preminger had a much bigger budget to work from.".

Groucho is touching at 78 trying harder than he did in Love Happy and for a fleeting moment lifts the car out of the ditch. Everyone seems to note how weird this was but in context I would say not so much. It's an attempt to imitate Terry Southern's hipster humor which only worked when applied by directors like Kubrick and Richardson with a light even handed touch. Then again the jokes are far more obvious than Southern and the basic situation too absurd. Sad to see so many great stars near the end but the real question is how did Harry Nilsson survive this ?".

As bizarre as it all sounds it plays like an extended episode of a bad sitcom and is really rather tame.

This film has so much to say about media and violence and militarization and the 1960s climate that its dismissal only makes sense. A movie that says this much in such a conniving and subversive way is one that should be treasured and never thrown under the bus. Mickey Rooney knew what he was doing Groucho Marx knew what he was doing and definitely Carol Channing knew what she was doing. This film is extremely wellcrafted and nothing is haphazard as some have suggested. It also has some of the best pan shots of all time. Its jail house scenes are complete comedy regardless of what scope they are viewed through. This wasn't just Preminger cutting loose from a studio's iron fist this was Preminger and the screenwriter making a serious comment on society. Watch this film on the big screen in any reissue if you can but it is actually really clever to see it on old bootlegs because you can see how much it doesn't fit into the Saturday TV Matine format or any format for that matter. Groucho Marx did tune in and drop outand its because all those great 1930s1950s legends are so hip and weirded out by their usual offerings that they committed and committed fully to making such an unbelievably brilliant comedyadventure with loads to say. Actors act because they relate to material and see something in the text. The film is photographed so well and is so appreciative of the film's talent that as it communicates its messages it provides a great staging ground for Rooney Channing Bolger Avalon and Marx to do the oddest and most remarkable work of their career. Entertainment on the edge people dig it!!!".

There are a few laughoutloud scenes especially Gleason pretending to have dropped acid. He really does a credible job of acting like he's tripping I must admit. The hallucination scenes however are really stupid and wildly unrealistic. This film is interesting because it has a truly proacidhippie lifestyle slant which I didn't expect. But despite that it just isn't very good or really entertaining at all. If I hadn't read a brief summary of the movie before seeing it I would have had no idea what was going on plotwise it's sort of incoherent and loose to say the least. Worth checking out as a curiosity.".

Preminger had a massive inferiority complex because he knew he wasn't really a good director. Even he could tell this when he was forced to finish a picture Lubitch had started THAT LADY IN ERMINE to resounding jeers. Preminger was no Lubitch. He had no talent and he knew it. He covered this by being an absolutely miserable person. Lubitch was a smart little Berlin street kid who started as a clown and Preminger was the son of some big Viennese macher who used connections to get in with Max Reinhardt. Lubitch knew how to entertain an audience. Preminger knew how to boss people around. He was a director not because he had any artistic interest but because the director is the boss' job. Very early on he became his own producer. Nobody can boss a boss.He didn't care so much what a film was about as long as he was making it. In later years but before the Alzheimer he couldn't recall making his early films at Fox and watched FALLEN ANGEL on TV as he was dressing to go out as if it had been directed by someone else. Later when he produced for his own company he became more selective of the properties he made choosing sure fire stage hits and best sellers. He made sure he hired good crafts people and top writers.He covered his artistic illiteracy with aggression intimidation and bullying. Friend Billy Wilder cast him as the Nazi POW camp commandant in STALAG 17 for a reason. Type casting. If Preminger was a painter he'd use a brush for house paints. Broad strokes please and nothing too fancy. When he shows a woman going wrong she runs off with an oily Flamenco dancer. Preminger is in the direct bombastic line of C. B. DeMille. Even so If Preminger had been Philo Farnsworth we'd all be watching potatoes instead of TV today. Preminger has his moments. ANATOMY OF MURDER has a Joseph H. Lewis low budget induced sense of mundane realism. The vinegar of location shooting absorbs the slightly sweet hammy but underplayed acting. But Otto was just beginning his run of super productions beginning with EXODUS and crashing down with badly botched HURRY SUNDOWN. Premiger resides in the pantheon of an obscure French cineaste cult known as the MacMahonists.Right after that Preminger let his hair down figuratively of course slapped on the love beads dropped acid and decided to tell the world. From somewhere he became aware of a script by one Doran William Cannon. What was in the original script would be interesting. Apparently Mr. Cannon's work was mailable enough to become whatever a director wanted it to be. He also wrote BREWSTER MCCLOUD and that is for better or ill a Robert Altman film. Maybe Cannon articulated the gestalt but couldn't dramatize or or the other way around or maybe his message was just too subversive for directors working in the system called the movie industry who defanged a project by merely adding their egos to the mix. Sort of like symbolic Holocaust Memorials more representative of a designer's cleverness than what they're supposed to be about.In this instance we have a parade of moronic ofthe times conceits and also timelessly and illtimed corny schtick. Jackie Gleason is a retired gangster married the Carol Channing reprising her Lorelei Lee bit from the fifties. They have an impossibly beautiful blond daughter Alexandra Hay and straight as she is she's in love with impossibly beautiful movie hippie John Philip Law who in real life was the mover behind a high class celebrity commune in the desert. Gleason is pulled back into the organization because as the organization's leading hit man he is ordered to break into Alcatraz to kiss a big time informant Mickey Rooney. Its remarkable the number of old pros Preminger recruited for a days work. The head of the organization GOD is Groucho Marx with an ironically bad die job on his hair and mustache living on a yacht. I mean George Raft appears as the yacht captain but why?Then suddenly strangely bursting out of the crap celluloid like the alien spawn emerging from John Hurt there is a real movie. Gleason is sent to a cell and joined by draft protester Austin Pendleton. The only thing worth watching in Skidoo are the scenes with Pendelton in them.Gleason writes a letter to his wife on Pendelton's stationary which has been impregnated with LSD. Pendelton then acts as a guide for Gleason's trip. If this had been the whole movie Skidoo would now today be hailed as a classic of sixties filmmaking instead of lame garbage most notable for it difficult availability. It makes me wonder if this trip or even if the entire prison scenario was the core of Cannon's original concept sort of a hip ripoff of A NOUS LA LIBERTE.Kiss is used as the euphemism for kill throughout the picture even on Austin Pendelton's poster which reads Kiss for Peace. Its the sensitivity to death borne of an acid trip.There are some strange bits as Gleason and Pendelton escape from prison by spiking everyone's food with LSD. Fred Clark who was sort of the straight man's straight man not that he was the best but after George Burns was finished working straight for Gracie he world work in two with Fred Clark with Clark working straight for him. He does a six minute solo of acid vaudeville silliness.Whatever is taking place outside of the world of Gleason who is excellent and note perfect and Pendelton a really magnificent performance under the most difficult conditions is worthless drivel.".

Om Prakash Sappy Indian epic love story definitely has it's good points including the songs  dancing but it wreaks from a goodytwoshoes perspective where pretty much everything eventually works out for everyone. The story is about a truck driver named Deepak who meets a professional singer named Aasha on the road and becomes her friend. She vows to make him a star and feels for him in other ways also but he's already engaged to be married. After his marriage tragedy strikes as he has an accident and is presumed dead and his wife commits suicideexcept she doesn't die either. She is blinded has a child and stays at a religious retreat. Her daughter upon selling trinkets runs into the former truck driver who now is engaged to be married to the singer. Upon finding out about the child's misfortunate mother the singer performs a good deed and pays for her operation to bring back the mother's sight. Of course Deepak doesn't find out about the connections until near the end. This is a very soap operalike story with religious overtones and good music but once the drama begins we don't hear much more of the music  sadly. Overall a pretty sappy movie that was enjoyable to watch but didn't bring about any longlasting effect.".

They have to use a little trickery to get him out of the jungle and away from his foster father witch doctor Roscoe Lee Browne. Browne knows all the jungle remedies but he's lived in the world outside the Kenyan veld and he's up to its challenges.But he's still got concern for his foster son who ain't used to civilization and all the things that entails. Among which include women in the person of shapely Dayle Haddon who covers him on the academic end of things at college. Talk about remedial education though this is really stretching it.She's also got a jealous suitor in Danny Goldman. Goldman's a little ferret of a schemer the would be Iago sends for Browne from Kenya to work his voodoo magic to get Vincent back to the woodland wilds and a clear path for Goldman back to Haddon. If that means him losing the big NCAA track meet where Vincent is going to represent Maryvale in all events like Jim Thorpe did years ago for Carlisle so be it.JanMichael Vincent looks just fabulous in a loin cloth. I'm surprised he never was cast in a straight out Tarzan film. He actually did appear in one years later when he was much older and the bad guy in that one. Of course he just had to utter Me Nanu.......You Jane to Haddon whose character name of course was Jane.Vincent and Haddon get great support from the whole cast especially Tim Conway who has to deal with being shrunk to three inches in height by Browne in a bar. Conway gets a nice fifteen minute sequence trying to deal with his unfamiliar surroundings. Nancy Walker has a fine bit as a Mrs. Magoo landlady who can't recognize a tiger that Vincent has brought from Africa as a pet. He must have gotten him from the zoo in Mombasa because as most kids know tigers aren't native to Africa.This was the final feature film appearance of Billy DeWolfe who plays the dean of the college and Goldman's uncle. I suspect he would have had more of a role had health permitted it.The World's Greatest Athlete is one of Disney's better screen comedies for the Seventies. And as we learn in the end JanMichael Vincent might not just be The World's Greatest Athlete.".

So they give it a try. Like many Disney films from the early 1970s it's loaded with silly humor and contrived sentiment yet there is a certain charm that may endear it to the younger members of its audience.".

	schema:headline " ...but not the world's greatest movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "One in a long series of formulaic teenager with a difference Disney comedies this movie is of interest mainly for its cast and its occasional bits of amusement accidentally tossed in amongst the tedium. Amos plays a college athletics coach who leaves on a sojourn to Africa with his assistant Conway in tow after suffering yet another humiliatingly bad season. While there to forget his troubles he is introduced to Vincent a spectacularly talented young man who is the orphaned child of missionaries and who has been raised in the wild. He can outrun a cheetah outjump a monkey and basically outdo anyone or anything in the realm of sports. In an extended sequence Amos coerces him to return to his school with his pet tiger along for the adventure! and play for his track  field team. Since Vincent has been in the jungle his entire life he needs a tutor to help him with his college subjects ! and so Amos enlists pretty Haddon to help him. This leads the jealous and devious Goldman to retrieve Vincent's witch doctor mentor Browne from the continent and have him taken back out of the way. Browne uses voodoo to foul up Amos's dreams of glory for Vincent and to keep Conway from alerting Amos to his presence. Naturally it all ends well this being a Disney movie. Amos who made something of a historic footnote by playing the first black lead in a Disney film in decades is animated and enthusiastic in his role though a bit one note. It's hard to imagine that the man here straining to make a lot of tired jokes funny and overplaying a lot of them is the same one who stormed off of Good Times because of the scripts and who later made such an impact in Roots. Conway's improvisational style sort of butts up uncomfortably against the carefully structured formula comedy found here and his timing seems off as a result though he does have an amusing extended sequence in which he is shrunken to the size of a doll and knocked around inside a purse and around a bar area. Vincent who naturally is in peak shape here is hilariously bad in his acting but impressive in the action sequences. It's also quite stunning to see him and Amos Conway and Walker! cavorting with a real tiger in the film! Haddon not coincidentally playing a girl named Jane has a rather sensuous moment with Vincent as she's tutoring him but otherwise isn't given much to do. She would famously appear in Playboy right after filming this confounding the Disney executives! Browne is clearly enjoying his sly magical role and has a lot of fun disrupting things and yanking the chains of those around him. Walker tries to inject some humor into her preposterous role of a nearly blind landlady who keeps mistaking the tiger for an inebriated tenant. Some real life sportscasters appear to lend an air of authenticity to the patently unreal proceedings chiefly Gifford McKay and Cosell who has trouble playing himself though he does tick off an amusing line or two along the way. It's not a bad movie it's just a very routine one with humor that had to be a tad stale even at the time of release.".

He's slim and muscular with long blond hair and he looks perfect in the skimpy Tarzan outfits. But really the star of this film is the TIGER! You never see this in movies today  a real live fullsize tiger wrestling with the leading actor! With his teeth around JMV's neck no less!! Can you imagine? One false move and CRUNCH! Dead actor! Wow. I was amazed. JMV cuddles and rolls around with this Tiger throughout the movie. It's awesome. Move on over Russell Crowe  Jan Michael Vincent takes on real tigers not CGI ones!!!".

In this one Coach John Amos and his assistant Tim Conway have been on the losing end of various sports endeavors for so long that dean Billy De Wolfe in a toobrief rolewho's accompanied by his son Danny Goldmanremind them of just one more year on their contract. Amos tears it up and goes to Africa with Conway to get away from it all. There they find JanMichael Vincent who outruns a tiger. The only way they can get him though is if he saves one of them...I'll stop there and just say that this is one of those silly family comedies that was the House of Mickey's breadandbutter during the decade that the other major studios were making big box office and winning Oscars with more mature fare. With the Tarzaninspired story and many wellestablished special effects there are quite a few chuckles hereand even a big laugh concerning a wheelchairbound old man who can suddenly walkthat I admit to doing while watching. And it's fun seeing Conway either putting his head where it sometimes doesn't belong or getting moved by a voodoo doll once owned by a witch doctor played by Roscoe Lee Browne. But the stuff involving Nancy Walker as a nearsighted landlady and Goldman as the dean's interloping son I could do without. And stunning Dayle Haddon as Vincent's girlfriend called Jane of course is just window dressing. Still this is harmless fare that should provide enough enjoyable distraction for 90 minutes especially as you watch such reallife announcers like Frank Gifford and Howard Cosell join in on the fun. P.S. I just found out via the IMDb site that Mr. Goldman was the voice of Brainy Smurf on the Smurfs TV cartoon show.".

It was also said to be Wyler's comment on the Cold War  and probably also reflects the feelings of a director who grew up in AlsaceLorraine and felt from birth the enmity between the French and Germans before World War I.One of the things I most enjoyed was the way in which the viewer had some sympathies with every single one of the seven main characters.The least sympathetic is probably the Chuck Connors role  yet even with him one feels right from the start his dynamism his love of life his alltoohuman pleasure in things. He's not a simple bully  in some respects he could easily fit in with the trio of Gunga Din who burst from windows enjoy women to the fullest if they aren't tied down play tricks and live life to the fullest. The director makes us FEEL the joy of Connors and his brothers in showing off in their daring their vivacity when we see them on horseback early in the movie.The most sympathetic are Peck and Simmons  and wow what a combination. They were born to play opposite each other  and it's terribly sad that this is their only pairing.Charles Bickford Burl Ives Carroll Baker Charlton Heston we feel with each one. For example Baker is given a wonderful scene in which she pleads that she will do whatever it takes to get Peck back apologizes for her behavior insists it will never happen again. She is shallow too young for Peck concerned enormously with appearances  yet Wyler shows us a warm creature easily capable of love and affection.We feel with Heston  who has grown up loving a woman who has put him in his place and who has now tied herself to a stranger  who will presumably in time became his boss even though Heston was raised as practically a stepson to Bickford. We see Heston subtly change over the course of the film  to an independence of Bickford that is wonderfully done.The astonishing courage of Bickford's character his stamina his truly rugged independence his native refinement and his outrage at the coarseness of the Hennessys is so welldrawn.Ives' character is brilliantly drawn too  a great sense of fair play an admiration for gentlemen  which he is decidedly not and knows  a feeling that he has never gotten much of what he wanted his disappointment in his son  these are fascinating to see.This is really a great movie  with great characters who themselves cause the plot to go the only way it could.My only objection is the too neat ending  but Simmons and Peck just looking at each other is SO right.Don't miss this. It is both powerful and subtle  it is never rushed and devotes time to the development of all the seven characters which I find quite rate in movies generally.Thus we see Simmons and Baker together alone  and Baker's comment You always think you know everything to Simmons gives us a pretty strong idea of their characters' relation before the movie ever began.We see Heston alone with Baker  his barely suppressed desire breaking out  and her feeling that he is beneath her.We see wonderful scenes of Bickford and Heston alone together  and the great scene where we realize that the men hold with Heston far more than with their nominal boss when they refuse to go where Heston won't go.This is monumental  fascinating  very American  and wonderful.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a rule I don't like westerns. This isn't because I'm a city slicker though now I do live in a city. I grew up in rural Eastern Oregon where real cowboys still herd their cattle through the center of town in John Day Oregon. My stepfather owned a 10170 acre cattle ranch. After being raised among real cowboys the Hollywood versions tend to leave me flat. The Big Country was an exception.Jim McKay Gregory Peck introduced us to a different kind of man far different than most stereotypical men of the Wild West. If I were to compare McKay's character to any other film character it would be Ghandi. He's a man who doesn't feel obliged to seek the approval of others ... a man who believes that violence doesn't need to be used to solve problems. His secret ride of Old Thunder making Ramon Alfonso Bedoya swear to keep quiet regardless of the outcome set the tone for McKay's character. His later secret fight with Steve Leech Charleton Heston making him swear to keep quiet regardless of the outcome cemented that tone. This was a REAL man whose opinion of himself was not dependent upon anyone else's opinion ... in stark contrast to anyone else in the film outside of Julie Maragon Jean Simmons. As Ramon said Such a man is very rare.Outside of McKay my 2 favorite character in the film was Rufus Hannassey Burl Ives. I found nothing about him distasteful considering he was a character whose back was against the wall ... whose livelihood was threatened. The things he did make perfect sense in such a situation. His only flaw was his obvious poor parenthood. He really blew it with Buck Chuck Connors and Buck's siblings were of the same ilk.I'm so glad that MGMUA finally released the widescreen version in 2001. This is a film that deserves such a presence. It may not be playing in theaters anymore but seeing it in any other display size takes so much away from it. I've seen the panscan version before and will never go back.One note. The full listing of writing credits for the film adaptation is lacking. Ambush In Blanco Canyon originally serialized in a magazine was later novelized into The Big Country by Donald Hamilton ... and Hamilton also worked on the adaptation as well as Leon Uris Topaz Exodus Gunfight At the OK Corral etc..This epic film was not lacking for anything. It had the best writers the best actors the best musical score and the best scenery of any other film of its time ... western or otherwise. And the film remains one of my favorite films of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Big Country is one big and fun western with concurrent plot lines. The first is the struggle between two implacable enemies Charles Bickford and Burl Ives. The second is a four sided romantic triangle involving Gregory Peck Jean Simmons Charlton Heston and Carroll Baker with Chuck Connors trying to horn in.William Wyler directed the almost three hour western with a sure hand and your interest does not wane for one minute in this film. Gregory Peck also was a coproducer on this film as well as the first billed. He had a hand in casting a lot of the film specifically Burl Ives in his Academy Award winning performance as Rufus Hannessy.It's the Terrills versus the Hannessys. Charles Bickford is the local Ponderosa owner Major Terrill. Presumably the title comes from the Civil War. Bickford does play Terrill with a military bearing. My guess is that he was a Yankee soldier.The Hannessys would now be called white trash. They look like hillbilly folk who also came west for fame and fortune. They've also got a big spread in a place called Blanco Canyon. They hate the Yankee Major as much as he hates them.Sitting between them is Jean Simmons who has inherited a modest piece of land that sits across a river that both outfits water their cattle on as per an agreement with her late grandfather. She doesn't work the land herself any more she teaches school in town. Simmons tries to keep above the feud. She is friends with Carroll Baker Charles Bickford's daughter. She's been east and is bringing home a prospective bridegroom who is a former sea captain played by Gregory Peck. That doesn't sit well with Charlton Heston who is the Terrill foreman. He's got eyes on Baker himself and Chuck Connors who is Burl Ives eldest son has eyes for Simmons when he's not in the local bordello.A lot of started and broken relationships and a few of the cast members being killed occurs in The Big Country. My favorite scene and line in the film is when Burl Ives gives some advice to Chuck Connors on how to woo and win Jean Simmons. His big advice is to show her how much you care by taking a bath occasionally.Charlton Heston took a role that was fourth billed because he wanted the opportunity to work with William Wyler. That was one great career move because Wyler and he hit it off so well that Wyler signed him for the lead in his next film which turned out to be BenHur. Heston in his memoirs conservative as he became says he also got along very well with Gregory Peck who he called a thinking man's liberal.Peck and Wyler had worked together previously on Roman Holiday and had done good work there and also hit it off. However with Peck as a coproducer as well as star they had some clashes on the set. One notable one involved Peck wanting to retake the carriage scene where the Hannessy brothers attack Peck and Baker on the way to the Bickford ranch. Peck wasn't satisfied and wanted a retake. Wyler who was legendary for doing scenes dozens of times until he got what he wanted refused. Later when shown the finished film Wyler had edited out and around what Peck didn't like and it came out OK. They remained friends but never worked together again.Simmons as the independent minded school teacher and Baker as the spoiled daddy's little girl acquit themselves well in their roles. Baker is disappointed in Peck not seeing him as her ideal western man and Simmons upbraids her with the quote I put in the review title.This is also the final film of Alfonso Bedoya who never did get a role in an American film as good as the one he had as Gold Hat in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Still this is a fine farewell performance to a very colorful and talented player.When he's on the screen Burl Ives dominates and fills it and not just physically either. Rufus Hannessy may not be to the manor born but he has his own sense of integrity and fair play. All that Burl Ives captured in Rufus and The Big Country is worth watching just for him alone.And that Jerome Moross score simply one of the best ever done in the history of film.".

Many of the characters are largely and broadly drawn with big strokes stubborn Peck fiery Baker resentful Heston righteous Simmons imperious Bickford cantankerous Ives and slithering Connors yet they all are dwarfed by the huge landscape. Tall men horses trees and houses are all presented as so many ants on an ant hill in many of the images. The film has a compelling story and intriguing interpersonal relationships and rivalries which are all enhanced by this larger than life approach. The landscape is sometimes aweinspiring notably in the Blanco Canyon scenes near the end of the film. Peck is appropriately straightlaced and uncomfortable in this rough  tumble setting lovely Simmons is a likable heroine and Baker is an effective daddy's girl with misplaced affections. Connors acquits himself very nicely as a thoroughly detestable punk. Heston comes off extremely strong in this film. He's completely at home and was probably never more handsome check out the scene in which he's roused from his bed by Peck! He makes the most out of this secondary role. Bickford and Oscarwinning Ives make a great pair of adversaries...almost makes one wish for a prequel to see what got these two so riled up but today's filmmakers couldn't be counted upon to do it in a tasteful classy way. Memorable scenes include the taunting of Peck by Connors and his brothers Ives grand entrance into Bickford's house and an almost legendary fight scene between Heston and Peck. All of the above are raised to an even higher plane of excellence by what must be one of the greatest musical scores in film history western or otherwise. Jerome Moross composed several themes the opening title is the best known which put this film into a whole new category of enjoyment. The score stands alone as a beautiful listening experience and paired with the images in this film it is amazing. It occasionally seems intrusive yet knows when to keep quiet as well. The Oscar that year went to Tiompkin's Old Man and the Sea but it seems astonishing that anything could have bested this score. The film's only real flaw is slight overlength but nothing really stands out as aching to be cut! Maybe just bits and pieces....but really the story just takes it's time and builds to some stirring moments.".

Why this movie has never received it's just due has mystified me for years. Maybe the late '50's became the time of the brat pak movie genre Rebel Without A Cause but the performances in this movie are classic. Jean Simmons was absolutely intriguing. As a man watching this movie I soon realized what Mr. Peck would begin to see in this woman as the movie progressed. Just that little glimpse from Ms. Simmons as she measured up the man she would soon fall in love with had more sexual power than most flicks today that try to thrive on the sexual theme to sell theatre tickets.This is not just a western. It is pure greatness from William Wyler and a cast that added strength to the film. Burl Ives and Charles Bickford played their respective roles with the intenseness and professionalism of a classic Shakespearean play and Charlton Heston was perfect as the antagonist to Gregory Peck. This film has no weakness and has gotten better with time.".

Just that little glimpse from Ms. Simmons as she measured up the man she would soon fall in love with had more sexual power than most flicks today that try to thrive on the sexual theme to sell theatre tickets.This is not just a western. It is pure greatness from William Wyler and a cast that added strength to the film. Burl Ives and Charles Bickford played their respective roles with the intenseness and professionalism of a classic Shakespearean play and Charlton Heston was perfect as the antagonist to Gregory Peck. This film has no weakness and has gotten better with time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers as there will always be people watching it for the first timeThe word gentleman has probably been terribly abused in all these years. For an icon of a true gentleman absolutely no one can surpass Gregory Peck on and off screen. In The Big Country Peck's performance best portrayed what a gentleman is. Before going into this theme let me make one interesting diversion in observing that movie makers around that time were rather fond of big casts led by undisputed heavyweights and supported by some who were lesser in stature but still stars in their own right. Without even thinking hard I can quote a few examples. Obviously The Big Country 1958 is one with Peck Jean Simmons Carroll Baker Charlton Heston Burl Ives and Charles Bickford. Even more impressive is Spartacus 1960 with Kirk Douglas Sir Laurence Olivier Jean Simmons again Charles Laughton Peter Ustinov John Gavin and Tony Curtis. Another is Judgement at Nuremberg 1961 Spencer Tracy Burt Lancaster Richard Widmark Marlene Dietrich Maximilian Schell Judy Garland and Montgomery Cliff. I used to try to line up the roster weighting one against another in a hopeless quest of deciding which one has the final edge. Such pursuit invariably ended up in my throwing up my arms in despair.So much for side tracking. The essence of Big Country is in its hero James McKay who is one notch above Will Kane in High Noon a rather passive hero' forced into heroism by circumstances. McKay is all positive never wavering ever so slightly in his belief. Neither provocation nor insult can force him into violence. While he steadfastly resists the temptation of being a flashy showoff type of hero' he is the farthest away from being a dodger. He takes up every challenge that Patricia Terrill Carroll Baker scorns him for dodging. It's just that he does not need to prove himself to her or to anybody for that matter. It takes a real woman Julie Maragon Jean Simmons to recognise a real man.  The most remarkable and daring thing about Big Country is the view it takes about fast draws which is the most important factor if not the only factor behind every single successful western. Big Country dares to treat it as utterly worthless or even more as a sign of cowardice. In the final showdown adversary Buck Hannassey the fast draw is portrayed as a coward at heart when his advantage is taken away and eventually shot down by his own father in scorn when he tried to shoot McKay in the back.Some say that Big Country is not even a western and I do not disagree. To me it's enjoying and admiring the performance of two of the greatest stars that ever graced the screen Gregory Peck and Jean Simmons.".

The unforgettable Burl Ives in his Oscar winning role Charleton Heston Carol Baker Charles Bickford Chuck Conners and Jean Simmons . . . what a beauty! Until this go 'round I had never given much thought to the location of the story. I figured The Big Country was an obvious reference to The Big Sky country of Montana or at least Wyoming. Since I have been to Texas it would be easy to assume the location was there especially the cattle ranches and dry canyons. Thanx to IMDb I now know the film was shot in California another place I have lived and noticed the ranches.The one overriding thing about this movie that I always felt was that it should have been a miniseries and should have gone on and on. It was a story you could put yourself into and who wouldn't have wanted to be James McKay falling in love with Julie Maragon played by the great Jean Simmons. Bravo!".

	schema:headline " Majestic western with much to admire.";
	schema:reviewBody "Westerns by their very nature are mostly quite simplistic films. That's not to say they're bad  some of the simplest westerns of all are actually cinematic masterpieces because they've been pared to the bone for maximum impact. Stagecoach and High Noon for example. But every now and then a western comes along that adds layers to the basic concept of the genre and becomes something more. This might be layers of psychology layers of philosophy layers of brutality  anything really that goes beyond the simple western framework and lends a more profound subtext to the film. Notable genre entries that have done this include The Searchers The Wild Bunch and The Big Country the latter of which is a 1958 epic made by William Wyler just a year before his incredible remake of Ben Hur.Sea captain Jim Mackay Gregory Peck travels to the Wild West to reunite with a lady he met back east the beautiful Pat Terrill Carroll Baker. However Jim finds nothing but hostility and danger in the west and is quickly taunted by some the locals who find him effeminate and cowardly because of his belief that violence doesn't solve anything. Pat's father Major Henry Terrill Charles Bickford is a wealthy rancher but Jim is troubled when he discovers that the Major is locked in a longstanding feud over water rights with a rival family the Hannasseys. It doesn't take Jim long to figure out that Pat is not the woman for him  she may have seemed the perfect match back in the polite society of the East but in her home region of the West she is dedicated to her father's aggressive attitudes and treats Jim differently belittling him almost because of his pacifist views. Worse still the ranch foreman Steve Leech Charlton Heston has designs of his own on Pat and wants to fight Jim for her affection. In the end Jim switches his attention to school teacher Julie Maragon Jean Simmons who owns the patch of land that provides both the Terrills and the Hannasseys with their water. Violence erupts between the two warring families with Jim and Julie getting caught literally in the middle of their fatal battle for supremacy.There's much to admire about The Big Country. Jerome Moross's amazing score is perhaps the most memorable thing of all a wonderful piece of dramatic scoring that is now a classic and known by people who haven't even seen the film. It's good to see Peck in such fine form too  often criticised for being too wooden his acting style here lends perfect credibility to the pacifist hero role. The entire cast in is excellent form if the truth be told with Burl Ives the choice of the bunch as the fiercely proud leader of the Hannassey clan an Oscarwinning role and thoroughly deserving of it. Franz Planer's cinematography is quite majestic and helps the film to live up to its rather grand title. And Wyler directs the film exceptionally well holding our attention over almost three hours and presenting characters and a back story that are totally convincing and involving. Critics have occasionally accused the film of being overblown and there is an element of truth in that and the ending rather unfairly asks us to care about the fate of Bickford and Ives when they've been portrayed as very unsympathetic characters up to that point. On the whole though The Big Country is definitely a western worth recommending.".

Notable genre entries that have done this include The Searchers The Wild Bunch and The Big Country the latter of which is a 1958 epic made by William Wyler just a year before his incredible remake of Ben Hur.Sea captain Jim Mackay Gregory Peck travels to the Wild West to reunite with a lady he met back east the beautiful Pat Terrill Carroll Baker. However Jim finds nothing but hostility and danger in the west and is quickly taunted by some the locals who find him effeminate and cowardly because of his belief that violence doesn't solve anything. Pat's father Major Henry Terrill Charles Bickford is a wealthy rancher but Jim is troubled when he discovers that the Major is locked in a longstanding feud over water rights with a rival family the Hannasseys. It doesn't take Jim long to figure out that Pat is not the woman for him  she may have seemed the perfect match back in the polite society of the East but in her home region of the West she is dedicated to her father's aggressive attitudes and treats Jim differently belittling him almost because of his pacifist views. Worse still the ranch foreman Steve Leech Charlton Heston has designs of his own on Pat and wants to fight Jim for her affection. In the end Jim switches his attention to school teacher Julie Maragon Jean Simmons who owns the patch of land that provides both the Terrills and the Hannasseys with their water. Violence erupts between the two warring families with Jim and Julie getting caught literally in the middle of their fatal battle for supremacy.There's much to admire about The Big Country. Jerome Moross's amazing score is perhaps the most memorable thing of all a wonderful piece of dramatic scoring that is now a classic and known by people who haven't even seen the film. It's good to see Peck in such fine form too  often criticised for being too wooden his acting style here lends perfect credibility to the pacifist hero role. The entire cast in is excellent form if the truth be told with Burl Ives the choice of the bunch as the fiercely proud leader of the Hannassey clan an Oscarwinning role and thoroughly deserving of it. Franz Planer's cinematography is quite majestic and helps the film to live up to its rather grand title. And Wyler directs the film exceptionally well holding our attention over almost three hours and presenting characters and a back story that are totally convincing and involving. Critics have occasionally accused the film of being overblown and there is an element of truth in that and the ending rather unfairly asks us to care about the fate of Bickford and Ives when they've been portrayed as very unsympathetic characters up to that point. On the whole though The Big Country is definitely a western worth recommending.";

	schema:headline " Spectacular underrated Western epic with an all star cast.";
	schema:reviewBody "The strength of this movie is its great cast an excellent script and Jerome Moross' memorable score.  Critics bombed it when it was released but moviegoers loved it.  I did too.It's a big country one of the characters in the movie says.  This is obvious in the opening credits as a stagecoach crosses the treeless plain carrying Gregory Peck who plays Jim McKay to a meeting with his fiance played by Carol Baker in San Rafael.  The fist fight with the foreman of Ladder Ranch played by Charlton Heston is original in its staging.  There have been much better fight scenes.  Pittsburgh and North to Alaska come to mind.  This fight scene is memorable because the camera emphasizes the vastness of the country by showing the fight from long range.  It works.The emphasis in this film is on the complex personal relationships between the characters.  Peck and Baker are engaged to be married but their relationship seems doomed from the start.  In the opening scenes they are harassed by the Hannassey's mortal enemies of the Terrell's.  Peck and Baker are fundamentally incompatible.  He doesn't measure up to her father played by Charles Bickford and she is upset that he doesn't ride Old Thunder or accept Steve Leach's challenge.  McKay does both but he does these things on his own terms.  He is not a show off.  He may be a little unsure of himself but he does not give up easily.  His efforts to ride Old Thunder demonstrate this.  He is also modest. I had a little trouble with a horse he later tells Julie Maragon in a classic understatement.  Pat Terrell is disappointed in her fiance and dumps him.  Later when she tries to make peace McKay rejects her overtures.  It goes much deeper than that he tells her referring to her comment that the estrangement was a simple misunderstanding.  In a pique she compares him unfavorably to her father and walks out of his life.  McKay's courage shows at the end when he rides into Blanco Canyon to rescue Julie Maragon played by Jean Simmons. Why did he do it?  He did it for love.  He loves Julie Maragon.The relationship between Rufus Hannassey played by Burl Ives and Henry Terrell sets the tone for the movie.  Terrell is a gentleman living in a mansion.  The Hannassey clan lives in rough shacks in Blanco Canyon.  Rufus is not as uncultured as the Terrell's make him out.  Indeed he appreciates the fine dueling pistols he finds in McKay's saddlebags.  Gentlemen's weapons he derisively tells his definitely uncouth son played by Chuck Connors.  In one scene Rufus publicly questions Henry Terrell's qualifications as a gentleman.  Gentlemen or not the two old men hate each other.  The movie never tells you how it started.  Perhaps no one remembers. Perhaps it is simple economics.  Both the Terrells and the Hannasseys covet the Big Muddy Julie Maragon's ranch.  Water is more than life in the West. In one scene Terrell's cowboys shoot holes in the water tower at Rufus' ranch.  Steve Leach questions the ethics of this.  Do you really want this Major? he asks.  Let the boys have their fun he replies.  Later Rufus returns the favor by barging uninvited into Terrell's party.  It is not unexpected that they kill each other at the end.The relationship between McKay and Steve Leach begins on a bad note.  Leach seems to have a romantic interest in McKay's fiance.  He offers a fight which McKay refuses.  Later when they do fight the relationship seems to change.  You take a long time to say good by he tells McKay.  I'm just about finished McKay replies.  It is apparent at the end that Leach respects McKay's courage.The script is refreshingly original.  The familiar dialogue from other Westerns is missing here.  This is a frosty Friday Rufus says at one point.  Teach your mother to suck eggs he suggests to his McKay at another point.  If anything there may be too much dialogue in this film.  A little more action might have helped.The action is also different from your typical Western.  The big screen approach to the fist fight is a good example.  The longexpected gun fight between Steve Leach and Buck Hannassey never happens.  Instead Hannassey and McKay face off with dueling pistols.  McKay wins because Hannassey shows his coward's colors.  He grabs a six gun from one of the cow hands and tries to kill McKay.  It is Rufus who shoots his son. Jerome Moross' music is fantastic.  My favorite cue is The Welcoming which underscores the scene in which Buck Hannassey and three ranch hands harass McKay and his fiance.  Variations of the musical themes in this film appear in the Jayhawkers and The Proud Rebel.  The title tune was recently reprised in Varsity Blues.This movie is best watched on the big screen.  Unfortunately I don't believe there is a wide screen version of this film available on video. Hopefully that omission will soon be corrected.  However the great script and wonderful characterizations can be enjoyed on the small screen too.".

Jean Simmons is the western school marm yet we never see her in a classroom setting.Seems that Peck has walked into the beginning of a range war between Bickford and Ives over water rights for cattle.Chuck Connors who plays Ives' son sets things in motion by assaulting Peck. Bickford uses this as a pretext to declare war on the Hennessey's Ives and his sons. Things really start to escalate. In the meantime Peck does prove his masculinity but it is too late for Baker who has come to believe that he is a coward.The final showdown is obvious but handled very well.Another great asset to the film is the rousing musical score.

In fact a kind of mild running gag in the film is how when Gregory Peck arrives everyone from his future fatherinlaw Charles Bickford and his fianc Carol Baker and even Charlton Heston mentions that it is a big country and that he can get lost in it. At the party thrown by Bickford one of the guests asks Peck if he's ever been impressed by anything larger than the country. Peck says he has. He was a sea captain and he's seen the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans! Ironically at one point he is believed lost and scouting parties are sent for him. He is never lost  he had a map and a compass all the time!Peck seems an eastern dude out of water when he arrives with his derby style hat exciting the hoots of laughter from Chuck Connors and his men the Hannasey white trash. Actually he is simply not a man to demonstrate his emotions as readily as Bickford Heston Connors or Burl Ives. They are always ready to defend their honor  as Bickford points out they are two hundred miles from the closest government seat so they have to be their own policemen. But Peck keeps confounding them all. He conquers the horse that throws all the strangers  but he does it quietly when only Alfonso Bedoya is around to help. He won't stand up against Connors whom he considers a drunken bully. He won't publicly fight Heston when the latter calls him a liar. But when alone they fight to a draw and Heston realizes Peck is not a weakling or coward.Peck also sees the tensions in the country as due to the antagonisms of two men Bickford's Major Henry Terrill and Ives' Rufus Hannassay. It is a clash of class on the surface although Peck eventually says it is a confrontation between two selfish old men. He tries to find a happy medium out of the mess by buying Jean Simmons' land but that is not as successful an idea as he hoped. Peck somewhat simplistically thinks that by promising open watering rights to everyone he is settling the main issue. But the hatred is too strong.All the characters are well drawn. Baker at first a loving girlfriend turns out to be too deeply committed to her father's point of view on everything. Simmons who owns the coveted watering area the big muddy thinks in a similar way to Peck but she underestimates her being a woman alone in a range war. Connors is determined to bully and grab what he can from everyone but he doesn't fool his father whom considers him a great disappointment and can't prevent the world from seeing he's a coward. Heston is loyal to Bickford who picked him out of the dust literally but he does have as sense of right and wrong and a sense of shame that causes a break in their relationship in the end. Bedoya proves to be loyal to Peck and the only one to accompany him on his last mission in the film. Bickford has striven to appear classy and a defender of Christian values but he is a ruthless cattle baron for all that who sees the silly attack on Peck as a comment on himself by his enemy Ives who knew nothing about it.But Ives is wonderful  and deserved his Oscar. His best remembered performance of course will always be Big Daddy in CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF  one of the best written roles in modern American theater. Rufus Hannassy is white trash note his advise of taking an occasional bath when dating a woman. But in comparison to the more hypocritical BickfordTerrill he does not push his men to confront anyone nor does he get uptight about trivialities. He confronts Terrill at the latter's home during a party after Terrill had led his own men to raid Ives' ranch and destroy his water tower. He does understand what Terrill would never understand a real gentleman is a good neighbor and a man of his word two things Terrill can barely be. And finally there is the involved issue of Ives' relationship with his son Connors. Ives' has a sense of morality and he beats up Connors when the latter tries to commit rape. Up to their last moments on screen together Connors is consistently disappointing him. It is only after the latter's death that Ives' comes to his senses and agrees with Peck as to what he must do to stop the range war from continuing.

Wyler frames so much of the action in huge sweeping vistas to evoke the film's title. A good job by Peck playing the sea captain gone west. All the other characters seemed to have him pegged as a pantywaist city slicker from back East rather than someone who would have to be quite tough to survive in that unknown milieu. His fiancee was such a spoiled brat type that one wonders what McKay ever saw in her back in Baltimore. There was some strange connection between her and her father played adequately by Charles Bickford. They called one another Darling Jean Simmons as Julie Maragon lit up the screen with her charm whenever she appeared. The supporting cast however stole the show. Chuck Connors as the sniveling evil Buck Hennessey. Burl Ives as the Hennessey patriarch. Oscar winner for this role And Charlton Heston as the Ladder Ranch foreman Steve Leach. An interesting role for Heston to accept a fairly unlikeable character. The plot and dialogue were thoroughly engaging. I definitely recommend this film. Grade A".

The myth of the American frontier in cinema is fascinating to me and any film that develops the ideas inherently has my attention. The Big Country is credited as the first pacifist Western as Gregory Peck refuses to fight until the last moment or acknowledge the seriousness of any conflict. He's an unconventional hero. One who teeters a line of cowardice. But this just makes him all the more endearing as a three dimensional character. Granted the film has its caricature characters on the side but the script has such a dry wit. Burt Ives won an Oscar for his role and coming in an hour into the film there wasn't much spotlight left to share but he certainly has his moments. It's a grand epic in visuals and length that I easily sunk into. It's a big country alright. Also boasts one of the best scores I've ever heard.

This genuine epic is less of a Western and more of a tribute to honor and decent human values none held more dear than by Rufus Hannassey himself.Everything came together in this masterful and sprawling work. William Wyler director arguably without peer in his field BEN HUR maintained an iron grip on his story never losing focus of what THE BIG COUNTRY was all about. With actors such as Heston Peck Baker Simmons Ives and Bickford pretty much at the apex of their careers the characters were imbued with more than life. They will live forever now long beyond our deaths and perhaps even rebirth. The film is all about honor. Pushy though selfmade landowner Major Terrill wanting simply the best for his daughter Baker and his refusal to consider the plight and livelihood of his backwoods neighbors the Hannasseys.  Peck himself as upstanding paragon of decency Jim Mackay who has wooed and has now come to marry Terrill's highspirited overly protected and ultimately shortsighted daughter Patricia. Heston as Terrill's 2 IC who has carried a torch for Patricia all these years but would never betray his boss one that he freely admits he would Follow into Hell if necessary.  Simmons as beautiful uncluttered and still single Julie Maragon whose property the Hannasseys would dearly love to acquire ostensibly for the Big Muddy water rights. These peoples' interactions set to the dusty but beautiful western backdrop are what makes this simply unforgettable and unrepeatable viewing. I had the good fortune to see this film in its original 70mm format at its London premiere in '58. It hasn't aged a day! It does however lose just so much on a television screen. Powerful doesn't adequately cover this masterpiece which is heightened even more by the neverequalled musical score from Jerome Moross. How this film might be received by a new audience in 2002 and with such different values I wouldn't care to say but I like to think there will always be people around that will stand up for the essence of what this great film promotes in terms of searing human endeavours strengths and integrities.".

Arriving McKay admires the grand scope and scenery of the open West but is unimpressed with its size. To western observers he is treated with indifference and his quiet peaceful demeanor is seen as lacking in manhood.

In addition both powerful men struggle to obtain the major source of water in the region called  Big Muddy  which is owned by Julie Maragon Jean Simmons. Her friend Patricia Carroll Baker is the daughter of Henry Terrill and is as bigoted and blind as her father. With a supporting cast which includes Alfonso Bedoya as Ramn Guiteras the film is filled with Grand scenes majestic landscapes and western action. The story is straight forward and definitely a must for anyone who likes a good old fashion Cowboy movie. All in all nothing short of a grand Classic. Easilly recommended to all. ".

Perhaps it lags in places and even if it does run for 2 and a half hours some points aren't as fleshed out as I would have liked I would have liked to have seen more of Heston's character and Baker just disappears from the film at times.

	schema:reviewBody "I am going to be rather biased in my review of this film as Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader C.B.E. D.S.O D.F.C is in my opinion only one step lower than the Almighty himself on par with Churchill Wellington and Nelson as one of the greatest Englishmen that ever lived.Some may argue that he was an arrogant and dogmatic man and of course in many ways you will be right but if you had lost both of your legs at the young age of 21 and had to fight every inch of the way just to be treated as an equal rather than a 'cripple' wouldn't you be a bit arrogant too? I know I sure as hell would be.In those days Englishmen were Englishmen and that meant being forthright and brave with Bader's situation the way it was he just had to be a bit more forthright and bit more brave to prove to himself he was not a second rate Englishman so don't knock him.He was such a generous and kind man who worked tirelessly and selflessly to help people with similar disabilities to his own especially children.However his charitable work is not even hinted at in this film which only covers the period from 1928 when he entered Cranwell R.A.F College until 1945 and the end of the War.We see the young Bader excel at sports like Cricket and Rugby and we see him take his first solo flights on his road to becoming not only one of the finest pilots in the R.A.F but one of the foremost aerobatic display pilots in the world.But we see a dramatic and tragic fall from grace as on 14th December 1931 Bader stupidly accepts a challenge to perform aerobatics at stupidly low height and the result is the near fatal crash which costs Bader both his legs and the complete destruction of his entire way of life.We then follow him through a tough and trying mental and physical battlefield as he tries to rebuild his shattered life. Bader has to come to terms with each obstacle on his road back to fitness and mobility and through this film we almost feel as if we are struggling with him from the first few jerky hops on a 'pegleg' to the first tottering baby steps on the new state of the art artificial tin legs.We the audience are so engrossed in his brave fight that we automatically reach out and are ready to catch him as he stumbles.Once he has returned to full health and after being grounded and 'phased out' by the R.A.F. we follow Douglas into civilian life as he takes on an uninspiring job his marriage to his beloved wife Thelma and the pursuit of his new found love of golf which he feels is a 'sport he can play on equal terms with anyone'However when the Second World War erupts in 1939 Douglas once again takes up the fight with the R.A.F. in his mission to return to active service. This time urgency seems to over ride caution and Bader is accepted and is soon given a command of a squadron in the run up to the Battle of Britain.When Bader's own ideas of fighter tactics reach the ears of Fighter Command he is given latitude to put these ideas in to action and his squadron is soon joined by two others until eventually Bader was the first person to lead a formation of five squadrons into battle in a tactic known as The Duxford Wing.However on the 9th August 1941 Bader's Spitfire collided with a Messerschmitt 109 and he was forced to bail out behind enemy lines and as a result he spent the remainder of the war a P.O.W. in Germany yet this set back did nothing to curb his British spirit or his dogmatic personality as he regularly baited insulted and outwitted the Germans at every occasion making several escape attempts over the next four years.The film ends with newly promoted Group Captain Bader leading the ceremonial Battle of Britain victory fly past over London on 15th September 1945 showing actual footage of the formation with Bader's Aeroplane flying solo in front.Paul Brickhill's biography on Bader on which this film is based is a must read for anyone who is interested in this extraordinary life and I thoroughly recommend it as it goes into the finer detail a motion picture could not possibly hope to cover.However even the book does not give a full biography of the man as it was printed in 1954 when most of Bader's charitable achievements the death of his wife his Knighthood second marriage and sudden death from heart failure at the age of 72 were still a long way off.However the plus point of making a biopic of a character who was still living was that Bader was able to have full input into the movie most notably when it came to the casting of his wife. His exact words on this subject were 'I'm not going to have some silly tart playing my wife.' But when Bader found out that Muriel Pavlow had been cast he was overjoyed and gave his full approval. Also he became great friends with Kenneth More who portrayed Douglas in the film in fact the two had become so close he was deeply saddened and affected by More's death which occurred just a few weeks before his own.However Kenneth More is the perfect Bader Muriel Pavlow is a glamorous and heartfelt Thelma and Lewis Gilbert superbly directs this story of courage and fortitude a story of a hero amongst heroes who despite his appalling disabilities fights on to become not only a Battle of Britain ace but an inspiration to millions of people worldwide.".

But he didn't choose to go that way and with the advent of WW2 he managed to resume his active pilot career despite the fact of having artificial legs and had more than a few adventures which he survived.

	schema:reviewBody "For those who have seen and enjoyed The Dam Busters1954 about British Bomber Command in WWII this biopic about Douglas Bader and British Fighter Command provides an excellent companion film. Douglas Bader pronounced Baader is excellently portrayed by Kenneth More in another stirring British Bulldog role see also his role of 2nd Officer Lightoller in A Night to Remember 1958.Our hero joins Cranwell British RAF Officer Flying School in 1928 and soon proves he has natural flying ability.He also excells at cricket and rugby but is not so hot at the academics coming 1719 in the exams.Discipline is also a bit of a problem for him and he has to learn that ...rules are for the obedience of fools and for the guidance of wise men.At Cranley he meets a friend and the two fly over to the Reading Flying Club in the early 1930's when Bader rashly accepts a dubious challenge to exhibit his aerobatic skill when the crowds are not present.The result was a near fatal crash that resulted in him having both legs amputated.The scene with nurse Brace is genuinely touching  I have seen this film many times and it always brings a tear to my eye.While recovering with other injured men they go on a jaunt in one of the chap's Bentley with Douglas as usual driving at breakneck speed with his peg leg on the accelerator.Miraculously they all arrive in one piece at a tea room and it is there that Douglas meets Thelma who is helping a friend by waiting on table ...cream or plain?.On a return trip to the cafe Douglas is distraught to see Thelma in the company of a young man coming out of the rain but is then relieved when she informs him that he is her brother.They informally marry and as there was nothing in King's Regulations about cripples being able to continue flying in the RAF and since a desk job was not to Bader's liking he left and got a mundane job in civvy street.Although cricket and rugby were now ruled out he did find he could compete on level terms at golf.The film shows the very determined spirit of Bader as he struggles to come to terms with his appalling injuries and after many falls his success in being able to literally stand on his own two though artificial feet.Ominously a news stand proclaims Hitler succeeds Hindenberg.That was 1933.The action moves forward to 1940 and as Britain had been at war with Germany since September 1939 it was looking for trained RAF pilots.Bader once again applies and passes his flying test but there still are Kings Regulations to overcome.Bader confronts the medical officer with irrefutable logic and this time is accepted back into the officer fold.He is given a squadron of Canadian pilots which includes the future famous group captain Turner played by Lee Paterson who are very dispirited because they have lost most of their uniforms and equipment in France after the hasty evacuation of the B.E.F. at Dunkirk in May 1940.To win their respect he gives a tour de force of his flying skill to prove that although he has tin legs this does not dim his fierce determination to succeed.His injuries have also instilled into him a combative approach and fierce loyalty and friendship to his men which is soon reciprocated by them.However there are apparantly no spares to make the Hawker Hurricanes serviceable and as we all know forms have to be completed in triplicate!.What seems to be the problem asks Bader to his chief mechanic.The channels appear to be blocked is the reply.Well we shall ruddy well have to unblock them Bader says uncompromisingly and he then goes over the head of the pettifogging quartermaster by telling Group that his squadron is not operational without parts and spares.How the viewer will applaud this slayer of bureaucrats!Eventually the spares arrive and Bader is then able to report to Group that his squadron is finally operational.The film artfully splices actual RAF WWII combat footage in this BW film and shows the success Bader's new approach to the old idea of formation flying had with the top brass.Eventually Bader becomes Wing Commander of The Duxford Wing.Early in the war Bader's luck runs out and he is shot down over France.The Germans even ask the RAF to drop a spare artificial leg down as he left the other jammed in the cockpit when he baled out.He fails to escape and is made a P.O.W.Mocking the Germans or Goon Baiting got him into trouble and he is moved from camp to camp  eventually ending up at the notorious Colditz Castle where he ends the war.After the German surrender in May 1945 he reminds Thelma there is still the war against Japan to be waged.This film depicts the public school ethos of officers in the RAF very well with the usual British phlegm reserve and applomb shown in British war movies of the 1950's.Every actor is very convincing in his part and I always enjoy acted real life docudramas  so much more convincing than mere fiction.I hope readers of this review who are likeminded will similarly enjoy viewing this great WWII movie.".

Douglas Bader pronounced Baader is excellently portrayed by Kenneth More in another stirring British Bulldog role see also his role of 2nd Officer Lightoller in A Night to Remember 1958.Our hero joins Cranwell British RAF Officer Flying School in 1928 and soon proves he has natural flying ability.He also excells at cricket and rugby but is not so hot at the academics coming 1719 in the exams.Discipline is also a bit of a problem for him and he has to learn that ...rules are for the obedience of fools and for the guidance of wise men.At Cranley he meets a friend and the two fly over to the Reading Flying Club in the early 1930's when Bader rashly accepts a dubious challenge to exhibit his aerobatic skill when the crowds are not present.The result was a near fatal crash that resulted in him having both legs amputated.The scene with nurse Brace is genuinely touching  I have seen this film many times and it always brings a tear to my eye.While recovering with other injured men they go on a jaunt in one of the chap's Bentley with Douglas as usual driving at breakneck speed with his peg leg on the accelerator.Miraculously they all arrive in one piece at a tea room and it is there that Douglas meets Thelma who is helping a friend by waiting on table ...cream or plain?.On a return trip to the cafe Douglas is distraught to see Thelma in the company of a young man coming out of the rain but is then relieved when she informs him that he is her brother.They informally marry and as there was nothing in King's Regulations about cripples being able to continue flying in the RAF and since a desk job was not to Bader's liking he left and got a mundane job in civvy street.Although cricket and rugby were now ruled out he did find he could compete on level terms at golf.The film shows the very determined spirit of Bader as he struggles to come to terms with his appalling injuries and after many falls his success in being able to literally stand on his own two though artificial feet.Ominously a news stand proclaims Hitler succeeds Hindenberg.That was 1933.The action moves forward to 1940 and as Britain had been at war with Germany since September 1939 it was looking for trained RAF pilots.Bader once again applies and passes his flying test but there still are Kings Regulations to overcome.Bader confronts the medical officer with irrefutable logic and this time is accepted back into the officer fold.He is given a squadron of Canadian pilots which includes the future famous group captain Turner played by Lee Paterson who are very dispirited because they have lost most of their uniforms and equipment in France after the hasty evacuation of the B.E.F. at Dunkirk in May 1940.To win their respect he gives a tour de force of his flying skill to prove that although he has tin legs this does not dim his fierce determination to succeed.His injuries have also instilled into him a combative approach and fierce loyalty and friendship to his men which is soon reciprocated by them.However there are apparantly no spares to make the Hawker Hurricanes serviceable and as we all know forms have to be completed in triplicate!.What seems to be the problem asks Bader to his chief mechanic.The channels appear to be blocked is the reply.Well we shall ruddy well have to unblock them Bader says uncompromisingly and he then goes over the head of the pettifogging quartermaster by telling Group that his squadron is not operational without parts and spares.How the viewer will applaud this slayer of bureaucrats!Eventually the spares arrive and Bader is then able to report to Group that his squadron is finally operational.The film artfully splices actual RAF WWII combat footage in this BW film and shows the success Bader's new approach to the old idea of formation flying had with the top brass.Eventually Bader becomes Wing Commander of The Duxford Wing.Early in the war Bader's luck runs out and he is shot down over France.The Germans even ask the RAF to drop a spare artificial leg down as he left the other jammed in the cockpit when he baled out.He fails to escape and is made a P.O.W.Mocking the Germans or Goon Baiting got him into trouble and he is moved from camp to camp  eventually ending up at the notorious Colditz Castle where he ends the war.After the German surrender in May 1945 he reminds Thelma there is still the war against Japan to be waged.This film depicts the public school ethos of officers in the RAF very well with the usual British phlegm reserve and applomb shown in British war movies of the 1950's.Every actor is very convincing in his part and I always enjoy acted real life docudramas  so much more convincing than mere fiction.I hope readers of this review who are likeminded will similarly enjoy viewing this great WWII movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "You could run out of clichs and superlatives to describe a man like Douglas Bader. Indomitable a hero an example to us all. Where to stop? This movie chronicles the wartime life of Bader the disabled pilot. Unlike most he fought several wars. One was for his life after his legs were destroyed in a crash another was to walk again without any visible support. A third was against the bureaucrats who insisted he would never fly again. And after all that he took on the Luftwaffe. Whatever criticisms may be levied against his personal character this man was such a tower of strength that those who seek to denigrate him stand like resentful pygmies in his shadow. I for one cannot begin to imagine the hardships he experienced from the loss of his athletic prowess to the agony of his time in hospital. Compared to them shooting at German planes must have seemed like child's play. Though that experience alone was enough to break the spirit of many a wholebodied man. There really was only one actor to play his part in a movie and Kenneth More was he. You might say he was born to it. I don't know how close he came to the real character of Bader but neither he nor the movie seems to shy away either from his reckless courage or his selfcentredness. We see glimpses of the latter on the golf course when he won't give up and has his wife  played by the excellent Muriel Pavlow  running and fetching the ball like a dog. At other times he is tearing around in a Bentley with almost no regard for his passengers or the public alike. Even after he has been liberated from Germany he can't give up the fight and thoughtlessly pursues his dreams of combat east. Never once do we see him consult his wife's interests. Bader was a driven man. If not he would never have survived the crash never have walked again without a stick never have got into the air again. Singleminded? you bet. And you take it or leave it. This movie was made in 1956. As it's a postwar production there's no propaganda drum to beat. It can and does stick prettywell to the story and captures all of the social and cultural attitudes of the time like a miniature documentary. The combat scenes are also very well done.There was a time in this country when men like Bader set a standard to which most people at least aspired. It was the sort of foolhardy courage and selfless determination for which the Victoria Cross was struck.But not any more. Today's Britain really is 'Little Britain' and in more ways than one. It's people have slipped into a cynical selfindulgent pathos. It has become fashionable to denigrate our true heroes for the simple reason that nowadays few could even begin to measure up to the standards of personal pride civil responsibility and social obligation that were once benchmarks of national behaviour. Today a hero is someone who can withstand abuse on reality TV shows. They can sing a 2minute song more tunefully than their competitors. Or they can score goals in a football team. For all of these things they are applauded honoured and paid millions. If you're a foulmouthed cook you can poison the nation's ears if not its bellies if you're a onelegged golddigging woman you are entitled to millions of pounds towards which you have made not a penny's contribution. Today a crippled warrior can expect less sympathy or compensation than an insulted criminal.There's no room for the right stuff in this country any more. Today we don't reach for the sky we stoop to mediocrity. The money's better it's a lot safer and we don't make others feel inadequate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Douglas Bader 19101982 was one of Britain's most popular heroes of WWII a celebrated combat pilot and Flight Commander. His triumphs during the Battle of Britain proved significant in the Allied victory. In 1941 after he was taken prison in Germanoccupied France Bader caused headaches for the enemy with repeated escape attempts and he was eventually confined to Colditz Castle a prisonerofwar camp reserved for such troublecases. And did I mention that he did all these things without the use of his legs? On December 14 1931 Douglas Bader had crashed his aeroplane while attempting lowaltitude maneuvers sustaining such injuries that doctors were forced to amputate both legs. The characteristically resilient pilot later understated the gravity of his disaster with this laconic note in his logbook Crashed slowrolling near ground. Bad show. Following the success of Paul Brickhill's biography British director Lewis Gilbert most noted for later directing several James Bond films brought Bader's story to life an inspirational testament to a man for whom impossible was not a word.The natural comparison for 'Reach for the Sky 1956' is Wyler's 'The Best Years of Our Lives 1946' which starred a reallife war veteran Harold Russell who had lost both arms in combat. There are biographical distinctions of course  Bader lost his limbs in peace time and later fought while disabled  but the basic theme of overcoming one's handicaps through hope and determination holds firm. Kenneth More whom I recently discovered in the gripping Titanic docu drama 'A Night to Remember 1958' brings a likable cockiness and fierce determination to the leading role. Bader's dogged resolve at times seems terse and even stubborn his notion of success appears to hinge upon rejecting the helping hands of friends and loved ones. In his attitudes there is a certain conceitedness perhaps a necessary attribute for a pilot who rose to the military rank of Group Captain. More's portrayal certainly imparts these elements of vanity but one can't help but be inspired by a man whose neversaydie outlook knows no bounds.Muriel Pavlow plays Bader's wife Thelma a delicate woman who seems unfairly neglected while her husband chases his ambitions. Though given substantially less screentime the film's most interesting female character I thought was Dorothy Alison's nurse who tends Bader back to health following his accident. Her appearance is brief but incredibly subtle just watch the series of conflicting emotions flicker across her face as Bader departs love and sadness and everything in between. I had expected the nurse to make an appearance later in the film but she appears to have been shunned permanently from Bader's life. This ties in nicely with the leading character after resolving himself to be entirely selfsufficient he must reject the one woman on whom he once relied so heavily. In Wyler's film Russell's character accepts that he'll never be entirely independent and it's only fitting that he should marry a woman who'll always be there to offer a helping hand. Bader rejects this helping hand he's not much of a husband but he is one hell of a battler.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a remarkable person Douglas Bader was. Always a madcap he joins the RAF in 1928 and becomes a perfect pilot but is unable to adhere to the norms and fill out the forms. On a dare he engages in dangerous lowlevel aerobatics and smashes up his kite which leads to two of his legs being amputated. Rather than be assigned to a desk job or accept a disability pension he resigns and takes some sort of mundane position that has all of the boredom of military paperwork with none of the excitement of flying. When the war comes along he rejoins undergoes flight school yet again and is finally allowed to fly. His administrative skills are effective. He has no tolerance for red tape. And his combat exploits are heroic. He's shot down over France captured and manages to escape two or three times until he is ensconced in Colditz Castle.There's an aweinspiring story buried in Bader's biography but this film doesn't quite soar into it. Instead it's one socially acceptable formulaic scene after another. After his double amputation Bader lies writhing with pain in his hospital bed. He's on the verge of dying but overcomes it by the sheer power of his will. Kenneth More who is Bader has shown a considerable range as an actor  from comedy Doctor in the House through thrillers The 39 Steps to drama Sink the Bismark  and he's good here at registering pain. The problem is that the role of Douglas Bader is itself like a formulaic straight jacket. In the face of any challenge  golf or the loss of his legs  he's relentlessly cheerful optimistic and eager. He completely lacks the very human quality of self doubt. Of course some of us have less of it than others but Bader's character has none at all. He comes across as a modern Sardonicus a mechanical smile etched into his face stumbling about in robotic fashion on tin legs. This isn't to make fun of the man but the way he's presented in this thoroughly routine biographical movie.Bader's unfailingly headlong cheerfulness aside the story is weak. A narrator is introduced at the beginning as an old friend of Bader's. He's about to tell us the story. This is Woody Woodhall with whom Bader exchanges a few winks and wisecracks before he disappears from the movie except for one more late appearance. Having someone tell a friend's story is one of those devices a writer falls back on when his efforts flag. But the fact that it's a common device is minor compared to the fact that it's not used well enough to be believable.Not that Woody's narration adds much to an already ironbound dialog. Hour after hour for four endless days the nurses fought for his life and in the end they won. I guess I've bad mouthed this movie enough. It's not as terrible as I've made it sound. Bad enough to generate an occasional wince but it does neatly present some events while avoiding others that are overly familiar.Example of such events. Bader's first trials with his prosthetic legs. He manages to take a few awkward steps by himself under the eyes of his medical tutors and the mechanism of stepping is explained to him. Without a knee the artificial leg must be flipped ahead with a sharp motion of the remaining thigh. And when asked to turn around he finds he can't and having had the practice of artificial legs explained to us we can understand why. How easy it would have been to have Bader sitting in his wheelchair for a year overcome with despair until he wills himself to stand up and  LOOK! I can WALK! Everybody gawks and applauds. But no. It's all handled matteroffactly and is all the more interesting for it. There aren't many scenes of aerial combat but they're innovatively handled too.I only wish the material being as inherently gripping as it is that it had been done better not as a tribute to a man compelled to overcome challenges  Bader's own story has taken care of that  but as a persuasively realistic picture of a man with whom we're able to identify. You know That's what I would have done if I'd been better than I am.".

All thankfully free of the obligatory American who could never have been there anyway didn 't often stop them crowbarring one in somewhere to enable a sale to the USA. I am a big fan of these films the British were much better at that time of making war films we didn't need John Wayne or anyone like him.The war was still very foremost in the minds of the British public and these films were often sugar coated. That included the character of Douglas Bader who was known to be arrogant at the very least and difficult to be with not the wonderful chappie portrayed in this biopic. Granted Bader was still alive when this was made so it was probably politic to show him as mister nice guy despite being difficult on set. Having said that I can't take away his courage if not for Bader and others like him we would be speaking German now.So I wish there would be a remake with a more accurate portrayal of the subject bad language and all. This time get someone closer in age to Bader than Moore that's no criticism of his performance which as ever was excellent he was far to old to play someone in their 20's. There are many young actors who could fill these boots check out Matthew Winters he has the right stuff.".

He quickly earns his wings and loves flying...perhaps too much! One day he's hotdogging about in his plane doing low level acrobatics when he makes a mistake and crashes. While he survives he loses his legs and any normal and sane person would have accepted that their military career was finished. However Bader was determined to walk through the use of artificial legs...as well as fly. Much of the film chronicles his very difficult and painful struggle to do this. Years pass and now WWII is looming. Britain is very short of pilots and to help fill this need the civilian Bader volunteers for service in the RAF once again. While it appeared doubtful they'd allow him to fly he was amazingly able to pass the physical and soon was leading a squadron of his own. While very successful and one of Britain's top aces he was eventually shot down and spent the remainder of the war in German prison camps. I say camps because despite his disability Bader was a real pain for the Germans and kept trying to escape!!Overall this is an extremely uplifting filmmostly because it's true. Additionally the film has much more going for it than the story. More was very good in the lead and I was very impressed that stock footage was kept to a minimum and what was used was far better than normal. It's a very good film and is a nice testament to a really strange but determined man.".

	schema:reviewBody "From director Lewis Gilbert Alife You Only Live Twice Educating Rita I had seen bits and pieces of this British war film from clips shown on two countdown shows so I was certainly interested. Based on the true story it is 1928 where the young and hyperactive Douglas Bader BAFTA nominated Kenneth More is joining as a cadet for the Royal Air Force of Cranwell where despite not caring for rules he succeeds in training and is posted to No. 23 squadron at Kenley. Next he starts learning how to fly a plane and has a very promising few turns but then in 1931 he makes a wrong move and ends up accidentally crashing his plane and is in a neardeath state and unfortunately he has both his legs amputated. During recovery Douglas starts learning how to use a new pair of artificial legs first wooden and straight and then ones that can bend and during this he meets and often goes out with Thelma Edwards Muriel Pavlow who he later marries. He is frustrated that he cannot find a job back in the RAF as a pilot he would be forced to work behind the desk so while he tries to get back into the sky he works for Shell Oil. World War II begins and Douglas does manage to talk himself back into being a pilot for the RAF again taking part in the Battle of Britain being made commander for a squadron of mostly Canadian men. Then his plane is shot down but he managed to parachute to safety only to be taken as a POW prisoner of war and after managing to escape a few times he ends up in Colditz Castle and the Nazis threaten to take his legs away if he keeps trying. In the end Douglas after being released succeeds in taking down many enemy planes and the film ends in 1945 when he leads a team of pilots for a celebratory flyover. Also starring Lyndon Brook as Johnny Sanderson Lee Patterson as Stan Turner Alexander Knox as Mr. Joyce BAFTA nominated Dorothy Alison as Nurse Sally Brace Michael Warre as Harry Day Sydney Tafler as Robert Desoutter Howard MarionCrawford as 'Woody' Woodhall Jack Watling as Peel Nigel Green as Streatfield Anne Leon as Sister Thornhill and Batman's Michael Gough as Flying Instructor Pearson. More creates a very amicable character the most interesting scenes are him learning to walk but the flying scenes and occasional battles are good viewing too it is a film that makes you proud to be British a most watchable Second World War biographical drama. It won the BAFTA for Best British Film and it was nominated for Best British Screenplay and Best Film from any Source. It was number 78 on The Ultimate Film and it was number 59 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!".

Maybe they are working on it or the ratings were low so they decided not to make another one.Either you are a fan of prince of tennis or a newcomer you should watch it and from the effects it totally blast me off by the way they are playing. Now the Japanese are making almost all their comic into liveaction. Some liveaction movies are coming and they look great. Should they make a part two? Depending on the appeal of fans.

Lastly being originally an animemanga the tennis matches are also chock full of impossible and overexaggerated special effects. This live action movie covers all these grounds and may serve as a fun introduction into the world of POT.As for the existing Prince of Tennis fans you won't be disappointed the Tennis and special effects have been done very well so much so that you might even be left craving for more tennis scenes maybe we'll get a sequel?. That would probably be my biggest disappointment since the plot was hastily sped through there were some matches from the original story which weren't covered.Given the time constraint which usually comes with trying to pack a long running story into a movie there was also a lot less characterisation for each of the main tennis players which is why the film could be appreciated a lot more by existing fans then new comers but don't let that deter you the movie puts in a fair effort to include all fan favourites and a basic rundown of each character for viewers new to POT.Overall for a POT fan like myself the movie was very enjoyable a few of the uninitiated may feel like they're being rushed through something which was originally a lot more dense but as a standalone it is still passable.A fun premise and a fun acronym!

It had a tight storyline and can't expect 68minus fillers of course episodes worth of material to be in 1 movie. Still there was some things that could have been better.Spoilers Start For one the main character Echizen Ryoma in the movie had a facial expression on all the time that looked like he was gonna start crying anytime. I guess it was supposed to be the cool slightly arrogant look from the animemanga that sums up his personality but they actor just didn't hit it IMO. On the plus side he did do the voice pretty spot on!Secondly I don't see why they jump right past the matches of Echizen becoming a regular. I mean they even tell him not to get his nose up after a regular spot on the team cause he is a first year and then we see like the shortest montage ever that doesn't even show anything and next you know he is a regular. I could really only get it cause I know the anime. I know it not vital for the story but some consistency would be niceThe fact that Echizen drops his racket at full speed so it shatters on the pole has to have at least SOME build up. I mean people watching it considers Echizen this tennis prodigy who can like copy all moves he sees why the hell would he drop his racket like that for no reason? In the series it happens over like 2 episodes where it is explained his opponent uses shots with a certain spin that after a long time makes Echizen lose all feeling in his arm for a few seconds which is why he drops it. Could at least have shown Echizen close up going awww my arm or something.Last big thing that is missing IMO is the chemistry between the team. Some of them are fine like Eiji and Fuji but otherwise there just isn't the team spirit which should push them to their limits and it seems kinda superficial at times.Aside from a few other small things it was a really entertaining and good movie. Really like the Atobe in the movie better than the one in the anime. The dad and bad guy Higaki Egate were also really good.Last I want to say that I am not a big fan of the anime I just find it entertaining and worthwhile like the movie ".

	schema:headline " Good translation of comic to a movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on a comic by Takashi Konomi Prince of Tennis is a story about Ryoma Echizen who's a child prodigy tennis player returning home to Japan from USA.The story is comic all the way. It's not comical but it's filled with impossible shots fired by the tennis players. The ball moves as if they had a life of their own supposedly controlled by the players. Japanese comic has tradition of super athletes like this beginning with Tetsuya Chiba's base ball saga Chikai No Makyu in the '60s. This is yet another version of super athlete that can transform the ball into a magic bullet.The movie is a good translation from the comic and each of the players are presented in a believable fashion. It seems that they were expecting to make a sequel from the way the movie ended but maybe the movie didn't perform well at the box office and the idea was canned. Sayuri Iwata and Yu Shirota puts in a good performance. Sayuri Iwata's role is one invented for this movie and does not appear in the original comic.The story is bit weak but the action between the players are entertaining to watch. It's a good intro movie for the Prince of Tennis saga.".

	onyx:emotionText "Based on a comic by Takashi Konomi Prince of Tennis is a story about Ryoma Echizen who's a child prodigy tennis player returning home to Japan from USA.The story is comic all the way. It's not comical but it's filled with impossible shots fired by the tennis players. The ball moves as if they had a life of their own supposedly controlled by the players. Japanese comic has tradition of super athletes like this beginning with Tetsuya Chiba's base ball saga Chikai No Makyu in the '60s. This is yet another version of super athlete that can transform the ball into a magic bullet.The movie is a good translation from the comic and each of the players are presented in a believable fashion.

He meets a nightclub singer Terry McKay who is also on her way home to her longtime boyfriend. She sees him as just another playboy and he sees her as standoffish but over several days they soon find they've fallen in love. Nickie has never really worked in his life so they agree that they will meet again in six months time atop the Empire State building. This will give them time to deal with their current relationships and for Nickie to see if he can actually earn a living. He returns to painting and is reasonably successful. On the agreed date Nickie is waiting patiently for Terry who is racing to join him. Fate intervenes however resulting in misunderstanding and heartbreak and only fate can save their relationship.";

He's absolutely marvelous as playboy Nickie Ferrante who finds himself falling quickly in love with someone other than his fiancee.  I have never seen chemistry on screen like this!  Although the movie may be classified as sap or a love story... it's got it's funny moments Do you think it will ever take the place of night baseball? Top of the mornin' to ya!And the rest of the day to you!.  But there are some scenes that just absolutely take your breath away... like when they are visiting Nickie's grandmother in my opinion the point that they realize their deep love for each other.  Also when they meet their fiancees in New York and while Terry's hugging Ken Nickie gently kisses his fingertips and places them on her glove and then she holds her glove to her cheek.  Truly divine. However the defining moment of this film believe me you better have some hankies handy! is at the end... the look on Grant's face whenever he sees the portrait is PRICELESS.  And of course Kerr's voice trembling at the words Darling don't look at me like that.  I give this movie a definite 10.".

I got intrigued by this film  back in high school when my sister dragged me to see Sleepless in  Seattle. I caught the references to this film that Meg Ryan made  throughout that film and thought that I'd like to rent this film  Affair to Remember to see what the commotion was about. Needless to  say with the whole shipboard romance aspect of it and the promise  to meet again in six months atop the Empire State Building of all  places I quickly became hooked. The scene on the French Riviera with  Nickie's grandmother playing the piano oh God is it beautiful! Cary  Grant is so debonair and suave and Deborah Kerr is so ravishing and  stunningly beautiful that it always demands repeated viewing from me  at least three times a year.   Seeing this film always makes me wonder if something like the kind of  relationship that Nickie had with Terry in the film would really be  possible. Would and could someone actually leave the person they were  engaged to to marry a complete and total stranger that they just met  days ago? I'd like to think that it could but then I am nothing but a  hopeless romantic. The final scene always tears my heart out no matter  how many times I've seen it I'm always sobbing. Watching this film  around Valentine's Day even if you are single is always a treat. It  allows our fantasies to take flight so that we may think that we are  actually the one meeting our beloved atop the Empire State Building in  a thunderstorm.  Watch with a box of Kleenex nearby.  My rating 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "An Affair to Remember is an almost perfect film. It is as deep and rich as it is stylish and romantic.And if someone tells you it is just a soap opera  that person would be very very wrong.Yes the film has style to burn. Deborah Kerr was never more beautiful. Her skin looks like cream her pert pinched nose like a blossom. She's never been more appealing than she is here. The scene where she smiles from a boat at her fianc on shore alone is worth the price of admission.Cary Grant seems to sleep in tuxedos. He is a walking model of male perfection.Less observant viewers come away from this movie thinking that nothing happened that nothing was ever at stake that nothing was risked or gained. How wrong they are.Kerr's amazing dresses  how about the one with the pumpkin colored ribbons woven through the front?  Grant's suavity and the south of France settings are not just there to pose for the camera.All of the beauty of this film is there to do very hard work  to tell a less than beautiful story.And no this is not a movie where nothing happens. Something is happening in every scene  you just have to be paying attention and you just have to be mature enough or have your antenna up high enough to catch the subtle messages the film is sending and to feel in your own solar plexus the resonances of loves dreams and selves risked and gained or lost.Nicki and Terry are both gambling much here. They are wounded people in a world of high glamor they speak in arch codes even as their hearts are bleeding or their breath is caught against the cage of dreams.Grant's character Nicki Ferrante is a lazy gigolo. Gigolo is a pretty word for an ugly situation. Ferrante is a talented artist but he knows that he can market something else he does  seduce women  far more easily and for a higher price than he can get for his paintings.Kerr's character Terry McKay as she says had to grow up very fast and fight off a boss who  well  she faced some bad stuff in her life. When a steady but less than thrilling man offered to set her up she no fool took the offer.These are two beautiful people swanning through life over some very ugly circumstances. They have both sold their best selves for easy money.And then completely by chance on shipboard they meet their soul mates. This meeting doesn't just present them with an opportunity for a one night stand. It demands that they face their own fears and become their best selves.I'm one of those cynical people who doesn't believe in love never mind soul mates but this movie carries it all off so well it makes me believe.Grant and Kerr begin with the lightest and subtlest of exchanges. they say things to each other  example I'd be surprised if you were surprised  that if you are not paying attention and that if you don't know a lot about life  would just go over your head.Slowly but surely their effervescent and yet irresistible attraction becomes truly heavy. The scene with Grandmere Janou Cathleen Nesbit is amazing for all it says without actually saying anything.I could see a naive filmgoer taking in that scene and then asking What was the point of that scene? You really have to have your eyes on the screen and have a sensitivity to human interactions. Who is looking at whom whose face is suddenly hidden and why who is saying what without actually saying it and why does the sound of that boat whistle bring tears  you have to be willing to pay attention and to have a sense of life and human relationships and yes an openness to the possibility of there being a God to understand that scene.Here you have a man and a woman who have basically sold themselves to the highest bidder and who at that point are perilously close to cheating. What happens? Their love is blessed by the Virgin Mary. Heavy stuff.We changed our course today. Truer words were never spoken.I've got to hand it to Leo McCarey who wrote and directed this film as well as the Academy Award winning Going My Way. He so wonderfully brings the best and most complex aspects of Catholicism to the screen here. Catholicism is associated with the romance languages  French Italian  and it also is friendly to this kind of romance  a romance where fallen beauties are blindsided by the kind of tortuous redemptive overwhelming fated love that demands and gets everything after which you are never the same.If you haven't seen the movie or Sleepless in Seattle I won't reveal the ending to you. I'll just say that merely thinking about the ending can make me cry such tears as really very few films I've ever seen can make me cry. These tears are their own species.".

	schema:headline " Amazing movie not at all annoying";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again due to its sweet nature and its refreshing look at how the world used to be. It is quaint yet still touching to those of us viewing it 50 years later. It is still relevant and it is still wonderful to watch the chemistry between the charismatic Cary Grant and the beautiful Deborah Kerr. The movie is a reminder of how simple things could make you laugh back in days when comedy was not sarcasm or needing negativity to be funny. An Affair to Remember is a wonderfully beautiful movie that creates a wonderful sense of how romance should be. It's lasting quality can be seen in other movies that have followed by deriving inspiration from the use of the Empire State Building as an iconic tower representing romance and this is a testament to the importance and relevance of this movie decades later. Plus Cary Grant is still a cinematic icon 50 years later. This is a beautiful movie than spans time and still touches hearts this many years later. And it will continue to touch hearts for many years to come.".

It is quaint yet still touching to those of us viewing it 50 years later. It is still relevant and it is still wonderful to watch the chemistry between the charismatic Cary Grant and the beautiful Deborah Kerr. The movie is a reminder of how simple things could make you laugh back in days when comedy was not sarcasm or needing negativity to be funny.

Kerr on the other hand was enjoying huge acclaim as a result of her performance in The King and I which itself was a superdeluxe musical retelling of Anna and the King of Siam 1948 also starring Dunne.All the elements seemed to be in An Affair to Remember's favor popular charismatic stars lavish production values and even the same director as the 1939 original Leo McCary. Unfortunately some of the sparkle seems to have gotten smothered beneath the Technicolor trappings hackeneyed melodrama cliches and the swelling swooning theme song.Everything starts out perfectly fine Grant a notorious international playboy meets Kerr a sensible nightclub singer while onboard a luxurious cruise ship. Although both are spoken for Grant's engagement is humorously reported upon at the film's start there is an immediate spark and the banter is quite charming and witty. The film is handled with a light comic touch and it seems as if for once a 1950's remake is going to at least be on a par with its predecessor if not exactly surpassing it.Unfortunately things begin to fall apart as soon as the starcrossed pair hit dry land. Except for a surprisingly touching if calculated scene where Kerr and Grant visit his frail Italian grandmother the alwayswonderful Cathleen Nesbitt the remainder of the picture veers sharply into pure 1950's soap. SPOILERS TO FOLLOW Grant and Kerr promise each other to dump their respective fiancees and meet atop the Empire State Building to reaffirm their love and get married. On her way to the meeting Kerr gets nearkilled crossing a street no doubt Vic Damone belting that damn song distracted her and Grant not knowing of the accident believes that she's had a change of heart.Kerr is now confined to a wheelchair Grant follows his life's dream to become a painter Kerr buys one of his paintings Grant tracks her down Grant learns of her accident by opening her bedroom door and finding a wheelchair in the darkened room hit by a spotlight. Groan. Together at last Kerr and Grant dissolve into happy tears with Kerr uttering perhaps the most cringeworthy line in big budget soap opera history If you can paint I can walk!In trying to combine the screwball romantic comedy elements of the 1930's with a tackier 1950'sera Love is a Many Splendored Thingtype mentality creates a very schizophrenic film. The first half is very enjoyable fastpaced and charming. The second half is mawkish and shrill still entertaining but a disappointment after the relative excellence of the first half. There's even a horrid musical sequence with Kerr and a disadvantaged children's chorusa crude and obvious nod to her previous King and I success.You could do a lot worse than An Affair to Remember when it comes to lowbrow melodrama gussied up in deluxe trappings after all nothing with Cary Grant is completely without merit.

After I saw Sleepless in Seattle when I was in high school and caught the many references to this film I decided to check it out for myself.  Needless to say with the whole shipboard romance aspect of it and the promise to meet again in six months atop the Empire State Building of all places I quickly became hooked.  The scene that takes place on the French Riviera with Nickie's grandmother playing the piano oh God is it beautiful!  Cary Grant is so debonair and suave and Deborah Kerr is so ravishing and stunningly beautiful that it always demands repeated viewings from me at least twice a year.Seeing this film always makes me wonder if something like the kind of relationship describes within this film would actually BE possible in real life.  Would and could someone actually leave the person they were engaged to in order to marry a complete and total stranger they just met days ago? I'd like to think that it could but then again I am nothing but a hopeless romantic.  The final scene always tears my heart out no matter how many times I've seen it.  I'm always sobbing.  Watching this film around the fourteenth day of February even if you are single is always a treat.  It allows our fantasies to take wing so that we may think we are actually the one meeting our beloved atop the Empire State Building in a thunderstorm.Watch this film with a box of industrialstrength kleenex nearby.My rating 4 stars".

Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant meet on a cruise ship and even though Cary's a notorious playboy and Deborah's practically engaged to another man they fall in love. The scenes on the ship are the most adorable of the film. They try to hide their romance from prying eyes by eating at separate tables and walking in opposite directions when they're seen together even when they have to stop talking midsentence!While the ship scenes are very cute the rest of the movie is a drama so be prepared when you rent it for a lighthearted afternoon. This is the second of three version of the film the first in 1939 with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne and the third in 1994 with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening but I like this version the best. It's not my favorite classic romance but it's a classic you'll probably want to watch if you a fan of Cary or Deborah. I like their third pairing in the comedy The Grass is Greener best because I like seeing Deborah's hidden comic talents. This movie really is a must see though especially if you've ever sat through the 90s classic Sleepless in Seattle. This iconic tearjerker ending has been included in many a romance montage.Parts of the movie feel a little boring namely when Cary takes Deborah to meet his grandmother Cathleen Nesbitt. Since I don't really find his character particularly sympathetic I'm not really moved when Cathleen talks about how sweet he really is underneath his cool playboy persona. But to each his own. Give it a watch and even if you don't end up liking it there's a good chance you'll well remember it.".

No there is no Austria and no war but there are some kids some songs and plenty of awfully exaggerated romantic nonsense. It starts off as a leisurely romantic comedy when Grant meets Kerr on a luxury ship. Grant is an infamous playboy who is about to marry a superrich young woman who isn't badlooking either. Yet Grant is ready to sacrifice all that and to start working for the first time in his life so that six months later he may meet Kerr on top of the Empire State Building  hence be worthy of her love. Kerr on Grant's suggestion that their meetingplace be the Empire State Building comments rather pathetically That's as close to Heaven as you can get in NY!. By the way Kerr's character grew up in Boston then moved to NY  but somehow kept that pure British accent intact. And while the two of them are having their wellremembered affair all the other passengers and even crewmembers giggle about incessantly starring and pointing at the glamour couple as if they were witnessing live sex between a naked Lady Di and one of her stable boys. Naturally everyone else on the ship is old and unattractive just like in Ryan's Daughter except that there it pertains to a village not a ship. Did I mention that the worldfamous playboy Grant is an artistic soul who is a good painter? Well then I also ought to mention that Kerr eventually gets a job as a teacher in a lowly NY school for nonrich kids where she inspires kids to have high hopes and dreams and to fight for their ideals perhaps and and... aaahhhh... But the highlight of absurdity and forcetragedydownyourthroat plotdevicemaking is Kerr having a traffic accident just as she is heading toward the Empire S.B.! How very old Hollywood school! And it doesn't end there Kerr even keeps the accident a secret from Grant so that he won't feel sorry for her won't have to support her or whatever other garbage reason the writer of this film thought up. In the end a predictable accidental meeting between Kerr and Grant eventually leads to them finally resuming that alltoo wellremembered affair  after a full year! The movie is rescued by the cast although I've seen them both better in other  better  movies and by that 50s Technicolor charm.".

In the end a predictable accidental meeting between Kerr and Grant eventually leads to them finally resuming that alltoo wellremembered affair  after a full year! The movie is rescued by the cast although I've seen them both better in other  better  movies and by that 50s Technicolor charm.";

It wasn't so much the script as the interaction between Nicky Cary Grant and Terry Deborah Kerr that was intriguingthe little stolen moments the careful words and even that tiny indirect farewell kiss Nicky bestows on Terry's hand as they part company when coming off the steamer. It all builds up to a terrific denouement and I have to admit to being thrilled when Nicky turns up at Terry's door and increasingly horrified as he baits her about missing their meeting atop the Empire State building. Cary Grant is charming as always and at age 53 still able to get a girl's heart to stop dead in its tracks. Who wouldn't have been too busy thinking about him to get into a devastating car accident? Deborah Kerr is lovely as well and the direction of the film is excellent. We don't get soundtracks like this anymore eithersoft romantically lush with children serenading the audience as much as they do Terry.If this movie had been made today I would probably be cynical and think of it as emotionally exploitative.

Forget that Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are a wonderfullyright pair of casting decisions with delightfully justoff synergy as a troubled romantic duo. When one thinks about the very popular romance An Affair to Remember the story needs to be viewed as a feature film idea and as a completed entity in its own right. And on these terms it is as refreshing I suggest as a Mediterranean breeze in the springtime. McCarey's direction is as straightforward and competent as is his script. There could have been more characters but the fundamental situation involving famous playboy Grant with amused and interested singer Kerr in a shipboard romance that simply succeeds in spite of all the fishbowlpaparazziinterfering passenger setbacks is unfolded for the viewer like a rose warming to a springtime sun's rays. Every aspect of the film technical and artistic works to increase its honest emotional impact. The famous the song music by Hugo Friedhofer songs by Harold Adamson and McCarey settings and art direction costumes and lighting cinematography by veteran Milton Krasnerall contribute to the final glowing effect...The acting in this picture by Richard Denning Grant Cathleen Nesbit as Grant's grandmother emcee Robert Q. Lewis as himself and skilled character veteran Fortunio Bonanova and the choir children and shipboard guests is always aboveaverage also Deborah Kerr singing dubbed by Marn Nixon is at her best in her multilayered role which is very good indeed frankly her charisma and skill had to help Grant's underwritten part if the film were to succeed. How well she did her work is attested by the film's wide acceptance with critics and audience alike. The term romance I suggest needs to refer to a personal and potential partnership between two persons capable of 'mature' or lasting admirationbasedlove and worthiness of being watched as they work within the context of their ethical values to create the terms emotional readiness and acceptable conditions for their 'union' of exclusivity together and against the world's people and agents of frustrations or tyrannies if need be. The attractive for once over thirtyfive importance of both characters and the difficulties they face in earning the right to become such a romantic unionin the objectivist sense of romance just definedare aided in the plot and retarded in personal terms by the problems they face the difficulty of Grant's becoming a working artist in whatever marketplace exists Kerr's conflicting schedule the death of his grandmother a lengthy enforced absence and her later accident all work against them. But the climax of the film is an honest triumph of romantic comedy writing and Grant's best scene in the film. This is a very rewarding positive and worldly film despite bows toward religious trappings. It is McCarey's masterpiece and a deservedly popular film for lovers everywhere secular or otherwise. A bit lengthy but a rare adult Hollywood comedic nearmasterpiece.".

It reminds me of the 1973 remake of Lost Horizon another turkey. However I give this 3 stars because Cary Grant is well Cary Grant. He is smart and beautiful and always stands apart from the dialogue although he is of course a good actor as well. I also agree that Grant and Deborah Kerr had no chemistry. She reminded me as someone once said of Julie Andrewsof having all the sex appeal of a very efficient dietitian. Yes there were elements of this movie that reminded me of the Sound of Music. Perhaps it was the cinematography. I think this film would have been better had it remained on the boat. That part although silly was light and funny. The transformation of the suave handsome Cary Grant to a billboard painter in overalls is worthy again of the Zucker touch. come to think of it the Zuckers couldn't top that!When Deborah Kerr walked in front of whatever hit her it reminded me of the scene from Plan 9 from Outer Space. That work has Bela Lugosi leaving his front lawn only to be instantly hit by a car off camera. That was hilarious in and of itself but the same scene with Deborah Kerr flouncing and singing her way to the Empire State Building and thus being mowed down by a taxi was a close second.The movie was not logical if she loves a man why did she not let him know what happened? And if he could paint she could walk wouldn't the reverse be true? If she could walk he could paint! Therefore following the logic of this movie all he had to do at the beginning was watch her walk around and he would have become a great painter. Oh yes and by the way the little intercity cherubs that she taught from her perch reminded me of the children in Lost Horizon. I don't mind chick flicksbeing a chick myself or at least an old hen I don't mind sentimental movies  I certainly don't mind Cary Grant but I do mind scenes characters and dialogue crafted to manipulate the audience. Come to think of it I should rate this a 2.Nah I really like the beautiful well written scenes with the grandmother. Wait... come to think of it one of the worst scenes in this movie occurred during that segment. It was the chapel scene when Deborah got down on her knees and prayed and Cary Grant watched her with growing awareness that this was the gal for him he also prayed and I think even crossed himself. OMG no I think I'll rate this flick a 1.".

Love Affair they show love for each other of course it shows they are together in real life too. All kinds of sex a peel going on between them and it shows on screen. They are so much better. I am glad Warren Beatty made this version or we would be stuck with the horrible lasting picture with Deborah Kerr.

It stars Louis Hayward Jane Wyatt Lee Bowman  Dorothy Patrick. Music is by George Antheil and photography by Edward J. Cronjager.Novelist Stephen Byrne Hayward makes a play for the house maid and unwittingly kills her when she repels his advances. Enlisting the help of his disabled brother John Bowman to dispose of the body in the river Stephen suddenly finds that the publicity surrounding the maid's disappearance has put him in vogue again. In fact he finds his muse sufficiently stoked enough to craft another novel. But as easy as Stephen finds it easy to have no conscience the opposite is the case with John and with the river refusing to hold its secrets something is going to give.Working out of Republic pictures Lang refused to let the low budget production hamper his vision of a bleak Cain  Abel like Gothicnoirmelodrama. He did however meet some resistance when requesting that the maid be played by a black woman which was quickly shot down by nervous executives at the famed B movie studio. House by the River is far from being among the best of Lang's work but the final product is still a triumph considering it's basically a three character piece set virtually in just two locations. It scores high on eerie atmosphere and finds Lang dealing in moral bankruptcyresponsibility and the eye for an eye mentality. Ushered into the narrative too is a Lang fave of people irked by loving someone they can't have. These themes allow the director to gloss over the simple script and dally in some truly arresting visuals.Aided considerably by Cronjager's Desert FuryCanyonPassage chiaroscuro photography Lang's film is a lesson in how to maximise effect from limited sets. The actual house on the river and that of the neighbour resplendent with creepy scarecrow in garden has a very disquiet feel to it fronted by shimmering water that carries the dead carcass' of animals it's a most haunting setting. And the eerie atmosphere continues inside the house where shadows work their wonders and Antheil's music sticks rigidly and rightly to the creaky house formula. The cast don't pull up any trees but they don't need to. Hayward is perhaps too animated for a study in snide villainy but it works and he has a nice line in visual mocking. The rest fall in line for what is required with the best of the bunch being Ann Shoemaker as nosey neighbour Mrs. Ambrose.Once a hard to find film House by the River is now easily accessible after gaining a DVD release the print is fine some age spotting and crackles but completely watchable. It's a film that is easily recommended to Lang and Gothic house based movie purists. Driven by a despicable protagonist and cloaked in a creepy noirish vibe it deserves to now gain a better and more appreciative audience. 7.510".

He doesn't care whom he drags down to keep his name clear and finish the book he is writing about the crime.In addition to excellent performances by Hayward Bowman and Jane Wyatt as Hayward's wife the supporting cast is a dream Plump Jody Gilbert is pathetic and hateful simultaneously as Bowman's maid. Ann Shoemaker gives a touch of comic relief  but just a touch  as a nosy neighbor of Hayward and Wyatt.Like the best of Lang  The Big Heat Fury M Metropolis and the Mabuse films  this concerns morality and its lack.

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason the great director chose to degrade this film on some occasions yet at other times he would revel in details of the film's opening quarterhour. However at the time that he made this film he was despondent over the collapse of his Diana Productions which was a coventure with Joan Bennett and her husband Walter Wanger. With no offers in sight from the majors Lang chose to visit Poverty Row which may have left him with bad memories of a film of which he should have been more pleased.In HOUSE BY THE RIVER we have Lang working at the bargain basement Republic Pictures where Orson Welles had just made a similar descent to make MACBETH. In each case the decline was only in budget not in quality. In Lang's case we have a film that plays as a great companion piece to his SECRET BEHIND THE DOOR both being a change of pace Gothic thriller from the master of spies and noir. Incidentally the promise of artistic freedom offered at Republic did stop when Lang attempted to cast a black actress as the maid. We're just lucky that Vera Hruba Ralston wife of company head Yates wasn't cast as the wife.The screenwriter Mel Dinelli working from the A.P. Herbert novel was a past and future hand at these house mellers  he previously did the screenplay for THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE and would do BEWARE MY LOVELY in 1952. He segued well from Robert Siodmak to Fritz Lang as longtime Langian themes such as conscience and fate are in evidence here. Oddly it is not the lead who suffers a conscience. Hayward's Stephen Byrne a hack writer who has been lusting for the new maid played by Dorothy Patrick revels in his selfpromoted celebrity now that she's disappeared. She's actually been accidentally murdered by Stephen who had been filled with lustful thoughts as the maid bathed and seems to have a near orgasm as he hears the bathwater go down the drain outside the house  the look on Hayward's face is priceless. It's his brother John who aided him in hiding the body and who is referred to as having gotten his brother out of other scrapes who turns to drink to quell his conscience and who is the primary suspect in the inquest. Little does he know that his brother is subtly implicating him in the crime in toto. His fate would be that no good deed siblingly speaking goes unpunished. The brother is played by Lee Bowman and it's the only role of his in which I can say he's memorable. That's not to say that otherwise he's a forgettable player just that he's not distinguishable from a bunch of mustachioed players who came out while the head ranks were off to war and who quickly had to retreat once they returned.Hayward is so enjoying his celebrity that he's signing books by day and wife Jane Wyatt refers to him being out all night and smelling of cheap perfume when he comes home. She's beginning to realize that Lee Bowman's John Byrne is the better of the brothers although the story implies that she was his own unrequited love.But as unsympathetic as Stephen Byrne may be before an audience ever rooted for Robert Walker trying to retrieve his lighter in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN we share Stephen's fears of the body doing some synchronized swimming with the deer. While attempting to retrieve it he only makes it worse for himself by accidentally he can't do much right it seems opening the top of the sack and letting out some flowing blond hair to make it even more obvious. When Stephen later finds that his brother's monogram is on the sack he breaks into a devilish smile of contentment.Cinematographer Edward Cronjager works well with Lang on their second pairing the previous one was the gorgeous Technicolor WESTERN UNION. When the body in a sack starts popping up in the river we recall the image of a floating deceased deer from earlier in the film and a character's claim that it shows up at about the same time every day given the tide. If the ending seems rushed it's only a reflection of the lead character's madness a quick snap unlike the state of mind of Chris Cross Edward G. Robinson at the ending of SCARLET STREET which is more detailed. It could have been a bit tidier but maybe the head man cut the budget and schedule short. It was known to happen at Republic.".

Their relative isolation on the banks of a wide river means only that they will have little help when danger occurs. The neighbors and police and few and far.Louis Hayward plays the main character Stephen Byrne a writer and a bit of a selfimportant cad. Hayward has an odd style on film during this era attractive and likable at first but with an acerbic humor and some kind of unworkable stiffness as if you know he's always performing. But he's clever about it and when you realize he isn't meant to be exactly lovable he's pretty well cast. Byrne's brother wife and maid all come through with solid if uninspired performances and you wonder exactly what held everyone back. Fritz Lang has many more successful melodramas than this one.I think the weakness is largely the raw material the story itself which is a bit straight forward. One brother commits a murder the other is drawn into helping cover it up and then the tensions build between them as an inquest raises questions. It has moments but there are no further twists that work. The ending is out of character almost comical in its false and unlikely horror. Along the way though are a series of nice scenes inside the house at night along the river at night at a party meant to hide the killer's guilt and so on. The music is especially helpful in jabbing the audience at key moments. American Georges Antheil was a composer famous for his avantgarde pieces in the 1920s in Europe before settling into a Hollywood routine. You can detect and appreciate the edge he brings to the score. The photography by contrast is good without rising up to the possibilities of these kinds of settingsthe house the river the dock all have more dramatic potential that we just don't see.".

	schema:headline " Bleak and foreboding suspense thriller from Fritz Lang";
	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang made a lot of great films over his career mostly in his native Germany but he certainly made a lot of worthwhile films in the USA and House by the River is definitely one of them! This thriller revels in its lush Gothic atmosphere and this is brilliantly complimented by the dark themes of the story and a strong overture courtesy of George Antheil. The film takes place as you would expect in a house by a river. Director Fritz Lang makes excellent use of both of these central locations as the house always looks dark and foreboding while the river is deep and dark and provides an excellent setting for a macabre story of murder. The plot focuses on two brothers one of which is an unsuccessful writer that lives with his wife and two maids. After making advances towards the younger and more attractive maid and being turned down our main protagonist finds himself in a predicament when she dies in his arms. He then recruits his brother to help him rid himself of the body in the nearby lake and the publicity of the disappearance gives him a welcome boost to his writing career...This film has been thrown in with the film noir movement that took place in the forties and fifties but if you ask me it's not really a part of it. The film does feature dashes of mystery common of film noir  but the focus is really on the suspense dark plot and settings thus making it more of a straight thriller. The story itself is strong and works because of its well defined characters. The ensemble cast is good overall with Louis Hayward impressing in the lead role and receiving good feedback from Lee Bowman and Jane Wyatt in support. The main reason why the film works so well is clearly down to the atmosphere and the director always ensures that the film takes place in absolute darkness which helps the macabre plot no end. Lang uses props such as dead animals and hallucination to maximum effect and all help to make the film what it is. The House by the River boils down to a suitable dreary climax which bodes well and gives credence to everything that has gone before it. Overall this is a lovely little movie and undoubtedly one of the best that Lang made in America. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "House by the River was a modestly budgeted film made during an apparent low point in Fritz Lang's film career here in the US for povertyrow studio Republic Pictures. Set in late Victorian times House details the story of one man's slide from unsuccessful writer to inadvertent murderer and his mostly successful efforts to cover it up. The film shows Lang's continuing interest in mentally disturbed but compelling villains. Stephen Byrne the villain of House is in a long line of Langian sociopaths psychopaths and individuals driven mad from injustice from Mabuse Rottwang the scientist in Metropolis Peter Lorre in M Spencer Tracy in Fury among others.While other commentators have pointed out the superb cinematography that puts this film in the film noirGothic story genre what seems to have been missed is the jet black humor with which this film is shot through. Mordant humor is present when Stephen discovers he's becoming a better writer through his crimes. Comments are made by other characters in the movie about how a writer should only write what he knows about. That takes on a dark ghoulish tone when the audience becomes aware that Stephen's newest book is entitled Death on the River and that it has a compelling narrative indeed. In fact Stephen shows he really enjoys the notoriety of being involved in the disappearance of the servant girl Emily as well as her death. He even sends a picture of himself to the newspaper investigating the story. They print it along with the story and Stephen uses the publicity generated to boost his book sales. This film is a good example of Lang as a brilliant yet very dark satirist of human ambition and folly.In sum not a perfect film the conclusion especially feels rushed but compelling and unexpectedly funny. In some ways Stephen's mad writer vaguely anticipates Stephen King's equally mad writer Jack Torrence of The Shining.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of movies just are not shown frequently as they should be. I was first aware of this obscure movie by Fritz Lang when I was at my college in the early 1970s and was reading a book about his films. Then I finally saw it about five years ago on channel 75 in New York City in a series of movies for a City College film course. It was worth waiting for.Louis Hayward is married to Jane Wyatt and lives in a small town near his brother Lee Bowman. The year is about 1890 and it is set in a rural section of New England near a major river as the title suggests. Hayward is supposed to be a promising writer but the truth is that he wrote a few small stories that got published awhile back and he's been pretending to be working on a novel for nearly two years. He takes a fancy to a new servant Dorothy Patrick whom he attacks and kills when she resists him. Frantic he begs his brother to assist him and Bowman makes the mistake of agreeing. They dispose of the body but the missing girl's fate becomes a subject of local interest and ironically Hayward is able to make a better impression on the locals than Bowman does. Soon they are suspecting Bowman. Hayward ever an opportunist is fully willing to let Bowman take this heat  especially as he is suspicious of whether Wyatt and Bowman who once dated may be still in love. In the meantime the body of Patrick reemerges and in one of the best sequences Hayward puts the body into a rowboat and rows in the early morning hours for miles up the river until he can find a spot to drop the body which is still eventually traced back to his home but to Bowman.Lang always showed the darker side of human nature in his films like the mindless mob violence in FURY. Here it is the brittle nasty smallminded New England neighbors of Bowman Wyatt and Howard who are impressed by Howard's friendlier demeanor and don't like the standoffishness of Bowman. The evidence against Bowman is quite weak but the dislike his character causes with these boobs makes him a likely murder suspect.Louis Hayward was a competent actor usually a minor league swashbuckler THE SON OF MONTE CRISTO. Here he is given a negative role and makes the most of it. His Steven Byrne is not among the great villains in movies but it is an interesting study in arrogance and selfishness that is worthy of watching. His claims to writer's block are patently false as we never see him even struggling to write anything he is seen sitting at tables with paper and pens near him but no activities whatsoever. But he knows how to feed a friendly and superior but accessible air to the townsfolk. This may be his best performance.Bowman usually a figure in comedies or a supporting man for Susan Hayward in one of her weepies purposely plays his role of John Byrne as a taciturn type  stiff but not hostile. But the stiffness goes against the thin skins of the idiot townsfolk who prefer Hayward's false front. And Wyatt best known for her performance in LOST HORIZON or as Robert Young's wife on FATHER KNOWS BEST does well as the long suffering Marjorie.Not SCARLET STREET FURY or YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE but definitely worth watching.".

I was impressed by the acting of the three lead players Louis Hayward in particular is superb as the borderline psychopath Stephen a threatening leer never far from his face while Jane Wyatt is also very good as the loving wife whose eyes gradually open to her husband's true nature and Lee Bowman is redoubtable as the limping brother who puts sibling duty before adherence to the law.Most of all though it's Lang's mean and moody direction which gradually brings the whole affair to the boil even if the final haunting of Stephen before his demise seems to have wandered in from grand opera.Nevertheless this fine little film noir is another notable entry in director Lang's distinguished list of works.".

Well it is 1949 and the genre is at its Hollywood peak. Still pairing Republic with dark shadows is almost like pairing Roy Rogers with Sam Spade. But the studio was clearly serious hiring one of the masters of noir Fritz Lang. In fact those shots of a darkly glistening river stretching out to infinity made me rethink the whole idea of swimming. And what about a slimy Louis Hayward as the unscrupulous Stephen. He's the kind of guy who would pat your back smile and then slip a letter opener into your gut. He's sure a long way from his usual swashbuckling hero. But my money's on portly Jody Gilbert who steals the movie as the truculent housekeeper. Gilbert's usually a comedic figure but you'd never know it here. Frankly though the lengthy courtroom scene breaks up the noirish spell of the river and the shadowy bankside mansion. It should have been rethought. Then there's the symbolism of the rippling gown and a flowing river suggesting that justice and time respectively never forget. These shots are some of the most striking bw photography I've seen. Of course the producers couldn't have known at the time but the wholesome Jane Wyatt made me think Robert Young and the kids would arrive any moment. Nonetheless she's right for the sweet wife's part. Overall the narrative may be flawed but some truly memorable scenes remain. Maybe that's why the film's only occasionally included among Lang's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this thriller about a psychopathic writer who accidentally kills his sexy maid and then tries to pin it on his crippled brother.Louis Hayward overacts a bit as Stephen the failed scribe who rejects his attractive and classy wife Marjorie Jane Wyatt in favor of his tease of a housekeeper.I enjoyed the performance of Lee Bowman as Stephen's brother John who out of family loyalty allows himself to be dangerously manipulated. He too harbors a forbidden love  for his brother's wife  but has the integrity not to act on it. Descending into alcoholism he'd rather flee than make love with his sisterinlaw.In a film that is much less ambitious than a classic such as M Fritz Lang creates scenes of satisfying creepiness on a river that is central to the plot. In addition a courtroom scene is quite entertaining.My only quibble with this movie is its facile ending. It all ties up just a little too neatly. I expected more from this famed director.".

	schema:headline " For one young maiden this will be a river of no return.";
	schema:reviewBody "You don't have much time to even put your hand into your popcorn when all of a sudden murder pops up. It's all sudden out of nowhere an obvious accident yet cruelly hidden. Louis Hayward strangles the maid he's anxious to bed while simply trying to keep her quiet so a nosy neighbor passing by won't hear her screams. Then when he realizes what he's done he's using his crippled brother Lee Bowman to help him get rid of the corpse simply by flinging the poor maiden into the river which is conveniently located outside Hayward's back door. But no bad deed goes unpunished the girl's absence does not go unnoticed and as you had already seen in those lowbudget Tod Slaughter British horror movies of the late 30's and early 40's the corpse comes home. Will the suspicious wife Jane Wyatt be the next to pay or will a little ghostly visit by the deceased make the piper be paid? Like the house in Rebecca the moors in Wuthering Heights and the land in Gone With the Wind the river acts like a character one without dialog but definitely living and breathing watching the evil occurring with baited breath and waiting for the right time to strike. The funny thing is that all along you really begin to think that the villain actually might get away with it and it is brilliant fun to watch everything fall into place. Fritz Lang another master of suspense keeps every moment gripping and after misfiring with his Secret Beyond the Door scores with his House By the River.The supporting cast has some great moments particularly Anne Shoemaker as the pesky next door neighbor who shows up at the most inauspicious times to annoy Hayward and Jody Gilbert in probably her biggest part as the maid. I began to notice this portly character actress only recently in so many films I've seen many times before and unlike other character actors of the time she seems like people you may have known in your neighborhood as a child or encountered at work. Other character actors usually seem so much larger than life or have a look that is far too unique to be common. In fact the day I watched this movie Ms. Gilbert popped up in another film I had just seen Are You With It? not surprising in the fact that she appeared in over 100 films and TV shows. Dorothy Patrick as the poor maid dispatched by Hayward reminded me of Angela Lansbury in The Picture of Dorian Gray with her pathetic creature one of those frail maidens you can tell from the very beginning who was destined to be exploited used and tossed aside. This is the type of film to watch in total darkness for the full effect.".

	schema:reviewBody "Louis Hayward Jane Wyatt and Lee Bowman star in House by the River a 1950 film directed by Fritz Lang. According to the interview on the DVD this film for some reason was lost and later located.The film is a Gothic drama. Hayward plays Stephen Byrne a snake and an unsuccessful writer. One day while his wife Wyatt is out of the house Stephen makes a pretty aggressive pass at the family maid Emily Dorothy Patrick. When she starts screaming Stephen winds up killing her. Panicked he begs his crippled brother John Lee Bowman to help him get rid of the body. John is sick of baling out his brother but does so because Stephen lies to him stating that his wife is at the doctor's because she's pregnant. John reluctantly helps. Emily's disappearance causes a lot of publicity which helps the sale of Stephen's books and inspires him to write one about her death as his marriage deteriorates. Meanwhile suspicion falls in the wrong quarters.This is an excellent film by Lang with some of the action taking place in the dark narrow house and on the river which has become a tremendous threat to both Stephen and John. At times it's downright creepy.This film was made by Republic and this isn't what one would call an A list cast or budget yet under Lang's direction it's an A film. All three of the stars would enjoy solid careers in television as would many of the supporting players.Louis Hayward's career was a strange thing. Handsome smooth with a caressing voice he made a wonderful Simon Templar in The Saint in New York and appeared in several top films including The Count of Monte Cristo And Then There Were None and Anthony Adverse. It seemed like all systems go. But megastardom was not to be the majority of his films were weak entries. He became wealthy acting and producing on television. Hayward is excellent here embodying the cold opportunistic and amoral Stephen. Lee Bowman is very good as John doing some of his best work. And Jane Wyatt who would become known to baby boomers as Margaret Anderson on Father Knows Best is lovely as Stephen's unhappy wife.A must see if you like Lang.".

That single name uttered snidely in the dark by Louis Hayward will make your skin crawl.I've seen House by the River at least 6 times. I don't know why I like it so much. It's a wonderfully welldone film but it creeps the heck out of me every time I watch it. Louis Hayward in the performance of his life plays a psychopathic wastrel of a writer in the late 1800's who tries to rape the housemaid while his wife is away but accidentally strangles her. He cons his brother into helping him get rid of the body. He gets inspiration from this for a book and his book is a success. But when certain people get in the way of his success he turns the whole thing around in the most diabolical way possible.Out of all Fritz Lang's sound films yes even M House by the River is my favorite. The Gothic atmosphere is so intense... the photography the music and acting all fit together perfectly. It might not be Lang's best American film but I think it's one of his most unique.".
