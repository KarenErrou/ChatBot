	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie only a few days ago at a convention and was moved to think about a side of torture tactics that I had never examined. The power of mental abuse can surely override any physical abuse and that is shown through Madeline Stowe's wondrous acting in this movie. Likewise Alan Rickman brings to the screen a marvelous portrayal of a ruthless government interrogator. It is interesting though even while he tortures Stowe's character how you see a bit of himself shine through his terrorist personality. It grabbed me in the scene where she is blindfolded and he is pretending to be someone else how he lets the mask fall from his face even as his voice continues his work. The basis of the plot is this A children's book writer Stowe is arrested on the premise that her books hold subversive political ideas trying to get children to go against the government. The writer continues to deny these allegations even as she is questioned and eventually abused physically and mentally by a government agent Rickman. The showing of these torture techniques is disturbing and probably should not be watched by those who are squeamish about such things. The film was made in partnership with Amnesty International in the early 90's. On the surface of this movie I would have to agree with all their policies but as with any movie of this sort a viewer should not support the organization purely on the face of the movie screen but it should spur the viewer to outside research. I believe that is what this movie does for many of us. The upshot of this I would say I enjoyed the movie but 'enjoy' is not quite the right word. I would watch this movie again if the opportunity arose and would also recommend it to anyone who has a taste for realistically disturbing movies. 4 stars out of 5.".

We see the subtle allusion to the parallels of a dishonest governmentsociety structure and the culture of sexual predation where one in four young children are molested and one in three women has experienced some form of rape.For me it brings up a chilling chickenandegg question does the attitude of our sexual repressionleadingtopredation create the political environment of fear and censoring or does the sociopolitical dysfunction fuel a culture of sexual predation?

No one can steal your power  they can only trick you into giving it up and then you have the right to take it back at any time.This is not a movie to be entered into lightly and you most certainly do ENTER it.

The acting in the film is superb sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization and not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role as he does with all roles making the interrogator fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round theater. Which does not add or take away from the emotion of the action. This movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and I'd say they have made a success of that goal.".

It's a movie about an interrogation and one that ends on a note of a message brought to you by Amnesty International which is well intentioned but not the right note at the end of all of this. Up until then it's an absolutely riveting display of acting prowess and technical marvelwork. Its bizarre execution comes from somewhere primal somewhere from a filmmaker who wants to take you to some place that is rather unrelenting and sad about the human condition where we put ourselves in a place we can't get out of  and sometimes how we can find a way to make it through bit by bit.It's like if Kafka had to do a remake of Saw and use nothing but politics. Oh and cast Alan Rickman instead of Jigsaw and make it about a woman who writes children's stories and is accused of writing subversive literature hidden in her latest story 'Closet Land'... come to think of it that's nothing like Saw at all save for the bits of torture which gracefully are kept at a distance.Two things are striking here the sets and lighting and the performances maybe that's three who cares. It's a showcase for Bill Pope later the mastermind behind lighting The Matrix to really make this a claustrophobic but somehow baroque room the characters are in. We rarely leave it save for those few flashes where Madeline Stowe imagines herself away with her creations so the photographer has to come up with new ways to show us these people in this very strange and oppressive environment. The other thing is the acting. If you ever want to look up 'underrated' here's the place.In fact I would make a bold statement this is Alan Rickman at his very best. He's so good here because he makes this character unlikeable but hard to pin down. Is he a really bad person or is he just crazy? Does he really believe what he's saying as he breaks this woman or does he mean it when he says They're watching me too when talking to Madeline Stowe's children's writer. We get glimpses of his character's life before all of this madness. but it's hard to see how that informs the macabre pitchblack comedy of when we wee him as the other guard when Stowe is blindfolded cavorting and contorting around the room like a madman. He gets to go to town and is sinister subtle even warm and when he gets mad you can feel it. Stowe on the other hand is given a more challenging task playing the victim always on the alert but strong because of her own 'Closet Land' she developed as a child not as any kind of political statement.I believed both actors in the roles no matter how horrifying things got and the filmmaking is just direct and absorbing. There's a lot of dialog that they have to cover here but it's never boring or slight. And oddly enough I don't think it would've worked as a play unless it was restructured or if things were cut out a bit. It is for all of its 'wordyness' a cinematic piece shot on a specificfilm set and given a musical score that unless I was mistaken sounded a helluva lot like Philip Glass it says Richard Einhorn but who cares. It's ultimately 'that' movie that you have to tell your friends about since they probably never heard of it until you came across it on say Rickman's IMDb page. Among a small group of people I imagine it's one of the great littleseen films of the past twentyfive years intelligent provocative adult filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Closet Land is an amazing terrifying piece of cinema. It features only two actors in a single set but never loses your attention. The set design is imaginative and troubling the staging of scenes maintains your attention while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The acting is outstanding with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the duty of carrying every scene.I first saw this film in 1991 soon after it came out on video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived not surprising given its political content. It should be seen though. It features a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in its citizens. The country is never named which makes it all the more striking. It could be anywhere East West 3rd World 1st World. It illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone when government becomes the ruler of the citizens rather than the servant.Madeleine Stowe is a children's author who has been dragged from her bed in the night and subjected to terror and torture. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman a seemingly pleasant functionary. At first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go but fear causes her to remain and the terror escalates. She is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation temporal manipulation confusion auditory manipulation role play and twisted logic to break down the author. She is humiliated and browbeaten forced to endure strenuous bodily positions deprived of food and water.Through it all she refuses to give in to do what the interrogator asks. She is told that it will all end if she just signs a confession. A simple little act. She refuses. Through it all she employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. It is slowly revealed that she was the victim of childhood sexual abuse. To survive she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse. These mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and turn the tables on her interrogator. She starts attacking his own beliefs and profession forcing him to examine his own life and motives. In the end she is free because she maintains the freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one trapped by the state.This movie was made during the height of the Cold war Apartheid and at a time when the crimes of many governments throughout the world made daily news. It is even more timely in a world where enemy combatants are held and interrogated in secret prisons denied legal rights or counsel where ethnic cleansing lays waste to whole societies and humanitarian aid is denied. It demonstrates that the individual can stand up to the state or other oppressor by refusing to give in to fear and terror.".

There is no movie heroine like this one She has gone through extreme trauma and victim blaming and we are supposed to admire her for maintaining integrity and willpower when her voice is threatened which I do. She isn't even supposed to have a love interest! I salute you Radha Baradwaj.Unfortunately the political message is completely undermined once the twist is revealed. I myself am convinced the Interrogator was indeed the child molester for long before child molestation is brought up we have lines like Before you knew a man's touch and You've changed. You have to watch it a second time. Most convincing is the poetry the Interrogator recites which would only make sense if he had known her before. And with all the times she says he's lying she doesn't do so when he claims to be the child molester! So the motivation in tracking her down was personal rather than ideologicalalthough you could argue that his victim blaming and rise to power despite being a pedophile are connected to ideology. BUT she is not being held prisoner for ideological reasons! He just didn't want to be found out because the story Closet Land hints at his terrible secret. I guess pedophiles aren't supposed to work for this government after all. Anyway considering all this what evidence do we have that this government's beliefs and aims are so bad? Despite this gaping plot hole I'm damned if Closet Land isn't greatly enjoyable and wellwritten in every other way. Especially if you're one of those crazy Alan Rickman fans I recommend it.".

This is absolutely true.I was the unfortunate victim of sexual abuse when I was a child and I would suffer panic attacks at night.

Later the residence seems to be more like the people in Deliverance. Soon bodies start turning up and everybody looks suspect with the exception of a few friendly faces. This does not keep the family from enjoying running around and messing around in the woods.We find that they have to be super ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get axcepted as the antagonists. Can the ignored young Stevie save his parents or will their pursuers put hisher foot in it?This film is more than most parodies as it was played with strait faces. They could not have chosen better actors and Daryl Anderson was exceptionally creepy. An added plus is that they let us know what is happening before the characters find out instead of pulling a clue out of the hat after the fact. Anyway this made for TV movie is good for a few laughs.".

The truth to the matters the mystery as to who's doing the killing is learned too soon leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house like if this madeforTV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film. It's not really badly made the content  story is just not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin though his performancecharacter is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious. Blond cutie Tammy Lauren the daughter might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too as she also starred in Wishmaster 1997 and madeforTV outings like I Saw What You Did 1988  The Stepford Children 1987. She hasn't got much to do in this film though. Skippable but watchable if anything.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie for the first time recently and was quite surprised at how awful it truly is. Have I seen worse? Sure but I won't waste my time watching this film ever again.THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE LAKE concerns a family who decides to give up city life due to the crime and move to the country in the midwest. Unfortunately dead bodies keep popping up there too.The film suffers from bad dialog and bad acting pretty much all the way through. There are a few exceptions in minor roles as far as the acting but the leads including Valarie Harper were not convincing at all. Add to that silly facial expressions and you've got a real eye roller on your hands. One of the things that surprised me was that although it was implied that the family was moving to the midwest there were really bad southern accents all around. I guess the director felt that anybody who lives in the country has to sound like someone out of DELIVERANCE. There are some nice shots of the landscape and lake areas so the scenery is good in places. That is really about all this movie has going for it though. I've seen some reviewers recommend that people watch this as a comedy. For me it didn't even work on that level. It was just that bad.The film also is a little slow paced but picks up a bit at the end as the family starts to realize who the killer is. And the killer knows that they know so the stalking begins. Up till that time though much of the movie is interaction with the locals and family time. And of course you'll see the mandatory misdirection. There is some suspense towards the end but not enough to hold anyone's attention.I would absolutely give this one a pass for a fan of horror or suspense.".

She leaps from one bed to another loving each of them in much the same way as Diana does in Darling 1965. It is hardly an example of feminism and the Radical changes in women's liberation within the 1960's. It does however possess a view of hope through all the grit. Dave shows how even a criminal can be loving gentle and kind. The film offers the audience a 2 hour exploration into the lives of the criminals in London at the time. It challenges the classic Hollywood narrative of peace disruption and resolution. The narrative structure seems to float along with very little climaxs. This gives the feeling of realism which many people may find dull or boring. Don't expect your Hollywood Blockbuster. You will find a challenging Independant British film documenting the feelings of the 1960s in an innovative and unconventional way.".

How sorry one can feel for Joy is debatable as it is a life she has freely become associated with first through her marriage to Tom and later when Tom is imprisoned through her relationship with his mate Dave. What is so interesting about the film is the settings Loach's realistic style and the naturalness of the key performances.  Having an almost documentary feel about it  the possibly unintentional intrusion of the boom mike in one scene adds to this style.  Also the street scenes of the kids playing in an alley comparable to a 20 yard toilet could have been filmed in any rundown working class tenement block of the sixties.  The film itself had a raw energy especially when Joy is searching for her son amongst the demolished houses. Loach manages to present a realistic portrayal of working class urban life during 60's Britain which is well worth a look at.".

For the remainder of the film we follow White's progress if that's the right word for the next few years as she lives a mostly tawdry life on the edge of both poverty and legality interacting with a mostly dubious set of individuals in notsoswinging London in the mid60's.The narrative is somewhat awkwardly interspersed with chapter plates presumably written by White although these don't actually aid the structure of the piece as the film progresses pretty much on a tangential basis although as an insight into her character's naive optimism and childlike simplicity they may serve some purpose. Loach's soon to be trademark flyonthewall camerawork is never still longshots extreme closeups walking shots tracking shots all to convince us like his acclaimed TV documentary Cathy Come Home of the previous year with the same actress in the lead of the veracity of his subject stripping away all cinematic artifice. In this he succeeds inviting no pity for her only portraying her making do and working with what she has with little prospect of escape.Of course this unremittingly bleak outlook can be overbearing and cold and there are many scenes where he could and should have called Cut! earlier but as an insight into the working class of supposedly affluent Britain it's important to hold up a mirror to society as he does here.In the final scenes when White is reunited with her temporarily lost child we are brought fullcircle to that shocking opening scene as he reminds us that family love is perhaps the only true love. Whether it will be enough of a basis for White to break out and make a life for herself and her son is debatable so that some sort of a sequel might have been interesting to consider.The cast is an interesting with one with Terence Stamp demonstrating his range as the crook who White falls for and who shows her a kind of loving even as the film makes clear in the only stagy scene in the film his courtroom trial that there are no victimless crimes. As in Cathy Come Home White holds the viewer's attention with her disarming honesty vulnerability and spirit.

This film was well before the days of career women.  A career woman of the 60s would likely have been regarded a closet lesbian and little else.  The film was made well before the days of women's emancipation and I think most modern day audiences will miss that.

	schema:reviewBody "This documentarystyle film based on Nell Dunn's novel almost views like a homemovie. As I watched it I kept checking to see how far into the movie I was and how much longer it would last. This in itself was not a good sign. However Loach does use the environment and surrounding people effectively with several close ups showing the hopelessness or boredom on people's faces. The main method of the semidocumentary is a series of episodic clips arranged in chronological order often title cards are used to introduce the episodes. To me the title cards suggest captions one might find in an old photo album. They are sometimes humorous and sometimes painful but they help move the story along.The film relates the story of a young NorthofLondon lower class woman Joy Carol White in the early 60s. She is a victim of her class in that she has never learned to think about aspiring higher. Yet she does persist and survive. At the beginning of the film Joy is in the delivery room giving birth to her son Johnny. I'm not sure if mass Western audiences at that time had seen many human births up close and on screen. So that may have been new to movie goers at the time. The next scene shows Joy breastfeeding Johnny while her husband Tom John Bindon scolds her for exposing herself since he was expecting his mates to drop by the house soon. There are early clues that Tom beats and abuses Joy. Although the couple is doing OK financially things radically change when Tom and his mates rob a store and Tom is caught and sent to prison for several years.Without marketable skills Joy drifts from job to job waitress model etc. as she hocks all of her belongings to make ends meet. When she re meets one of her husband's old crime mates Dave Terence Stamp she falls in love with him and they live together. Unlike Tomwhom she is now trying to divorce while he is in jailDave is fun kind and loving. Some of the richest and most beautiful scenes of the film reflect the happiness of Joy and Dave. But when he mugs a rich old woman to steal her jewelrycoupled with his record of previous runins with the lawhe is sent to prison for twelve years. Joy continues to think of Dave. She also writes him and visits him regularly in jail. While she swears she will wait for him she continues to have causal affairs with other men and lives from day to day and job to job. As Johnny gets older Joy remains stuck...Once again to me this looks like a wellacted but poorlyphotographed home movie. On the other hand I may be missing the great moviemaking craft that Ken Loach seemed to deliver so well in Kes but missed here.".

Previously I've watched a handful of the early black and white ones but POOR COW the first film from longtime director Ken Loach offered in a new wave of allcolour pictures that eventually heralded the way for the miserable likes of EASTENDERS and other soaps that came later. POOR COW is a product of its era and it shows and that's what makes it interesting.The film is in essence the story of a young mother and her kid and their attempts to get by in a cruel and often harsh world. Carol White achieves level of naturalness in her performance that you don't often see which means that she's utterly convincing. The male characters are presented as brutes philanderers or simply bland cold men who don't care about the impact they make on people's lives. There's plenty of talent in the supporting cast a lot of faces who would go on to become familiar on TV and in film which makes this a fun watch despite the gruelling subject matter.The thing I found about POOR COW is that it kept me watching. I was always interested in finding out the outcome of the story although any viewer will immediately realise that it's not going to be a happy ending. I was interested to note that the interlude in which White gets involved with a group of dodgy glamour photographers seemed to inspire a whole subgenre of films directed by the likes of Norman J. Warren and Pete Walker. Apparently many of the scenes in the film were adlibbed which accounts for the sliceoflife realism of the piece.".

Beautifully set in a 19Sixties London workingclass area this film spares no effort to indulge you in the hard realism of her everyday's life. Also making you part of the girl's dreams about happiness and domestic stability  not different from many other girls' dreams.After having laid such a solid bottom 'Poor cow' invites you to connect its tale to the Swinging Sixties. A time when London was the epicenter of many freshly generated whirlwinds.Well this film's statement seems clear to me no Sixtiesglitter  shine. 'Poor cow' tells us that even in the Sixties everyday life for common people went on as usual. Accentuated by music of Sixties' popicon Donovan you may even detect that newly acquired Sixtiesfreedom primarily increased pressure on women to expose their nudity.Apart from all this 'Poor cow' deserves praise for its excellent acting  shooting. As well as for the credibility of its story  in a Sixtiesenvironment that surely warms the heart of everyone around at the time. Another Sixtiesfeature the film shows a half naked young boy frontally. In 1967 nobody thought much about that in our times this picture would probably have been censored as child pornography.".

I saw this film in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and was wowed by it. Then I saw it again at another festival where it won again and I was even more impressed because subtle touches become evident the second time around  for a short film this packs a lot of clever layers into a short time.AWOL is not for the faint of heart but it is very well done and completely impressive for a short film  for any film actually. It's an interesting story told very well and every scene moves the story which reveals good filmmaking instincts went into making this film. The film looks gorgeous and David Morse is also stunning with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene. Watching his character attempt to defeat the curveballs life is throwing him makes a great viewing experience.It also should be noted that when tortures of war are in the headlines everyday the lines between reality good and evil can get very gray while the rhetoric gets loud and attempts to make things black and white. AWOL smartly allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think the message is what is real and what is not which adds to the mystery.Both times I've seen it the audience was WAY more into this movie than the others playing with it which is saying a lot. There are a lot of shorts out there right now but few deliver the kind of all around excellence and complex subject matter that AWOL does.It sounds to me like the previous reviewer is off his or her rocker or has some personal agenda because this really is a great example of short independent filmmaking. I see a LOT of short films and I must say if only ALL the shorts making the festival rounds were this good THEN the shorts business would have some serious legs.".

It helped that it was actually about something unlike the others that were screened. It's very well directed and the production value is top notch.

It helped that it was actually about something unlike the others that were screened. It's very well directed and the production value is top notch. I would compare it to Jacob's Ladder in that it keeps you guessing as to what the true reality is of the world that we're in. You should definitely try to hunt this film down and if it's screening at any festivals near you try to check it out.";

His strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom.This thoughtprovoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action drama suspense and mystery. As with all good films the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie. The mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense. You find your self looking for the answers along with Marquette. Audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit  with many awards received they must have agreed that A.W.O.L. 2006 is well worth watching. I'd love to own a copy  how do I go about getting one?".

	schema:reviewBody "What Alice Found was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell this is combination of a road movie with a cautionary tale as well as a voyage of discovery.If you haven't seen the film maybe you should stop reading here.Alice is a case study of a young woman that wants to break away from the unhappy life she leads in a New England town. Her pretext for leaving is going to join her best friend who is away studying at a Miami university. Alice is the product of a single mother's home one that is struggling to make ends meet in sharp contrast with the life of ease her friend seems to inhabit. In flashbacks we get to see Alice's life before going on the road.Alice like her namesake in Alice in Wonderland embarks in a trip to the unknown that life hasn't prepared her for. The highways of America are full of predators in search of the weak and innocent. Alice meets with disaster when her car breaks down the road and a friendly Southern couple come to her assistance when a strange man approaches in the darkness with the excuse he wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to come along in their plush R.V. on her way down South.Nothing has prepared Alice for what this couple turns out to be. After all in her sheltered life she hasn't dealt with what Sandra and Bill her new benefactors do during the overnight stays at the rest stops in the American highways. It comes as a shock to her the realization that the kind Sandra is nothing but a prostitute that plies her trade among the truck driving populace one meets in those places.Alice brilliantly played by Emily Grace is a study in how the young woman awakens to the new reality she can't escape. In fact Sandra makes it seem so easy that Alice tries her luck at the oldest profession on earth in order to raise some badly needed money.Judith Ivey gives a tremendous performance as Sandra. Ms. Ivey is perfect as the seemingly normal woman one wouldn't suspect she is doing the nasty with clients she and Bill find along the route they travel. Ms. Ivey is amazing when she reveals the truth about her life to an accusing Alice. As the husband Bill Raymond is good in his portrayal as the husband that in reality is a procurer.Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell the film is not afraid to go to places mainstream films dare not to go. Congratulations to this director who has written a plausible story and has gathered the perfect cast to play it for our benefit.".

There is not a false note in her character choices. But the film is worth watching above all for the wily yet sensitive character of Sandra as masterfully created by Judith Ivey. There is an especially sly subtext to virtually every moment in which Ivey is oncamera. As a viewer I found myself stopping the tape hitting rewind and reviewing her scenes in order to attempt to discern the psychological subtleties.The film raises the following question about the characters Are Bill and Sandra good Samaritans or are they an evil pair of Dickensian predators preying upon the youthful Alice? One of the strengths of the film is that it never quite fully answers that question. Alice seems more selfconfident than she started out as a result of her experiences with Bill and Sandra.

Her fresh and assertive character however is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her asspatting boss and takes off for Miami vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She encounters a middleaged couple in a motor home the husband's retired from the military who rescue her from a strange man at a roadside stop and from her car's breakdown perhaps caused by their mechanizations.As it turns out the couple is heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet young Alice as a promising recruit. The wife played by Judith Ivey in a performance worthy of some big award buys Alice sexy clothing and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially Alice passively accepts her ministrations and with the couple's instructions does several tricks. The encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for finishing too fast.What's wonderful about Alice and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. This is how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither all good or all bad. Alice leaves the motor home with her wellearned money and a feeling of mutual respect.".

The encounter shown in the most detail is quite different from most cinematic sex but may be typical of what most often happens in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for finishing too fast.What's wonderful about Alice and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. This is how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither all good or all bad. Alice leaves the motor home with her wellearned money and a feeling of mutual respect.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's nothing much to the story. A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend Julie and encounters an odd couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple from Rosemary's Baby you have some idea of what these two are like. Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army. Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore although we don't find this out at once. They're affectionate helpful and full of common sense.They more or less adopt the girl Alice and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate RV although they are not driving directly to Florida.This is where the film could have gone onehundredpercent wrong. All the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil. They would take the virginal Alice handcuffed to the bed or whatever and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex. Alice would have had a heck of a time escaping with lots of aborted attempts before the final shootout. But no. The couple really IS pretty nice and Alice is far from virginal. Alice overhears Sandra with a customer asks about the business and tries to turn a trick on her own. Bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all. They don't talk her into it. They guide her.Alice makes several hundred dollars which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple. Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it. Alice misunderstands. She doesn't find whoring very pleasant work and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off Sandra responds with What? Not here honey. Not in the middle of nowhere. However after she is talked into handing her gun over to Sandra the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to Florida.You know what I found the most tragic moment in the film? It had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery. Alice has been expecting to room with her friend Julie after she arrives in Miami. Julie is after all a legitimate student. But when Alice calls her friend from someplace in Alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late Julie hesitates and says Well  my mother doesn't think you should room with us. And to tell you the truth my roommate isn't cool on it either. I invited you down sure but I thought it was just like a visit for a week or something. Go back to Milford Alice There is a long silence before Alice hangs up.Only one shot is fired a few white frames of film and no one is hit. Tears appear only once. Nobody slugs anybody else. No car explodes in a fireball. No cop chases them down the Interstate.The direction is occasionally clumsy. Too much crosscutting between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the wobbling pistol. There is hardly any musical score. There is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward as it's probably supposed to be. Alice isn't unattractive but she is not babalicious either. She sports Asiatic eyes a kind of robust version of Molly Parker. The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out. The direction is a straightforward narrative with a few illuminating flashbacks. Nothing is wasted. And it was all evidently shot around Danbury Connecticut. The city sticks in my mind because I drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles.I don't know exactly What Alice Found. I dread even THINKING that the answer to the riddle is that she found herself. The acting isn't bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. It's definitely worth seeing a quiet orderly film that treats the audience like adults.".

A good movie to show your teen age daughter who has aspirations of leaving home early for the open road and adventure. This movie film has a low budget feel to it but it works because of the low lifes and areas that these people move in.

Being from the South I thought Judith Ivey's character seemed especially real and as everyone else has mentioned she does an outstanding acting job. The characters are not beautiful and look nothing like the average Hollywood stars  their imperfect bodies and personalities seem so much more natural and real. One reviewer mentioned that the main character Alice had no good reason to run away from home which is true  she didn't have any moral or upstanding reason to run away such as escaping child abuse etc. I thought that she was just fed up with deadend jobs in a working class life and wanted to flee down to Florida where her friend lived the appealing and privileged life of a college student in Miami. The actress shows Alice's confusion uncertainty and questioning turn into decisiveness and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alice is trapped in situations with seemingly no options causing her to panic take action and reach out for help. At first the grainy filming style put me off and made me think that it was a very low budget or homemade movie but in actuality it is very well done. The home movie quality really makes you feel like you are there with the characters a part of their RV trip across the country. This is definitely a film worth seeing although I don't quite understand all the descriptions of it as a heartwarming coming of age tale. It is rather vulgar and disturbing at times even if it is not completely sad in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fantastic film! Wow  this is really a treat. I can't believe that I discovered such a gem of a movie. A pretty young girl traveling south to Florida meets a friendly older couple with an RV after she has a flat at a rest stop. However she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them.Everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you.Newcomer Emily Grace did a fantastic job as the really cute yet somewhat shy Alice.

A pretty young girl traveling south to Florida meets a friendly older couple with an RV after she has a flat at a rest stop. However she learns that things aren't as they seem and the couple gets a bit creepy after she spends some time on the road with them.Everyone in it was just so perfect for their parts you just about believe that you are watching this happen in real life in front of you.Newcomer Emily Grace did a fantastic job as the really cute yet somewhat shy Alice. Emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing and you can see just how she got into the situation that develops in the film.

Now I'm not a big fan of Indietype music and it actually made my head spin for most of the film but it perfectly shaped the film into a true indie as well as a film about trashy trailerRV life. So it was redeemed on that level. The second point I immediately noted that became redeemed as well was the film quality. From just leaving boxoffice type movies I had forgotten the other world of film. So seeing the first 20 minutes of What Alice Found looked like my dad's home videos. But the filming especially towards the end had a real sort of style to it that made the film seem more real and that made you forget about how it was filmed but just about what the story was about. I will not spoil the story in any way but Judith Ivey's acting was superb from the second she walked on screen and Emily Grace entered the film industry in a nice sort of way. There was nothing that hit me in this film as unbelievable but from all of the recent films I have seen What Alice Found was certainly the best film of trashy people told in the best possible way. You feel like you are there with the actors due to its 'real' feel and seeing the plot unfold made this film really shine. I would like to say that it was a very nice film that blossoms in its small little way but nothing could please me more than films like this one day reaching massive audiences. Creators of the film your film really had a purpose one that should be told exposing Southern RV life in no way ever shown before and I commend you for your efforts so I wish you the best of luck in the future.".

The pace was so slow that counting ceiling tiles seemed interesting to several people in the audience instead of capturing our attention then telling the story visually we were treated to a shot of uninteresting scenery then of vehicles in parking lots of people walking of vehicles on the road of anything handy that could be used to fill up time then a tiny slice of the story and back to the fillers.  Hidden inside this feature was a great story but why was it hidden?  Paced properly this would have made the basis for an interesting short and if some of the conflicts had been explored and the characters allowed to evolve the story could have served as the foundation of a good quirkily presented offbeat feature length movie.The pace was slow and there was too much padding but even so there is no excuse for flat uninteresting lighting.  DV does not mean boring images and to shoot in DV requires the same care and finesse in lighting as any other motion picture image but it sure didn't get it here.  A fill light a high kicker a touch of sparkle light in the eyes anything to enhance the skin tones and the audience would have forgiven the lower image detail. Lighting is a good thing no matter if you are shooting DV or film but it was neglected in this feature.  Even if you wanted flat uninteresting lighting for some reason thirty dollars worth of ND film on the RV windows would have kept the background from overpowering the foreground so badly that the compromise degraded the viewer's attempt to see nuances of the performance.Assuming you slide past the slow pace and extraneous shots then squeeze by the flat lighting you trip over focus and depth of field.  Repeatedly the camera is not focused on the subject or point of interest but someplace else as if the camera operator either forgot or just didn't care where he was focused at that moment.  When the buildings outside the RV are sharp and clearly defined but the actors involved in the action taking place inside the RV are out of focus something is wrong because if the point of focus does not include the main action the scene simply does not work.  Sometimes the depth of field was too great and the background intruded on the action sometimes it was too shallow and not enough was in apparent focus at a given moment to look real.  I could not accept that as an artistic choice as it plainly did not fit the story or action.  Focus point of focus and depth of field are vital to each scene.After you slide by the pace squeeze by the lighting or lack of it and trip over the focus issues you find yourself confronted with underdeveloped characters.  No they were not the most undeveloped characters in the history of cinema they were ninety percent developed but they need that final ten percent to come to life.  Alice had a life that was more boring than anything else but there was no real cumulating of events or a triggering factor worthy of her sudden and drastic action.  Maybe the supporting roles could be allowed to remain more two dimensional although I feel it is better if they too are fully realized but the protagonist should be fully developed three dimensional and each action should be based on cause reason and must be believable.  Yes being bored is bad being unhappy is to state the obvious being unhappy but there was not enough demonstrated cause for Alice's action to trigger the trip and no arc to show why she made the choices she chose during her time in the RV.  The character was somewhat too shallow.Emily Grace may be a very good actress but given only the role of a bored unmotivated semi impulsive young woman without too many smarts to play here then put into a flatly lit frequently improperly shot scene you really cannot tell if she was brilliantly defining the role as it was presented to her or if she was struggling to find the character too.Many many of the right ingredients but the wrong mix prepared wrong an edible meal but not a gourmet feast.And that's the pity. .".

Alice Emily Grace the runaway encounters an elderly couple Bill Raymond and Judith Ivey who introduce her to the world of truckstop prostitution. As she gets sucked into the elderly couple's world she discovers and we discover as an audience more and more about who Alice is and what she wants out of life.Acting The acting is pretty good actually. I didn't always find Ms. Grace's thick Boston accent to be believable but that didn't really detract from the performance. Ms. Ivey was wonderful as Sandra a Southern belle with a checkered past and bills to pay. Mr. Raymond's character Bill however was not as well defined as the other two characters but his acting was still pretty good.My only complaint is that Alice doesn't take very long to warm up to the idea of selling herself. I think her character should've taken a little bit longer to slip into that kind of world however I will admit that this does lend an emotional instability and a general uncertainty to the film.Cinematography This film is shot in a sort of naturalistic style that lends well to the themes of desperation and banality that come with this type of setting and story. I found however thatat timesthings can get a little blurry. Nonetheless the cinematography definitely suits the story.SexNudity You'd think there would be more sex and nudity in a film about prostitution but there's actually only three onscreen sex scenes and onethird of them don't involve Alice andor Sandra the first sex scene is actually in a flashback and it's somewhat brief! There is another sex scene offscreen and a fourth that is shown very briefly as in only a second or two. For those who are good at math it's also implied that Alice had sex 5 times total considering the amount of money she earned.I must give Ms. Grace and Ms. Ivey credit however. Ms. Grace played her sex scenes as well as could be expected of her character and Ms. Ivey didn't seem phased at all by the subjectmatter. I was very impressed at the subtleties of their characters as well!Editing This film has a decent runtime however it was edited in a manner that makes it feel like the film is much longer than it really is. Ordinarily I might have a problem with this however the editor certainly made it feel like a long RVroadtrip which is the way it should be.Overall I had seen this film a while back and I really didn't enjoy it like many of the F.A.Q. contributors and reviewers on this site but now that I've seen it with the eyes of an adult I can see the film for what it truly is A somewhat twisted sad sexual comingofage tale that should be seen especially by teenagers who plan on running away from home. I give it an 8 out of 10!".

The first impression one gets from watching this drama is how cheap it looks. The quality of the cinematography is about on par with a home movie. The script and direction are amateurish but the film must be given credit for keeping things interesting as it explores the seedy goings on at truck stops. Newcomer Grace does OK in the title role although the most striking thing about her is her strong New England accent. The main attraction here is Ivey who is quite good as the woman who takes Alice under her wing.".

The picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry. The plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use.This could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds.All we see are flashbacks here and there of Alice and how her home life is so bad her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter. We see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her tell your Mom to make some better food and everybody says it's your mom. Yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. I could definitely see if her Mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it. How immature! We're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman forgot her name gave her baby up when it was 9 months old. This really could've been so much more. It could've had Alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to Florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute. Or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie that is Alice a girl with a home life of probably 90 of America's population WORKING CLASS runaways to Florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.I don't see why it won an award at Sundance it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award. Also to me Alice's BostonNew England accent seemed forced. It didn't seem genuine. I should know I was born and raised in Boston but now live in Georgia. 410 Not really worth your time in my opinion.".

She tries to put an end to it but is ultimately taken captive and viciously and I do mean viciously raped. She is injected with the drug but OD's and dies only to return as a slimy mutant hermaphrodite.The sex is handled more competently than the first film but is ever bit as uncomfortable. The blood and gore are noticeably less until closer to the end when the blood monster goes on it's rampage.

Although this film isn't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment I did find BEAUTY to be a little stronger and better put together allthewayaround than VIRGIN...but then again that's not really saying much.BEAUTY starts off as a pretty rough and straightfaced exploit film. A couple of Yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion. As this nastiness is going on the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa and that they're gonna do the same to her. They then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more. She somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story. The rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker moved by the young lady's story decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lowerlevel guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the Yakuza leaders. This whole plan backfires so now Ms. VigilanteClinicWorker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got  only worse some pretty rough buttrape ensues along with the prerequisite gang rape.... She too is drugged but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim  it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON!!! no sh!t that's what really happens!!! This is when BEAUTY really takes off with some pretty f!cking insane kill scenes  including a very classy chestburstrape that looks like a cross between ALIEN and a bad porn and my favorite  a headengulfedbydemonvagina kill complete with demon vaginaslime...that has to be seen to be believed...Definitely some promising stuff going on in GUTS OF A BEAUTY but still very disjointed feeling. BEAUTY almost feels like two different films being forced together in a noncompatible way. Still I have to give the film credit  the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall. A solid 710 for another crazy Jhorror classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kazuo Komizu who hasn't made one decent film directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its Japanese release.Yes it does feature scenes of rape gore and dismemberment but so what? It has the style of a bad American porn film shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers Dirty Debutantes and is incredibly slow.It seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of antisocial acts.There is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.Just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this.

It's a shame production companies don't realize that.One reviewer here ZombieKilla81 commented that the film's near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it. I disagree. The subject matter is never the issue. The issue is how that subject matter is treated. In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.Personally I like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior with an intriguing context if the material is well directed freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing.

It has the style of a bad American porn film shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers Dirty Debutantes and is incredibly slow.It seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of antisocial acts.There is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.Just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this.

When Yoshimi's sister mysteriously disappears she decides to do some snooping about and discovers that the Ichiyama Yakuza Clan have sold her as a slave in Africa although by the time she learns this she is being gangraped by that same gang and shot up with Angel Rain a powerful drug that causes her to really dig being raped. After the lads fall asleep she manages to escape and goes straight to her psychiatrist Hiromi. Yoshimi proceeds to tell Hiromi what has happened then promptly jumps off a bridge to her death.Hiromi plots to get revenge for her patient and seduces one of the yakuza before placing him under hypnosis which compels him to kill the rest of his gang the next time they call him stupid ?!. He doesn't manage this and ends up mutilated and hacked to pieces. Then the clan track down Hiromi gangrape her then shoot her up with some Angel Rain which instead of making her horny transforms her into an insideouthermaphroditedemon that goes on a killing spree gorily butchering the yakuza that raped her and the leaders girl too.From all the wonderfully sleazy rapes to the insideoutdemon rippin' through a chicks stomach with hisher fanged cock in an obvious Alien homage and punchin' through a dudes head Entrails of a Beautiful Woman is one helluva good time! I actually dug this one far more than Entrails of a Virgin  it's a lot less disjointed faster paced and brings more gore to the table too.Director Kazuo Gaira Komizu seems a really interesting  intelligent character also  in the interview on the Synapse disc when asked what prompted him to make such a film he lurches into a long and rambling answer in which he touches on philosophers such as Descartes  Rousseau as well as topics such as the duality of man Japans lack of a focused religion and many others that you wouldn't really expect from the man who created this sex 'n' gore epic.".

It's really dull most of the time. Not even the sex scenes90 of the movie a interesting. Lame effects and bad editing makes this even worse or better!?.The girls are nice though and the ending is a hoot. Therefore I would rate it a 5 out of ten. With it's 70 min. running time it's a nice little sick movie to watch in between. On the dutch DVD there is a nice collection of original trailers of other sick japanese films like Evil Dead Trap 12 and the first one in the Guts series Guts of a Virgin.

For someone who's just coming in in the middle of one of the episodes what you have to realize is that these guys are all incompetent because they've been moved up the ladder of command because the other officers died. Also the main guys are from the laundry corps which is why they have laundry in everything. If you like Red Dwarf you'll probably like this. Slightly different t.v. concept in that all you see is the Commander's report each day.It would be better if this were explained more not just in the very beginning of the first episode but then it was pretty hard to figure out what had happened in Red Dwarf too if you hadn't been told.".

	schema:reviewBody "Luchino Visconti's Death in Venice is a masterpiece of utterly haunting beauty that will capture the imagination of anyone interested in the screen's capacity for breathtaking images. It is a poignant tragedy based on Thomas Mann's classic novella of the same name. Visconti has captured many of the essential qualities of the book and employed a superb visual style with the assistance of the great cinematographer Pasqualino DeSantis for a story which is essentially an interior one. It is about the struggle within the soul of a man Gustav von Aschenbach a composer vacationing in the Venice of 1911.In Mann's book Aschenbach was a writer but Visconti asserted that the book had been inspired by events in the life of Gustav Mahler whose music mostly the haunting adagietto of his Fifth Symphony is used as background and foreground music helping create an almost tactile mood of melancholy.Dirk Bogarde plays Aschenbach a man possessed by feelings of failure haunted by the grief he and his wife Marisa Berensen shared over the death of their daughter. He is a man on the precipice of emotional collapse who finds both redemption and destruction in the contemplation of beauty. The creation of beauty and purity is a spiritual act. God and composers are alike.In this film beauty becomes incarnate in the form of a young Polish boy vacationing at the same hotel the Hotel des Bains on the Lido. The boy's stately mother is played by Silvana Mangano. The longhaired blond boy is Tadziu aged 14 played by the Swedish Bjrn Andresen. Aschenbach is smitten by then obsessed with the boy's beauty in a manner that is more spiritual than sexual but which must also contain a good deal of sublimated sexual longing. At first he merely steals opportunities to look at the lad. They never speak. Gradually he starts to seek him out selfdestructively spurredon by the boy's coquettishness and knowing glances. Bogarde makes the character's longing as tangibly moving as it is ultimately pathetic.All this takes place in a misty Venice dense with metaphorical gloom and a mysterious plague cholera carrying death to its inhabitants. In one horrifying scene a barber remakes Aschenbach's face so that it is both a grotesque parody of youth and an ominous death mask.Visconti's skill in recreating lush period detail to paint familyalbum poses of aristocracy to make beauty seem dangerous to underline the complexity of human psychology are all in evidence here. The color photography by Pasqualino De Santis and the costumes by Piero Tosi are excellent.The ending of the film is unforgettable Gustav languishing on the beach the Polish folk song in the background the boy Tadziu in the water turning into an angelic apparition with extended hand. Overwhelming!I cannot imagine a better film ever being made of Mann's great and essential work.".

Aschenbach is smitten by then obsessed with the boy's beauty in a manner that is more spiritual than sexual but which must also contain a good deal of sublimated sexual longing. At first he merely steals opportunities to look at the lad. They never speak. Gradually he starts to seek him out selfdestructively spurredon by the boy's coquettishness and knowing glances. Bogarde makes the character's longing as tangibly moving as it is ultimately pathetic.All this takes place in a misty Venice dense with metaphorical gloom and a mysterious plague cholera carrying death to its inhabitants. In one horrifying scene a barber remakes Aschenbach's face so that it is both a grotesque parody of youth and an ominous death mask.Visconti's skill in recreating lush period detail to paint familyalbum poses of aristocracy to make beauty seem dangerous to underline the complexity of human psychology are all in evidence here. The color photography by Pasqualino De Santis and the costumes by Piero Tosi are excellent.The ending of the film is unforgettable Gustav languishing on the beach the Polish folk song in the background the boy Tadziu in the water turning into an angelic apparition with extended hand. Overwhelming!I cannot imagine a better film ever being made of Mann's great and essential work.";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Death in Venice 1971 about 15 years ago found it profoundly moving and often thought about it. Watching it again few days ago I realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema. With hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography the fine acting and above all the Mahler's music without which the movie simply could not exist.Death in Venice is a stunning Luchino Visconti's adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella about a famous composer in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably Gustav von Aschenbach loosely based on Gustav Mahler who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. His search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach Dirk Bogard follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him. The boy Tadzio belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you enchants you conquers you and makes you its prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of Tadzio spellbinding charms. He became addicted to him he fell in love with him. Was it bless or curse for him? I think both. He died from unreachable impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself. The last image Ashenbach's eyes captured was that of the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light. Nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about. If he could Ashenbach probably would've said I was able to witness one of the faces of perfection I could not bear it but I was chosen to learn that it exists here in this world and I can die in peace now because it did happen to me. Unforgettable music Gustav Mahler's haunting adagietto of his Fifth Symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie. It reflects every emotion of a main character  it sobs it longs it begs for hope and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die. I may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to Death in Venice. I dare say that Mahler's music IS its main character  it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen. It sounded triumphantly when Ashenbach returned back to Venice to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death. It sounded gloomy when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can hear so many different feelings in it  tenderness and adoration confusion and selfloathing worship and melancholy but always  LOVE that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts literally. The movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composerwriterArtist. We are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as Achenbach was by the boy's mysterious charm.".

So why should a movie be different?If you want speed then eat at McDonald's rush in the tube watch TV commercials and pay a prostitute for a 5 minute work.If you are looking for real emotions deep feelings and thoughts that will last in your memory and heart for a long time then you don't want to miss this movie.One caveat don't go watching it for the gay theme. This movie isn't about gay love if you look at it through this point of view it will let you down completely. This movie is symbolism from beginning to end it does not speak of what you see. It speaks of the struggle of the artist to reach the beauty so close always unreachable and like another reader perfectly commented so inevitably connected with death because the only perfection that a living being can ever attain is in the death. If you look at the movie from this point of view it will show to you for what it is a complete masterpiece from beginning to end.".

Adapted by Mr. Visconti himself who decided to focus on the Venice chapter only as well as to modify the occupation of the main protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach who becomes a music composer highly inspired by the composer Mahler the film was also inspired by other Thomas Mann's novel like 'Doctor Faustus' or by Marcel Proust's writing.

Perfection Beauty is a chimer pursuing it is pursuing Death as Time is passing by. At first von Aschenbach does not understand why the perfection of the form in his musical composition does not lead to the perfection of his symphony and therefore lose himself in a quest for Beauty following the young Tadzio as not only a symbol for this ultimate Beauty  Perfection but also as the Mask of Death.

The notion of Desire which leads to the understanding of the main questioning for Aschenbach Perfection is reached through hard work it is a consequence not a fact. The Young Tadzio blows away this certitude. Does von Aschenbach desire Tadzio or is he fascinated by what he represents Perfect Beauty?The challenge of Luchino Visconti was to apply a superb cinematography and a precise narrative method to a film that in nature deals with complex concepts.

Death in Venice is a lesson to avoid writing stories off as what you think it means or is about. There's much more going on beneath the surface here. If you don't relate to our lead character who looks rather lost in Venice... then you should at least appreciate the absolutely incredible cinematography and the way the music Mahler fits into it. This is one of the best uses of classical music to pictures you will see after Stanley Kubrick's work on 2001 and a Clockwork Orange. Yet this movie has a level of sophistication that you might compare more to Barry Lyndon.Okay moving away from Kubrick Visconti is his own artist reaching levels typical of the greats of Italian art. Many won't agree with me because this film might not be their cup of tea for several reasons. There's some really long scenes here with seemingly not much point to further a plot. But that's not the style of Death in Venice. It's all about mood atmosphere often all the background people and fanfare going on at the hotel all around him it reflects his state of mind and it's achieved with such precision to detail... and again here I'm going to compare to Kubrick like Jack in the Shining  that kind of psychological breakdown. But The Shining has been appreciated by the mainstream too while Death in Venice is largely unwatchable for the mainstream. This is higher art. The scenes where he comes close to the boy and the finale is just so perfectly executed that every filmmaker should watch Death in Venice as a lesson.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cinema's greatest period started in postWar Europe with Italy's NeoRealist movement.  During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces.  But in 1971 Luchino Visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work  Death in Venice which might as well be called  The Death of Europoean Cinema.  After the Sixties wound down so did the great European filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats  Coppola Scorsese  Co..  This movie absolutely feels like a grand summingup not just of Visconti's particular obsessions but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the Visconti revealed here.  He's not playing to the crowd folks  either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind.  The pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight.  Incidents  are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturmunddrang cosmos.We will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies  one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale  Thomas Mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it  Visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role  Dirk Bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony.  Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast Visconti changes the main character Aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler  geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk.  Bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies  it's a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance  a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.Cinema just doesn't get better than this.  I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalinaddicts out there who say that it's too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced.  The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns  i.e. which is the better path to aesthetic perfection  passion or discipline? and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers.  Of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway.  A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something.  And what it's mostly about is suffering  Romantic  capital R  suffering in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself Visconti knew whereof he spoke.  If for nothing else see  Death in Venice  for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending with Bogarde's jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face.  Meanwhile off in the distance young Tadzio the object of Bogarde's dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture.  The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about  love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty.  Death in Venice  is a miraculous work of art.    DVD tip  as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece  The Damned I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie.  It's ostensibly in English but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "Definitely one of the most difficult artistic powerful and discussed films ever made Death in Venice had an almost impossible mission Put blood on the veins of a story in which almost nothing happens and yet have a statement to made. If you consider that's quite difficult to read the book I abandoned after 10 pages thinking that Thomas Mann took too long to told the story only pointing views on art and similar things which I felt very close to other book of his called Tonio Kroeger a very good book you're gonna think that this cannot be filmed. Luchino Visconti tried conquered and made an important film. But I must say this film entered in my list of one the most hated movies I ever watched and it only got out of it this year after 6 years of my first view. By the time I watched I didn't care much for it I was expecting a more developed story a few more movements than it doesn't have and at the end I didn't get it all. A few years later and much more older finally I found Death in Venice an more complete film than it was years ago and thanks to the brilliant and unique performance of Dirk Bogarde I think I went further on my notions of perception of what's the story and what's the point of it. Still has some doubts about the excessive use of artistic licenses used by the screenplay and some never answered questions but still is a great movie.Bogarde plays Gustav Von Aschenbach a famous composer that travels to a Venetian seaside resort in search of repose after a period of artistic and personal stress that includes the death of his son. His heart is weak his emotional state is a completely mess and he's desperate to achieve something great with his music. To make his travel worst perhaps better depending on your view he meets a beautiful young boy named Tadzio Bjrn Andrsen good actor with a magnetic presence almost without saying any lines a teenage boy traveling with his parents. Gustav can't stop looking at Tadzio and viceversa but the meaning between the look they gave to each other is very different. Alternating with the trip to Venice Visconti shows us some flashbacks of Gustav's life while he was married the conversations about the notion of art and real beauty with his friend Alfred Mark Burns and Gustav's breakdown which led him to Venice. Pay attention very closely to the conversations between Alfred and Gustav about beauty and what a real artist is. These moments always get something to say about what Gustav is doing in Venice searching for Tadzio in all places even knowing that there's a epidemic of Cholera coming to town.I don't know if the movie follows the book exactly but I think some notions of the main character were drastically changed. For instance people always say that Gustav is a cloistered homosexual but in the film if you really pay attention Gustav is a little bit far of it he was married with a women and his supposed sexual interest in Tadzio comes from his thoughts about pure beauty something that really makes him feel complete along with his music and that's what he really sees in Tadzio. Of course there's the enigmatic and provocative look that Tadzio got in his eyes You must never smile like that. You must never smile like that at anyone. says Gustav to himself in one scene best quote of the movie. Before you start to think that he's a pedophiliac calm down and see Gustav's trying some approaches but doing noting except look and think about the boy. The book is one focus Gustav's point of view and so does the movie. If it wasn't we would be able to know what Tadzio had on his mind with such gestures. Be patient and try to watch more than once because this is one of those films when you don't get the general idea by watching one time. It grows with you and the more you see more the vision of what you think this story is it changes. Dirk Bogarde has the performance of a lifetime here and I can't imagine another actor playing Gustav. His last and moving scene is the most impacting and powerful scenes ever filmed his character sitting in the chair dying of the cholera looking for the last time Tadzio running in the beach. Very well photographed. Gustav Mahler's music are well played in a good synchronized scenes. One of the forgotten films at the Academy Awards of 1972 it was nominated for best costumes it lost for Nicholas and Alexandra. The costume designs are beautifully made and it is a key part for the film notice the first time Gustav sees Tadzio dressed in white with some blue lines on the shirt almost like if he was an angel to Gustav. What a vision! 910".

	schema:headline " A Surfeit of Overripe Beauty";
	schema:reviewBody "Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice published in 1912 was one of the earliest mainstream literary works of to deal with the subject of homoerotic desire. Gustav von Aschenbach a famous German author travels to Venice where he meets and becomes obsessed with Tadzio a beautiful teenage boy whose Polish family are staying in the same hotel. Aschenbach discovers that cholera has broken out in the city but that the authorities fearful of losing income from tourism are trying to keep the outbreak a secret. Despite this discovery Aschenbach neither leaves the city nor warns his fellowguests as either course of action would mean his being separated from Tadzio with whom he has fallen in love.Mann was himself bisexual and the story is based upon his own experiences while visiting Venice the previous year when he had also been fascinated by a handsome young Polish boy. The depiction of Aschenbach also draws upon Mann's memories of the composer Gustav Mahler whom he had known and who had died in 1910 he shares the same first name and Mann's description of his physical appearance would also have fitted Mahler. This may be the reason why for the purposes of this film Luchino Visconti made Aschenbach a composer rather than an author and made use of Mahler's music the famous Adagiettofrom hisFifth Symphony is passed off as a composition by Aschenbach. Visconti made other changes to the story to strengthen the identification with Mahler. In the book Aschenbach is a childless widower whose wife died many years earlier and who has never remarried. In the film Aschenbach's wife is shown in flashbacks and although she does not accompany him to Venice there is no indication that she has died. Mahler's wife Alma did not predecease him indeed she survived him by more than fifty years. They are however shown mourning the death of a young daughter just as Gustav and Alma Mahler lost a daughter some three years before his death. I first saw this film in the late seventies a few years after it was made when I was a teenager studying Mann's book for my German ALevels. I remember being impressed by it at the time but then I was a very impressionable young man and probably thought that any arthouse film based on a work of classical literature shot against the background of a famously beautiful city with plenty of classical music on the soundtrack must be a great classic of the cinema especially if a it deals with a controversial subject and b nothing much happens except long conversations about Art and the Meaning of Life. Since then my admiration for Mann's novella a book with a welldeserved reputation as one of the major works of twentiethcentury German literature has grown whereas my regard for Visconti's film has decreased. Mine is not the normal complaint of the loved the book hated the film brigade namely that the filmmakers have altered the story too radically. Apart from the few changes to Aschenbach's circumstances mentioned above and the omission of the opening scenes set in Munich Visconti has kept fairly faithfully to Mann's plot. There are however some works of literature which do not lend themselves to a cinematic treatment and Death in Venice seems to be one of them. There are some good things about the film. The photography of Venice is certainly beautiful reminiscent of some of Turner's paintings of the city and rivalling that in Don't Look Now another film from the early seventies set in the same location. Dirk Bogardewas normally a talented actor and the young Bjrn Andrsen with his prettierthananygirl beauty certainly looks the part as Tadzio. Andrsen who is heterosexual became something of a gay icon following this role causing him some embarrassment. The Adagietto is certainly a beautiful piece of music although I sometimes wonder if its association with this film has done Mahler's longterm reputation any good leading people to associate him with decadence and morbidity. The problem with the film is that its good looks are all on the surface. Mann's novella contains little in the way of action and not much in the way of dialogue the two main characters Aschenbach and Tadzio never exchange a single word. Its significance lies beneath the surface on the psychological and philosophical levels. On the personal level it is a characterstudy of a man who has striven to live an ascetic life governed by discipline restraint and reason but who finds his world view shattered by the sudden realisation of his own powerful sexual desires for a boy. On the philosophical level it is an examination of two contrasting attitudes to life the Apollonian life of reason and the Dionysian life of passion a concept derived from Mann's study of the philosopher Nietzsche. Visconti who was an intelligent man doubtless understood the complexities of Mann's work but it is these very complexities which make it difficult to adapt for the screen. The contrast between Apollonianism and Dionysianism is not a naturally cinematic subject and the complicated inner life of an intellectual writer or musician unaccompanied by some dramatic outward action is equally difficult to dramatise. Visconti is never able to find a substitute for Mann's ideas. The lengthy debates between Aschenbach and a fellowcomposer about musical aesthetics do not add much interest they simply help to make a lengthy and tedious film even more so. The film may be beautiful but it is also dull and longwinded and in such a context its beauty becomes something excessively rich and cloying. In Mann's story Aschenbach dies after eating an overripe strawberry and this becomes an appropriate image for an overblown film in which Dirk Bogarde appears to die of a surfeit of overripe beauty. Too much Venice and too much Mahler can be bad for your health. 510".

They seem to acknowledge each other's presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze.Each viewer will have his own interpretation.  The composer has lost a child of his own.  Is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved?  Is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare?  Could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece?  Who knows?From beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th Century Venice.  The elegance of the ladies the deck chairs on the sand the children frolicking in their necktoknee bathing costumes the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in 1971 when I was very young. All I recall is a very sad story about an artist who was very ill when visiting Venice where he spent time furtively seeking out a boy he was attracted to. It was sad and depressing and a bit creepy. I watched it again 45 years later on TCM and it seemed to be a much more powerful statement about a tragic life and death that reaches its climax in Venice during a sweltering summer in 1911 when the city is overtaken by a cholera epidemic. The main role is played by Dirk Bogarde a British actor who is making the best of his last days longing for a love he can never achieve.The background music by Mahler is very sombre and fits the tragic ending. The city is being scrubbed to stop the spread of disease and no one wants to frighten away the tourists who are the city's economic lifeblood. Again the symbolic conflict between dreams and reality. The acting is superb. The period costumes are stunning. The photography is powerful and sweeping with seas sunsets and the skyline of Venice. This movie is not entertainment but a work of art. I couldn't take more than one of these works at a time but it is worth seeing as a unique achievement.".

	schema:reviewBody "So many good reviews. The film is excellent the book also. It is mostly a tragic gay love infatuation story. The people who go into beautyasceticsdeath perfection of art on and on and the movie does present the story this way are missing the real story.The real story comes out better in the book  a late middle aged man Dirk Bogarde is too young and handsome for the role becomes infatuated with a 15 year old boy. Possibly the first such awakening of his homosexual idin 1913 it was still punishable with prison.In Mann's book Aschenbach was an author it is widely believed Mann had Gustav Mahler in mind. In any case Aschenbach has had lots of losses in life and recent failures in his career and is suffering from a near mental breakdown. Now comes the ultimate degradation of his persona as he becomes infatuated with Tadzio. Mann was no stranger to psychoanalysis so there was clearly a carnal interest as well.The movie miscasts TadzioBjorn Andreson is too lithesome and feminine and frankly not sexy enough for the role. A dramatically better movie would have cast him bettereverything would be much more understandable then. Most of all he needed to be much more masculine.So....Aschenbach sinks lower and lowerdyeing his hair and using make up to attract the boy. The movie is pretty clear about the sexual nature of all thisbut has lots of flash backs feeding this cover up that it was all about art and ascetics beauty death blah blah blah. While it was mostly hormones.The costumes are wonderful...everything really well done...I could spend hours talking about symbolism e.g. Esmeralda the boat to Venice also the name of Aschenbach's first prostitute sexual adventure... That would be an effort and bore everybody. These things you appreciate as the movie unfolds and add depth and intelligence to the film no need to enumerate them plus there are too many to count. The film is a jewel that way.Read the novella and buy Mahler's 5th. But you know the film is uniquely good as well. This is rare a movie as good or better than the book.RECOMMEND HIGHLY".

	schema:reviewBody "A Nobel Laureate the German novelist Thomas Mann was always concerned about the relationship between the artist and the society he lived in. He was right to be worried. He wound up in Los Angeles. Visconti's film and Mann's novel that it was based on are kind of autobiographical. It's the story of a German professor played by Dirk Bogarde who is a composer author in the novel with composer's block. It's the turn of the century and like the 1800s he's played out. His friends advise him to take a trip and find some peace and quiet near the beach in Venice  the one in Italy not California. The hotel doesn't turn out to be so quiet. There is for instance a sizable Polish family with half a dozen kids chattering away in the lounge and dining room. At first it seems to annoy Bogarde but then he notices a blond boy in his early teens and the kid is stunningly beautiful. Bogarde is attracted to him because an artist is always interested in innocent purity in whatever form it takes. But his interest turns into something more than a distant admiration and he follows Tadzio around Venice never speaking to him let alone touching him. Finally sweating and ill Bogarde has the hotel's barber give him a make over  a hair cut and dye make up and lip rouge restoring what nature has taken away. A caricature of himself Bogarde continues to follow Tadzio around while a cholera epidemic sweeps Venice and nails Bogarde himself who is captured by the sureenwinding arms of coolenfolding Death while reaching out to the boy on the nowempty strand. The cholera doesn't come out of nowhere there have been portents  an early warning against eating fresh fruit a man collapsing in a railway station but nobody having to rush off to the toilet. When James Joyce is handing out gifts in Finnegans Wake he included a collera morbous for Mann in the Cloack as an homage an enigmatic sequin reflecting how internationally famous Death in Venice had become. It's a curious film with all sorts of correspondences. Mann's story was almost autobiographical. He himself was bisexual and Tadzio is closely based on a real Polish boy he met in Venice. Mann gave his main character Aschenbach the features of the composer Gustav Mahler a good friend whose musical excerpts form the only underscore for the movie. So Mahler is the source of Bogarde's mustache and pincenez.Visconti has said that the movie was a disaster at its first showing but a producer asked him enthusiastically who had written the melancholy score. Gustav Mahler. Great! Can we get him? Bogarde himself was bisexual. And Tadzio despite his being a male is groomed like a pure young girl throughout all eye shadow and rosy lips. The other boys have the short hair cuts of the period but Tadzio has a Farrah Fawcett do so he looks like a figure that might be glimpsed in a Halloween parade in Polk Gulch. Tadzio isn't unaware of Bogarde's interest. From the moment they first see one another in the hotel lounge coy Tadzio returns Bogarde's rapt gaze with a secret smile. He flirts ostentatiously with the older man. He's later seen kissing a friend. What the hell is up? Have we run out of heterosexuals? Sometimes I think I'm the only straight man left in the universe except for wearing pantyhose. They keep out the chill and aren't as uncomfortable as you might think.Anyway Bogarde makes a perfect Aschenbach troubled tragic and ridiculous. He was really a fine actor. Tadzio is a pretty girl. We don't really see much of anyone else. Marisa Berenson isn't on screen nearly enough. We could have used more of her statuesque grace and if she'd shed her hampering outer garments the movie would have been ennobled. Wardrobe is superb. Every woman's bonnet has a wide brim and is topped with feathers bouquets amusebouches and other stuff that looks like a mobile dropped from the ceiling of an art museum. Venice a city of gondolas and dreams looks surprisingly cool gray and hazy. I suppose it's disappointing because Venice is in Italy which is supposed to be sunny in romantic stories. If it had been a few miles away in Yugoslavia the absence of sunshine would have been expected.".

The forbidden fruit of sorts but more a sign of him surrendering life itself.In Visconti's film he also eats strawberries but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach. The chase in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It works too but lacks some subtlety indeed and also the multilayered symbolism giving food for thought.But that's all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries faces and constellations and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest  the last gesture of Tadzio standing in the water being the equally sublime and mysterious finale.".

	schema:reviewBody "In DIV Visconti overstates the Mahlerishness of Aschenbach to the point of confusion and worse does the same to the 'boyogler' interpretation of Aschenbach to the point of insult. The result ends up feeling like an horrific parody  or even fictional bio  of the great composer  conductor.Mann upon whose work the film is apparently based much admired Mahler and learning of his death gave Aschenbach Mahler's first name and apparently his appearance  but unlike Visconti Mann cast him as a writer not a composer. Mann's written work was already mostly finalised when these 'honours' were bestowed at any rate. But more importantly Mann is widely thought to have drawn from a number of different sources for his main character different traits from different people and to specific ends. In short the clumsiness of the film's choice of visuals seems to lecherise Mahler himself through a 'little boy obsessed' Aschenbach and insinuate something of Mahler himself which has no real basis. The overplayed likeness left the feeling that what was going on was really nothing to do with the novella but instead a 'secret revealed' about Mahler. And so the story lost all philosophical meaning immediately and became something more like slander or gossip leaving the perhaps less studied Mahlerappreciating audience to be misled into supposing all sorts of things  even trying to extrapolate something of the historical relationship between Mahler and Schonberg as if Mahler's helping of Schonberg required any more motivation than memories of his aspiring composer  musician younger brother Otto!But aside from this terrific complaint which I might at least be able to unreasonably! write off to misinterpretation the film's slow broody stillness  and labored sincerity  cannot reach a shadow of the way to the effortlessly profound music which it misappropriated. Way back in the day July 19 1971 Alan Rich did a great review of this movie in the New York Magazine. ...the insult to Mahler doesn't like in any imputation about homosexuality not even in the way this element is luridly underlined in the movie. It lies rather in the cheap uncomprehending nigglenaggle about the arts that Visconti puts into the mouths of AschenbachMahler and Alfred Schonberg...It's easy enough to find on googlebooks. That review pretty much says it all  other than one more comment which desperately need to be made and that being that the film's lack of subtlety pushed it Aschenbach firmly into 'little boy ogler' territory which was simply creepy but which also obliterated much of the intelligent introspection and 'longing for the lost days of youth' that the film might have otherwise evoked. Someone likes it I guess. Not me. Tacky. Slow. Selfserious. Overblown. Selfimportant. Failed art house bordering on mockumentry bordering on defamation.".

But more importantly Mann is widely thought to have drawn from a number of different sources for his main character different traits from different people and to specific ends. In short the clumsiness of the film's choice of visuals seems to lecherise Mahler himself through a 'little boy obsessed' Aschenbach and insinuate something of Mahler himself which has no real basis. The overplayed likeness left the feeling that what was going on was really nothing to do with the novella but instead a 'secret revealed' about Mahler. And so the story lost all philosophical meaning immediately and became something more like slander or gossip leaving the perhaps less studied Mahlerappreciating audience to be misled into supposing all sorts of things  even trying to extrapolate something of the historical relationship between Mahler and Schonberg as if Mahler's helping of Schonberg required any more motivation than memories of his aspiring composer  musician younger brother Otto!But aside from this terrific complaint which I might at least be able to unreasonably! write off to misinterpretation the film's slow broody stillness  and labored sincerity  cannot reach a shadow of the way to the effortlessly profound music which it misappropriated. Way back in the day July 19 1971 Alan Rich did a great review of this movie in the New York Magazine. ...the insult to Mahler doesn't like in any imputation about homosexuality not even in the way this element is luridly underlined in the movie. It lies rather in the cheap uncomprehending nigglenaggle about the arts that Visconti puts into the mouths of AschenbachMahler and Alfred Schonberg...It's easy enough to find on googlebooks. That review pretty much says it all  other than one more comment which desperately need to be made and that being that the film's lack of subtlety pushed it Aschenbach firmly into 'little boy ogler' territory which was simply creepy but which also obliterated much of the intelligent introspection and 'longing for the lost days of youth' that the film might have otherwise evoked. Someone likes it I guess. Not me. Tacky. Slow. Selfserious. Overblown. Selfimportant. Failed art house bordering on mockumentry bordering on defamation.";

I admit from a cinematography point of view some of the shots were great in fact the opening scene was beautiful but this didn't make up at all for the plot or lack of it and the way the rest of it was set up. Just because something is artistic does not make it good. I got a real sense from this film that it was artistic for the sake of it and that those who actually like it like it to show off how arty they are. It was badly written slow and incredibly uncomfortable to watch. Forgive me if a plot that revolves around an Edwardian Pedophile doesn't get me going. For the love of God if I had to watch one more long pan in shot of that boy in his swimming trunks I swear I would die. It was so uncomfortable as you zoomed in on his face or costume. Through the whole thing I felt like I was the pedophile for watching this man with this really disturbing obsession with the little boy. Nothing happens in the entire film. All that happens is you follow Bogarde's character around while he's on holiday and view him stalking this child. Following him around sitting on the beach for a bit. Watching him while he sits and reads his newspapers while occasionally cutting to a flashback of before the holiday and Bogarde's character's last concert which wasn't received very well. Then his mate harking on about what beauty is for no apparent reason and having an incredibly pretentious rant about what does beauty mean. I didn't identify with any of the characters what so ever there was absolutely nothing compelling in the plot it didn't seem that the film had anything to say at all as it aimlessly wandered about like a dog sniffing at a hedgerow trying to find a scent.It was unbelievably boring i had nearly slit my wrists through despair and desperation by the end. People will accuse me of being of the generation that just loves things to be quick and guns and car chases are all that I care about. Not so I love a good film that has a good plot and I really love attention to detail and getting lost in a film. But the fact of the matter is this film had none of those things bad plot bad dialogue and unidentifiable characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure where to start with this. In short it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the novella I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie. The movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella. For one I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book Tadzio is fourteen but he is described as pure ideal innocent whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease. He is an accomplice to Aschenbach he always looks back at him almost provokingly. In the book it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the boy. As for Aschenbach I imagined something closer to the professorturnedclown in The Blue Angel based on a story by Thomas Mann's brother Heinrich than this fortyyear old with hardly any gray hair. In all fairness I do think that Dirk Bogarde did a good job but either someone else should have done that or he should have made to look older at the beginning. I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the Apollonian and Dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on Aschenbach's obsession of Tadzio and does not justify it. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used because ultimately he did inspire Mann to write his story. I'm not sure turning Aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move. Or the creation of Alfred who I don't remember in the book.And one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips. I was wondering if it was dubbed because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that each Italian movie I have watched has this problem. It just bothers me because these directors Fellini is the other person I'm thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in Italian cinema and here are their characters laughing without sound then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces I'm thinking of the scenes when Aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing. This scene couldshould have been the strongest but it was annoying instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arachnia isn't that bad of a cheesy creature feature.SPOILERSTraveling to Arizona to examine a new fossil recently unearthed pilot Sean Pachowski Rob Monkiewicz with Professor Mugford David Bruce and his assistants Chandra Weaver Irene Joseph Trina Bevin McGraw Kelly Alexxus Young and Deke Dan Merriman witness a meteor shower flying closeby and a crashing one forces their plane down. Regrouping and attempting to find shelter they come across an abandoned house in the middle of the desert. The owner of the house Moses Cobb James Aspden thinks them trespassers until they prove otherwise and returning to his house he shows them a gigantic spider that he claims was once alive. When giant spiders show up and attack the farm they devise a plan to help survive against the everincreasing number of spiders.The Good News There is a lot of good here most of it the campy nature of the film. Few films today are willing to pay homage to the creature features of the early 50s opting instead to concentrate on the 70s films and leave the earlier ones alone . It's refreshing when one comes along to have the spirit of those films quite competently. From the easily explained and rendered plot to the blatant borrowing of other films to carry it's storyline the exploitative elements of nudity and violence as well as the welltimed comic relief this just screams giant campfest. The brief moments of greatness do come across as being quite nice. One of the best is the moment where a character runs from the crashed plane and nose dives at the point where the clich would have the thing explode only for nothing to happen. A quite inspired moment that left a welldeserved chuckle afterwards. The bathtub scene and in general anything with the two women were nice to watch even though one of them was a total copout. The ending is the real highlight where the film shifts gears and becomes the allout camp classic that it was destined to be but wasn't with loads of action a couple of witty moments and some nice moments strung together. It's the real highlight of the film.The Bad News As much as their was to like in the movie there was also a couple of things hurting it. First off the pacing is a big mess. The opening gets things off to a flying start but then it seriously drags things out until the very end only sporadically showing signs of life. That means the middle section will really test the most discriminating viewer's patience even before they're rewarded with a grand conclusion. The spiders come into the movie much too late and their low kill total does them no favors. Speaking about the spiders they are so cheesily rendered and depicted that hardly anyone would be scared of these creatures. They are just beyond looking bad and instead are laughable. It's hard to believe what would be more realistic in this situation cheap CGI or what was presented here. They were that bad. They invoke the tone they wanted quite admirably but come nowhere close to being believable.The Final Verdict While not the best giant spider flick there's some others that aren't as good. Some pacing issues aside this could've been a great little find. It has the potential the ingredients and the sense of fun but it doesn't quite make it there. Only for those hardcore fans of the genre or those in desperate need of a new flick for their annual Friday Night MST party with friends.Rated R Violence Nudity and Language".

He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale. And anyway I LOVE stop motion monsters which compared to CGI critters in bigger budgeted movies just seem to be that much fun to watch.".

Unfortunately a meteor shower forces the plane to crash in the middle of nowhere the pilot Sean Rob Monkiewicz manages to crash land the plane without any fatalities  not even a cut bruise or scratch on anyone come to think of it  the six survivors look for help. They come across an old farmhouse  decide to pitch up there for the night however what they don't know is that the meteor shower has unleashed some huge mutant spider like creatures from under the ground who are on the look out for potential food  a host that they can lay their eggs into...Written  directed by Brett Piper who also credited with the special effects this is another low budget horror flick which is getting universally trashed here on the IMDb by people whom I assume are looking for Transformers 2007 style special effects  a hundred million dollar budget if that sounds like you then avoid Arachnia at all costs but if you appreciate a nice little homage to the giant bug flicks of the 50's  60's then this might interest you. The light hearted script by Piper doesn't take itself too seriously  starts off pretty well then it seems to get bogged down with not much happening for a large chunk of running time before the giant spider things attack  the fun kicks in. The character's are cheesy clichs but I felt the film had fun with them  were quite likable I liked Chandra the obligatory 'strong' female the airheaded lesbian twins were amusing as one wanted to get undressed  take a bath even in the situation they found themselves in even though they had no bubblebath soap etc... the annoying geek is the first to die like the makers knew he'd be the one the audience wanted to see die first the scheming selfish character who thinks of noone but themselves is here  the hero feels like Ash from the Evil Dead films complete with chainsaw  the actor's physical appearance to Bruce Campbell who played Ash in the Evil Dead films. I also thought some of the dialogue was amusing while drinking some alcohol Sean says 'I haven't tasted anything like that since I was in a Bangkok whorehouse' to which Chandra replies 'I take it you mean a beverage'! There were one or two surprises as well there is a scene when Sean tries to call for help on a mobile  tells the police that giant creatures are attacking them at which point the entire audience is probably shouting out lie or something  then Chandra picks the phone up  does just that just to annoy anyone watching who has already made their minds up everyone in the film is stupid! Unfortunately it's not all good news the film is a bit slow at times some of it is rather stupid there's a serious lack of gore  to many people survive in fact the giant spider things only kill three people which just isn't enough I'm afraid.Director Piper does alright he was obviously working on a low budget  he or maybe someone else who knows made the decision to use stopmotion animation rather than CGI computer effects. I see by the comments on the IMDb that a lot of viewers don't like stopmotion which is fine but I think it ties in with the 50's  60's giant creature features very well  I'm one of those people who would rather see a bad stopmotion effect rather than a bad CGI one it's take your pick really because I doubt Arachnia would have had the money to create good looking CGI effects anyway so either way the effects were always going to end up cheap looking. There's no gore here someone is ripped in half seen from a distance  some baby spider things burst from someones chest which reminds me that it seems to pay homage to various other horror flicks like the chestburster from Alien 1979 while people stranded in a farmhouse having to board it up reminded me of The Night of the Living Dead 1968. For some reason sometimes the pointofview shots from the spider things is tinted red other times it's tinted red but the picture is split up into several images while at other times the POV shots are simply normal film like the makers just randomly added the spider eye sight effects to some shots  not other's. I also have to mention the opening credit sequence the credits are played over a never ending multi coloured tunnel effect that looks remarkably like the opening title sequence of Doctor Who from the Tom Baker era!Technically the film is OK sure most will think the special effects are terrible but while I agree they generally are I always felt the makers at least tried. Apparently shot in Vermont. I actually quite liked the acting here the two leads were pretty good actually.Arachnia is a fun little homage to the giant bug flicks from the 50's  60's unfortunately filmmaking has progressed a lot since that period  I suppose Arachnia is a good example as to why. I liked a lot of it but at the same time I disliked a lot of it if you know what I mean. Not to be confused with the similarly titled Arachnid 2001 or Spielberg's Arachnophobia 1990.".

I mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget. So what does one expect? Hitchcock?I felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously. THe movie The Oscar comes to mind most of Sylvester Stallone's movies. THe two leads were not Hepburn and Tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie. The woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played anal retentive professor was no Clifton Webb but he did a god job. And the Bimbo's for lack of a better were played by two competent actors. I laughed at the 50 cent special effects. But that was part of the charm of the movie. It played like a hybrid Tremors meets Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the movie is just like all Giant Bug movies of the 50's. A Meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have Giant Ants Lobsters rocks or Lizards terrorizing the locals. A meteor was the cause of the problems this time. I was was very entertained. I didn't expect much and I go a lot more then I bargained for.".

I may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out? I think they were probably right!

I think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie neither of which had any real purpose other than to bare certain parts of their anatomy for the cameras. This movie should be categorized as comedy not horror as the villains of the movie spiders were stop motion animated and not believable in the least.

	schema:reviewBody "The title makes it sound like a cheesy Bmovie and that's exactly what ARACHNIA is a nobudget giant spider flick from the guy who brought us A NYMPHOID BARBARIAN IN DINOSAUR HELL. Thankfully this is a lot better film better paced and more fun although the budget is as equally low as in that film.The plot is predictable and routine from the outset a bunch of Bmovie types are in a plane crash fun models and then take refuge in a rundown farmhouse. The film manages to mix in various bits from lots of different genre movies and admittedly it is fun playing spot the ripoff. We get the egghatching scene from ALIENS complete with a queen spider  huh? the chainsaw action from EVIL DEAD II and the besieged farmhouse scenario from NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD plus lots of other bits and pieces along the way.The director goes all out for sleaze with a onedimensional female character that strips off for a gratuitous bath scene and a ridiculous lesbian interlude that just serves to provide titillation for the male viewer. Acting is pretty bad with the best role going to David Bunce as a despicable college professor he's suitably slimy and weedy in the part. The female characters are bimbos the actresses poor but not as bad as Rob Monkiewicz who thinks he's Bruce Campbell! Instead he looks like Richard Bacon the former Blue Peter presenter and he simply doesn't cut it as the heroic lead.The script acknowledges that the film is a cheesy Bmovie through and through so there's plenty of humour along the way. Some of it works a lot of it falls flat but for what it's worth I enjoyed the movie. The giant spiders are animated through stopmotion as opposed to CGI and while the animator is no Harryhausen the special effects are surprisingly decent! The standout is when two spiders have a tugofwar with a human corpse tearing all the limbs off in the process. Lots of people are critical of the jerky fakeness of stopmotion but I know I'll always enjoy seeing it on screen if I had to choose between the spiders here and the ones in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS I'd pick this movie every single time. Sadly the bloodshed in the film is minimal which is surprising considering the level of nudity on display.In the end ARACHNIA succeeds because it offers up what Bmovie fans are looking for. There's a guy battling a giant spider on a roof wielding a chainsaw there are Molotov cocktails galore lots of exploding spiders and an endreel appearance by the air force who kick ass. My favourite scene though is the kicker where a cocooned guy's chest explodes and minispiders dartout a virtual rerun of a similar moment in ALIENS. You've just gotta love the fact that the filmmakers had the audacity to shoot this scene!".

	schema:reviewBody "I usually try not to spoiler in this case I shall do so wholeheartedly. Don't read on if it bothers you.First I must comment on The Da Vinci Code phenomenon. Angels And Demonsthe movie is a vague sequel albeit the book precedes the Da Vinci book. While Da Vinci was hardly deathless prose it told an interesting unusual story at breakneck pace in an easytofollow manner. It was pacey and entertaining. It sold shedloads and deservedly so. The movie adaptation was faithful but lost the novel's immediacy it still had broad appeal and did well at the box office hence this sequel.So to Angels And Demons where I haven't read the book. In the run up to the Cardinals' voting in Conclave for a new Pope four of them are kidnapped. Despite reservations about Robert Langdon Tom Hanks hardly proCatholicism in Da Vinci the Vatican consults him. He figures out that this is the work of the Illuminati a secret group dating back to the Renaissance who seek revenge for the Vatican wiping out many of them in the 16th century for their proscience antiCatholic views. Together with a lady scientist whose research generated an antimatter bomb stolen by the Illuminati intended to wipe the Vatican off the map Langdon engages in a clueladen race against time looking for the missing cardinals and the bomb. He is helped by Ewan MacGregor's Camerlengo Patrick McKenna Camerlengo is acting Pope until the Conclave comes up with a new one  a functional rather than authoritarian position and hindered by Stellan Skarsgard's head of Vatican police. Armin MuellerStahl is a Cardinal who may have his own agenda. There is further jeopardy from the fact that the Illuminati have probably infiltrated the Vatican at the highest level.So far so notveryspoilery. Much action racing around convoluted clues etc. key factors which made Da Vinci so successful albeit with a noticeably less credible plot. We even have have a couple of likely suspects  Starsgard's unhelpful police chief and MuellerStahl's cagey Cardinal.Now for the rest of the plot. Three Cardinals are killed but the fourth is saved. The bomb is recovered. However there is insufficient time for it to be defused. McKenna takes it up in a news helicopter and bails out. The bomb detonates the shock wave causes relatively little damage but McKenna's gesture in saving the Vatican and thousands of lives means he is certain to be voted in as Pope by popular acclaim. Of course he turns out to be the villain having murdered the old Pope and arranged the whole thing. Thank you Robert Langdon the end.This pleased me in one respect  while the film still had you believing that the Illuminati existed I wondered why they would leave a series of clues pointing to where the bomb was? Of course as it was all McKenna's masterplan he wanted the bomb found.But then I started thinking about this masterplan. Let me list the parts of it McKenna never does the standard explanatory monologue you're left to figure it out yourself 1. Steal antimatter 2. Make antimatter bomb 3. Poison Pope 4. Recruit professional killer to kidnap and kill Cardinals 5. Create trail based on incredibly complex clues from poem in priceless 16th century book in Vatican archive6. Rely on Langdon solving clues in time 7. Make car bomb to blow up professional killer 8. Rely on helicopter being nearby once bomb is recovered 9. Rely on there being sufficient time to get helicopter fly it high enough to avoid total destruction despite nobody having the slightest idea exactly what effects of antimatter bomb might be bail out get to ground safely 10. Rely on hero factor being sufficient to result in being elected as Pope.The rationale I think was that as Pope he could prevent the Catholic Church living happily with science.As a plan I thought that this was risibly implausible. I happily suspend disbelief and willingly did so while the hunt was on but the revelation of who the baddie was and therefore what his plan must have been was to be frank utterly idiotic  so idiotic in fact that it devalued the rest of the film.There was some other stuff which made me scoff with derisionMcKenna is branded on the chest a large glowing brand maybe 20 cm square is applied forcefully to his chest for upwards of 5 seconds following which it is dropped to the floor where is sets the carpet smouldering. Yet this doesn't seem to phase him in the slightest  he races through tunnels and flies helicopters with nary a whimper he does hold it as if it's a bit tender later on though.Earlier in the film McKenna tells a story about his military service which ends with him explaining that's where he learned to fly helicopters. It would have been a good deal less clumsy if he had simply whipped out a sign and hung it round his neck reading I'm going to be flying a helicopter later in this movie. Langdon rewinds the security video stored on the police chief's computer. The computer makes the noise of an audio tape being rewound across the replay heads! My favourite bit was when the girl scientist tears a page out of a priceless 16th century book the page which carries the allimportant clues to finding the Cardinals and the bomb in the form of a poem in English printed in watermarks in the paper! not because it was an inherently good bit but because I was immensely tickled at the gasp of horror coming from a lady in the audience.This film was mistitled. It should have been called Angels Demons And Complete And Utter Bllcks.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK everyone. Here's how it goes. Robert Langdon is smart. He knows history and symbols. There is a threat against the Vatican. OK? Following me so far? The threat is from the Illuminati an organization of scientists vowing revenge on the Catholic Church. Alright? They've kidnapped four cardinals who are supposed to be in the running for Pope. Get it? OK and the sexy scientist Vittoria Vetra is the expert who knows how to manage the bomb they're threatening the Vatican with. Yeah OK as long as you understand we can get on with the movie. But we'll remind you of all of this in about 10 minutes in case you forget. This may as well have been flashing on the screen for the entirety of Angels  Demons. On the surface this doesn't seem like the kind of film that would attract brain dead idiots but it seems that writers David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman didn't want to take the chance that some mentally challenged 11 year old might get lost in the story. This is my biggest qualm with Angels  Demons an already mediocre film dragged down to fiery depths of cinematic hell by a completely incompetent script. OK maybe that's a little extreme but I couldn't pass up the chance to say fiery depths of cinematic hell now could I? One example of the spoonfeeding nature of the script is the power outage idea. A camera has a live video feed of the bomb and it's somewhere inside the Vatican. Security decides to turn off select power grids bits at a time so that they could see where to check for the bomb should the camera go dark. This seems easy enough to remember right? Well turns out it isn't. Every time the characters are in a room and the lights go out some side character must remind everyone that security is turning off power at random. They really should have abandoned all hope of a fourwalled narrative early on and had Tom Hanks turn to the camera every now and then and say Alright so let me get you up to speed here... And Robert Langdon. What a great character. Not only does he know everything that could possibly help him in his quest to rescue the four cardinals and stop the terrorist but he talks about nothing else! I could count on one hand the amount of lines Tom Hanks reads that isn't a historical fact about Italy the Illuminati the Catholic Church or something along the lines of It should be here! We have to go there! They must be planning to... or other cut and paste exclamations. But it's a good thing that the good guy Camerlengo Patrick McKenna is there for guidance. Man he's such a hero. A real saint. The perfect man for the job. Or is he? SHOCK! TWIST! Run for the hills because the suspiciouslooking good guy who fits into the plot in nearly no significant way other than to be revealed to secretly have been the mastermind behind the whole plot is...the mastermind behind the whole plot! EEEEKK! But that means that the even more suspicious looking guy who everyone suspects is secretly the villain is...not secretly the villain! Gosh if only they had given us a chance to figure it out... Other minor things. Some good some bad. Good they got rid of what would have been a ridiculously contrived romantic subplot. The explosion at the end looked pretty. The bad whose bright idea pardon the pun was it to have the light shine into the camera and nearly blind the audience whenever a character is running around with a flashlight? Why is it that two people of Italian origin in Italy alone speak English to each other sometimes but Italian other times? I wouldn't mind if they spoke English the entire time but the flipflopping drove me crazy! Don't even get me started on the hilariously obvious and incredibly poorly written so poorly written it stood out amongst the rest of the poorly written film speeches about faith vs science. Yeesh. Really what a mediocre film. Pretty blandly directed awful writing and a phonedin performance by Tom Hanks. Throw in an incredibly suspenseful will Robert Langdon die in the middle of the movie?! scene a useless female sidekick and no real reason to care what happens to anyone and you can top off what should have been a huge disappointment but really was just what most of us had expected. Oh well. They can't all be gems.".

From scene 3 on the movie is a 'chasemovie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No storyline no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.You would think that with a running time of about 140 minutes a movie is able to bring more. Much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is difficult to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel Angels and Demons could misfire as badly as this film version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. Due to the spoilers please do no read on unless you have already seen the film.1 In the film there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse still there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors. 2 The breathtaking locations in Rome as described in the novel were not realized visually in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. But there are superior photographed depictions of Rome on The History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City was presented in eternal stock film footage. The great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the Ecstasy of St. Teresa was only momentarily glimpsed and the West Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not visible at all.3 The most tasteless choice made by the filmmaker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope.4 One of the most colorful and important characters of the novel Maximilian Kohler Director of CERN was cut out of the screenplay.5 There were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise.6 There were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. This technique worked in The Godfather films but Ron Howard is no Gordon Willis.7 The College of Cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a Southern drawl. This dude would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel.8 The crucial relationship of the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church.9 In the novel the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. 10 As a whole the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.In the novel Langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the Tiber River. In Ron Howard's film it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels  Demons which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flatout action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful onlocation scenes save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with antimatter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican the Illuminati and the great feud between the two but here she's neither love interest nor his intellectual equal.Ewan McGregor on the other hand chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well Tom Hanks.The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago I thought that should a film be made of it it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly that's what this Ron Howard film did with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some discussion time over a cup of tea this one moved things along so quickly it's like reading the book all over again page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.Catholic reviewers have called Angels  Demons harmless because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds but the walk along the Path of Illumination now that's almost free.Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive but for those who haven't this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks and characters such as Galileo Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot but much left unsaid. Satisfying popcorn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular.".

	schema:reviewBody "The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded a few seconds later he is giving orders and a few minutes later he is running literally around in charge of operations  in real life he would be in shock. And as usual in thrillers the assassin doesn't kill the heroes giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens ha ha and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting You are going to be blown up. Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican  an achievement because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's  and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.".

There were considerable differences from the book much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film in spite of the changes from the book. It was still enjoyable filled with action and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the movie symbols are found and figured out quickly without any interest for the viewer. They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol which was the most interesting and creative one in the book was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. In my opinion that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols which is what the Langdon character is all about. Overall this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book and fails at the attempt to be an action movie  thriller. 4 out of 10".

However there is no chance that I will ever want to watch Angles and Demons ever again.The film barely resembles the book in fact only the general premise of the story is there.From the very start of the film I was disappointed in the book Robert Langdon receives a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler Director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father can't remember the name and then requests Langdon to come using the super fast plane... In the book the only people who knew about this technology that the Father and Daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... In the film however there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.Leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie... it changed everything that happened from then on when the Camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room it should have been Maximilian Kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti in the film it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot... err I think I got this right but I was bored and can't really remember the events in the film...There was no love interest between Vittoria and Robert and in the book she wasn't at CERN when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. In the book all four of the preferratti were killed but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the Assassin at the Church of the Illuminati not blown up like he was in the film by the Camerlingo. The bit where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there saved by his Mickey mouse watch alarm. OK in the book we are led to believe that Langdon bailed out of the helicopter fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched but it was important in the film because he had to race back with the film... There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved this was also important in getting to know the character of Vittoria.In all one of the worse films I have seen I would have left early but my brain went numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of Ron Howards finest in fact how he will get work again is beyond me!!! I want my money back!!!".

The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons the plot was straightforward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.Cardinal Strauss Armin MuellerStahl was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna Ewan McGregor you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's familiar moreso than a necessary partner.The plot is as such one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past there have been quite a few has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how offguard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrapup and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady coverup group of sadists Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.".

Dedicated Famous Five fans will miss Timmy the dog as he demanded to be written out of the script after controversially describing the plot as moronic. Nevertheless this movie is everything we've come to expect from one of our best loved children's authors and is a mustsee for nine year olds everywhere.";

To me though it did look very like Da Vinci Code 2 not unnaturally given that most of the original component parts were there again  obviously Brown as writer Howard as director Hanks as star Zimmer as resident composer etc etc.I must admit though that it came across to me as a preposterous empty only occasionally flashy thriller. The hope of the writer no doubt was that by basing the sources on ancient lore and setting the action in modern day locations this heft would give credence to the events on the screen but it's all too unbelievable for words.Hanks' character it seems has the uncanny ability to decipher ultracomplicated arcane clues in minutes he has one hour between the scheduled executions of popeaspiring cardinals which are the prelude to the bigbang antimatter cataclysm set for midnight only to race around a darkened and crowded Rome to unerringly arrive just after the deed has already been done! He does however divine enough to eventually save the last of the scheduled victims and of course be on hand to save Vatican City from destruction at which point we learn it wasn't about the mysterious Illuminati Group's 400yearsinthemaking grand revenge against The Vatican but about papal legate Ewan McGregor's fiendish plot to assume the papacy himself...I'm aware of the novel's massive popularity which will propel the film to worldwide success no doubt like The Da Vinci Code before it but really the plot holes here are bigger than the Grand Canyon. Like when the Italian police with Hanks and female sidekick scientist in tow run into a seeming deadend in one of the chosen churches promptly abandon our wouldbe Holmes and Watson who then naturally discover a secret passage from the church to the Vatican. There's loads of stuff like this in the film and though director Howard tries to ratchet up the tension with clock graphics ticking down the minutes to midnight and employing Hans Zimmer's pounding subOrff music to propel us to the next bigscene it just gets crazier and crazier to the frankly deranged conclusion of MacGregor's errant priest saving the Vatican by piloting a helicopter handy he was in the Italian airforce as a young man! up to safety where the antimatter explosion occurs relatively harmlessly before parachuting back to earth to be proclaimed a hero. But no a twist as transparent as glass reveals the truth and normality is resumed on the ashes of MacGregor's ambitions.It must be hard to act such tosh convincingly and I'm not sure anyone succeeds. Hanks hovers between stolid and stodgy while MacGregor's accent makes regular return trips to and from Ireland as the film progresses. There are some spectacular special effects notably the creation of the antimatter Godparticle at the start and the pyrotechnics above the Vatican at the conclusion. In between there's poor continuity for which the constantly interjected exposition fails to compensate and too much forced action setpieces where Hanks might as well be running about with a big S on his chest so intuitive and deathdefying is his character.Anyway Rome And Vatican City looked wonderful as they always do but other than make me want to go back there sometime soon this blockbuster left me cold and scratching my head about what all the fuss was about. Best just to accept it as a Harry Pottertype phenomenon where with a surefire audience of the millions who've read the book the film had to be made. The fact is though that it didn't and in my opinion shouldn't...".

	schema:reviewBody "Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels  Demons I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown the fact that it was written by Dan Brown and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind and expected the worse but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump and that is by all means good entertainment value.The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon Hanks jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the reelection through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo Patrick McKenna McGregor. However he soon learns of a new threat one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known an antimatter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon using his intellects and trust me you'll be hearing a LOT from it is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra Zurer who is also the cocreator of the antimatter. The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes evidently slowing the book's much anticipated actionthriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper but on screen it can go either way. The character's are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile intellectually and physically since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter the straightfaced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones and instead of playing a part in the story they are just kicked aside as assets. However Angels  Demons accomplishes what DVC could never a thrilling fastpaced movie filled with satisfying explosions beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica including many of the churches and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases almost. While newcomers might call it a National Treasure 3 with a much larger threat there is still enough contagious suspensethriller eyecandy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates AD does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder. A good booktomovie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.7.410".

The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks Brown and company.There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form. I am not giving any spoilers except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie.Although they did film in Rome they had to recreate interior shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they had no access to that area and I am not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks.This movie should be received better by the critics and public but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie that this is just a movie.".

So many changes were made it is arguable as to whether or not the movie is based on Mr. Brown's book or just borrowed a few ideas from it. Anyone who enjoyed the novel will be disheartened by all the changes that make the movie confusing rather intriguing. The movie starts out with a scene slightly similar to one that takes place much further on in the book. The head of the scientific research center who was a major character in the book is completely eliminated. The British writer and camera person are not in the movie at all and I don't recall them mentioning the relationship between the female star and the murdered scientist who had 2 careers that seemed to be at odds but are a major reason for his anti  matter research. Nor do they even point out the real cause for the pope being killed.".

Earth wind water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.Just like 3 years ago there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel this was always likely.Ron Howard who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci".

Then I watched it again two Sundays ago March 20th 2005 and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing. I even cried the first 2 times but mainly because the actress was actually crying and I am a big fan of hers.It is a very well acted and done TV Movie. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film! I keep watching it over and over.

This movie although sometimes you want to rattle the son for trusting her so much is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes much to do that to me! The plot doesn't have much to it but the acting provided by Judith Light is incredible. She looks beautiful the whole time and by the end you don't want the fate imposed by the courts to happen to her. Overall a movie worth my highest praise! Thank you for making it and redefining my view on the death penalty. I eagerly await this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of media since Lifetime is starting to issue some movies to customers. Although I don't have high hopes for this one because this took place almost 9 years ago which is still hard to believe since this movie is STILL ingrained into my head after all this time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Landscape after a battle opens with escaping prisoners over a snowy field full of fences  in rather funny movements accompanied by Vivaldis Four Seasons. A touching opening. But we soon enough learn to know these prisoners as a mob and when they also treated humouristic burry a man alive the protagonist stops for a moment but is soon more engaged in finding books from the turndowned camp than caring about his neighbour.The rest of the film is set in an American camp from where the prisoners are not released in some kind of semi freedom semi camp. A perfect set for a study of war criminality American camps Polish nationalism Catholisism grief and human misery in general.Film makes an important turn. In comes women and with them film changes light colour and temper. At the same time it turns out that these prisoners were slaves in Holocaust. I think a main underlying political theme of the film must mankind's treatments of Jews under and after the world war and not only the Nazi exterminations but mankind letting it happen  and even forcing them out of Europe after the war. On an emotional level the film is about grief and the problem with letting grief come how environment makes grief difficult and how difficult it can be to share grief for people with different experiences. But the film is a carpet of underlying contradictionshumour irony and sudden beauty. A couple of times during the film a gypsy prisoner plays on an harp an emotional tune brutally rejected filmatically speaking by the protagonist. That example picks up an important essence of the film's style and theme. When it comes to humour its very comic how the protagonist constantly looses and finds back his glasses in crowds in hay stacks etc.Its not hard to understand Spielberg's respect of Wajda when you see this film. The great treatment of light can be compared with Spielberg on his best. The Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Narrativly it only brings the film out of the camp but filmatically it brings the film to dream and eternity with profound beauty. Anyhow there is also another scene I can't let go without comment. Its the Christian Supper. Undoubtly ironical but simultaneously deeply religious we see the transsubstantiation moment everybody falling on their knees while the protagonist is saved from isolation by the priest to serve as a comic altar boy. His bells are mocking the scene but also gives it emotion and love. When Nina gets her bread sun light falls upon her and bells ring spheric its the peak moment of the film.Main actors are excellent in their roles. Olbrychski as the perfect Wajda protagonist  the doubting reflecting mind unable to put all the aspects of his mind and emotion into life. Beautiful Celinska is with great body acting debuting in a character unable to express all her inner in her proud movements.Those who try to describe everything often are unable to take nothing in consideration. This is what Wajda manages. His films are either very moving deep or beautifully shot but pays attention to life's and society's particularity. A moment of joy for one is the moment of irony for a second the moment of grief for the third a moment of nothing for the fourth.There is at least two reasons to pay attention to Wajdas films of this period. First is the remarkable free expression of deep political impact. This country was the first to overthrow communism twenty years later. Second is the development of a filmatic and narrative language that Kusturica has rose to grandeur.".

Their vengeance on a guard seems limited to trying to drown him in a mud puddle even though it's obviously supposed to be freezing. The American soldiers are very poorly dubbed and not very well played. The film is talky and overly intellectualized. It takes a long time to get going. Well perhaps this last is intentional since the story is about a liberated Polish prisoner of war in a refugee camp who withdraws from the world and seeks solace in books and poetry. Eventually he meets a Jewish girl who tries to engage him in the world again. As he is beginning to emerge from his shell and respond to her she is senselessly killed. Visiting her body in the morgue he allows himself to feel the pain of her death. It is these latter scenes and the extraordinary quality of Celinska's acting that make this film powerful and ultimately a great film. Seldom if ever have I felt a person's death on the screen so personally and deeply as with this film.".

The acting was pretty bad especially the female lead who was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around her shirt opened and the director showed closeups of her naked breast for the next 1520 seconds. I couldn't see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film. Maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience. Much of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by the Americans. First the American uniforms did not look anything like U.S. Army uniforms. Second none of the extermination camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans. I would think that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians. All in all it's just not a very good film if you don't speak Polish.".

Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below your average TV drama. And there are some typical Speakman pummeling bad guys scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star. In the end this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is the music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe with his pompous and melodramatic score which simply doesn't belong in this kind of dull movie. It's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score which makes the entire movie look even more confused goofier and dull.Don't waste your time watching this even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan.".

When his beloved sister Jenny Nagy is tragically murdered by a serial killer named Martin Kagan Shaner initially Lomax is satisfied when Kagan is sentenced to die by going to the electric chair. When an inexplicably sympathetic doctor Alice Barnes Datcher insists that Kagan is schizophrenic and that any and all murders were committed by his alter ego Martin Mirman the dangerous psychopath is granted a stay of execution. But not for long as an incensed Lomax decides to put his CQB skills to work to finally erase Kagan from the planet. But first he needs to get weaponry from his old buddy Snake Varney and find time for romance with reporter Liz Pierce Gracen. Will Lomax's Expertise be enough to get the proper revenge? The Expert starts off in classic Martial Arts movie style with a shadowy figure displaying his moves as the opening credits roll. Unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't live up to this promising intro. The actual action scenes are minimal and Speakman only Kenpo's it up on the baddies a scant few times. The first major action scene feels strangely slow and confused. A lot of the running time is spent as a Prison Slog with no action whatsoever. Despite the presence of James Brolin as the warden these scenes are ultimately pointless. We liked the moment when Brolin becomes unhinged but overall neither he Speakman or the rest of the cast can overcome the mediocrity within.Michael Shaner who we remembered from Bloodfist 1989 where he played the infamous Baby and Angelfist 1993 or possibly other movies with the word fist in the title portrays the main baddie in a boohiss hateable style. His resemblance to a young Robert Davi made us believe fan favorite Davi also could have assayed the role. Because of the fact that when we first see Martin Kagan he's fixing a copying machine and has ink on his face and because the camera keeps cutting closer and closer on to his leering face with each successive loud musical stab we were prepared for a first an evil copying machine repairman. Sadly despite the hilariously hamfisted telegraphing of his evilness he was just your standard baddie.Let's not forget that Jim Varney is also onboard as a Vietnam vet who works at a store called Gun City USA. Now that's what I call shop 'til you drop. Even though it's a glorified cameo it was nice to see Ernest himself call Speakman The Best and act as this movie's Machine Gun Joe. Elizabeth Gracen played the typical female reporter this time resembling Teri Hatcher not to be confused with fellow cast member Alex Datcher. The main problem with The Expert is that it ceases to be an action movie for vast portions of the running time. And anyone renting or buying a Jeff Speakman movie called The Expert isn't expecting that and it's a disappointment. Supposedly the great Larry Cohen and the equallygreat William Lustig had something to do with this production but went uncredited. We can see why.A prime example of 1995 video store shelffiller regrettably we were not impressed with The Expert.".

	schema:reviewBody "SWAT cop Jeff Speakman comes home one night to find his sister dead and so when the suspect is caught and is given the death penalty Speakman gets sad however when he hears that the killer might get out of the death penalty he gets ticked off and so Speakman breaks into the jail to execute the guy himself. The serial killer played by Michael Shaner is so transparently mean spirited and just around obvious manipulative that it's fairly contrived to think that someone would buy into his story that he is mentally unstable. The Expert does feature some well staged action sequences but the reason why I didn't care for this flick was that it clearly didn't know what it wants to be. Is it exploring capital punishment because there are people that get the chair even though they're sorry and there is an innocent man who is on death row. ? Is it about how to cope with a murder that hits too close to home or is it a revenge thriller about what happens when justice doesn't prevail. However without a stance to take The Expert pretty much talks itself in corners and every action sequence seems to be out of place while the politics are so heavy handed that they seem too overwrought to really convince. In other words The Expert has too much on it's plate and for the action crowd this only provides the bare minimum action while for fans of movies that get political will be disappointed by the lack of a stance taken. The movie itself has a few interesting elements but typically the messy plot got in the way of the revenge plot. Fans of Speakman should find something to like but after this flick he seemed to disappear into obscurity.  out of 4Fair".

	onyx:emotionText "SWAT cop Jeff Speakman comes home one night to find his sister dead and so when the suspect is caught and is given the death penalty Speakman gets sad however when he hears that the killer might get out of the death penalty he gets ticked off and so Speakman breaks into the jail to execute the guy himself. The serial killer played by Michael Shaner is so transparently mean spirited and just around obvious manipulative that it's fairly contrived to think that someone would buy into his story that he is mentally unstable. The Expert does feature some well staged action sequences but the reason why I didn't care for this flick was that it clearly didn't know what it wants to be. Is it exploring capital punishment because there are people that get the chair even though they're sorry and there is an innocent man who is on death row. ? Is it about how to cope with a murder that hits too close to home or is it a revenge thriller about what happens when justice doesn't prevail. However without a stance to take The Expert pretty much talks itself in corners and every action sequence seems to be out of place while the politics are so heavy handed that they seem too overwrought to really convince. In other words The Expert has too much on it's plate and for the action crowd this only provides the bare minimum action while for fans of movies that get political will be disappointed by the lack of a stance taken. The movie itself has a few interesting elements but typically the messy plot got in the way of the revenge plot. Fans of Speakman should find something to like but after this flick he seemed to disappear into obscurity.  out of 4Fair";

	schema:headline " Halfway decent action film dragged down by obvious messagemaking";
	schema:reviewBody "My main critique of this film is twofold 1 80's90's action films like this tended to be reactionary in some way but the message this one hammers home even silly for its genre and 2 Jeff Speakman while a good martial artist is a charisma vacuum as an actor. First however what the film does have in its favor. As previously stated Jeff Speakman is quite convincing as a martial artist and in general as a physical presence. I certainly wouldn't want to mess with him in real life contrary to whatever Steven Seagal's beef with him was. The plot is also quite efficient if rudimentary in the way it sets up the characters and moves the action forward. The first scene in particular establishes Speakman's character as the nobs expert that the title indicated he would be. The action scenes were also wellchoreographed and there was some decent camerawork in the slower portions of the film. I also thought that James Brolin and Jim Varney in a onescene cameo did respectable acting work. However just about everyone else Speakman included was halfway decent at best. The writing also wasn't anything to be proud of either. My biggest issue with the film is the message if one can call it that. THE EXPERT delivers yet another rightwing fantasy about a lone hero who takes on an ineffectual justice system by doling out his own version of justice against the violent criminal who killed his sister. Of course violent criminals should be punished but the negative way it portrays a female psychologist involved with the case very unsubtly clues the viewer onto what the film's stance is. Not that a film shouldn't take a stance on anything but I happen to think the stance wasn't very fair. Aside from that the score was overblown and there were a few pacing issues in the middle portion where the main character barely gets any screen time. I know I shouldn't have expected too much considering Jeff Speakman was a thirdtier action star at best but the obvious messagemaking made it a little bit of a chore to sit through.".

Normally typically and as usual Now I haven't seen any other Jeff latest film they are kinda hard to come by but he is busy today with Kenpo seminars all over the world and I think it's a good idea to stop when you are supposed to and keep a low profile and do what you like to do. I kinda doubt in Jeff latest films maybe because I am a fan of 90s action films. OK the story is usual a sadistic maniac Kagan played by Michael Shaner who you probably remember for Lethal Weapon 1987 he was the guy who was saved by Mel Gibson from suicide jump. He made an interesting performance but not too well to be noticed for more upcoming roles kills John's Speakman sister and therefore he seeks revenge his own way. You know kinda badass and radical. There's actually nothing that quite special in the film the action scenes were solid the movie has an interesting music score that fits perfectly in the scenes. Jeff is really good in his fighting scenes as always. We got actors as James Brolin as a cold prison warden and Alex Datcher as a liberal fighter for convicts rights or whatever other actors didn't do anything much with their performances well what did you expect from a low budget film? But here's what's cool I was quite surprised by this. Jim Varney appears in film as Speakman's war buddy who is a pawn shop owner and who also supplies Speakman with some cool weapons and equipment for his revenge. Varney is a comedian but even in this 5 to 6 minute role he proved otherwise he was really cool in the role. And I really suggest all Varney fans to check him out here you'll love it. Ernest P. Worrell can be a badass I tell you. Well overall low budget action film fans here's a real treat enjoy it.".

Hard to believe that even though the original movie was made 14 years before this one its SFX are actually more realistic mostly because the transformation scenes in this movie often happen either offcamera or while the character is running behind something.Also the humor in the movie falls short. Granted the chewing gum skit was pretty funny but as I walked out of the theatre I was pretty ashamed of myself for laughing at such an immature joke. The Eiffel Tower scene is funny only because of its felonious breaking of the laws of physics Uh since the Tower spreads outward wouldn't these bungee jumpers wind up slamming into it at some point during their fall?And finally the plot is simply insulting. Even though the original movie had little more behind its story than I'm a werewolf oh no that is even better than this stereotypical drivel about an antiAmerican punk who wants to purify the world from the country. If that's not bad enough their method luring GenX tourists into a club to meet their grisly deaths is awful inefficient. And to top it off there are numerous mentions and depictions of eatingdrinking someone's heart including a scene in which Julie Delpy sticks a human heart in a blender  yummy none of which are suitable for anyone with a stomach.As stated in the beginning if you really want to see a good werewolf movie the original 1983 film will suit you just fine. But if you rent this one be warned the producers and writers spent more time getting Bush to sing the theme song than they did writing the plot.".

	schema:headline " Don't Look at it as a Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "As a sequel to An American Werewolf in London this film is sure to disappoint many. It certainly doesn't have the talent that was involved on that one. No John Landis. No David Naughton. No Jenny Agutter and other morethancompetent actors. No Rick Baker and dazzling innovative special effects. I could go on...and on. But if one distances themselves from seeing this film as a sequeland really it is not a sequel at all...it doesn't have any of the same characters from the first film this film is not that bad on its own. Sure it is relying on your memories of the London film to get fannies in the seats. Yep it uses the same character TYPES and situationsdead victims talking and being funny comes to mind quickly. Other than that and the fact that werewolves are involvedand a romance of course I found few other similarities. This film is definitely going for more laughs and takes itself even far less serious than An American Werewolf in London. The leads...Scott and Delpy are pretty good. The rest of the actors are pretty good too with Julie Bowen as a slutty American and the guy playing Claude particularly good. I also loved all the French police and the gentle humour inherent in every line they said. The script has some genuine scares laced throughout the picture but always comes back to the humour. French werewolves enjoying feasting on Americans was a particular funny storyline. Director Anthony Waller creates a fastpaced film with some excellent sequences interspersed with some sophomoric plot strands. By no means is this a great film or even a great horror filmspoof but it is a film that should grab and hold your attention. Make you jump a few times and laugh out loud now and then.".

	onyx:emotionText "As a sequel to An American Werewolf in London this film is sure to disappoint many. It certainly doesn't have the talent that was involved on that one. No John Landis. No David Naughton. No Jenny Agutter and other morethancompetent actors. No Rick Baker and dazzling innovative special effects. I could go on...and on. But if one distances themselves from seeing this film as a sequeland really it is not a sequel at all...it doesn't have any of the same characters from the first film this film is not that bad on its own. Sure it is relying on your memories of the London film to get fannies in the seats. Yep it uses the same character TYPES and situationsdead victims talking and being funny comes to mind quickly. Other than that and the fact that werewolves are involvedand a romance of course I found few other similarities.

The script was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something.The original was a makeup effects landmark. So naturally the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup FX and do CG werewolves instead. These CG werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the comedy.

	schema:reviewBody "I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London An American tourist visits a famous European capital  he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague  he embarks  Pardon the pun  on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession  he turns into a werewolf  he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims  etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is With this Paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes  there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie  here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I  The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower  it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI  The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic  but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment".

That film had it's funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else. This updated version now set in Paris does not have that edge at all and simply isn't in the same class....but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch. So werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the London version I'll still give it decent marks since I don't care what others think. I liked it even though I agree London is better and I prefer that version too. The first 3040 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant. It also introduces the lead female character played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to make that many films or least ones I hear about over here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great.When the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no fwords and no Lord's name in vain  amazing!However there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middleaged guy like me either. This film is geared a lot more toward 20somethings if that helps anyone.It's entertaining.....just don't expect it to live up to the first film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why I get my hopes up for sequels... my hopes are always destroyed.This movie is no exception. For starters it's important to note that An American Werewolf in London AAWiL will always have a special place in my heart as one of the first horror movies I remembers seeing on HBO as a kid.This movie lacked just about everything that AAWiL had good acting good special effects a decent soundtrack etc. Tom Everett Scott is a terrible actor... the kind of actor I see and wonder how he ever gets casted for anything. Julie Delpy is OK and I dig her accent. Everyone else was pretty much fluff andor fodder. The effects were God awful.

For starters it's important to note that An American Werewolf in London AAWiL will always have a special place in my heart as one of the first horror movies I remembers seeing on HBO as a kid.This movie lacked just about everything that AAWiL had good acting good special effects a decent soundtrack etc. Tom Everett Scott is a terrible actor... the kind of actor I see and wonder how he ever gets casted for anything. Julie Delpy is OK and I dig her accent. Everyone else was pretty much fluff andor fodder. The effects were God awful.

And in this horror film it has violence gore and tons of sex scenes AKA a lot of nudity. That's probably the lines for a horror movie. The sex scenes comes out of nowhere like the director told the actors to perform them because of the line sex sells.All of the acting in the film are horrible. The CGI was mediocre. I really didn't like that that much either. Well here are some good things in the film The last 10 or so minutes in the film have some horror elements. It's more like a creature fight between two werewolves.If you would like to see a horror film STAY AWAY from this one. I think people who love this movie are so dumb. Maybe they've seen another film.

The girl turns out to be the daughter of the werewolf from 1981's An American Werewolf in London and her mother from the earlier movie and stepfather are trying to remedy her lycanthropic disease. She's somehow linked to a clandestine order of werewolves in the city who regularly lure people to raves in order to feast on 'em. There's also a subplot about a drug that allows werewolves to change at any time with no need for a full moon. Julie Bowen Pierre Cosso and Thierry Lhermitte have peripheral roles. This is a standalone movie and so it's not necessary to see 1981 film first I recommend catching it just for the first half. The Eiffel Tower sequence is particularly creative and thrilling. Despite what some say Everett Scott makes for a quality main character just as effective as David Naughton in the original if not more. Like the first film the movie expertly mixes horror with comedy. There are spooky scenes set in catacombs dungeons and graveyards with the requisite full moon looming all to a rockin' soundtrack. Unfortunately the second half starts to mark time by becoming redundant and dull compared to the excellent setup. And the CGI werewolves are decidedly cartoony by today's standards although I'm sure they were pretty stateoftheart at the time.The movie runs 105 minutes and was shot in Paris with studio work done elsewhere.

	schema:reviewBody "It took me nine years to finally see this film. Back in 1997 it sounded like a dreadful idea. However now with a Blockbuster Video movie pass I can take chances on certain films without actually having to 'pay' for them.It's a dumb film. What made American Werewolf in London work was it was more of a serious film than a comedy and the comedy was wonderfully dark which added well to the horror element. Paris seems aimed toward attentiondeficit teenagers though it's rated R. The lead character is too goony to be of much interest or to be taken seriously plus he'd have been killed in his earlyon rescue scene therefore the film doesn't even try to make the unrealistic setup seem realistic. You can't buy into a drama or horror film if the film doesn't strive to be true in its own world. CGI werewolves aren't scary. London has outdated effects of course but they're still wonderful to watch for the audience is being treated to a painful and prolonged transformation. A realseeming nice guy  not some bland goofball  is going through something horrific and the special effects strive for realism and therefore one can buy into the transformation all the while knowing it's not real. Turning an actor into a cartoon werewolf is not engaging and therefore there's nothing to buy into.The ending is one one of those haha wrapthingsupinabow scenes that plagued so many horrorsuspense films of the 90s such as the alsounnecessary The Vanishing a weak remake of a gutwrenching Dutch film.".

However now with a Blockbuster Video movie pass I can take chances on certain films without actually having to 'pay' for them.It's a dumb film. What made American Werewolf in London work was it was more of a serious film than a comedy and the comedy was wonderfully dark which added well to the horror element. Paris seems aimed toward attentiondeficit teenagers though it's rated R. The lead character is too goony to be of much interest or to be taken seriously plus he'd have been killed in his earlyon rescue scene therefore the film doesn't even try to make the unrealistic setup seem realistic. You can't buy into a drama or horror film if the film doesn't strive to be true in its own world. CGI werewolves aren't scary. London has outdated effects of course but they're still wonderful to watch for the audience is being treated to a painful and prolonged transformation. A realseeming nice guy  not some bland goofball  is going through something horrific and the special effects strive for realism and therefore one can buy into the transformation all the while knowing it's not real. Turning an actor into a cartoon werewolf is not engaging and therefore there's nothing to buy into.The ending is one one of those haha wrapthingsupinabow scenes that plagued so many horrorsuspense films of the 90s such as the alsounnecessary The Vanishing a weak remake of a gutwrenching Dutch film.";

I agree King still manages to corner the market on topical guests but his knowledge of the topics is limited at best and as a result the interviews often become trite. Case in point King recently interviewed the woman Roman Polanski supposedly sexually abused umpteen years ago. Having just seen The Pianist and knowing very little about the topic I tuned in.

When Bill Maher Carl Bernstein a former president or other substantive guests sit across from him it's not too bad. Other times he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars. During the OJ Simpson trial it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes it comes off a little bit like trash televisionJerry Springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience.On the other side King's show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightestpolitical platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said Larry King is not a bad interviewer but alas he is not a great one. King does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. Always seems like the minute King can't quite deal with the issue at hand that's when he turns to the phone calls maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has. He might interview someone like David Gergen but may not have read any of his books. Sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script.When it's an entertainment celebrity no problem. He can come off like he's thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. And I notice he usually has seen the star's latest movie. Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. However if it's the likes of John Dean or Bob Woodward King comes off a little like he didn't quite finish his homework. So off to the phones.If you are looking for real indepth interviewing Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads andor researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. I don't see King quite doing that. Granted he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross which may say more about the American audience than King. In short Larry is better than Bill but not as good as Terry.".

He's a subtle Scorpio he gets his zings in when he needs to just as he managed to do last night with Paris Hilton during her first postjail TV interview.The thing about this entire case that has really amazed me is that Hilton is still apparently clueless about why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was a tooharsh sentence and what's more actually MADE her serve it . In all the time she was in jail supposedly alone 23 hours a day in her cell she never once in her mind rewound the events which led to her being given the sentence that Judge Sauer saw fit to impose on her. She never once realized that it just might have set off a major red flag when she 1 showed up late in court for the original hearing and 2 proceeded to inform him when he asked her did she not know that her license had been suspended did she not get the papers in the mail that I have people who read that sort of thing for me. All the time she was in her cell she never came to the realization that this action showing up late and that statement  and more importantly the attitude  the utter cavalier disregard for the court system and the law in general and her driving privileges in particular that she displayed  just might have made Judge Sauer pardon the pun go sour on her. Last night on King's show after giving lip service to how she has been changed forever by her traumatic experience how she has learned her lesson she answered his question Do you think you got a raw deal? with a resounding yes. And during the course of the conversation if you can call it that she said more than once that she did not feel she deserved what had happened to her. King asked gently more than once if she does not feel she creates the situations in her life that she finds herself in to which she pretty much stared at him blankly. She basically therefore holds the conscious belief that she's been victimized in this situation she does not understand how she herself caused it that day in court by her cavalier attitude with the judge. I feel this is very sad  tragic even considering what a huge role model Hilton is to some people and it renders anything she said last night about her socalled rehabilitated state into the realms of complete and utter cluelessness contradiction and hypocrisy. During the course of the interview Hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview King scored major points by asking her what her favorite Bible passage was. She responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes completely superficial noninsights which she had read on air as if she were Nelson Mandella or something and finally grunting out I don't have a favorite passage. Judge Sauer in my book is a hero and after last night so is Larry King for subtly exposing Hilton for what she truly is.".

She responded by groping perplexedly at her pathetic notes completely superficial noninsights which she had read on air as if she were Nelson Mandella or something and finally grunting out I don't have a favorite passage. Judge Sauer in my book is a hero and after last night so is Larry King for subtly exposing Hilton for what she truly is.";

I read Mr. Osteen's book Your Best Life Now and even though I enjoyed reading the book I was disturbed by some of the comments made by Mr. Osteen. I brushed my feelings off thinking it was just me because so many people love Joel Osteen. When I read the interview online it confirmed what I felt when reading the book Mr. Osteen thrives on himself instead of giving all the glory to God who put him where he is today. The interview with Joel Osteen ended with the icon asking Larry King if he was ready to submit to Jesus Christ and Larry's answer was no I think I'll give a deathbed confession. This is not a direct quote. I hope Mr. King has the opportunity to confess on his deathbed instead of dying in an accident where there is no time to confess anything. My question to Mr. King is wouldn't you rather be living as a Christian and find out there is no heaven than to live as a nonbeliever and find out there really is a hell? What do you have to lose except your soul? My prayers are with you Mr. King.".

It wasn't a horrible idea but it wasn't the best of ideas either. I will not blast AfterMASH for it's failure to live up to MASH but what I will say is that when a TV seriesor movie series or a music act is popular for a long timeit has it's own time and place and when it's over it literally is the end of an era. MASH debuted in the midst of Vietnamsoon to be Watergate and just a time in America when things were upside down. At the end in 1983all of that was over supposedly. AfterMASH is among the many failed sequel shows like Golden PalaceGolden Girls The Sanford ArmsSanfordSanford  Son Three's A Crowd Three's Company and JoeyFriends. Simplyenough is enough the first go 'round.The plot lines and writing were very much like the old show and the drama was first rate but AfterMASH lacked a very important ingredient a star name. MorganFarr  Christoher were famous yes but they are and always will be character actors. They were great on MASH but they didn't have enough name or pull to attract the numbers MASH racked up. What also never helps is network tampering. I could be wrong about the showmaybe being successful... and maybe it would have been if not for stupidly placing it against The ATeam if Happy Days couldn't winwhat chance would a new show have?. Thendumping actors especially a different Mildred in Season 2! and the old ploy of special guest star from the original series. I did like the show with Radar and was glad to see him no longer a virgin and dealing with a real issue. In the endthe plot with Klinger on the run from the police for belting a guy was just likeWhat's the big deal about punching a guy who deserved it? I also got tired of Sunn Lee saying ..but Maxour baby doesn't have a name! I thoughtwell just name the kid already!As for the results next seasonsome good shows...especially the final appearance of Col. Flagg at Klinger's court trialbut the damage was done. It may have hurt the actors when it was pulled but for mewellI simply moved on to the 80s sitcoms I was already watching. Not as deep or poignant but heckthe 70s were long gone.

	schema:reviewBody "I for one am tired of AfterMASH being the TV industry joke the joke being that a spin off of a popular series can't survive without major cast members. AfterMASH was a fine series with Potter Klinger and Mulcahy dealing with issues which occur when the bullets stop flying. Potter fighting the VA to provide disability for a cancer patient who was stationed at Abomb tests is just one example. Viewers finally met Mildred Potter and were introduced to Bob Scannell who served with Potter in WWI. Jay O. Sanders now a semibig name in movies played Gene Peiffer a likable surgical resident whom Potter took under his wing. Mike D'Angelo John Chappell was the bumbling administrator with his aide Alma Cox Brendis Kemp who always locked horns with Klinger. AfterMASH ended it's 1st season ranked 15 in the ratings.So why did this series fail? Two reasons in my opinion for what it's worth. First some genius at CBS decided to move the sitcom from MASH's old time slot of Mondays at 900 to Tuesdays at 800 where it went up against NBC's The ATeam. AfterMASH didn't stand a chance. Second the character of Gene Peiffer was written out with no explanation to be replaced by Dr. Boyer played by David Ackroyd. Boyer who didn't even have a first name was handicapped having lost his leg in the Korean War and lashed out at everyone who thought less of him because of it at least in his mind. Most viewer I believe want characters they can identify with or understand and a brawling selfpitying loner with a chip on his shoulder doesn't cut it. In reality such a person couldn't remain employed in any hospital.AfterMASH will never be a lost classic rather it's a whatmighthavebeen and television's loaded with them. Still the show comes up in any TV Guide fall preview that includes a spinoff with the usual line Does anybody remember AfterMASH?Finally if there's any spinoff that merits being the industry joke it's The Sanford Arms NBC's illfated attempt in 1977 to continue Sanford and Son without Fred and Lamont. It ran for 4 episodes. At least AfterMASH made it to 30 before being axed in December 1984. Eventually AfterMASH will be released on DVD. After all shows with fewer episodes are. Glad I won't be trampled in the stampede to buy it.".

The two exceptions were Klinger who shocked everyone by remaining in Korea and Father Mulchachy who was rapidly losing his hearing after standing on top of an explosion.  These were intriguing plot twists and when MASH ended the audience was left with the questions of whether or not Klinger would ever leave Korea and whether Mulchachy would regain his hearing or go completely deaf.The first episode of After MASH quickly resolved both of these cliffhangers in a schmaltzy unsatisfying way.  Klinger was home and Mulchacy had an operation that immediately restored his hearing.  Two cheap cop outs for strong plotlines.  The quality of After MASH was not good enough to justify ruining the ending of one of the best television programs in history.".

	schema:reviewBody "To be fair I didn't see a lot of this show. Probably because it wasn't as good as the original MASH but I seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule. Some shows just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week. But I really did try at first so it wasn't all bad. Maybe I just kept expecting it to improve but I can't give this show a 1. In all honesty I can't give it any more than a 2 either.It wasn't MASH I'm not going to type those stupid 's every time. And it was trying to be MASH without putting forth any effort like it would just magically happen. Well guess what? No magic. The best I can do here is to compare it to other shows.Trapper John M.D. was a much better show by far. However they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ but nothing at all like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same just change his name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH wasn't the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame followup to All In The Family. It had no heart no conflict no depth  all of the things that made All In the Family so memorable. Likewise MASH was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove the war and you remove the drive for 99 of the humor. Potter can't yell at Klinger for wearing a dress because Klinger isn't wearing a dress because he's not trying to get kicked out of the Army because he's already out of the Army because the war is over. breathe All of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer to stay around and watch the show.And from what I remember the whole show seemed to be Potter Klinger and Mulcahy just standing there unnaturally facing the audience like a trio of Vaudeville performers. It was reminiscent of Good Times where they spent 90 of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation. They weren't. And it felt even less natural on After MASH.Another random tidbit I recall is that the people who made MASH never got any royalties from the spinoff. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a spinoff of the movie MASH which they owned and not the TV series. Nice try but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie and he was never deaf. I guess studio execs will do anything for a buck. Anything other than make a worthwhile sequel that is.".

Show that Radar's farm had failed and and moved away to join the police in St. Louis. Show that Col. Potter now runs a Veteran's Hospital and that Hawkeye went home to Maine and a smalltown practice. Show that Mulcahy's hearing has been largely restored through surgery. It could have been a huge hit just to see them all later as a epilogue to the whole story of MASH.Instead we got AfterMASH which took the basic idea of what happened next and ran it into the ground. We got three familiar characters Potter Klinger and Mulcahy a brief introduction on how they got there and then try to replicate MASH stateside. Create a whole new set of young mischievous doctors for Potter to keep an eye on a whole new bossy administrator to yell at Klinger and then find thin reasons for constant guest appearances by former MASH cast. It kept trying to be essentially a stateside remake of MASH with some of the same characters but the chemistry wasn't there.

	schema:reviewBody "When watching this if you are able as it hasn't really been repeated or given any release people often make huge mistakes. They compare it to the wrong things. Is this M.A.S.H? no. can't be. A lot of people will tell you that M.A.S.H. wasn't even M.A.S.H. and that the Potter episodes are much worse then the Blake episodes or whatever. the Show changed over time to make something which was good as a whole.After M.A.S.H. kinda has the same issues. set a few months after they got home the show reunites Col. Sherman T. Potter Maxwell Q. Klinger and Father Francis Mulcahy well as SoonLee Klinger and keeps them completely well in character while changing the setting from the middle of a war where there job was to patch and ship them out to a Veterans hospital where sometimes the ones they saved still have a long way to go.Starting off Potter finds retired life too dull and after having problems back in private practice found a good place and winds up Chief of Staff in the Veterans hospital where he finds an old War Buddy from his Unit back when he was a Sgt Bob Scannell played by Patrick Cranshaw. After Klinger found trouble set himself up home after finding Soonlee's parents and his family not accepting a Korean daughterinlaw He ends up helping out Potter and becomes his Sectary but has to learn you can't just pull some of the same tricks as in the Army. Then Father Mulcahy joins after having a major depression when it was found out he was deaf. After a minor operation part of his hearing is restored and he works at the Hospital.New Characters include the Hospital Administrator Micheal D'Angelo John Chappell who is more interesting in his public image then the patients Alma Cox Brandis Kemp his Sectary and in charge Admin who hates everyone bar her love D'Angelo while wanting everything to go via the book and has a grudge against the loose altitude of Klinger.When the show starts it also features Alma's Assistant Bonnie Hornback Wendy Schaal who fancys Klinger and Dr Gene Pfeiffer Jay o. Sanders the local resident who is always over tired and with a lack of money leading him to try to get food wherever he can. over time these characters disappear into the background before being completely removed with Pfeiffer being replaced with Dr Boyer Davie Ackroyd a former frontline medico in Korea who lost his leg and has a big chip on his shoulder.While the show was good it didn't quite get the crowds they wanted and they tried to push it closer to Mash.. but sadly they didn't seam to know how to do that and after Klinger had a few run ins while trying to get money to support his wife and soon to be born child he ends up back in court where he decides to pretend to be insane. Some say this means he is 'Back in a dress' but doesn't wear a dress much but wares a range of outfits where he has to prove to them he was insane but got better. The Hospital Admin is changed and some characters come and go. Season two was very much NOT helped by the Network deciding to put the show opposite the Ateam believing falsely it could beat it in a war. Leaving a batch of episodes unaired and even some unfilmed.It's easy to see why people compare it to Mash as a Spinoff it's trying to take some of the love for the show and bring it to a new one but this show successfully takes old characters and puts them into a new setting.. However the new characters weren't always used to the best and the settings weren't always the best and people didn't get it as much of a chance as it needed and it would be a shame it see it never released to the public.Some notable episodes often feel like M.A.S.H. before it don't quite go as far as they could do when they have to deal with after combat issues like Downwinders left behind shrapnel missing limbs and more.".

	onyx:emotionText "When watching this if you are able as it hasn't really been repeated or given any release people often make huge mistakes. They compare it to the wrong things. Is this M.A.S.H? no. can't be. A lot of people will tell you that M.A.S.H. wasn't even M.A.S.H. and that the Potter episodes are much worse then the Blake episodes or whatever. the Show changed over time to make something which was good as a whole.After M.A.S.H. kinda has the same issues. set a few months after they got home the show reunites Col. Sherman T. Potter Maxwell Q. Klinger and Father Francis Mulcahy well as SoonLee Klinger and keeps them completely well in character while changing the setting from the middle of a war where there job was to patch and ship them out to a Veterans hospital where sometimes the ones they saved still have a long way to go.Starting off Potter finds retired life too dull and after having problems back in private practice found a good place and winds up Chief of Staff in the Veterans hospital where he finds an old War Buddy from his Unit back when he was a Sgt Bob Scannell played by Patrick Cranshaw. After Klinger found trouble set himself up home after finding Soonlee's parents and his family not accepting a Korean daughterinlaw He ends up helping out Potter and becomes his Sectary but has to learn you can't just pull some of the same tricks as in the Army. Then Father Mulcahy joins after having a major depression when it was found out he was deaf. After a minor operation part of his hearing is restored and he works at the Hospital.New Characters include the Hospital Administrator Micheal D'Angelo John Chappell who is more interesting in his public image then the patients Alma Cox Brandis Kemp his Sectary and in charge Admin who hates everyone bar her love D'Angelo while wanting everything to go via the book and has a grudge against the loose altitude of Klinger.When the show starts it also features Alma's Assistant Bonnie Hornback Wendy Schaal who fancys Klinger and Dr Gene Pfeiffer Jay o. Sanders the local resident who is always over tired and with a lack of money leading him to try to get food wherever he can. over time these characters disappear into the background before being completely removed with Pfeiffer being replaced with Dr Boyer Davie Ackroyd a former frontline medico in Korea who lost his leg and has a big chip on his shoulder.While the show was good it didn't quite get the crowds they wanted and they tried to push it closer to Mash.. but sadly they didn't seam to know how to do that and after Klinger had a few run ins while trying to get money to support his wife and soon to be born child he ends up back in court where he decides to pretend to be insane. Some say this means he is 'Back in a dress' but doesn't wear a dress much but wares a range of outfits where he has to prove to them he was insane but got better. The Hospital Admin is changed and some characters come and go. Season two was very much NOT helped by the Network deciding to put the show opposite the Ateam believing falsely it could beat it in a war.

And that's key because I think most shows actually lose their freshness after all of the unique themes are used up and that's usually within the first season or two. After that the show becomes like a worn piece of furniture comfortable familiar but not all that attractive yet accepted.After MASH was a fine looking production from what I remember but it seemed like the cast had created a familial unit from which they could not escape and unless they were a marquis player like Harry Morgan the on screen talent's career would not be TV nor feature film oriented.When I saw it I felt this tired feeling come over me like I did when I saw a lot of TV. But After MASH in particular because as I stated in my MASH review the actual Korean war only lasted a few years and yet the show just went on forever ignoring a lot of history of the actual conflict itself and then taking this very high and mighty attitude about how ridiculous the war was forgetting the fact that it was the Soviets trying to establish a communist Korea in direct opposition to the Korea we had liberated from the Japanese.But none of that history is mentioned in either TV series. It's just more introspection on the human self and how violence from doctors is bad and how army doctors would never take a life. Fortunately real US Army doctors and medics have a much different attitude and training regime i.e. they shoot and kill the enemy when needed. But you'd never get that from watching either series.What was good about this show were the production values. Excellent sets costumes and even some exteriors. You really got a sense of post Korea America in the 1950s transitioning into the early 1960s. But the implausibility of the characters remaining together after being discharged and standing down was even from a Hollywood standpoint just way too implausible for me to swallow.An interesting effort but to me it's just another reminder of why I really disliked most of the TV offerings coming from Los Angeles and a reminder that what the nation needed at the time and thankfully has now are actual documentaries about various military engagements including the Korean War that the US has been involved with.Again not a series I would recommend but it actually is a handsome looking production.Give it a shot and see what you think.".

The scripts were vague and contrived and rarely held your attention. The reason I think it is so horrible is because of the height it fell from. Fair or not to bear any resemblance let alone half a title of a legendary TV show and to come up this short is nothing short of insulting. What were the producers thinking?".

Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless. The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones. And there's no plot at all.Moreover this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles only to disrespect its principles afterwards for example by including the director in the credits  another sign of his pride?.I found the movie offensive not as an Argentinian but as a watcher.

	schema:headline " Fascinating like picking a scab is fascinating";
	schema:reviewBody "I will confess that once I started watching this movie it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion. Quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim or maybe fascination that they got funding to make distribute and show this film that kept me searching it for merit or possibly some bizarre wishfulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain. But no such luck.So you are warned to not start watching it in the first place lest the same thing happen to you. There's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on.The firstperson mockumentary and the schtick about Fabian's quest to impregnate women of the Falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric maybe Freshman  high school Freshman that is film student project than you might imagine. The effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants who other than the two professional leads are in fact real people as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically it's pointless and sexist.The reason I ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab there's an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until it's completely off even when you know it's bad for you. You just want to see what happens.In the end this is rather dishonest filmmaking because it seems ultimately to have no moral center no elucidation of the local political situation nor any place in the type of politicalsexualpersonal film universe  a la Goddard. In short it's got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does. Smug would be the oneword tagline.I'd suggest the filmmakers rent 'Waiting for Guffman' a few times or hell even 'Blair Witch Project' if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion. Or at least entertainment value.".

	onyx:emotionText "I will confess that once I started watching this movie it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion. Quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim or maybe fascination that they got funding to make distribute and show this film that kept me searching it for merit or possibly some bizarre wishfulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain. But no such luck.So you are warned to not start watching it in the first place lest the same thing happen to you. There's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on.The firstperson mockumentary and the schtick about Fabian's quest to impregnate women of the Falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric maybe Freshman  high school Freshman that is film student project than you might imagine. The effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants who other than the two professional leads are in fact real people as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically it's pointless and sexist.The reason I ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab there's an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until it's completely off even when you know it's bad for you. You just want to see what happens.In the end this is rather dishonest filmmaking because it seems ultimately to have no moral center no elucidation of the local political situation nor any place in the type of politicalsexualpersonal film universe  a la Goddard. In short it's got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does. Smug would be the oneword tagline.I'd suggest the filmmakers rent 'Waiting for Guffman' a few times or hell even 'Blair Witch Project' if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion. Or at least entertainment value.";

Many critics tried their damndest to shut it down. I don't know why. It's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland I've seen the first three in the series Festen Idioterne and Mifune. They were all great Festen being a masterpiece in my opinion. Fuckland isn't up to those others. I was just fascinated with the filmmaking. It's played as if it were a real documentary with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down. At a few points in the film it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time. I wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen. It is basically about this guy Fabian who is an Argentinian visiting the Faulkland Islands. Argentinians were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands and Fabian plans to impregnate the women with Argentinian children. He sets his eyes on one and most of the movie is spent on her seduction. The two actors are very natural. Camilla Heany only kind of hints that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas seems completely real. The politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me since I have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history. I was 3 I think when the Faulklands were invaded. The final bit of the film doesn't work at all. I don't get what the filmmakers were going for there. Still Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experiment. It does break some Dogma rules though notably the no extradiagetic music rule. There is a lot of that. 710.".

I was buying it believing it was all real.  It's not at all exciting...it's actually pretty boring watching the jiggly camera work I guess it was a hidden camera or something most of the time? and seeing this boring story play out with a lead character who is clearly insane...wanting to impregnate a woman to start the argentine line of heritage or whatever his plan is.  Tho it was fairly boring it's one of those movies you cannot take your eyes off of.  I wanted to start watching something else...I was waiting for the next movie on Sundance Channel but I couldn't turn the channel...and ended up watching till the end.

During that scene it was obvious that she's an actress and it was all fake...from what I saw on this site I still wasn't 100 sure I only read the summary on the main page.It's an okay movie to see once...but only because it keeps ahold of you. It's not a good movie overall just one of those rare things that keeps you watching just to see what weird stuff will happen next and how these people that seem so real yet so fake could do the things they do fall so quickly into having sex and starting this relationship and all.I guess the filmmaker had his point and he made it...or maybe he was trying to make entertainment and he failed...either way not great but not the worst either.".

Of course when one check IMDb we can see that the women he has sex with is an actor as well and the documentary is not really a documentary but a movie masquerading as a doco.The question that I have afterwards however is what was real and what wasn't.

This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that the gothic sequences are tacky overthetop and frankly silly. The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney he is not a bit like the novel even when delivering dialog straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his few terribly ham performances. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to savor how freakishly wrong it was.".

It fails to be amusing or satirical at all and instead turns the character's fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama.This affects the romance as well. It's meandering and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established.

My main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book.  Jane Austen was poking fun at the Gothic mania in her society and much of the novel is tongue in cheek.  The movie however is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically. The lighthearted funpoking flavor of Austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama.  The scenes of Catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting.  Also Henry Tilney is dreadfully unappealing.  Why I ask would anyone fall for him?    If you are looking for a funfilled Jane Austen evening watch Emma instead!".

The story was meant to gradually draw the character of Catherine Morland out of the fantasy world she had built for herself and into reality. The typical language characters and themes of a Gothic romance were sent up the whole way through and were shown to be the epitomy of bad writing.However this adaptation seemed to embrace and flatter what it was that Jane Austen was attempting to satirise. It retained a gothic feel throughout and seemed to 'put back' what it was that Jane Austen was trying to 'take out'. Northanger Abbey became the mysterious castle Henry Tilney became the intriguing Gothic hero and the 'secret' which Catherine believed existed at the Abbey turned out to be real. One cannot help thinking that the makers of this adaptation hadn't read the book very closely as they seemed to have missed the point.Unfortunately with an adaptation of this type when Jane Austen was writing she was assuming that her readers would be familiar with the Gothic genre. Filmmakers today would need to explain to the audience what the Gothic genre was all about explaining why this adaptation contains so many fantastical elements that Jane Austen was attempting to escape from.All of this aside it works quite well. The adaptation keeps to the storyline pretty much and retains much of Jane Austen's witty dialogue. The music helps contribute to the eerie atmosphere very well. One cannot help but wonder at the beauty of this version. Perfectly cast and impeccably acted.".

	schema:reviewBody "My mom my cousins and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans. We know all the words to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece and have watched Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books and I've even sat through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on film.Bad idea! This is just about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at WalMart for 1 my previous worst movies. The first thing wrong which you notice in the opening scene is that the heroine Catherine has a gruesome and weird imagination inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel she has dreams day and night in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig dragged across a field headed for Godknowswhatall and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse.The second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the highpitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No dainty classical music or English country dances here! It is also evident almost at first glance that the actress for lack of a better word chosen to play Catherine is completely off. First she is rather unattractive and is rendered even more so by her unAustenlike behavior. Her looks and movements are just wacky! Plus they're completely affected and unbelievable.This sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film. Not even Mr. Tilney the supposed dashing young suitor is decent.As more and more characters are introduced a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident. Huge Marie Antoinettestyle headdresses clash with the for the most part correctly styled Empire gowns. A French woman apparently a friend of General Tilney's is made up all in black as some sort of ancient Goth nightmareshe bears a striking similarity to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even sillier by a HUGE halfmoon beauty mark on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearing.Another anomaly that kept my mom and I howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the bathing scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse togetherprobably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates worn around their necks with strings. The plates floated horizontally on the water containing some mysterious pieces of...something. We guessed it was soap then aromatic herbs then finally when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure.And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie stay your hand. And if anyone is considering BUYING itwell I don't even know what to say to that.You'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 14 of the way through they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop. Unfortunately they didn't and Northanger Abbey was let out into the world.".

Well at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing though he overdid it as he usually does nearly as bad as William Shatner. But that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total suckitude. It's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is really happening and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on. Too many loose ends and the ending feels like a tune in again next week climax. The lead actress is too ditsy and weirdlooking to be a heroine the leading man is too goofylooking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap newagey pet project of the director's hippy daughter I mean saxophone??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing?. So in conclusion I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.".

Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs Allen I feel.Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney he just talks a load of rubbish and is not a clergyman as he should be it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine but then the book never really gave that impression either.General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but I quite like it.I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear? What a silly thing to say! Elinor's calm response is stupid too.anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me".

	schema:reviewBody "I got this movie with my BBC Jane Austen Collection 5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks or so I thought one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting.I still don't like to watch the fingersewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying dreamily while she sews My only acquaintance...tore my gown. This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting to my mind is incredible. The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from whatever I'm doing sewing though not my fingers together hopefully or boondoggling or whatever in order to watch the character deliver his lines. It's the turn of expression the cast of posture that make the words come alive  that's what makes good acting as far as I'm concerned.Well I watch almost every part of Northanger Abbey because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney the perfect blend of Bathian fop and real masculine hero  you're not sure until the end whether he's after Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of Welsh? accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming the combination of their behaviors  especially Mr. Richards' high voice lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom  makes them so real. General Tilney as the hardhearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating too. And Captain Tilney the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself... and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names I can't currently remember  the two of them are so perfectly at once smart and smarmy.The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the Jane Austen adaptations. I know this was one of Austen's weak points well it is as far as I am concerned even though all her novels are love stories it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they're aren't really in love then what's the point? All the other adaptations I've seen other than the early OlivierGarson one have pretty coldfish kisses at the end if they kiss at all. I don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. And the ending kiss in Northanger is a doozy.The overthetop approach to costumes music and lighting work very well as far as I'm concerned. And the script is extremely clever  the way we are educated about Gothic romance highlife in Bath Cathy's normal country upbringing etc. is very well done as they usually are in BBC productions. Also I like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels. And the Marchionesse I think was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device.Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey  she meant to make fun of Gothic romance not promote it. But I don't think she meant to put Mysteries of Udolpho etc. down. She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in his mother's room. Besides General Tilney was a villain albeit a prosaic one. That point was meant to be made surely.".

She is invited to visit the Tilneys at Northanger Abbey the seat of the formidable and somewhat financially challenged General Tilney who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth afoot.Where mutual attraction mixes with family finance dispute is inevitable. This coupled with Catherines vivid imagination leads her to fear for her safety. Her eventual departure is marred by accusations and counter accusations of deception and connivance.But the attraction between Catherine and Henry stands these trials.

The glory of the movie is that it never reveals all your imagination runs free running with the imagination of the main character one Kathrine M.

Dreams are woven throughout the movie enhancing the mood. Sometimes it is hard to tell what is real and what is not this is intentional I believe.Atmosphere reigns supreme.  The music is not what you'd expect of a movie by Jane Austen it is eerie flute and drum based high and haunting with an undercurrent of fear.  If a soft pleasant tune were playing in Northanger Abbey it would be positively inviting.  Now it is foreboding a grim and starkwalled palace of madmen. But!  The characters!

Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gratingly incongruous. The female singer was positively dreary! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherine's eyes.Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig? A totally extraneous and unnecessary character.One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone. He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home. Only her friend Miss Tilney's thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded. This whole point gets seriously muddled in the film. They make the General too dark from the outset.Peter Firth should have not sung! This part was painful to watch. His depiction of Tilney wasn't too bad but it was a shade dark in places. Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morland's imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark. Firth would have benefited from better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach. John Thorpe was appropriately odious. The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It certainly fit his character.I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack. It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie. If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on. Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor. The picture quality was not much better. This is glaringly noticeable on a digital television.When I think of what this film could have been I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.".

I may have pictured them somewhat differently from how Austen described them but nevertheless I find it very hard to accept them as the characters in the book.  They just don't fit.  Second of all why are there so many scenes cut out and new ones put in?  It felt like I'd missed so much when the movie was over and that it was rushed and incomplete.  And all of her visions!  Some of the scenes in this movie are very similar to those in John Gielgud's Prospero's Books which I know is lauded as brilliant filmmaking. However here it just distracts from the story and creates an uncomfortable situation for the viewer.  If you love Jane Austen I would suggest not seeing this movie.

The actress who plays Catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised even when she's supposed to be looking lovingly into her Tilney's eyes. Honestly!! The movie ends with a Catherine fantasylike scene where one can't help but wonder if it's happened or if she's merely delusional and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie. The only good thing about the movie is the title which was written by Ms. Austen herself. I generally love the BBC's productions but this one is horrid.".

The music all saxophone and synthesizer was complete rubbish and ruined the period milieu.The acting was terrible. The lead actress seemingly believes staring bugged eyed conveys innocence. It merely makes her look perpetually surprised which hardly fits every scene. The lead actor only is slightly better although he is lit sometimes so badly that he comes off a sort of frightening leader of an 80s rock band. In fact the whole production seems to be directed to be a music video rather than a wonderful Austen film. I seriously wonder about the availability of drugs in the UK in the 1980syes it is that sort of film.If you have choice invest you money in the 2007 Northanger Abbey100 better.".

My problem with one of the other reviewsConor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of ItaliansDubin is a Jewish last name and as such has a dark complexion not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman. He doesn't stand out at all rather delivers a great performance.This didn't win many awards but it is deserving of a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.

Some of the other posts are right Wannabes isn't going to rival The Godfather for best mob film ever. On the other hand Wannabes is a wellwritten and welldirected picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actoractress. My problem with one of the other reviewsConor Dubin stands out as the only Irishman in a cast of ItaliansDubin is a Jewish last name and as such has a dark complexion not a traditional ruddy one of an Irishman. He doesn't stand out at all rather delivers a great performance.This didn't win many awards but it is deserving of a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn. I found it for 7 bucks at Blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least! Highly recommended.";

I saw his first film directed by another neighbor Frank Adonis who's had bit parts in everything from 'GoodFellas' to 'The Sopranos' called 'One Deadly Road' which also starred a girl I went to junior high with. See?... small world. Anyway that movie did NOT impress me.The story was run of the mill gangster fare the characters and situations unbelievable and the depiction of these kinds of people very unrealistic to my experience anyway. Too over the top. The kind of movie that friends of mine started quoting more to make fun of it than to applaud it. Too bad.Well awhile back DeMeo's new low budget feature hit a local theater by us. We never got to see it as it ran there very shortly but I finally got it from Netflix this week. And I gotta say I enjoyed it! There were certain moments where I thought I knew how the story would end up and was pleasantly surprised that I was wrong! GOOD! Though DeMeo himself was a bit stiff very onedimensional in his starring portrayal of the protagonist Angelo the rest of the cast were really good! Everyone seemed pretty natural and some were straightup funny intentionally! Another plus. The people you may know in the film are Joe Viterelli sp? Jelly from 'Analyze This!' and Joseph D'onoffrio sp?... who played the young Tommy Pesci's character in 'Goodfellas'.I thought this film did a better job of portraying this type of atmosphere and life than 'One Deadly Road' did. A lot better. More realistic for the most part. I really appreciated the fallen son aspect of the storyline as well it rang true though some of it was a bit out of line and kitschy... SPOLIER ALERT!!!! like Vinny killing his own father.Anyway like I said it wasn't groundbreaking... at this point what mob movie can be?... but it was thoroughly enjoyable and a real surprise. It's worth a view.DeMeo can be currently seen on 'The Sopranos' though I look forward to his next feature. Hopefully the guy'll just get better and better.".

It's not a glorification of crime as a way of life but rather a statement on what people do sometimes to get ahead in the city.I'd say the main weakness what makes this come up short of being a really good movie are the actors playing Angelo and his brother Paulie.  William DeMeo just doesn't exude the leadership qualities you'd expect in the head of a crew.  He's isn't physically imposing enough and seems more like a follower not a leader.  And the actor playing his younger brother Conor Dubin seems out of place as the only Irishman in a cast of Italians. Joe Viterelli hands in a fine performance as Santo the local mob boss. Viterelli was born to play the part  his face and voice are perfect.  Joe D'Onofrio plays Vinnie his spoiled ambitious son who clashes with Angelo throughout the film.This film wasn't shot on a big budget and there aren't any elaborate sets but it has a nice feel to it.  The characters aren't overly violent or cartoonish like you'd see in a normal Hollywood treatment.  No one is screaming for attention.  Angelo and his friends act like regular neighborhood kids from Brooklyn wanting to move up in the world.A good story with a moral to the ending and that's what it's all about.".

The more recent Wild Wild West has some similarities The Ballad of Cable Houge comes to mind.  Using comedy fantasy surrealism the plot has a group of afroamericans traveling with a case of gold chased by a posse.  They join a settlement of afroamericans in the West which while free by law are reminded by the neighboring white towns that their liberty of action does not border out of their free town and their law does not apply to white people.  In a poignant scene the only white man who was in the original group of afroamericans with the case of gold is brutally killed in public view by the white neighbors almost to demonstrate that a white folk that joins the black folks has reached his lowest social status lower that simply a black man which by law cannot be killed without reason.".

The plot was well done and it was a fun movie. Everybody who had a part in this movie did excellent! I even think it beat out both movies in someway. Well not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had there strong points. For instance they both had excellent well known casts very good plots and very good filming. But Posse beat out Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was original in Posse unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference the action sequences! Oh my gosh! Posse was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast paced. Like modern day based shoot'em up movies. The action had big budget explosions too! The fistfights were pretty good also. Mario Van Pebbles was great in this movie! I suggest buying this excellent movie!".

Some of the landscape photography was stunning. That's about it. Oh and it was a nice touch having the buffalo head above the bar door in Freemanville I figure it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The movie starts sort of OK but the characters are so flat so comic book so 'much' the bad guys are just over the top bad I choke trying to describe them further. The SpanishCubanAmerican war was 18951898 with America being involved only in April to August of '98. I think the movie said it took place in 1893 I could be wrong but I don't want to look at it again to check. A big part of this movie hinged on the KKK killing Jessie's daddy. Well boys the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan wasn't even around during the time period of this movie. Of course the nasty basrds got busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of that. BUT for the purpose of the movie it is historically incorrect and that was a major part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few jabs and I'm done. I didn't know that Boyz2Men and other bands like that got their inspiration from New Orleans street singers from the 1890's. I also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in the 1890's...but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1 nails... We just about died laughing and I like a cheesy western more than most people do. Such a waste of talent and money  this really had the chance to show a part of American history that isn't well known. httpwww.coax.netpeoplelwfbkcwboy2.htm for some more information. This could have been so good but it was just....bad from 110 this gets a 1 instead of a zero because Mario looks good in his hat and there was an Appaloosa horse in the film.".

This is a story of early black settlers cow boys and infantrymen returning from the SpanishAmerican War with a cache of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including Melvin Van Peebles Marios father Billy Zane Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane. One senses that Peeples strived to use as many notable black and some not so notable  smile actors as possible   Perhaps too many some notable persons Issac Hayes Pamela Grier are only scene in cameo others briefly such as Tone Loc. The sentiment and efforts of Peebles efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. The large cast a feat for any director work well and do a good job of telling the story in the classic revenge and fight vs justice western.Most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor Woody Strode from Once Upon A Time In The West who's own life was a barrierbreaker within the context of a previous era not yet completed faded from memory. No other actor could have done this role better. Read the minibio on Woody Strode here as a primer httpimdb.comnamenm0834754bio The film does a good job of balancing action with a bit of sardonic humour. The dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary! And as others have mentioned the profanity was not accurate to that period. The sex scene was a bit much  not really needed. There are some historical inaccuracies such as the seeming electronic branding of the cattle etc. But Posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative works reflective of other untold stories and events. The actual photos of real cowboys at the end credits was very nice touch.".

I can't believe it's considered a western. Western is one of my favorite genres and this does not belong amongst westerns. This movie was to westerns what Donald Trump is to diplomacy.I suffered through this movie until a certain scene. This scene had me laughing out loud which was somewhat miraculous considering how royally upset I was with the film til this point. It was a showdown in the town of Freemanville and a corrupt unit of the army had brought in a Gatling gun. Jesse Lee Mario Van Peebles the hero has a genius plan to disable the gun. He's going to use dynamite. Not a bad idea Jesse. How are you going to get close enough with the dynamite to light it and toss it near the Gatling gun without getting shot up? Strap it to an arrow? No. He lights the dynamite wick puts the lit dynamite stick in his mouth yes his mouth shoots a man mounts a horse using the dead man as a human shield then gallops towards the men reloading the Gatling gun shoots the two stooges at the Gatling gun and as his horse leaps in the air he tosses the dynamite on the platform with the gun just in time for the dynamite to blow.ROFL. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me right now? You've got to be kidding me.At that point I decided that I could no longer fight the one rating. Mario Van Peebles was dead set on getting a one star rating from me no matter how hard I tried to grade on a curve. So I will oblige.".

This scene had me laughing out loud which was somewhat miraculous considering how royally upset I was with the film til this point. It was a showdown in the town of Freemanville and a corrupt unit of the army had brought in a Gatling gun. Jesse Lee Mario Van Peebles the hero has a genius plan to disable the gun. He's going to use dynamite. Not a bad idea Jesse. How are you going to get close enough with the dynamite to light it and toss it near the Gatling gun without getting shot up? Strap it to an arrow? No. He lights the dynamite wick puts the lit dynamite stick in his mouth yes his mouth shoots a man mounts a horse using the dead man as a human shield then gallops towards the men reloading the Gatling gun shoots the two stooges at the Gatling gun and as his horse leaps in the air he tosses the dynamite on the platform with the gun just in time for the dynamite to blow.ROFL. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me right now? You've got to be kidding me.At that point I decided that I could no longer fight the one rating. Mario Van Peebles was dead set on getting a one star rating from me no matter how hard I tried to grade on a curve. So I will oblige.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I heard about and saw the trailers for Posse I was eagerly waiting for the film's release. AfricanAmericans made up fully a third of all cowboys in the Old West but were virtually nonexistent in Hollywood's Old West except as train porters or mammies. The only real black cowboy seen by most Americans was Woody Strode thanks to John Ford Sergeant Rutledge The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance How the West Was Won Richard Brooks The Professionals and Italian filmmakers Once Upon a Time in the West The Revengers The Unholy Four.Posse written produced and directed by Mario Van Peebles had promise. Unfortunately it gets bogged down by cliches and a tired storyline. A rousing climax almost saves the film though.The movie begins with a stark history lesson about the true accomplishments of blacks in the Old West as told to Reginald and Warren Hudlin by an old man the legendary Woody Strode. He then segues into the fictitious story of Jesse Lee...Lee Mario Van Peebles and his men are getting cut to pieces by the Spanish during the SpanishAmerican War while their commanding officer a slimy but effective Billy Zane drinks Cognac miles away. Lee complains about the conditions and is arrested. Zane later promises to exonerate him and his men if they will pull off a mission for him  namely to steal valuable documents from the Spanish. Stephen Baldwin is thrown in with Lee's gang because he's a troublemaker Zane wants to get rid of.    The group pulls off the mission but instead of finding documents they find gold bullion. They also find Zane and his cohorts waiting at the rendezvous point with guns to finish them off. Unfortunately for Zane his men are like Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders  long on bravado short on skill. Lee's men having been in combat get the drop on Zane kill most of his men and flee back to America as wanted men. By the way the method they use to get out of Cuba and back to America is original but very creepy.The middle part of the film is spent showing Lee and his men rapper Tone Loc Baldwin a whiny aide and a few spares heading to New Orleans where they meet up with Big Daddy Kane. They also run into Zane who has been tracking them. The whole tracking plotline is hard to believe remember how long it took John Wayne to track down Natalie Wood in The Searchers? but it makes for good shootouts.Eventually Lee and his men make it back to Lee's hometown a black township full of freedmen. Such townships were numerous in the Old West but survived only at the whim of white county officials watch Rosewood for an example of what they often suffered from. The town is run by Richard Jordan as a greedy sheriff in cahoots with some crooked county officials. Throw in Zane and his own posse along with a Gatling gun and you get the rousing climax.Mario Van Peebles is not much of an actor but he has enough range and skill to carry the burden of being Jesse Lee. Baldwin is not quite up to par with brothers Alec and Daniel but he holds his own especially when he meets his demise at the hands of fellow whites. I liked Big Daddy Kane's softspoken but proud and defiant role as Father Time and the way he kept looking at his pocket watch before doing anything. Tone Loc was a waste though since he kept rapping like it was 1998 instead of 1898.The town basically had one purpose and that was to show off an impressive cast of black stars  Melvin Van Peebles Pam Grier Reginald Vel Johnson and Nipsey Russell among others. Of course having a cameo meant biting the bullet literally in the finale.By the way another problem for Posse was its setting. Many contributions and accomplishments by AfricanAmericans came during the years following the Civil War from 18651890. Black soldiers became the vaunted Buffalo Soldiers who protected white settlers and tracked down Geronimo. Freed blacks moved west in droves as homesteaders and as cowboys on cattle drives because many white men had been killed or maimed during the war. Black townships sprang up in Oklahoma and Arkansas. Black lawmen like the legendary Bass Reeves were in abundance especially in Oklahoma and Texas. By 1898 blacks were in a decline despite their bravery in the SpanishAmerican War that would not be reversed until World War I. Surely Van Peebles could have drawn up a storyline set between 1865 and 1890.Posse has a lot going for it. It's too bad Mario Van Peebles went for cliches shootouts and tired storylines meant to sell tickets rather than tell a good story. Unforgiven and Tombstone showed you can do both.".

SPOILER POSSIBILITYAlso Tone Loc as Angel the sixth member of the Posse is killed off incredibly early in the film.  Strangely at the start of the film we are shown a picture of the Posse which includes him and Father Time.  But the thing is Angel is killed before Father Time actually hooks up with the posse.  In addition although he comes good in the end Charles Lane's character is a real creep at first.  It's only the sacrifice of Stephen Baldwin's Little J that he comes good.These gripes aside POSSE is a very enjoyable film and worth spending time viewing.".

I'd come back to it because I believe Mario Van Peebles has a great film in him. Unfortunately this one is not it. It is ambitious and the multiracial cast gives it a good go. The various skill and talent levels aren't blended correctly to make an organic cohesive whole. A shame because its clear that Robert Hooks is trying really hard as is Billy Zane. Seeing old school players like Lawrence Cook and Pam Grier trying to make sense out of their brief story arcs was a chore. The biggest problem for me was Mario at some point decided to make it a vanity project because it started out a decent 40's style westernalbeit with nudity and some extreme violencethat morphed into a weak Clint Eastwood imitation. The contributions of rap star Tone Loc were pitiful at best but Big Daddy Kane worked harder and his work was credible. Richard Jordan and Blair Underwood are so intriguing together that they are almost in a different better movie. There are a lot of moments like that in this film where you sit frustrated at the editing and continuity decisions made by the director and the cinematographer. What is clear is that the script is pointing to a much much better film than what is being delivered. Oh BTW the word 'motherfucker' has its origins in the antebellum slave culture of North America. I've seen many complaints here about the usage of that epithet and how it shouldn't have been used during that era1898. Research the word and you will discover its bleak and stark history. If you were a fan of the show DEADWOOD you would have noticed that the character Swearingen peppered his remarks with the word and it even popped up in the film Heaven's Gate. I have to give it up again to the Billy Zane for his spectacular death scene. I didn't have that big of a problem with the New Jack Swing musical stylings imposed on the film's soundtrack but I did take issue with the lack of banjos and fiddles.A blown opportunity for greatness.".

	schema:headline " Good Western Action by Van Peebles";
	schema:reviewBody "spoilerIn 1993 AfricanAmerican directoractor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urbanaction film New Jack City with Posse. The film was cowritten and directed by Van Peebles who also stars as the main character Jessie Lee.Plot The film begins at the turn of the 20th century when the United States was embroiled in the SpanishAmerican war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man serving with an allblack cavalry troop in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J Stephen Baldwin fasttalking Weezie Charles Lane and the toweringbutsimple Obobo Tiny Lister. They find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it. However the ambitious bigoted Colonel Graham Zane finds out about the gold and is apparently willing to kill Jessie Lee and company for it. A shootout between the Graham's forces and Jessie Lee's leaves the colonel blind in one eye and his forces retreat. Jessie Lee's ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves and the gold back to New Orleans but it turns out that Graham isn't far behind. Jessie Lee and his allies are forced to go on the run heading west to a town called Freemanville. Apparently Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. Jessie Lee's father King David was the charismatic preacher who cofounded the town. However as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks King David was soon brutally murdered by a white mob in a parallel of the Ku Klux Klan terror campaigns that began around the same time. Jessie Lee and company eventually find their way to Freemanville only to find that the townsfolk aren't exactly glad to see himespecially when Sheriff Bates Richard Jordan of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants Jessie Lee and his partnersdead or alive. Carver Blair Underwood is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanvilleand his own agenda may not square with having Jessie Lee around.Analysis The action sequences are all very credible and Mario Van Peebles turns in a good performance as the brooding hero. In the aftermath of the success of New Jack City it was almost expected Van Peebles would helm a sequel or at least a similar urbanaction followup. Instead Van Peebles looked 100 years into the past creating a mostlyblack Western effectively 'updating' the blackthemed Westerns of the 1970's and continuing the legacy of largelyforgotten blackthemed cowboy films from the early 20th century. Unlike New Jack City the film was independently financed and originally released through GramercyPolygram Entertainment. Allegedly execs at the major studios balked when Van Peebles pitched 'Posse' to them. Some of the more curious casting at the time involved rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel respectively. In certain interviews Mario Van Peebles has said that he often likes to cast against type in the years since the trend of casting rap singers in nonmusical films would become almost commonplace. Keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities Blackaction film veterans like Isaac Hayes Truck Turner Pam Grier Foxy Brown and Larry Cook The Spook who Sat by the Door show up as does standup legend Nipsey Russell not to mention TV producer Stephen J. Cannell who hired the junior Van Peebles to star in Sonny Spoon years earlier. The film is bookended with Woody Strode Spartacus in a key role.".

Well not really Unforgiven because that was a superb movie that these two can't compare with in the long run. I do think it beat out Tombstone though. Both had its strong points. For instance they both had excellent well known casts very good plots and very good filming. But Posse beat out Tombstone in four ways in my opinion. First the characters were more unique in Posse. The music was better in Posse. The idea was original in Posse unlike Wyatt Earp. And the biggest difference the action sequences! Oh my gosh! Posse was a western with really good action sequences. I mean really good! The action was fast paced. Like modern day based shoot'em up movies. The action had big budget explosions too! The fistfights were pretty good also.

	schema:headline " A Landmark AfricanAmerican Horse Opera!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "New Jack City director Mario Van Peebles and scenarists Sy Richardson and Dario Scardapane pay homage to virtually every memorable Hollywood western with Posse an elegant inventory of clichs ranging from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to Once Upon a Time in the West. Derivative as all getout this Rrated horse opera delivers a little bit of everything from a search for gold in Cuba to a desperate flight across the mountainous badlands of the American west. Although it borrows from every iconic oater Posse qualifies as one of the best AfricanAmerican westerns with a distinguished cast. White Sands lenser Peter Menzies Jr.'s stylistic cinematography endows this adventure a mythic largerthanlife grandeur. Aside from the atmospheric settings Posse benefits from Van Peebles's muscular helming and charismatic performance as the protagonist. He wears a flatbrimmed black hat has a couple of sixguns holstered in belts crisscrossing his waist. Of course he can brandish them like chained lightning and plug his adversaries deadcenter with every shot. Peebles surrounds himself with a firstrate cast including Woody Strode Stephen Baldwin Tommy 'Tiny' Lister Blair Underwood Billy Zane and Richard Jordan. This rugged hardriding horse opera unfolds initially in Cuba during the SpanishAmerican War in the 1890s. Arrogant U.S. Army Colonel Graham Billy Zane of Titanic orders Jesse Lee Mario Van Peebles of Heartbreak Ridge to take a group of predominantly AfricanAmericans in civilian clothes infiltrate enemy lines and bring back whatever he can find.

When Colonel Graham happens upon themprepared to shoot them as deserters and confiscate the loot for himselfJesse shoots him in the eye and escapes with the loot. One of Graham's disgraced AfricanAmerican troopers Weezie Charles Lane of True Identity turns against Graham and helps Jesse and company get away from Cuba. They are shipped out in coffins and taken to the mainland in Florida. From there our heroes light out for the Wild West. Graham follows them in hot pursuit with a patch over one eye and greed pumping through his veins.

Sheriff Bates Richard Jordan of Lawman is one of several men who killed Jesse's father King David Robert Hooks of Trouble Man and Jesse has vengeance loaded into his sixshooters. Incredibly enough the scene that sticks in the memory is the death of Jimmy J. 'Little J' Teeters Stephen Baldwin because a gang of angry whites beat 'Little J' to death in front of a crowd of AfricanAmericans. The irony here is revelatory. Posse proclaims proudly the exploits of AfricanAmericans on the frontier. Specifically Jesse's unit Buffalo Soldiers of the U.S. Army's 10th Cavalry Regiment. Similarly the legendary but largely forgotten Hollywood actor Woody Strode serves as the anonymous narrator who introduces and concludes the movie. Much of what he utters is designed to challenge audiences with a limited acquaintance with AfricanAmerican history. Indeed the other thing that sets Posse apart from every other western is its theatrical celebration of AfricanAmericans and AfricanAmerican History. Van Peebles orchestrates some slambang action scenes with lots of gunplay and explosions. The explosion that destroys the Gatlin gun in town looks like a napalm strike. As symbols of rank and authority Zane and Jordan constitute two truly slimy villains. Zane's creepy Graham howls rewards and retributions throughout Posse. Rounding out the cast are Pam Grier Isaac Hayes and his own father Melvin Van Peebles. Although its message gets heavyhanded at time Posse ranks as a landmark AfricanAmerican movie a solid western and an entertaining shoot'em up with a touch of inevitable romance.".

	onyx:emotionText "New Jack City director Mario Van Peebles and scenarists Sy Richardson and Dario Scardapane pay homage to virtually every memorable Hollywood western with Posse an elegant inventory of clichs ranging from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to Once Upon a Time in the West. Derivative as all getout this Rrated horse opera delivers a little bit of everything from a search for gold in Cuba to a desperate flight across the mountainous badlands of the American west. Although it borrows from every iconic oater Posse qualifies as one of the best AfricanAmerican westerns with a distinguished cast. White Sands lenser Peter Menzies Jr.'s stylistic cinematography endows this adventure a mythic largerthanlife grandeur. Aside from the atmospheric settings Posse benefits from Van Peebles's muscular helming and charismatic performance as the protagonist. He wears a flatbrimmed black hat has a couple of sixguns holstered in belts crisscrossing his waist. Of course he can brandish them like chained lightning and plug his adversaries deadcenter with every shot. Peebles surrounds himself with a firstrate cast including Woody Strode Stephen Baldwin Tommy 'Tiny' Lister Blair Underwood Billy Zane and Richard Jordan.

	schema:reviewBody "In many Western lore cowboy legends about lawmen outlaws and life in the Old Frontier period have been mostly centered around Caucasians. Very obscure do we ever examine the Wild West where AfricanAmericans have the chance to tell their own tales about them running their own cities laying down their own laws and fighting off against outlaws who want to stir trouble in their neck of the woods. There's not much reading material about this subject and very little Hollywood movies are ever made about AfricanAmericans striving in the rough scenery in the Old Frontier.Posse was a pivotal step to tell a great story in this compelling and refreshing story that is loaded with originality. It had potential to be a really good story sadly director Mario Van Peebles tends to go overboard by practically rubbing the story right inyourface to get his message across. At times the historical references become so overly done the actual story becomes secondary which can be very distracting and disjointed. It may look good for a documentary but for a movie it makes the entire story very thin. Aside from that the quickcuts from scenes are very distracting and the noisy backgrounds are also too loud that it upstages the dialogue provided.Van Peebles is without a doubt an excellent director. He was outstanding in the 1991 film New Jack City. So where are the flaws in Posse? Did he feel that the dryness from the basic story needed some muchneeded tweaking on the visual references? Did he just lean towards the style and forgot that a story to develop we also need substancebecause were weren't getting any here? Set after the SpanishAmerican War U.S. Army 10th Calvary Regiment led by Jessie Lee Van Peeblesjoins forces with Weezie Charles Lane Angel Tone Loc Obobo TinyLister and Caucasian ally Little J Stephen Baldwin courageously step up to winback their city from the corruption from racist outlaw Colonel Graham Billy Zane. The fight scenes feel very anticlimactic and the soundtrack just carries on like it's a an overlong music video.Once the war is over the Calvary heads home to Freemanville where Jessie grew up. Only to realize that his community has changed and is now been taken over by racist neighbors and a law enforcement that caters to white people. Therefore the posse joins forces to restore their town and to wipe out the corruption.For a story of this magnitude it had a lot of great material for a an interesting and provocative Western story that has never been looked upon. But instead we get a simplified lazily scripted visuallyladen shootemup fight between good against evil. The story line is never in full focus and the characters are not that easy to care about because the development is poorly structured. It's just too dependent on action but it's all without purpose.You've heard of the quote too many cooks spoil the broth. Well Van Peebles casts a plethora of big name stars from Isaac Hayes to Blair Underwood from Pam Grier to Nipsy Russell. Well as big as those names are they don't really have much to do here and that an extra would've been better cast in their roles.When all the dust settles all the message we get is that white people then and now continually deprive the black man from equal opportunity no matter how much they have succeeded over years. The freely utilized preachy ways were handed out to what the story failed to offer. If these closing messages were with us the whole time Posse would've been a better film instead of succumbing to an endless array of sloganeering.".

His bantering back and forth with JesseMarioVP Lil JayBaldwin and the others was something else! If you don't like Mario Van Peebles' movies don't let that keep you from seeing this movie! I don't remember liking any other role that he does in any other movieexcept possibly Mama Flora's Family but I do give him an A for this. He acted seriously as a leader of men. If you only looked at Jesse Lee in this movie you would be thinking that he's a Denzel or Hanks type actor.

There are also other famous starsGrier VelJohnson Hayes etc. in minor roles. Meteor Man once tried to do a similar thinga lot of good to very good actors in one place but that movie has nothing at all on this! It seems like everyone did a pretty good or better job. What's under the hood? It's a western that has humor harmonious characters and war between people just trying to survivewith only agility amateur gun and a few fast guns and able fighters on their side and extremely racist people and their allieswith military weapons on their side. A few gunfighting scene seems a little surreal most of them seems at least good. It also was well written. That being said tiny parts appear to be illumatic in nature the alternate religion and calling its doctrine the good bookbible has been called that and crafting a king Davidwho had moralistic but antibiblical beliefs.

With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing. It is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites.

If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously. With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. Al Gores portrayal is hilarious Cartman's scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing. It is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites. I'll won't comment too much further on the plot because I don't want to give anything away.";

Al Gore here is more than hilarious everyone who sees him feel sorry for him and yes he can childish doing tantrums since nobody believes him but he is just a f demented bastard. Basically four kids are trapped in a cave because of Al Gore but certainly he don't have that in his mind there's not space for any other subject is just Manbearpig what concerns Al Gore. Those four kids are Cartman Kenny Kyle and Stan basically Stan felt sorry for AL Gore and the four boys were just playing in Al Gore's game never imaging that Gore could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbearpig hilarious scene they are just children damned Manbearpig. So at this part we have on one hand all the stuff with the rescue team who also feel sorry for Al Gore and on the other hand we have a little yet extremely hilarious Cartman episode and there are not surprises of the attitude of Cartman after he finds a treasure inside the cave certainly the whole stuff with this treasure is fantastic and is great because you will see a sick Cartman in both senses he is really sick for the boys and really sick for us. And in the end Al Gore does killed Manbearpig! This character is a fantastic one and I'm cereal! Terrific fun in this episode a highly rewatchable one. 10 out of 10".

But Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian in part because Norton's beautiful daughter Casey Valerie Bertinelli has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her. However Brian does come up with a great security device. It's called CHOMPS which stands for canine home security system. The device which looks like a dog is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. The rival owner sends two bungling spies one is Red Buttons to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a fun family flick from the old school of good clean entertainment. CHOMPS is of course a real dog played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact Benji has a duel role as Brian has a real dog named Rascal too. Just watching this little dog in action is pure joy as he is able to scale walls pull trucks and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys. The human cast is also quite nice with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious. Costumes scenery and production values are good too. Although you may have trouble locating the film it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful wholesome diversion from the world's woes.".

It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty personal behavior and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes. This movie which is delightful to all ages offers an interesting humorous look into our own experiences. Everyone will recognize personality and behaviors types of themselves and others. Everyone will see the humor. The humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level. For lighthearted laughter and a 'feel good' movie Chomps is an excellent choice. Memorable.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw Chomps during the  approximately  2 days of its theatrical release. It is a delightfully cute and funny movie in the spirit of 'Benji' though much improved and focused more on the actors than the dogs. The simple portrayal of life difficulties in a humorous way followed by the bullies and villains getting their just deserts is both sympathetic and heartwarming. It is also thought provoking. With deft subtleness this movie affects ones awareness of cruelty personal behavior and bullying. Movies have different genera's and different purposes. This movie which is delightful to all ages offers an interesting humorous look into our own experiences. Everyone will recognize personality and behaviors types of themselves and others. Everyone will see the humor. The humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level. For lighthearted laughter and a 'feel good' movie Chomps is an excellent choice. Memorable.";

The acting is typical Disney and you see a lot of the same faces as in other Disney movies. The plot revolves around an inventor that develops a robotic dog security system who looks just like his real small dog. A lot of the comedy comes from watching this tiny little dog beat up the bad guys bust through brick walls and otherwise perform amazing stuntsreally well done. This is a movie for the whole family although the kids will probably cry just like I did in the one really sad part of the movie and no I won't blow it for you. This is another Disney classic along the lines of The computer that wore tennis shoes and Flight of the Navigator. For it's time this movie was way ahead and is also just plain good sci fi.

At the series' best the cartoons were good very good in a few cases. At its worst they were really bad.'Plane Dumb' following on from one of the best in the series 'The Tuba Tooter' is down there with their worst actually a strong contender for THE worst. And there is a lot more wrong to 'Plane Dumb' than being widely and unsurprisingly considered one of the most racially offensive cartoons ever made just to make that clear before anybody asks. Although the flaws are far more numerous and more glaring 'Plane Dumb' is not without redeeming qualities. The best thing about it like pretty much all the worst of their cartoons is the music score. It is lively characterful and beautifully and cleverly orchestrated and not only adds to the action but enhances it and gives the cartoon the energy that is sorely lacking elsewhere. The other redeeming quality is the suitably menacing animation on the whale.Regarding the racially offensive stereotypes before any attacks start there is the acknowledgement that there were plenty of stereotypes in cartoons and films in the 30s some of them not being subtle or kind. Very few if any were as littered with racial stereotypes as much as 'Plane Dumb' and in a way that's this distastefully overthetop and unsubtle not just in the ugly character designs but also in the way they speak their dialogue and the way they act. Far more offensive than any of the stereotypes in the Censored 11 cartoons including the most offensive of that collection 'Angel Puss'. Not just that none of them will fly or bode well with anybody today and are too far of its time to be relevant or current anybody will find this is the case regardless of skin colour.As said however 'Plane Dumb' has far more problems to it than just being offensive. Apart from the animation of the whale the animation is far too simplistic and static with little imaginative about the backgrounds sloppy synchronisation and it's best not mentioning the character designs. Tom and Jerry themselves have rarely been the most compelling of characters they are not just bland here but they have seldom been more annoying. When they are literally unrecognisable for most of the cartoon for obvious reasons it is hard to believe that it's them they feel like completely different characters.Humour also just isn't there. The timing is dull throughout and the gags are too few and lack any inventiveness or comic timing of any kind the usual strangeness and absurdity that is basically the tone of the series do not come through. This is because of 'Plane Dumb' being uncharacteristically for a Tom and Jerry cartoon dialogueheavy and while different can work in this case that was a huge mistake. The reason being that the dialogue itself and its winceworthy stereotypical nature is cringeinducing. There is nothing funny or endearing about it it's basically annoying and overboard dumb and nothing else. The story is never a strong suit in their cartoons this story is one of the flimsiest and also one of the dumbest and most senseless.Overall of an uneven series 'Plane Dumb' is one of the worst and very bad ones. 210 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Tom and Jerry are transporting goods via airplane to Africa. But being white men they're worried they won't be safe so they put on blackface to fit in. Once they're wearing it they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before reaching land they suffer the advances of an overaffectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks a swordfish and a whale. Once on land they're frightened by fantastic creatures and duck into a cave. Inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface. And upon exiting the cave things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals.Plane Dumb is an especially sloppy effort from Van Beuren Studios. One example a lion unknown to Tom and Jerry enters the cave before they do. But the animators must have forgotten about it because the lion never appears again. Another example is the ending that's not an ending it's just an arbitrary stop.According to a YouTube poster the cartoon was originally intended to feature the voices AND caricatures of a popular 'Negro' comedy team known as Miller  Lyles. But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed and codirectors John Foster  George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into a 'Tom  Jerry' story.They shouldn't have bothered. The crude animation and poorlyexecuted gags make the film a loser from beginning to end.".

Learning from Madame Volosca Brinke Stevens about his and his friend's fate he finally leaves the carnival.The Good News I have never liked Carnival Sideshows for this reason they are creepy and make me uncomfortable to be around. This film perfectly captures this spirit and does it well. This is a carnival that actually seems creepy because the freaks in it are not the usual freaks in a sideshow. All of them are also pretty unexpected as well. They were pretty scary realized and manipulated yet shared the inhumanity that makes them look like sideshow freaks. All of them were also designed to creep people out and they did creep me out. What was also new was that there was one person left alive at the end. Normally these movies kill off all of the characters and left town. This was a very nice and new touch that not many films would try to get. It has that Wishmaster vibe to it that those who get wishes will get their just rewards. I really like this theme for films and it should become a more regular fixture in friends.The Bad News Unless watching the freaks in the sideshow is not upsetting for you then this may be a less enjoyable film. I really can't see why but it can seem that way. Like all Full Moon films this contains no jumps or shocks to make it a more interesting experience. This has to become a very noticeable change in their films as I've only found one film Shrunken Heads that contains a jump. With all the films in their catalog they do have a niche but it isn't among those that like to be scared with their horror films.The Final Verdict Unless you like Full Moon films or hate carnivals this would should be approached with caution. It does star two cult stars Brinke Stevens and Phil Fondacaro but the fact is that it does need something else. Take a chance which is all I can say.Rated R Violence Graphic Language and Nudity".

	schema:reviewBody "Full Moon Studios is a film production company that mainly does horror films. In fact that may be all they do. They had a few good films back in the day their strongest period probably being in the 80's as in the 90's they made nearly everything a horrorcomedy. They never were as bad as Troma though as their films felt like they were almost big time but not quite while everything about Troma says cheap. That being said for the most part I really do not care for the movies this studio churned out during the 90's. A lot of them had potential but just missed the mark and some of them were just horrid abominations that never even should have been conceived. This one I found to be kind of okay which is high praise indeed for one of their movies made after like 91 or so. It was not a great film by any means but I was enjoying what they were presenting and even if I were hating it one thing nearly every Full Moon Studio film does is end fairly quickly as they usually do not clock in over 1 hour 20 minutes. The film's main fault I found was that it did end too quickly as one minute it was on the next it was over.The story has a group of sort of friends going to a carnival. The group consists of an obnoxious dude that wants to be the center of attention his friend who seems to be the most sensible a girl who wants to be worshiped but has space issues a girl who wants a hot body and the sensible boy's brother who is confined to a chair. The obnoxious guy has trouble with one of the games and the wheelchair bound boy figures the game is rigged and after this the proprietor of the freak show seems to take an interest which grows when the obnoxious person makes fun of the proprietor for being a little person. They go into a fortune telling hut where they are read their fortunes and they also get tickets to the freak show where they see some rather disturbing freaks and soon the girl who wants a perfect body goes missing. The friends with the exception of the sensible one just have to try and search for her which brings them all into danger! The freaks were pretty good as the strange bug man looked rather good as did inside out girl. The one guy whose brother lived in in his belly was right out of Total Recall and then they had one that I did not get at all in Digestina. They billed her as being able to eat anything but all she did was sit in a vat of acid it seemed. She kind of made no sense however she was the hottest girl in the film. The teens are all idiots and probably deserved worse than they got. The sensible guy though ended up just in a field and then the movie ended. Not sure what that was all about as in this particular case I kind of wanted the film to go on a bit. Ross Hagen turns up in a bit part as the sheriff and Phil Fondacaro as the proprietor does a really good job in this one too.So perhaps had they worked on the ending I would have enjoyed it more. The film plays out as kind of a dirtier version of Something Wicked This Way Comes but with less chills. You never get a real sense of danger in this one as you really do not care about the group of friends except maybe the guy who keeps telling everyone they should leave but they want to stay to find their friend but not really. They all have kind of selfish reasons for wanting to find the girl and they all get what they deserve. This one might have been even better had they done it earlier as back in the day Full Moon films did not have enormous budgets but more than the 120000 this one had. They generally had 1000000 which may not sound a lot by today's standards but could have helped this film out a lot as there is a cheapness about it. Still it was kind of okay just wish they worked on that ending a bit more.".

	schema:reviewBody "A group of teenagers visit a freakshow attraction at a traveling carnival. The kids are all taught nasty lessons about themselves from sinister ringleader Abbot Graves marvelously played with tremendous theatrical flair by Phil Fondacaro. Director Fred Olen Ray relates the gnarly macabre premise at a quick pace does a good job of capturing and conveying the creepy seediness of the carnival setting and maintains both a pleasingly eerie mood and a grimly serious tone throughout. The acceptable acting by the competent noname thespians who portray the kids keeps the picture humming Jamie Martz as the meek Bobby Michael Amos as mean jerk Tommy Scott Clark as sympathetic wheelchairbound cripple Grant Jessica Keenan as the stuckup Melanie and Jeana Blackman as frumpy and insecure wallflower Jeanie. The makeup by Gabe Bartalos for the various freaks is strikingly grotesque and imaginative my favorites are the luscious Curran Sympson as Aelita the insideout girl  she does a truly sick variation on your standard striptease!  and Peter Spellos as ConjoinO who has a head living in his stomach. Benjamin Carr's twisted script has a dark fairytalelike quality with the kids all meeting appropriately nightmarish fates that reveal their true natures. Popping up in snazzy small parts are Brinke Stevens as fortune teller Madame Volosca and Ross Hagen as the crusty sheriff. Mac Ahlberg's sharp cinematography and the shivery score both further enhance the overall spooky oogabooga atmosphere. An enjoyable horror outing.".

The kids are all taught nasty lessons about themselves from sinister ringleader Abbot Graves marvelously played with tremendous theatrical flair by Phil Fondacaro. Director Fred Olen Ray relates the gnarly macabre premise at a quick pace does a good job of capturing and conveying the creepy seediness of the carnival setting and maintains both a pleasingly eerie mood and a grimly serious tone throughout. The acceptable acting by the competent noname thespians who portray the kids keeps the picture humming Jamie Martz as the meek Bobby Michael Amos as mean jerk Tommy Scott Clark as sympathetic wheelchairbound cripple Grant Jessica Keenan as the stuckup Melanie and Jeana Blackman as frumpy and insecure wallflower Jeanie. The makeup by Gabe Bartalos for the various freaks is strikingly grotesque and imaginative my favorites are the luscious Curran Sympson as Aelita the insideout girl  she does a truly sick variation on your standard striptease!  and Peter Spellos as ConjoinO who has a head living in his stomach. Benjamin Carr's twisted script has a dark fairytalelike quality with the kids all meeting appropriately nightmarish fates that reveal their true natures. Popping up in snazzy small parts are Brinke Stevens as fortune teller Madame Volosca and Ross Hagen as the crusty sheriff. Mac Ahlberg's sharp cinematography and the shivery score both further enhance the overall spooky oogabooga atmosphere. An enjoyable horror outing.";

In real life I doubt if they would let this nutball within 100 miles of the President.  Sporting a strange mullet haircut carrying a cane and wearing a poloneck white sweater Ron Casteel is the most conspicuous undercover agent I've seen.  In moments of tension he is prone to make philosophical speeches From the moment I was born I started dying one begins and recite poetry.He and a colleague investigate VERY SLOWLY.  Even though the film has an extremely short running time it seems very long mainly because every scene is extended to at least twice its natural life accompanied by irritating and often completely inappropriate music no less than five composers worked on the film!There is some impressive location work on the Golden Gate Bridge at the film's climax and I guess that is where most of the money went.  Absurdly even though our heroes have discovered the location of the bomb apparently they don't inform anybody else.  San Francisco is about to be nuked and yet there aren't squads of police atomic scientists and bomb disposal experts milling around just our two heroes shooting it out with the baddy as the countdown continues.  This lunatic farrago comes to a climax that is  well let's just say it's highly unusual and very much in keeping with the rest of the film!".

Ground Zero could almost be a cult film for its amazing level of weird dated badness.The plot concern some gangsters being on trial and a man holding the city hostage with an atomic bomb in the golden gate bridge to blackmail the gangsters release. Our heroes are a ugly secret service guy who talks like he's in a bad radio show from the 30s and his wuss of a partner who hates violence but at least acts better than most of the cast. They shoot people drive around San Francisco fight and exchange terrible dialogue.The only real strength Ground Zero displays is wide angle shots from the top of the Golden Gate bridge. It is neat to see those dizzying angles from way up there. All the bridge location stuff looks pretty good. The atomic bomb that's there waiting to go off looks terrible and the script is useless but that bridge still looks fine.Also this thing is slow. It's only about 80 minutes but they drag so badly. While we were watching it my friend and I just found ourselves talking about way better movies like It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and such. So yes please don't watch this unless you're drunk or something.".

Ground Zero could almost be a cult film for its amazing level of weird dated badness.The plot concern some gangsters being on trial and a man holding the city hostage with an atomic bomb in the golden gate bridge to blackmail the gangsters release. Our heroes are a ugly secret service guy who talks like he's in a bad radio show from the 30s and his wuss of a partner who hates violence but at least acts better than most of the cast. They shoot people drive around San Francisco fight and exchange terrible dialogue.The only real strength Ground Zero displays is wide angle shots from the top of the Golden Gate bridge. It is neat to see those dizzying angles from way up there. All the bridge location stuff looks pretty good. The atomic bomb that's there waiting to go off looks terrible and the script is useless but that bridge still looks fine.Also this thing is slow. It's only about 80 minutes but they drag so badly. While we were watching it my friend and I just found ourselves talking about way better movies like It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and such. So yes please don't watch this unless you're drunk or something.";

Though the film doesn't go into the tragic stuff so much one can sense that Bruce accepted the price of making music his way. There are so many elements that make up his legacy IE. invention of the Peopleodian where Bruce could actually play music by touching people. It must have been challenging to document Haack's 'scatterbrained' output which pretty much fell into every musical category imaginable even rap music but the director cut the piece together very coherently and managed to capture the spirit. And the cast... what a group of characters Bruce surrounded himself with but what do you expect from a telepathic guru tripping with kids fighting against the music industry. I recommend this film to anyone interested in music history it's that mainstream but that important.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had heard about Bruce Haack in college when I studied electronic music. He was presented to me at the time in the same vein as Theremin Paul and Moog that is as an innovator in technology who was also an accomplished musician. But that was all he was a name in my textbook.Then a few years ago I was doing some research on synthesizers and I came across his name again. This time I read about his children's songs and his Electric Lucifer album. I was intrigued but couldn't locate any of his work easily and eventually his name dropped to the bottom of my must get lists.So when this was released on DVD it caught my eye and I found a copy. I already knew a little about Mr. Haack and this film definitely expanded my knowledge of his life his work and to some degree his thoughts on his life and work. There are some interviews with his friends and colleagues many examples of his work and even some amazing video footage from What's My Line? and Mister Rogers Neighborhood.But the film has weak spots. There are many interviews with DJs and modern electronica artists who come off as not very articulate and they add very little except to say Bruce Haack used synthesizers and now I do too... kind of a rahrah chorus section GOOOOOO BRUCE!.There isn't enough interview time with Esther Nelson the children's dance instructor with whom Mr. Haack made so much wonderful music. And there is too much time spent with Chris Kachulis who for some reason wears a wifebeater shirt and looks as if he is homeless.While it seemed to me that most of the important nexustype events in Mr. Haack's life were presented there was scant mention of the alcohol and drug use that was apparently VERY prevalent in his lifestyle. I thought that was a selfcensoring mistake... it was a part of his life a part of him and his music and should have been presented in an upfront matteroffact manner rather than glossed over. It's even directly relevant to The Electric Lucifer album the music scene in America at the time his state of mind when composing and recording etc.I would have liked to have seen more of his inventions. I was left feeling that anything he made was lost or buried with him and I think it would have been cool to have seen them demonstrated with recently shot footage the video clips from the 60s are less than excellent quality.Also the flow of the film is uneven it frequently abandons any kind of linear or chronological format to show a DJ interview and then a TV clip and then back to something else... it's somewhat disjointed and seems more like a 45 minute TV show with lots of DJ interview filler.Like I said tho I DID come away knowing more than when I sat down so this is by no means a waste of time or money. It's just not quite as entertaining or quite as informative as I would have liked.Bo".

It definitely has a fan worship feel about it which is a good thing.I had heard of Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him and I found the start of this documentary frustrating because I could hear other musicians talk about him but Bruce Haack himself was kept way too far off in the distance. I wanted to see this Bruce Haack guy!! I felt as though the makers assumed I already knew him as well as these musicians on the screen which I didn't so I felt a bit left in the dark.When Bruce was finally shown in action it was great and gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was but it was only a taste. We got treated to more musicians and I felt as though I was being told Look  all these cool musicians are into him so he must be cool! I didn't really care much for the musician's commentary on Bruce.I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know the important stuff  more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life and yes his use of drugs and other issues. I would of liked to know so much more about his Hackula project. I wanted to get inside his mind. Even if they did this via some voice of god commentary and photos it would of been OK.The animations were good but again I felt these were used as filler they didn't really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the Dimension 5 records. I did think it was clever and creative but again... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! Maybe Bruce Haack was this elusive in real life?Anyway  in the end I enjoyed this documentary and felt a sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses such as Mr. Haack get forgotten as the march of time stamps ever onwards.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all kudos to the director for making a documentary about Bruce Haack. I doubt anyone else would have due to Haack's obscurity. However that also puts a lot of obligation on the shoulders of the director since his work will probably be one of the sole reference works about Haack in the future. Unfortunately I think there's problems in that aspect but more on that later.The documentary starts off well by introducing Haack with some basic background information. There's some good insights into Haack's personality as a musician with some interesting anecdotes and facts. I was under the impression that Haack eventually ended up dropping out of Julliard so I thought it was odd that there was no mention of this. Furthermore there was no mention of the fact that he had a degree psychology which I think is important to his approach to music. From the relatively good start the movies goes into a somewhat confusing segment which features a group of people who had known Haack when they were kids. I never really came to understand their relationship to Haack and I think the director used their commentaries to little effect. This is also a problem in the various interviews with modern day DJs and electronic musicians. Few of them seemed to be particularly inspired or influenced by him and merely seemed to be interested in his music because of his status as an obscure pioneer of the genre. As such they added very little to the documentary. I'm not putting down the artists for their comments but merely the way their commentary had been integrated into the documentary as such.There is little information about Haack's methods of composition as an electronic musician. His use of vocoders which I personally think is one of Haack's principle distinctions as a pioneer is not mentioned once. I was also disappointed that no real attempts were made to draw any parallels between Haack's lyrics and his life. Especially since I have always found his lyrical themes and concepts religion powerlove computerization of mankind etc to be particularly unique. Generally there should have been made a better distinction between his work as a composer of children's music and his more serious outputs. There are huge differences. Ideally the director should have gone through and properly described sort of like how he did with Haackula but more thoroughly some of Haack's most important albums. So all in all this documentary is not that bad but it definitely has its share of problems. Frankly the angle of trying to make Haack into the Godfather of Techno does not really work. It's a shame because this is probably the only time someone will do a serious attempt of shedding some light on the otherwise enigmatic and obscure Bruce Haack.".

	schema:headline " A PornoMusical? Yes and a very enjoyable one!";
	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw Alice in Wonderland  an Xrated Musical Comedy was in the early '80 in a MovieTheater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we actually enjoyed it very much although we were left wondering why all the goodies were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one leaving us guessing...what we just missed. Obviously it was the softcore edited chopped version which left me with the desire to watch it again soon but in its original integral version. Well more then 20 years went by during which I forgot all about this movie and only a few days ago by sheer chance I stumbled upon a heavily used VHS copy which had seen better times a bit washedout colors scratchy sound and a few flaws but guess what? It's the original uncut version and this time I really had a ball! Humor Musical and Porn may sound an awkward combination but in this case it really works and unlikely the big majority of boring pornflicks nowadays invading our screens this is a really amusing and entertaining sex fantasy which will not disappoint you. The direction is clever the swift editing makes the movie fly like a bird all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain funny all the actors seem having a good time the songs are catchy worth mentioning the one about growing up sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious What's a nice girl like you doing on a Knight like this the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged amazingly energetic Terry Hall proves that she can also dance and dances enthusiastically her guts away...Don't worry she also does what she was best known for... the acting the singing the set the costumes are of quality level and then...there is Kristine Blue Eyes DeBell in the first starring role of her career and oh boy! she indeed has a few H.C. sequences! Personally I think they are absolutely not distasteful on the contrary they are spontaneous and quite arousing. She is young and ohhh! so very pretty with the help of her new friends in Wonderland she discovers her body and her sexuality so she sings she dances and...what do you expect? She is also experimenting sex! The closing sequence when she finally makes love to her boyfriend is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her physique du role the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile and her acting ability make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable. There is plenty of sex going on in this Wonderland and everybody seems eager to get busy with the first available boys or girls which means lot of hardcore action to be seen. On the other hand some closeup shots clearly spliced in just to make the pornhounds really happy are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general however the sexaction is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music the dances and the comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex watch it together. Take my word you will have an hour and a half of very good time perhaps also an aftershow extra action... This is Adult Entertainment so be careful don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos. If your 10 years old can put his hands on it he might amuse himself but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why this Alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in Lewis Carroll novel or he watched on the Disney's video. I bet you will not forget this oneofakind very soon. It's a real shame that they don't mak'em like that anymore...! I give it a 9 out of 10.".

Here Alice is a virginal librarian who falls down the rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self image. Made at the time when adult films were creative endeavors with plots instead of just a series of sex scenes this is a good looking little movie more akin to the low budget films of its day. Despite what you may think this film actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. Its an naughty little tale for adults. If you're wondering whether or not my recommendation is a good one or not consider that the film was pretty much only available in its nonhardcore version for the better part of the last three decades simply because the film stands up with out the sex which is how I first saw the film years ago on cable TV. The relatively recent home video release on DVD put back the sex in horribly grainy inserted clips which makes it clear the removal of the shots was the best choice all around. If you're an open minded adult with a taste for something spicy I can heartily recommend this little film as a nice diversion.".

As much as I enjoyed the oneonone with him that the media caused there was never a video that I really enjoyed.  I had seen only one other movie way back when there was a satellite channel called XXX it dealt with a private eye unraveling a case that actually had a proper plot and was enjoyable.  All the others were grunting and puffing and blowing and whatnot.  There's only so many times you can watch a blonde bimbo faking 'it'.This movie caught my eye and I migrated to it allowing him to wander the shop.  He noticed how hard was it not too? grins. I was actually interested in something lol! in the video section! and came over buying the slightly used copy for me.  We took it home and I loved it.  Here was a Porno with a plot.  I wasn't sure it even classified as porno but I use the word loosely.The librarian was a character I could identify with.  Alice rejected her boyfriend's advances. She was not comfortable with her own sexuality and prudish in her comments.  Bill went away and she continued to check in books.  The White Rabbit ran through the library one book if you notice closely I believe it's been ten years since I saw the movie was by Lewis C. and Alice for that same reason that propels teenagers to run into the woods when a chainsaw wielding maniac is behind them rather than towards populated areas follows.  It's the best way to get the plot forward. Alice finds herself in Wonderland.I barely recall all the details but I do remember clearly the swim in the lake and how she was dried off.  I liked how they got Humpty Dumpty Up again the Mad Hatter's size of member being on his hat to wear it proudly and the brother sister team of Dum and Dee which did disturb me slightlythen again they could have been husband wife but I never could tell no matter how many times I watched it.  The woman on the knight who told Alice go away and find your own Knight What's a A Nice Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This?.The part that really caught my attention when I watched it about a year or so later was one of the cards 3 of hearts I think who resembled my ex's current wife exactly! We couldn't help but tease her about being in the movie! The King of Hearts was interesting and the Queen was even more so. Due to the openness of the forum I can't go into details just say it was orgy based and we'll leave it at that!When we split up I was allowed to take the videohe knew I liked itbut in the time since it's been lost in borrowing.  Someday I'll find another copy.Btw if anyone could tell me offlist what scene was cut from the Amazon version I'd really appreciate it.I heartily recommend this movie for the over 18 crowd.

	schema:reviewBody "Alice Kristine DeBell enters in a world of wonder... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid. The Mad Hatter the White Rabbit the Queen and others even Tweedledee and Tweedledum show Alice some things about her body  and other people's bodies  that might be quite wonderful. A tale of love and lust the likes you have never seen.The story of how Kristine DeBell got involved with this is interesting. According to her she was a model at the Ford Agency and saw that there were auditions for this film. She did not know what kind of movie it was so she tried out and landed the part. Now exactly what point she figured out what sort of movie it is is unclear but we do know that she ended up going through with it.The producer was Bill Osco probably best known at that point and maybe even today for Flesh Gordon.

But personally I think there is something very special about this film and I hope it gets a nice DVD release with the sound and picture touched up and special features if that is even possible.

Why she agreed to do the first is still a mystery.Through Osco she got the lead in another cult though not adult film The Great American Girl Robbery 1979. And who coproduced with Osco? None other than Chuck Russell who went on to direct such films as The Blob and Nightmare on Elm Street 3! Through some small miracle DeBell escaped the world of adult films and bmovie shlock appearing in Meatballs and being a successful star ever since.While that may be a small tangent off the point of Alice it is relevant what could have been a forgotten bizarre attempt at an adult musical actually lead to the career of a mainstream actress and indirectly an incredible horror director.

The Mad Hatter the White Rabbit the Queen and others even Tweedledee and Tweedledum show Alice some things about her body  and other people's bodies  that might be quite wonderful. A tale of love and lust the likes you have never seen.The story of how Kristine DeBell got involved with this is interesting. According to her she was a model at the Ford Agency and saw that there were auditions for this film. She did not know what kind of movie it was so she tried out and landed the part. Now exactly what point she figured out what sort of movie it is is unclear but we do know that she ended up going through with it.The producer was Bill Osco probably best known at that point and maybe even today for Flesh Gordon. The director Bud Townsend had made a few horror films Terror House and Nightmare in Wax which are largely forgotten today even by fans of cult horror.In Alice the songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie.

And Reagan's tiresome hypocrisies had yet to mar this land when it was released but in a way he and his stooge Meese did affect Ms DeBell.  When Meese was staging his antipornography commission to distract people from his own criminal activities Meese hired the services of an antiporn activist named Judith Reisner.  Reisner was obsessed with images she perceived as child pornography.  She saw the Alice cover Ms DeBell did for Playboy and promptly announced she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was in fact a photo collage of parts from several grown women and the face of a ten year old.

	schema:headline " Alice is really deep in that rabbit hole. This will be a visually impressive yet incoherent mess for sure.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is Adult Entertainment so be careful don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos. This Xrated movie was very trippy and weird. It would make author Lewis Carroll really mad in a happy way. I'll give the movie some credit. It didn't bother trying to put logic into it like other film versions. Still it does make you wonder what were the producers smoking when they thought to put Alice in Wonderland into a musical porno. Directed by Bud Townsend this movie is loosely based on the novel Through the Looking Glass Lewis Carroll's second book in the Alice in Wonderland books. This movie shouldn't confused with the Disney's 1951  2010's Alice in Wonderland versions as it barely haves anything to do with them. In this version Alice Kristine De Bell is an adult virgin librarian who trying to find out if she wants to put out or not for her annoying hounddog boyfriend William Ron Nelson. Stress over the issue she falls into a wetdreamlike state where she find herself living sexual fantasies with the White rabbit Larry Gelman the Mad Hatter Alan Novak  other odd creatures. There are three versions of this film an R Rated softcore sex romp an Xrated version and the Triple X. In my opinion the best one is the XRated version. There are a few skips here and there due to editing but this is a very clean goodlooking transfer especially considering it was scrapped from less than optimal source materials. The surroundings really jump out and fleshtones during the nude scenes are stunningly precise. The Rated R version looks like it was cheaply copy off a VCR. You can clearly see the tracking in certain scenes and the colors was somewhat warped and blurry. The XXX version on the other hand is the worst. The hardcore scenes have been inserted from rather ugly discolor print source with the wrong ratio with little to no music supporting the erotica. At least the sex scenes weren't too degrading. For a porno movie they treat the women who work in the film with a little more respect and understood how far they can take it with the actresses. The sex scenes with Alice getting lick by cat people was somewhat artsy. The scene where Alice was masturbating near the waterfall was somewhat beautiful. The background music during this scene really set the mood right. Then the scene where she assist in making repairs to Humpty Dumpty Bradford Armdexter was funny and clever but one of the most upsetting scenes in the film was the couple Tony and Sue Tsengoles that play the twins Tweedledee  Tweedledum. I really didn't the whole fake Twins incest sex scene. Watching two people that look like each other do it was just awful. I also didn't like how slutty and dirty every other woman in the film looks in the film. Where did they get these women? The Queen of Hearts Juliet Graham looks like she came from BDSM crack house at Times Square. The nurses look like they did a line of heroin before showing up for the film shoot. Not attractive. Not at all. At least Alice looks presentable. She was very attractive and had the charm to carry the film. Her singing and acting was alright but the cheesy dialogue they fed her wasn't helping her film career. I just glad they made Alice into adult rather than trying to make her look younger. I don't wish for the film to go the paedophilia route. The Mad Hatter and White Rabbit were pretty amusing in a goofy sort of way. I like how cheap the White Rabbit looks. His ears looks more like a Russian winter fur hat with ear flaps than rabbit ears. I just wish they added more characters from the book like the Blue Caterpillar and the Cheshire Cat. While I don't approve of pornography based off children novels. The movie feel like it was trying to go all feminist 'sexual awakening' with its tone. While the movie isn't in the same level as Sigmund Freud or Dr. Kinsey case report. The movie felt a character study of the psychosexual development during female adolescences. The movie does tackle the sexual consciousness stereotype of gender role and psychosexual orientations meanwhile living the gonzo '70s spirit of a pornchic film with some wit and style. There are several songs and alright dance numbers. All of them looks like they were having fun. The musical numbers including the funkgospel Each and Every Moment the heroine's anthem Busy Growing Up and the ridiculous What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This. My favorite has to be 'the Humpty Dumpty bring it up' song. All the music is extremely catchy and supports by classical jazz hits help the onscreen action perfectly. I love the New Orleans type feel music that would play during the title cards. The movie was surprising very funny. It had tons of meta humor sexual innuendos breaking the fourth wall jokes and puns. It gets even more zappy toward the end while the movie stops being a movie and just continues to run with weird quick cuts. The film was produced by adult film mogul Bill Osco. Originally Osco shot the film on the cheap with Adult Cinema intentions. But after a warm reception at a Seattle Film Festival he managed to sell a recut version of the film to 20th Century Fox. It was just that the timing wasn't right for Osco. While he was able to have the prints ready his movie was playing against 1977's Star Wars. It didn't do so well at the box office. Overall This porno movie is pretty unique. A rare kind. A surreal mustwatch acid trip.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim California in October 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets  we saw a movie marquee advertising ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX. So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid ultraconservative Orange County.Thirty two years later I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store. I wondered to myself if this was the same film until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely Kristine DeBell in the starring role and decided to rekindle some fond memories. Subversive Video to their credit has released two versions X and XXX in the same package. As it turns out the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X in spite of the original XXX advertising at the there. Seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of this man's scope behind the camera in his salad days he directed two episodes of TV's DEATH VALLEY DAYS.Miss DeBell appearing in the April 1976 cover of Playboy is ideal as Alice. She brings a fresh all American innocence to the role as a librarian in her early twenties yearning for a better life.

	onyx:emotionText "I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim California in October 1976. While driving the tourist laden city streets  we saw a movie marquee advertising ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX. So before even checking out Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic a half mile away our curiosity won out and we ventured into this cinematic threshold. I remember even before the movie began how surprised I was to see this kind of film appearing in staid ultraconservative Orange County.Thirty two years later I came across ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store. I wondered to myself if this was the same film until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw a picture of lovely Kristine DeBell in the starring role and decided to rekindle some fond memories. Subversive Video to their credit has released two versions X and XXX in the same package. As it turns out the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X in spite of the original XXX advertising at the there. Seeing it the second time around makes me realize what a delightful romp director Bud Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of this man's scope behind the camera in his salad days he directed two episodes of TV's DEATH VALLEY DAYS.Miss DeBell appearing in the April 1976 cover of Playboy is ideal as Alice. She brings a fresh all American innocence to the role as a librarian in her early twenties yearning for a better life. When her boyfriend is rebuffed from taking their relationship to the next level Alice reaches her turning point. This is a 'musical comedy' yet the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to offset the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice as she trills about wanting to be free. That's when the magic begins.

	schema:reviewBody "I would probably not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the constant references made to it here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is or should be regarded as pornographic remains a relic of the 'guidance' provided to film makers by the Hayes committee many many years ago and it is now really time that we relegate it to the past. So far we have not progressed far beyond establishing a somewhat arbitrary division between what we now term 'soft' and 'hard' porn with both carrying the same pornography label. It is time for us all recognise that neither the R rated soft porn? release version of this film nor the unrated version hard porn? available on DVD were in any way pornographic.In legal terms pornography is defined by its capacity to deprave or corrupt. Many classic books such as Lady Chatterley's lover Fanny Hill Women in Love The Story of 'O' or Moll Flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography. Although the Hayes code would have rated AIW as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment. In AIW we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do. After he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a Wonderland closely based on that of Lewis Carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs. She is shocked but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away. She wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored and the film ends with them living 'happily ever after' with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog  an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart.Pornographic?  Hardly!.Suitable viewing for children?  Well probably not quite unless they have very progressive parents.R rating?  PG would be more appropriate today.Entertaining for viewers in most age groups ?  Yes but the film has its faults  these are discussed in many of the comments here on IMDb however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it.I believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an antipornography activist of scientific proof that a magazine picture of Kristin deBell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models. These and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic Several home video productions have been released in both VHS and DVD format the last was a DVD containing both the R rated and unrated versions of the film released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies of this were readily available until a few months ago now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price  a situation which usually quickly results in a new DVD release appearing. This continuing interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to near classic status.Commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting  my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect selfcensorship recommendations originating with the Hayes Committee. On this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as 'not helpful' and I seldom make them but fortunately I still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying. It is flawed but Kristine deBell gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience. Overall I would rate it at 7 stars and will be buying a copy of the next DVD edition if and when it appears. If Ms deBell is still alive today I would love to hear her comments both on the attempts to suppress this film and on the late recognition that it has gradually achieved.".

Pornographic films like these are interesting species largely because they are not focused on the endlessly and emptily scoredshot sex scenes but more concerned with infusing some cheap sexualized humor into the screenplay.Both this and Flesh Gordon are far more innocent pictures than you probably think but both have the same problem of failing to be very erotic.

Alice in Wonderland An XRated Musical Comedy also features a handful of songs composed for the film and even those can distract from the eroticism the film wants to create but can't consistently maintain.Still much like Flesh Gordon there's fun to be had here.

The movie handles its mystery rather well with Frank Langella's uniquely scary performance being the obvious highlight. Given that the movie falters at the end when its otherwise intriguing concept gets bogged down by the series of ridiculous events that feel as if they were taken from a different movie. While The Box tends to approach the wrong territory and is rather unfocused one can't help but acknowledge Kelly's ability to attract the viewer's attention.

	schema:reviewBody "In the winter of 1967 Professor Charles Goetzinger conducted an experiment in his Basic Persuasion Class hiring an actor to attend all his classes wearing a large black bag. Strangely after several days the black bag began to inspire anger in the other students. Goetzinger's students would pick fights with taunt and tease the black bag seemingly unable to recognise that there was a human being within it.What Goetzinger's experiment showed was that anonymity loosens the restraints on aggressive behaviour and that when victims are anonymous and therefore dehumanised it grows easier to commit violence against them. This echoes the countless bizarre reports of children at Disneyland striking hapless costumed characters for no apparent reason and why most movies especially war movies deindividualize the Other in an effort not to implicate their audiences.Richard Kelly's The Box which can be divided into three sections deals with these themes but goes a bit further. In its first section lasting approximately 30 minutes we have a fairly faithful retelling of Button Button a Richard Matheson short story and Twilight Zone episode 1986. This section involves a couple Norma and Arthur who are given a box by a strange man named Steward. The box is equipped with one button and should either Norma or Arthur push it they will promptly be given a million dollars. The catch is pressing the button results in someone they don't know immediately dying. Of course Norma pushes the button anyway. Why wouldn't she? The box facilitates disavowal. Modern man though he knows his actions cause suffering is himself increasingly isolated from the consequences of his choices.Steward gives Norma and Arthur their money and then leaves with the box but not before ominously stating that the box will now be offered to someone whom you don't know. Shocked the couple suddenly realise that thousands of these boxes are around the country everyone given the chance to make easy money at someone else's expense. Norma and Arthur far from being suddenly wealthy are now in mortal danger they may be exploited by any number of button pushers around the world. The message if everyone is willing to have others suffer in order to facilitate their own personal gains then all is already lost the film drawing broad parallels between capitalism war human nature greed and violence.In the second part of the film Kelly tells us that the boxes are really a test given to mankind by aliens. The aliens are gathering data and if humans are found to be selfish and beyond redemption they will destroy the planet. This is a classic flaw in science fiction films Abyss The Day The Earth Stood Still etc in which advanced beings teach us not to be violent by hypocritically threatening us with violence. I call this Big stick diplomacy whereby a superpower negotiates peace whilst simultaneously threatening violence. Throw in a bunch of silly science fiction themes worm holes teleportation and the kind of apocalyptic pseudoreligious ending that ALL of Kelly's films have and...well let's just say Kelly sabotages his whole film with unnecessary mumbo jumbo.Luckily the third part of Kelly's film salvages everything. Early in the film Norma mentions Jean Paul Sartre. Later Norma and Arthur go to a performance of Sartre's 1944 existentialist play No Exit and find the words No Exit written on their car window. Sartre of course famously said in No Exit that Hell is other people the implication being that the earth is made hell because we become throwaway objects when in the gaze of others.More horrifically modern man no longer has the ability to choose whether he presses the button or not. In the age of globalization he has ceased to become a subject and is now a default participant. To escape the global system is to be free but escape is impossible. This is partially why the film's aesthetic is labyrinthine and confusing and wholly divorced from the cosy spaces of the 1986 Twilight Zone episode. Kelly recognises that Matheson's world is long gone. The system's labyrinthine tendrils crisscross in all directions to such an extent that boxes and buttons are now continually overlapping and always unwittingly pressed. The film's way out of this gridlock is essentially what Godard espouses in Our Music Who are you? man encouraged to make empathetic connections born of mutual suffering rather than either avoidance or blind tolerance.This notion of compassion born of mutual suffering is articulated at the end of the film when Norma begins to identify with Steward. She has a mutilated foot and he has a mutilated face and by recognising his pain and suffering she is able to regret having pushed the button.We then learn that The Box Test has a second phase. He who pushes the button must sacrifice themselves for their child which of course is what Norma does. She allows herself to be shot so that her son may live. The implication is that whilst everyone on the planet has selfishly pressed the button man is nevertheless inherently good enough to sacrifice himself for his fellowman.Cue cheesy CGI water worm holes and silly baptism purgatory and hell metaphors. Kelly's point there is No Exist no escaping the world only the fleeting chance of a kind of mutual empathy a kind of heaven on earth.810  Ignore what the film says about the acronym HREM. With the film constantly referencing Xrays it means High Resolution Electron Microscopy. IE  the box test is an X ray of humanity the aliens trying to see what we're really like deep down inside.".

Early in the film Norma mentions Jean Paul Sartre. Later Norma and Arthur go to a performance of Sartre's 1944 existentialist play No Exit and find the words No Exit written on their car window. Sartre of course famously said in No Exit that Hell is other people the implication being that the earth is made hell because we become throwaway objects when in the gaze of others.More horrifically modern man no longer has the ability to choose whether he presses the button or not. In the age of globalization he has ceased to become a subject and is now a default participant. To escape the global system is to be free but escape is impossible. This is partially why the film's aesthetic is labyrinthine and confusing and wholly divorced from the cosy spaces of the 1986 Twilight Zone episode. Kelly recognises that Matheson's world is long gone. The system's labyrinthine tendrils crisscross in all directions to such an extent that boxes and buttons are now continually overlapping and always unwittingly pressed. The film's way out of this gridlock is essentially what Godard espouses in Our Music Who are you? man encouraged to make empathetic connections born of mutual suffering rather than either avoidance or blind tolerance.This notion of compassion born of mutual suffering is articulated at the end of the film when Norma begins to identify with Steward. She has a mutilated foot and he has a mutilated face and by recognising his pain and suffering she is able to regret having pushed the button.We then learn that The Box Test has a second phase. He who pushes the button must sacrifice themselves for their child which of course is what Norma does. She allows herself to be shot so that her son may live. The implication is that whilst everyone on the planet has selfishly pressed the button man is nevertheless inherently good enough to sacrifice himself for his fellowman.Cue cheesy CGI water worm holes and silly baptism purgatory and hell metaphors. Kelly's point there is No Exist no escaping the world only the fleeting chance of a kind of mutual empathy a kind of heaven on earth.810  Ignore what the film says about the acronym HREM. With the film constantly referencing Xrays it means High Resolution Electron Microscopy. IE  the box test is an X ray of humanity the aliens trying to see what we're really like deep down inside.";

I love Donnie Darko and I think with The Box Kelly has gone back to the Darko style of writing and directing. I am not sure why it received so many bad reviews maybe because like Donnie Darko it was too cerebral for the mainstream. It's not a movie you can do three things and watch you have to pay attention to the little details. I do feel there are missing pieces that weren't explained but that could be the way the film was edited and may come out later in a directors cut edition or it could be Kelly's way of keeping the audience guessing. I can see how this movie wouldn't appeal to the masses especially since it is a cautionary tale of morals and ethics but if you liked Donnie Darko you will probably enjoy The Box. I can see this having a cult following like Donnie Darko.Also I am not a Cameron Diaz fan but I think she did a great job.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie starts off with a couple waken up by the doorbell early in the morning. The woman Norma Lewis  Cameron Diaz  opens the door just to find out no one's at the door. But there is a mysterious box on the doorstep and Norma brings it in. In the meanwhile Arhur Lewis  James Marsden  joins her at the diner table and together they unfold the wrapping paper to find a box with a big red button on top of it. On the box is a keyhole which needs a key to open up the top so you can press the button. They have no idea what it is or what it means but that will soon change.Later that day a mysterious creepy man is at the door Norma opens the door and the man presents himself as Arlington Steward  Frank Langella . He is creepy in the sense that he has a big open burn mark on his face in the trend of Harvey Dent  2face  as seen in the Dark Knight. He will ask Norma if she received the box and will explain what it is. Mr. Steward gives Norma a key to open the box and she can keep the key with the box for 24 hours in that time she will have to make a special choice. If she will push the button Steward will give the family a staggering 1 million dollars in cash BUT someone somewhere in the world will die. To gain her trust Stewerd gives Norma a 100 dollar bill and leaves.So far so good the first 30 minutes of this movie are good and interesting and you will wonder what will happen if they press the button. The story has a great concept and is very promising.Unfortunately the movie collapse under it's own weight of complexity in the remaining 75 minutes or so. It's not because of bad acting although Diaz is terrible Marsden plays OK but not memorable and besides Langella sticks out with head and shoulders. It's not bad directing either. I loved Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko so we're not dealing with a beginner. The Cinematography and camerawork is good and the atmosphere in the entire movie is really well done. It's just that the plot is turning out to be way to smart but yet it feels dumb and clumsy. At moments the movie is very predictable and sometimes you are scratching you'r head about what the hell just happened. You keep on watching because you'll expect that the movie will fall on it's place near the end. Unfortunately this is not happening and the movie ends with questions unanswered. Kelly is probably trying to create something that people will talk about after the movie and on birthdays. But to be honest I didn't care about the characters and the story no more the last 20 minutes took forever and I remember asking my girlfriend if they could please get it over with.This movie is comparable to flavored chewing gum. It starts off with an explosion of flavor but as you keep on chewing the flavor is starting to go away and you end up with a dull tasteless piece of rubber in your mouth.".

I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko the driving force of the narrative is existential. In The Box the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first and then broaden my gaze afterwards. The Box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. It isn't always sure what it wants to be. The twists are numerous but easy to follow if not to predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits. A Box containing a button unit arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don't know and they will receive one million dollars. One of the things The Box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. Before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality alluring yet sinister. Once it has been pushed events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. The notion that the Box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox. If there are external beings developing an altruism coefficient based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button then as the conspiracy unravels we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism Be selfless or the species will be wiped out. I suppose the couples don't know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision but they have no reason to suspect that The Box can do anything so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives? The psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. Push the button or don't it's likely someone is messing with you. Take the money or don't no one gives anything away for free. Search for the truth the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. I propose that The Box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life is that freedom? No it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another Box. This is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. They demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom. We made it to Mars and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. The references to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point rather well. You can only enter the final chamber free or not free. Sure but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber it is a chamber nonetheless. Trevor Nemeth".

	schema:headline " Overambitious Box leaves too many elements to consider";
	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of science fiction allegory social experiment The Twilight Zone and the thriller genre  no less all those elements combined  Richard Kelly and his film The Box should've at least won me over but it doesn't. It can't even decide if it wants to remain completely mysterious or explicitly tell us what's going on and any film that has to contemplate that is too complex for its own good. With any story this daring there's potential for something meaningful. The Box does let you glimpse it and draw a few interesting conclusions but through intellectual jail bars placed before our eyes by the myriad of plot contrivances. In other words too many plot elements exist in in the film that keep us from ever putting our mind around what Kelly is trying to say. Although he starts simply by focusing on a couple James Marsden and Cameron Diaz and their child making an ethical decision the scope widens to include everything from Arthur C. Clarke references to mindless drones to some indiscernible notion of the afterlife.This beginning piece is based on Richard Matheson's story Button Button which was a short story turned into a Twilight Zone episode. In The Box a mysterious man with a halfburned face played by Frank Langella drops off a box with a button in it at the doorstep of Norma and Arthur Lewis and their son Walter. He later comes back and gives Norma a proposition don't press the button and nothing happens or press the button and receive one million dollars and subsequently someone anywhere in the world whom they don't know will die.Well Norma a teacher just lost her teacher tuition discount for her son and Arthur's application to be an astronaut was just denied and despite living in a nice looking house in Richmond Virginia they apparently have no money so it's not hard to figure out ultimately what they'll do. After all don't press the button and there's no film  not that some people who sit through this would've minded that in retrospect.As with his cult hit Donnie Darko Kelly keeps The Box fascinatingly creepy. It starts with the colors the classic string soundtrack from the band Arcade Fire and some peculiar Easter eggs and moves on to more jarring occurrences.

	onyx:emotionText "As a fan of science fiction allegory social experiment The Twilight Zone and the thriller genre  no less all those elements combined  Richard Kelly and his film The Box should've at least won me over but it doesn't. It can't even decide if it wants to remain completely mysterious or explicitly tell us what's going on and any film that has to contemplate that is too complex for its own good. With any story this daring there's potential for something meaningful. The Box does let you glimpse it and draw a few interesting conclusions but through intellectual jail bars placed before our eyes by the myriad of plot contrivances. In other words too many plot elements exist in in the film that keep us from ever putting our mind around what Kelly is trying to say. Although he starts simply by focusing on a couple James Marsden and Cameron Diaz and their child making an ethical decision the scope widens to include everything from Arthur C. Clarke references to mindless drones to some indiscernible notion of the afterlife.This beginning piece is based on Richard Matheson's story Button Button which was a short story turned into a Twilight Zone episode. In The Box a mysterious man with a halfburned face played by Frank Langella drops off a box with a button in it at the doorstep of Norma and Arthur Lewis and their son Walter. He later comes back and gives Norma a proposition don't press the button and nothing happens or press the button and receive one million dollars and subsequently someone anywhere in the world whom they don't know will die.Well Norma a teacher just lost her teacher tuition discount for her son and Arthur's application to be an astronaut was just denied and despite living in a nice looking house in Richmond Virginia they apparently have no money so it's not hard to figure out ultimately what they'll do. After all don't press the button and there's no film  not that some people who sit through this would've minded that in retrospect.As with his cult hit Donnie Darko Kelly keeps The Box fascinatingly creepy. It starts with the colors the classic string soundtrack from the band Arcade Fire and some peculiar Easter eggs and moves on to more jarring occurrences. There is never a point where things get so absurd that you don't care what happens in the end even if there's a chance the end could be terribly unsatisfying. It's one of few saving graces for The Box but perhaps even this is only for those intrigued by high concept scifi mystery that parallels human nature no matter how vague.When any thriller collapses somewhere after the midway point you can usually blame the fact that too many occurrences in need of explaining were written in order for the writer to achieve his desired end.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis Cameron Diaz lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur James Marsden. One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. By the late afternoon a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward Frank Langella and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur who is currently working for NASA fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma who is a teacher learns that her faculty funding is being cut.One's enjoyment for this bizarre scifi thriller based on the short story Button Button by Richard Matheson will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dreamlike state of that far superior film The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world is entirely implausible. That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as TwoFace from The Dark Knight and believe this offer seems equally contrived.If this sounds unlikely so far what follows is even more absurd involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. To a point the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. Later at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived scifi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. The ending which won't be spoilt here resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the resemblances can be seen by this point given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film with a very unsubtly written role as the mysterious scarred man who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in FrostNixon. There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them highlights this.Since 2001 Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko. Though this film might be intriguing for a little while it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before you dismiss my post as not getting it let me say...I'm one of the biggest Richard Kelly and The Twilight Zone fans out there. Donnie Darko is one my alltime favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had it's moments. I'm a HUGE scifi fan. I was very excited to see The Box couldn't wait for it to come out.Having said that...The Box is terrible. Behind Drag Me To Hell this was the worst movie I've seen in 2009. And it just simply WILL NOT end! Whenever you think you've reached the end another change in the plot and you're off to more torture. I was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the film...I could hardly take it anymore.The biggest problem with The Box no matter how you slice it or try to justify it is that it simply makes little sense. Trust me I got it I understood what was going on. But that doesn't mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it. Take the basics for example. The main couple...Cameron Diaz and James Marsden playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at her job then bemoans that they are living paycheck to paycheck. Well sell that fing Porsche your husband is driving then!!! They live in a beautiful 2story house in a nice subdivision. Marsden is working what seems to be a highpaid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And yes Marsden drives an overly expensive car. But they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? No need to press the button just cut down your highpriced lifestyle a bit! The movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. Instead they are seemingly desperate for money...all the while living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. Like I said...you can understand what's going on yet it still makes little sense! That's a rare combination.There was an awful scene in a library that I feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history terribly acted too by the way. It was idiotic illogical and out of place. I can't even begin to fully describe it actually so I will move onto a subplot that involves nosebleeds and body possession by aliens. Yes I'm being serious unfortunately. A kid is in Diaz's class with a wicked and smile on his face a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school. He starts asking Diaz personal questions literally embarrassing her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt apron and all! I don't know many alienpossessed kids who appear to be in Junior High that also moonlight as a busboy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! See what I mean...you can understand it completely but it still makes no sense...a rare combo! Like many things in the movie the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him no ending to his character. Moving on... A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens don't want to help Diaz...then who was taking over this lady's body and giving Diaz advice?! Again...The lady was trying to help Diaz...and the aliens weren't interested in helping Diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained. Never talked about again. No nothing!! It goes on and on and on like this for what seemed to me like 2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive reshoot at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there one minute gone the next. Subplots began but never ended. The numerous pushbacks of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. It's truly a trainwreck.Pass on this one...there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10 just because I like Diaz and scifi! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.Thanks for reading!

He starts asking Diaz personal questions literally embarrassing her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt apron and all! I don't know many alienpossessed kids who appear to be in Junior High that also moonlight as a busboy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! See what I mean...you can understand it completely but it still makes no sense...a rare combo! Like many things in the movie the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him no ending to his character. Moving on... A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens don't want to help Diaz...then who was taking over this lady's body and giving Diaz advice?! Again...The lady was trying to help Diaz...and the aliens weren't interested in helping Diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained. Never talked about again. No nothing!! It goes on and on and on like this for what seemed to me like 2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive reshoot at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there one minute gone the next. Subplots began but never ended. The numerous pushbacks of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. It's truly a trainwreck.Pass on this one...there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10 just because I like Diaz and scifi! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.Thanks for reading! JD";

To explain my experience let me use this word picture Imagine that you have been binging on pixie sticks and paint fumes for the last month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma lands you in a hospital where the nurse seems to get a kick out of shooting adrenalin into your IV. The dream that you have while in the coma will be something like this movie.SUMMARY A man shows up at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it. Press the button they will get a million dollars in cash and a person they don't know will die. I'll try not to spoil anything but from there things devolve into a plot so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your sanity. But hey most of us have been sane for a while now and change is good.PROS Amazing storyline overall good acting not a slow moment once it gets going. It asks questions of human morality that are rarely if ever asked in popular culture. This movie is deep it has meaning. Its not summer blockbuster special effects fluff not that there's anything wrong with that this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. But i think it is perhaps that very thing that makes me like it so much.CONS The first twenty minutes before it gets going are really quite slow. At the end of the movie you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour. I can guarantee that this movie will not get rave reviews from your peers or most critics it is far too strange and there aren't explosions every three seconds. In fact there are no explosions of any kind in this movie besides your brain popping from trying to understand exactly what the heck just happened. Personally I don't think this is a bad thing but many will.RATING Easily a 910. I have never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can't give it a 1010 is that it is just too wrapped up in itself. There are several large things left unexplained at the end that are still bugging me as I sit here writing this. But overall this is the best experience I have had in a movie theater in quite a long time. But be warned you will not like this movie if you can't sit back turn on your suspension of disbelief to about 150 and prepare your brain to do some impressive acrobatics.Visit www.thestuffblag.com for more reviews".

I believe you already have the movie summary  so I won't paraphrase the movie.First  let's start the with good.1. If you like psychological thrillers that make you think as I do the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you  this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like what if you had to chose one family member live another to die or what if you had to die by drowning or fire This movie is a great concept  bottom line.2 The wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. Realistically though how difficult is that to accomplish? .....Okay that's about all for the good. Let's talk about the bad.1. This movie feels like a 2 hour Twilight Zone episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. That might have made the movie tolerable.2. Do you remember in the movie From Dusk til Dawn?. The movie started out interesting then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep  same thing here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers 2.3. Yes  we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach  but the story jumped around way too much didn't elaborate on the current story arc and took aforgive mecompletely insulting direction.4. The ending didn't make sense. Not at all. None.This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. If you're board out of your mind in bed sick or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie and can view this free online  by all means go for it.If you need to pay anything to view this movie don't waste your time  you're better off watching old Howie Mandel standup on You Tube.

I also will try to rate movie fairly even if I did not like it. City lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed but I can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time.I think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating should take a few ideas into account. Try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate.This movie was the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. 2 hours of my life where just stolen. The acting was awful across the board. The scenes where choppy at best. However the real disgrace was the story. The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to B. However after that it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained. Nothing really ever made sense was steward dead is he alive did he hit by lighting was it really lighting was it aliens is he an alien etc. The ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions. The only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater.6.510??? What is wrong with some of you? I will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this we did think what would make it better? and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie.

Under the right circumstances every person has a price meaning everybody would push the button whether it's for money love knowledge youth or something else. That makes it a good premise but the movie wants to be deeper cooler and more complex. It's complex alright. What they do here is take dull biblical concepts like hell afterlife and eternal damnation and mix it with Jean Paul Sartre's existentialism spelled out like for 10yearolds aliens from outer space dead people resurrected Arthur Clarke references a love story zombies dumb scifi and some simplistic lectures on ethics. Dialogues are bad and the CGI is so obvious it makes Langella's face ridiculous. This is Mars Attacks meets The Day the Earth Stood Still meets Saw meets Knowing and God knows what else. Plot elements are thrown in randomly and nothing makes sense. Why is it set in 1976? Why are those particular families targeted? How does the box work? Why does the babysitter have pictures of the victims in her room? Why do aliens give a sht about humans in the first place? If these aliens are so ethical funny idea then why do they use such sadistic methods? If the purpose of the test is only to evaluate people's altruism quotient than why torture them afterwards with complicated mind games? Why not just wipe them out? Why do aliens use a dead man with a facial disfigurement to perform their tests? What about the lighting? Who exactly are the employers? Why those particular employees and what happened to them? Why do aliens want to save human kind and yet make people kill each other? Why do they harm innocent children? What was the government's involvement? Was that kid with the evil grin and the peace sign supposed to be scary? Or that old lady in the library with a nose bleed? What's up with all that water? How come this supposedly struggling family owns such an expensive car? And more important... What was the scriptwriter smoking when he wrote those lines? More questions arise and more offensive religious crap paves the way. Why are Women portrayed as the ones responsible for all the corruption in the world? I'm surprised they didn't insert the Devil clich...oh wait... Was Langella's character the devil? Is the Devil a Martian? Do Martians appreciate Jean Paul Sartre? Is it possible that Sartre was one of them ? Such complexity is overwhelming.".

Was that kid with the evil grin and the peace sign supposed to be scary? Or that old lady in the library with a nose bleed? What's up with all that water? How come this supposedly struggling family owns such an expensive car? And more important... What was the scriptwriter smoking when he wrote those lines? More questions arise and more offensive religious crap paves the way. Why are Women portrayed as the ones responsible for all the corruption in the world? I'm surprised they didn't insert the Devil clich...oh wait... Was Langella's character the devil? Is the Devil a Martian? Do Martians appreciate Jean Paul Sartre? Is it possible that Sartre was one of them ? Such complexity is overwhelming.";

	schema:reviewBody "I wish I could be surprised at the rating of this film being so low but it sums up the state of humanity just as this film does. TOO MANY MORONS OBVIOUSLY DO NOT THINK WHEN WATCHING A FILM!This was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The parallels it draws with human nature capitalism war the way we treat one another and also the impeding Alien interference is unbelievably incredible and anyone who thinks this film is actually anything less than a 7 is deluded and would probably push the button. As you probably know the plot revolves around a box with a button that kills someone if pressed and in return whoever presses it gets a million dollars. The box is passed on daily to new strangers and the pattern continues. While that could have gone any direction it was used as a metaphor for our greed and tendency to put ourselves first over someone else's misery or in this case total demise. Humanity is in a current state of exactly this. We destroy the planet in the name of money and instant profit we go to war killing people we don't know in the name of freedom which anyone with their head screwed on knows is a complete lie and is actually just a facade for a bunch of people's greed. If we continue doing this to ourselves and the planet we will have nothing left. In my opinion that is EXACTLY the message this film was portraying and it did it spectacularly. Maybe I only saw the message because I wouldn't have pushed the button and am a firm believer in being the change you wish for. This film stood to point out the flaws in humanity. Many of my friends said they would have pushed the button. I'm quite disappointed in them but I can see why. Nobody thinks there will be a consequence even though you're killing someone. It's quite heartbreaking but until you tell them in plain black and white what the consequence will be they are blinded by their greed.If and I think there is quite a lot of evidence for it Aliens are watching us they would no doubt be wondering what the heck we are doing as a race and how we could be so unevolved. We stand no chance of survival as a race unless we stop thinking about our own fortunes and start pulling together collectively. That means not killing people not going to war not destroying the planet raping its resources for capital and actually uniting as people regardless if we know each other or not.This film contained this message and I am disappointed it obviously hasn't touched a majority of people here.One of my friends who said he would push the button was in the process of signing up to the Armed forces. He has since changed his mind siting a combination of this film and my added analysis as the reason. I wish it will continue to spread such a positive message and making a difference in this messy world we live in.If you didn't enjoy this film then fair enough that's your issue but I hope the message was at least clear to you.. How people have rated this so low is shocking!In my opinion this film is pure genius.".

At no point did I ever feel sympathy for his character even with a large portion of his face missing.He is nowhere near as charming as he is implied to be and ultimately his character and the whole big mystery behind it which the main couple spend a huge portion of time trying to uncover is one big fat Red Herring that is completely explained at the end when the movie's Show Don't Tell atmosphere is abandoned so Arlington Steward can become MISTER EXPOSITION! for TWO WHOLE SEPARATE SCENES in describing just who he is and whatwhy he is.I was surprised that Cameron Diaz could act sufficiently that I could not immediately just think Cameron Diaz when she came on screen.The visuals are nice the directing style is very artistic in an almost I'm not ripping off Kubrick  I'm just copying a little sort of way. It's a fun thing to watch.The hard stuff The setting of the story involves scary man bringing a scary box to this couple's door which is locked. The next day he gives Norma a key to open it and a crisp fresh 100 dollar bill and tells her if she presses the button someone somewhere she doesn't know will die and she'll get a million dollars.Unfortunately the story starts to unravel haphazardly as it leads us on a cryptic mystery quest that genuinely interested me. That mystery then smashes into a wall of dogmatic JudeoChristian Old Testament morality in a scene in the library which is so over the top and wildly confusing it almost doesn't fit into the movie.The initial mystery shows itself to be a Red Herring and a whole new mystery opens up which is unceremoniously ended with a hugely disappointing MISTER EXPOSITION! explanation that destroys any and all mystery and boils the entire events of the movie into a cycle of murder Old Testamentstyle morality and pointless human suffering that ultimately teaches us nothing beyond Don't kill ever even if it means you will suffer incredible hardships What does that mean? As an amateur douchebag and philosopher it really irritated me with this.What essentially happens is that people are arbitrarily chosen for this button test which is so coyly called the Human Resources EXPLOITATION Test. People who press the button suffer what the main couple does. Those who don't are essentially enslaved by the employers and made to carry out their dastardly deeds somehow reminiscent of the Manson Family's Creepy Crawlies game.These slaves are called employees and are made obvious by their nosebleeds whenever they carry out their employers' deeds. The employers are apparently implied to be aliens. Since the main character is a NASA scientist obsessed with Mars it's implied these aliens are Martian.First these Martians set up the couple for immense pain and suffering. One they have the principal of a school Norma teaches at cancel a program that allows her to teach without paying money you know it's them because he gets the trademark nosebleed so she's out of a job and out of money. They also sabotage Arthur's NASA astronaut test losing his dream of going to the Moon and damning him to suffer his job with no chance of his desired advancement.So the Vessel formerly known as Arlington Steward gives Norma Cameron Diaz the box and all that junk. To their credit they manage to resist the temptation with great spirit and courage. In fact it's only out of sheer stress and uncertainty ABOUT THE BOX that the button is pressed. So in fact if they had just told her about it and said she would make her choice to Mr Steward without having him waiting around she probably wouldn't have made the decision.Instead she presses the button and minutes later as the deadline is reached here comes the Vessel with the money. Then he proceeds to harass her along with other employees who seem to be simultaneously guiding them and harassing them making them suffer horribly the potential guilt.Later it's revealed that the man who killed his wife at the moment Norma pressed the button was actually forced to do sohe says it was either his wife or his daughter.Later on we get some MISTER EXPOSITION where Vessel explains that these employers are testing the whole human race and the only people who will be spared extinction are those who did not press the button. That is that apparently. They didn't really explain any gray area in that Black or White morality. These slaves are then shown forcibly entering blocks of water for some reason maybe to go on an alien planet and be spared.Later that guy who was forced to murder his wife is then murdered for DARING to tell all of this to Arthur and how his wife pressed the button as well. Then Arthur's wife and son are abducted and they wake up back in their house where Vessel Steward waits and their son Walter is struck deaf and blind.The Vessel then says that either they live with the money and their son Helen Kellerized or he kills Norma and Walter is returned to normal.Ironically the very moment he with her urging decides to kill her is the same moment another wife presses the button.This incoherently implies that this is an endless cycle by which spouses will be forced to murder their spouses or else have a family member of theirs suffer an incredible pain and nearly impossible life.Or they can choose not to press the button and live as slaves before taken to Mars or something.".

Lousy plot awesomely horrible acting and no visual effects to make it worth watching. I had more fun sitting through 'Red Sonja' and 'Hercules Goes to New York'. I would much rather sit through a whole evening of Danielle Steel movies than watch this movie ever again. We have here yet another movie which should never have been made.

His name is Robin Williams and he's an up and coming comic on the Los Angeles comedy circuit. While on the other end of town producer Garry Marshall and partner Harvey Severson have developed a new show called Mork  Mindy that's a spinoff to their previous hit show Happy Days. It's in their meeting with Williams that they have found the ideal actor to play Mork. But as the show slowly turns into a hit the story of what happened behind the camera unfolds as a young comic is suddenly handed everything he ever wanted very quickly which affected his personal life as well as those in it. Set against the backdrop of Mork  Mindy this is a story about a show's rise to number one it's struggles on the production and the rising star of Robin Williams.";

This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.I was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show which in a way it was. But of course the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just a cute impression although it was even deadon. On an unrelated note I noticed that Robin's struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman who was underappreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively but that's the Taxi behind the scenes biopic.All in all this was a very enjoyable flick in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid by all never melodramatic like I suspected and the story moved along well. Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!. Not a great masterpiece by any means I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber but definitely watchable especially for those Robin Williams and Mork  Mindy fans out there. Nanoo nanoo!".

The producers took pains to recreate the characters from the show both physically with regard to personality. They go out of their way to put forth the fact that Williams almost became typecast for his Mork role and the tedium and frustration that the part produced for him. After all his fans knew he was something special when they saw him for 5 minutes on Happy Days. His manic rapid fire improvisational brilliance continues to amaze to this day and yet through this TV movie we see how close he may have come to losing it all in the early 80's. My only qualm is that I have been unable to locate the credit for the actor who played John Belushi.".

Skills like the ability to mimic others and the ability to switch characters practically midbreath. I can't imagine that many people could capture so much of his character and personality.

Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes. Its another to do it for a whole TV movie.I don't know how I felt about the whole show and I don't know how much they played with the facts but I do know that it was Chris Diamantopoulos that kept me watching.

There were scenes where Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 rapid fire lines and do 15 different characters while delivering those lines all while sounds as much like ROBIN WILLIAMS doing those characters.....well that my friends is impressive acting. Its one thing to do a Robin Williams impersonation for a couple of minutes. Its another to do it for a whole TV movie.I don't know how I felt about the whole show and I don't know how much they played with the facts but I do know that it was Chris Diamantopoulos that kept me watching. So for that I give HIM a 10.";

He was so charming in this which helped me get through all the Williams energy. The little behind the scenes pieces of his other shows Happy Days and Laverne  Shirley was enlightening. I also thought RichmondPeck's Harvey was also a nice rock in the pond. This is a good thing.This movie told the age old story of Hollywood folks going through the ups and downs of stardom. It kept me glued to my TV and I learned to love Robin well hell mostly everybody seem to be the super people I sometimes think Hollywood is. Go figure.I sometimes wonder why the network people are always played to be idiots. We never saw the head of ABC. Just heard him like Charlie from Charlie Angels I wonder if this way planed?. It seems so sad that a show at number 1 could be so destroy by their own network.I think this story could be told about anyone's life as they climb the ladder of any job. Movie and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people that you grew up with you just want to reach back in their past to remember your own past. I Remember watching the show and always wondering what does happen in their personal lives.Mork and Mindy will always be part of me and I got to see part of them.

Whoever wrote Williams' funny lines did an excellent job whether this included ad libbing or not. Still at least early on I felt like all I could do was imagine it was Williams. I don't think anyone could truly master his style though Diamantopoulos made a valiant effort. In one of the final scenes Diamantopoulos did a very good job imitating Williams' coworkers.When Williams was not funny Diamantopoulos did not always show talent. But in a couple of scenes associated with an unusual episode of the show which was Williams' idea not the network's Diamantopoulos really shined as a dramatic performer and really made me believe he was Williams. He also did well in a couple of instances where Williams criticized Mork's portrayal.Other than Diamantopoulos unfortunately and except for the actors playing John Belushi Tyler Labine was fantastic and Raquel Welch I didn't see any real acting ability among those playing celebrities. Though the actors playing Laverne Stacy Fair and The Fonz David Josefberg portrayed those characters better than they did the reallife actors. Daniel Roebuck especially needs to be singled out because unless he was intended to be a parody of the genius directorproducer Garry Marshall he did not achieve what he was attempting. Marshall was not a moron though Roebuck did the moron role very well on 'Matlock'. Later in the movie though Roebuck did come across nicely. And I loved the stunned looks on the faces of Marshall and Harvey after Williams auditioned for them. Of those actors not playing celebrities Michelle Harrison did the best job as Williams' wife Val. David RichmondPeck did a capable job as Harvey.I enjoyed the scenes related to the show itself the most though I couldn't help but think the show's live audience was doing a fine job of acting. Except for Diamantopoulos I didn't think anyone was that funny. I was especially disappointed in the portrayal of Jonathan Winters.Of course the usual constant criticism by the network just had to be included as it often is in movies like this. That was fun though especially when the censors were kept hopping by Williams' antics.The scenes related to Williams' personal life were well done but not that pleasant though not as bad as I expected. The scene where Williams met Belushi while doing his standup routine and the one where they got to know each other afterward were quite enjoyable. Overall I was fairly happy with this movie.".

Don't misunderstand I know he was not a saint but he also wasn't a whiny unappreciative ass hole either as is also portrayed here. I can only imagine that when this aired on TV it had been a while since people had seen the real thing and there are young people who never saw it so they were satisfied with this movie of the week garbage but for folks who did see the real Mork  Mindy and have followed Robin throughout the years should be truly disappointed. Which brings me to my original question. WHY? Did these people really imagine that they would be able to capture Robin's brilliance in a slapped together docudrama? Well it's obvious that they thought it possible and the result was this unworthy attempt. And the actual meaning of unauthorized means that the star or his family refused to sign off on this.

Right off the bat I gotta say the guy playing Williams Chris Diamantopoulos is a virtuoso. A good example? He's so convincingly annoying as Williams can be at times! His talent with voices and kinetic energy is astounding. Unfortunately at times the film falls into schmaltz as most TV biographies do such as the unseen badly dubbed head of ABC. Or the dramatic intro of John Belushi who because he's played by a lookalike we don't recognize as anybody! 1995's The Late Shift about the Jay LenoDavid Letterman debacle handled that area much more deftly with the onscreen graphics of who each person was. Here you have to be familiar with the story or wait for a corny announcing of a name. But again most of this is erased by Diamantopoulos' masterful performance. Which is why I was disappointed that it wasn't a straight Robin Williams bio which could then delve into life after MM and his second marriage. But Thanks to Diamantopoulos I have some new zingers to use on friends such as a knock at his door to which he replies Please take off your clothes and come in A boyfriend? A wonderful alternative to msturbation! Now we can reach that balding over 40 boring white male demographic. And Daniel Roebuck is becoming a pro at this having now played Jay Leno Don Bergman in the Three's Company story and now Garry Marshall. The downside is that this isn't one of those rush out and get it movies because who knows when it'll air again. But if you get the chance give it a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robin Williams is one of my favorite performers and he has had a very interesting life easily could be transformed into a great movie made for TV or otherwise. Unfortunately the creators of this TV film chose to focus on one very small aspect of William's life and condense it.The Unauthorized Story of Mork and Mindy begins when William's career is about to take off. He's living in a small apartment with his girlfriend working the clubs and the park trying his over the top comedy on everyone. He's losing hope that he'll ever make it big. Big time TV producer Garry Marshall has two of the top TV shows on television in Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley and is looking for another hit. Together with his writer Harvey they are looking for something different to bring back high ratings for the sloping Happy Days. They want to write in an Alien. Someone suggest newcomer comedian Jay Leno for the role and when Harvey goes to meet Leno he runs into Robin Williams who blows him away. Williams does a whirlwind audition for Marshall and he gets hired. The appearance of Mork on Happy Days is so successful that Marhsall creates the classic series spin off starring Williams. The show launches Williams into stardom and a life of women drugs and more money than he can imagine. After the first season the network tries to change Mork and Mindy and it's not for the better. Despite their attempts to keep it afloat the show is crashing and so is Williams. His partying lifestyle has caused him to lose his wife and his sanity. He is in danger of losing it all. With the help of his estranged wife and his costars he realizes he must stop and overcome his addiction.The movie is NOT about Mork and Mindy...vaguely. It's more about Williams rise and fall and his addiction. Not that it shouldn't be but it should have done a better job of telling the story. The shining point is the cast. Relative newcomer Chris Diamantopoulos is absolutely amazing as Williams. His look his mannerisms his voice and the fact that he is able to become not only Williams but every aspect of Williams' characters and behavior. He is astounding!! Not only is he amazing but his supporting cast Erinn Hayes as Pam Dawber Daniel Roebuck as Garry Marshall Tyler Labine as John Belushi David RichmondPeck Michelle Harrison as Valerie Velardi they are all magnificent in their roles!! Unfortunately they are wasted on a condensed rushed script that was churned out for May sweeps...except in April. I hope to see someone do a better story with equally great casting. 6.510".

There is no living nightmare no sudden changes of setting. There is seemingly nothing out of the ordinary for our protagonist to deal with.The main character played by veteran character actor Arthur Hunnicut sets out from his cabin in the hills accompanied by his faithful hound to hunt raccoon. Because the raccoon is a predominantly nocturnal animal hunt is by moonlight.The man and dog soon encounter a large raccoon who hops on the dog's back and attempts to drown the hound in a pond. The man jumps in to help his dog. There is a sort of almost blackout after which the pair are seen on the shore in a lying almost sleep like position.Calling his dog by name Rip I think the old man sets off to return home. When he arrives he finds the wife weeping and unresponsive to his conversation. He also observes visitors coming and going to his house paying respects and giving words to console his wife.Still seeming puzzled at the strange reception and goings on around the Home Cabin the Man and Rip take off on a long walk down the road where He remarks out loud that he did not remember such a long fence in these parts. He eventually comes upon a rather large fellow dressed in garb similar to hisoveralls hat work shirt. They are at a gate which leads to an area where a lot of smoke is freely rising up. The Gate Keeper is overly eager in his persuasive pitch in trying to get the man to enter. Rip sounds displeasure. The Gate Man tells the Old Man that he may enter but the dog would have to remain outside offering to watch the animal for him. The man will have none of it and the two continue on their way down the path.After a little more hiking they come upon a second gated entrance where the Gate Keeper recognizes the man and welcomes him.

His appeal here is put to consummate use as a mountain man doggedly faithful to a loyal hunting hound. Their fates are tied together as inseparably as any human bond. Good. I see a subtle environmental message here. All critters go to heaven because how can we condemn any poor devil that merely follows instinct in order to stay alive.

	schema:headline " Hillbilly Heaven";
	schema:reviewBody "My favorite nonterrifying Twilight Zone was The Hunt from January 1962.Here came Hyder Simpson a delightful Appalachian hillbilly. He's cantankerous and gruff a plainspoken man and we get it quickly how he's a good man honest and maybe a mite too straightforward a man faithful to Rachel his wife and to his old beagle Rip.Well the two of them Hyder and Rip go coon hunting. They die and wake up and don't realize they're dead. They only get it slowly and it's fun watching them or watching Hyder come to the realization they are indeed dead. Rip with his animal sensibilities probably already knows. There's the Miller boys digging a hole on Hyder's property which riles Hyder and what riles him even more is how they ignore him like he's not even there which of course he isn't. Hyder realizes the men are digging a grave for a dog his dog actually although Hyder doesn't know it and his ire turns to sympathy and respect for men who think enough of an animal to give it him a respectful burial.Hyder follows his own funeral procession but gets lost and finds himself on Eternity Road. Soon enough he and Rip arrive at the gates of Hell and not realizing it's Hell they encounter the slick salesman of a gatekeeper who apparently doesn't have a right to claim Hyder. Hyder's not on the list but the devil is a wily scoundrel and tries every trick he knows to get Hyder to step inside. It's all devious subterfuge and we get it before Hyder does how the gatekeeper's intimations  it's Heaven inside the gate  are false. It's Hell in there. A more sophisticated man might have blundered in but not Hyder. He's in a battle for his soul without knowing it and he's got two things working in his favor. He's got his loyalty to Rip and Rip's keen animal perception  Rip gets it how there's something fishy about this Heaven.Well Hyder is invited in but not Rip. No dogs allowed.I suppose for any and all of us who have ever loved and been loved by a pet there's been at some point the dilemma  how can it truly be Heaven if Spot or Butterball isn't allowed inside. Can I ever be truly happy without my faithful companion? Not to fear the smarmy gatekeeper says. Dogs have their own Heaven. This intended to placate Hyder only riles him more.

	onyx:emotionText "My favorite nonterrifying Twilight Zone was The Hunt from January 1962.Here came Hyder Simpson a delightful Appalachian hillbilly. He's cantankerous and gruff a plainspoken man and we get it quickly how he's a good man honest and maybe a mite too straightforward a man faithful to Rachel his wife and to his old beagle Rip.Well the two of them Hyder and Rip go coon hunting. They die and wake up and don't realize they're dead. They only get it slowly and it's fun watching them or watching Hyder come to the realization they are indeed dead. Rip with his animal sensibilities probably already knows. There's the Miller boys digging a hole on Hyder's property which riles Hyder and what riles him even more is how they ignore him like he's not even there which of course he isn't. Hyder realizes the men are digging a grave for a dog his dog actually although Hyder doesn't know it and his ire turns to sympathy and respect for men who think enough of an animal to give it him a respectful burial.Hyder follows his own funeral procession but gets lost and finds himself on Eternity Road. Soon enough he and Rip arrive at the gates of Hell and not realizing it's Hell they encounter the slick salesman of a gatekeeper who apparently doesn't have a right to claim Hyder. Hyder's not on the list but the devil is a wily scoundrel and tries every trick he knows to get Hyder to step inside. It's all devious subterfuge and we get it before Hyder does how the gatekeeper's intimations  it's Heaven inside the gate  are false. It's Hell in there. A more sophisticated man might have blundered in but not Hyder. He's in a battle for his soul without knowing it and he's got two things working in his favor. He's got his loyalty to Rip and Rip's keen animal perception  Rip gets it how there's something fishy about this Heaven.Well Hyder is invited in but not Rip. No dogs allowed.I suppose for any and all of us who have ever loved and been loved by a pet there's been at some point the dilemma  how can it truly be Heaven if Spot or Butterball isn't allowed inside. Can I ever be truly happy without my faithful companion? Not to fear the smarmy gatekeeper says. Dogs have their own Heaven. This intended to placate Hyder only riles him more. What kind of Heaven is it Hyder wants to know that would separate a man from his dog? And if dogs and masters are to be separated at death how can the master be happy without his dog or the dog without his master? Is it something the rest of us would worry about? What would we choose Heaven or our dog?

The beauty of the episode rests with Simpson's refusal to cross the pearly gates without his companion who warns him of danger ahead  ...a man well he'll walk right into Hell with both eyes open but even the devil can't fool a dog. If loyalty has it's place in the world I'm sure Heaven wouldn't interfere with a potential customer just because that customer has a four legged friend.

Hyder Simpson Arthur Hunnicut El Dorado comes home after waking up the next day to find his dog's grave being dug by two neighbors and his wife dressed in black and mourning the loss of her husband who didn't heed to her warnings of bad omens getting a visit from the local preacher. So seeing as he doesn't have a home to come back to technically and while following his wife and the mourners taking his casket to the graveyard Hyder meets a fence that no longer allows him access to the usual backwoods places so he takes Rep and they walk the Eternity Road as Heavenor Hellawaits. Where will Hyder spend eternity? Rep just might determine that. I have a place in my heart for this episode even though many might consider it a bit corny and perhaps too Hollywoodized a version of characters from the Deep South but I like where its heart is ultimately and Man's Best Friend and His Master as partners for life with the Missus coming shortly is just a nice close me thinks. Animal lovers in particular except for the whole hunting for raccoons business might enjoy this episode for how an owner will not leave behind his pet looking at the dog as more of a family member treating it with respect. Everything in the film from the angel that greets Hyder and Rep proper to the surroundings that ultimately lead to the Heavenly Gates is completely representative of the backwoods people and culture as seen through the lens of certain folks who visualize them as they perceive them in the Hollywood industry. Although The Waltons creator Earl Hamner Jr. did write this episode I'm guessing a lot of his intentions were not presented as he saw them. That said I still find The Hunt rewarding in many respects. Being from the South I at least appreciate their trying to show a different side of America on the Twilight Zone.".

Unfortunately for Mr. Simpson the keeper at the gates of heaven Robert Faulk won't allow him to enter paradise with his hunting dog. NO DOGS ALLOWED is the rule of the day. Simpson quickly decides that this heaven isn't for him if they won't even let his poor old dog in. It jess don't seem right he tells the gatekeeper as he reluctantly heads down the eternal road with his pooch by his side. Luckily for Simpson he makes the right choice since the place he passed by was actually hell. He soon meets an angel who welcomes him and the dog to the real thing. There's nothing of any consequence in this episode except for Hunnicutt's amiable performance. Jeanette Nolan is also on hand as his earthbound wife. The story was written by Earl Hamner Jr. creator of The Waltons and its easygoing style fits the subject matter to a tee. This is one of those rare episodes of the series that only needs to be seen once.".

Unfortunately for Mr. Simpson the keeper at the gates of heaven Robert Faulk won't allow him to enter paradise with his hunting dog. NO DOGS ALLOWED is the rule of the day. Simpson quickly decides that this heaven isn't for him if they won't even let his poor old dog in. It jess don't seem right he tells the gatekeeper as he reluctantly heads down the eternal road with his pooch by his side. Luckily for Simpson he makes the right choice since the place he passed by was actually hell. He soon meets an angel who welcomes him and the dog to the real thing. There's nothing of any consequence in this episode except for Hunnicutt's amiable performance. Jeanette Nolan is also on hand as his earthbound wife. The story was written by Earl Hamner Jr. creator of The Waltons and its easygoing style fits the subject matter to a tee. This is one of those rare episodes of the series that only needs to be seen once.";

In fact I was quite pleased with the final product.I must admit the Afrikaaner and Xhosa? accented English of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing Waking Ned Devine Trainspotting or any other film with heavyaccented actors I adjusted after about 15 minutes. And I was trying to figure out why Hilary Swank was supposed to be South African and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very American... as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent. But later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the US as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent. So it began to make sense that only certain words might have a Afrikaaner lilt to them.I know it's a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a Truth and Reconciliation trial. I'd heard about the T and R process in South Africa after the fall of apartheid but I didn't really know how it worked.The final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived this was overall a very strong film. The closing sequence where the truth comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for. A definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders.".

She seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does. And she didn't prove me wrong in this movie.However the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and nonspeaking. I have to single out Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor  the two main protagonists  for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary.I must applaud Tom Hooper as the director and Avril Beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was striking and I had to push the pause button to savour the photography.Why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an International award. It seems to me to hit the highrating button on all counts. It was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid. A life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.".

She seems to rely on restraint to gain the emotional impact that she does. And she didn't prove me wrong in this movie.However the movie also had fantastic performances from all other members of the cast both speaking and nonspeaking. I have to single out Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor  the two main protagonists  for their outstanding acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failings. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary.I must applaud Tom Hooper as the director and Avril Beukes as the editor for keeping a multiple layered story being revealed smoothly whilst keeping dialogue and action moving along in an understandable fashion. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was striking and I had to push the pause button to savour the photography.Why can't a movie like this ever get nominated for an International award. It seems to me to hit the highrating button on all counts. It was not just a film it was a true experience of life in a country coming out of apartheid. A life of poverty was all around but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.";

The parents of Steve Sizela request Sarah to represent them also since their son that was arrested with Mpondo but has gone missing.

But Mpondo who is a man traumatized with the torture anticipates and tells what has happened to Steve Sizela and him in the hands of Hendricks and his superior Piet Mller Ian Roberts.

The story takes place in South Africa postApartheid but could have been in South America for example where many torturers have granted their amnesty despite their cruel past during dictatorships. Truth and reconciliation seem to be very difficult to achieve in these situations when usually torturers grant their freedom and victims are forced to forget what they did to them and live with their traumas and losses.

	schema:reviewBody "In South Africa the Truth  Reconciliation Commission hear the confessions of those in the former power who took part in crimes torture and violations of human rights. Those that confess are granted immunity and it is only those that try to conceal their involvement who are open for prosecution. When former police officer Hendricks confesses to the torture of Alex Mpondo it starts a chain of events. Mpondo pans to contest the amnesty of Hendricks despite his hazy recollection and wants to know what became of fellow activist Steve Sizela who was arrested at the same time and never seen again. South African born lawyer Sarah Barcant returns at the request of her father to represent Mpondo and try to uncover the truth behind the story.Forgiveness and healing are two words that are easy to say but very difficult to do. It is near impossible for me to understand what the village councils held in Rwanda must be like where those that massacred others must confess all to gain amnesty likewise I cannot comprehend the challenges that all involved with the TRC in South Africa have faced  to have people admit to so much but get off with nothing as it were. This film doesn't really manage to get close to examining that pain because instead it goes for more of a courtroom drama approach that uses the TRC as its frame rather than being the focus. In doing this it still manages to be interesting even though the serious tone and real setting means it ploughs a pretty straight furrow and cannot indulge in the genre histrionics that it occasionally suggests it wants to do.As a bit of basic insight into the Truth  Reconciliation Commission the film is still interesting and will probably move those that are somewhat unaware of the situation. However for me it would have been much more interesting to allow a debate to rage for the sheer complexities of the situation to be aired but by going for a mystery approach it becomes morally quite cleancut and not as reality has shown it often can be  only towards the end does it take the time for a bit of thought which is fine but I would have liked it to have been part of the film rather than an epilogue. The cast would probably have taken to this challenge as well because although they are quite good nobody really sets the world on fire. Swank deserves credit for doing the film but she is not that good and seems to have been added to provide a bankable star to drive the courtroom action. Ejiofor is better because he has more complexity to him although I would have liked him to share more scenes with Bartlett who is also strong in a difficult role. Roberts is poor because the film uses him as a nice clear baddie for the audience to hate. The direction is mostly good setting up interesting shots here and there  but the film is mostly helped by the good use of locations which are convincing and set the sense of place very well.Overall this is a good film but not as moving or as thoughtprovoking as it could have been. By leading with a straight thriller type plot the debate and the insight is left to the minority of moments and although interesting is not all that I had hoped for. The cast are good and the Western cast deserve credit for taking on a worthy subject. This deserves a bigger audience than it is have received and is worth watching if you get the chance.".

Well now i'm not to worried that she will disappear as so many other sidekicks of Clint before... Now i am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for i have written what i wanted to write. OK here it goes I think if you are from a western country especially Europe watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there!

It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945 which it does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train nonstop to Berlin. On the train is a mix of homosexuals nuns deported refugees murderers alcoholics and the failure literature critic 'Gunnar'  played by the in Sweden famous actor Gustav Hammarsten. The leading role 'Gunnar' is the type of person that although his intentions are for the best seems to drag everyone near him in a extremely funny way into disaster and to a living hell especially for a from the Finnish war homecoming wounded soldier played by the extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. On the train is also a doctor who cheats on his wife with his mistress. They have together planned to murder the doctors wife that is also travelling with the same train without any knowledge about her husbands intentions. Will the wife of the doctor elude the plans to murder her and will everyone else survive the unlucky fellow 'Gunnar'?".

Legendary actor Gsta Ekman does an absolutely amazing performance as an older gay man that caters to his lover who is totally unappreciative. This lover is gay just because he hates women! Here is a great clip with English subtitles httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vgLc85TLhSl4 . And not to mention Robert Gustafsson who is incredibly funny in as an injured man that gets in more and more accidents and is soon all covered in bandages but doesn't seem to mind his injuries at all... lol...The film is written and directed by Peter Dalle another famous Swedish actor and after making this film I consider him to be a genius!

This however is both more accessible and more elaborate than his previous works.Gunnar is a literary critic who wants to change his life. This is just after World War 2 and Gunnar decides to go to Germany where there is work rebuilding the country. He wants to make a difference. He gets on the train to Berlin along with a gallery of other personalities. Some of which have more sinister motives...Seldom have i seen a noir murder story mixed with slapstickcomedy. And i guess this is not for everyone but in my opinion it works pretty well. Mostly due to solid acting from most of the cast. The murder story is quite interesting but would perhaps have a had hard time standing by itself. But with the small sidetracks and the humor added the movie moves along quite nicely. Also i have to say that this is one of the nicestlooking Swedish movies i've seen. The technical quality is excellent in Swedish terms.So no movie is perfect. What is lacking? Well some of the actors especially Anna Bjrk and Kristina Trnqvist in the two largest female parts are quite wooden and unnatural. They could just as well be reading their lines from a piece of paper. Also the slapstick has a rather brutal touch to it sometimes that becomes almost too much. But of course this is a matter of taste and humor.All in all i felt this was a wellmade and enjoyable movie from director Peter Dalle. I rate it 610 and recommend it.".

Too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script act your lines  don't read them!.The comedy is more or less slapstick with the same jokes repeated over and over. The pace is incredibly slow at times quite often actually with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason. The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. The film looks great though in moody BW but it's wasted on such inept filmmaking in every other department. 110".

	schema:reviewBody "Jaded starts out strong but loses steam quickly and trails off into nothing. It raises a lot of interesting issues and then does nothing with them. Omitting the court scene at the end could be forgivable but leaving several loose ends without resolution was unsettling at best. Although for the most part those threads such as what exactly the customers in the bar were paying 500 for have fairly obvious conclusions leaving them hanging in the air in that way robbed this movie of a satisfying conclusion. As it is it almost seems as if they ran out of money to film the courtroom scene and thus made a movie out of the investigation and then just tacked on a ending.The low budget for this film was painfully apparent  it seems almost like a student film. I've seen better production values in porno. Which is puzzling since for the most part the actors involved are professionals that are recognizable from more superior efforts such as Aida Turturro from the Sopranos. Along with any sense of flow the director failed to elicit good performances from her actors that we know can do better with the exception of Carla Gugino who seemed to be acting in a different film with the intensity that she brought to her performance. She was unfortunately the only thing enjoyable about this movie with a strong premise but no follow through.And shame on whoever commented that Carla was chunky  do women have to be anorexics with stick arms and legs to be acceptable? She's a gorgeous young woman and those kinds of comments are just ridiculous.".

	onyx:emotionText "Jaded starts out strong but loses steam quickly and trails off into nothing. It raises a lot of interesting issues and then does nothing with them. Omitting the court scene at the end could be forgivable but leaving several loose ends without resolution was unsettling at best. Although for the most part those threads such as what exactly the customers in the bar were paying 500 for have fairly obvious conclusions leaving them hanging in the air in that way robbed this movie of a satisfying conclusion. As it is it almost seems as if they ran out of money to film the courtroom scene and thus made a movie out of the investigation and then just tacked on a ending.The low budget for this film was painfully apparent  it seems almost like a student film. I've seen better production values in porno. Which is puzzling since for the most part the actors involved are professionals that are recognizable from more superior efforts such as Aida Turturro from the Sopranos. Along with any sense of flow the director failed to elicit good performances from her actors that we know can do better with the exception of Carla Gugino who seemed to be acting in a different film with the intensity that she brought to her performance. She was unfortunately the only thing enjoyable about this movie with a strong premise but no follow through.And shame on whoever commented that Carla was chunky  do women have to be anorexics with stick arms and legs to be acceptable? She's a gorgeous young woman and those kinds of comments are just ridiculous.";

	schema:reviewBody "Jaded should not be considered as en erotic thriller because the sex scenes are not for viewing pleasure unlike movies like Indecent Behavior or Friend Of The Family. Jaded is not an easy watch as it's story is difficult to conceive and it's not that common in society. From the beginning of the movie with the first scene you expect more strong scenes. The raping scene wasn't in my opinion a well created scene. I think that the director didn't use proper camera techniques overall in the movie. That's why it looks sometimes dull and becomes boring almost near the end.The performances are extremely good from all the five female characters. These women gave strong intense but believable performances that demonstrate the actresses' dramatic abilities. The legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot's difficulty because the legal term of sodomy is different from a simple raping. From the point of view of Meg's defense sodomy needs to be penalized as a raping a huge crime grade B although it's a different crime. Pat and Alex's defense claims that Meg enjoyed and asked for it. This is where the movie turns interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing for sure is that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. Watch Jaded if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your society. If not give it a try because it's a very good and strong drama.".

Before I watched this movie I didn't even KNOW it was possible for a women to rape another women so it's opened my eyes WIDE open. I also thought that Carla Gugino's acting was excellent too she must of had to dig deep to do this role. And I didn't think the rest of the acting was all that bad either. My overall rating of this movie would probably be 710 which is farely good since not many movies make it past 5 and 6. If you like an intense film about rape you would like this one. The only foibles I had with this movie was as was mentioned earlier the no show court case that everyone expects they shouldn't have let the chase for the offenders gone on so long so that they could have fit the court scene in it just would have made the movie so much better.".

His children  Daphne Thurman Chloe Amis and Jimmy Hewlett  ridicule him for appearing on TV and as a reward for their remarks he drops them off at the Dutch House with 750 apiece and tells them they're on their own.

Maybe the biggest problem with this film was it tried to say too much in far to many areas thus leaving holes or unfinished plot lines.In the late eighties and early 90's the impact of computers and internet on business made a mint for some and lost a mint for other's. Those that fought the old ways no found themselves to be the outsiders in society. Not the artists gay males old homeless men etc. It was and still is a time to reaccess priorities.I liked there was a gay male character shown in such a positive light. The ending is a bit of a sell out for his story line but should not impact the importance of the role during the time it was filmed. There was interracial dating the realization that homelessness could happen to anyone at any time.I also understood the main character's motivation for tossing his college educated children out of their wealthy home ..... he didn't exactly leave them on the street. As was mentioned briefly most of the parents in this super wealthy world were more then ready for their children to leave the nest.The way the adult children adjusted to a new lifestyle and fending for themselves or not and the strange yet strikingly beautiful life they built with friends and new friends was IMO well developed. The movie also covers the territory of the empty nest syndrome and the parents realizing after 26 years they are strangers. The reawakening and strengthening of family values was very inspiring.Final note .... students of art and art lovers or those that enjoy beautifully filmed movies should not miss it.".

Not merely a dysfunctional family but one so immersed in the material world that they've lost sight of what truly matters in their lives. But when it all comes crashing down around their feet they discover that the loyalty of family and friends reigns supreme.I consider it wrong to classify this wonderful story as a comedy  it is a drama through and through despite comedic moments. Though there are moments of coarse language and nudity they are done tactfully and the movie should probably be rerated to PG13. The family learns a hard lesson on what it is to be a family and people shouldn't be so quick to dismiss it due to its R rating.The themes are hardly suitable for preteens but allinall a wonderful movie for the entire family.".

I've had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times since every time I loan it out to someone I know could appreciate it's artistry on all its levels my copy fails to come back home to me lol. The last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for VHS sales has never been made as a DVD that I know of and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before I could tape it again.My favorite aspect after the nailonthehead social commentary is the paintings by Timna Woollard. I've searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. Or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book or video aquarium or as a documentary of her work. If anyone does know of where I can acquire any sort of copy of Timna's work or where her studio is in England please do not hesitate to contact me via email.".

It was embarrassing to watch his performance in fact I was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie knowing this was Plummer of Sound of Music fame!  I see from his bio that he called Sound of Music sound of mucus so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him in it.I wonder if today he was asked how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is what would he say.....?Probably something like Where the Money Is....".

The film is also full of brilliant new characters  and instead of just interview after interview we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well the ending was funny but also botched and failed  none of it made sense. And in parts the film became offensive in trying to be funny  but that's Ali G for you  if it isn't offensive it isn't itself and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief and should have got into the 67 average rating range on IMDb. But it could have got worse as well and people are bound to have mixed opinions especially on a film such as this.On the whole Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best  and funniest and most clever.

You can watch it several times and pick new gags up each time. The humour is both aural and visual and the timing is impeccable. The humour is probably very English and specifically London so its possible that nonEnglish viewers may not get some of the humour.

It actually has a plot as Ali rises to become Primeminister of Great Britain! It has some very funny parts but not nearly enough of them maybe its because Ali G has been around for about 3 years now and the concept is becoming a bit stale now.

Since they are invariably people who feed on public attention it is entirely appropriate to feed on them once in a while. But it takes a seriously misleading confusing and outrageous character to pull it off and Ali G Sacha Baron Cohen does it. Cohen thinks funny Ali G is a hugely funny creation in much the same way that another wild and crazy guy Andy Kaufman invented unforgettably outrageous characters. Ali G Indahouse is Ali G to the third power cubed. The plot is suitably improbable offering an appropriate springboard for the Ali G craziness. I laughed till I cried. The plot twisted around and ended happily and there wasn't a clich that wasn't ragged on or a convention that wasn't exploited and at every turn the absurdity of the Ali G persona looms over all ragging on itself and painting everything with its humor. I like the fact that Ali G is a white middleclass guy who has become a hiphopper and gone native with it. In that way it's about recreating oneself and then bumping up against conventional reality which results in absurdities and humor some attributable to the pretense of the invented persona and some to the ridiculous conventions it scrapes against. It could be a stretch and unfunny. It works and knocks 'em dead.Let me now back away from overanalyzing something that looks uncomplicated and isn't but is hugely funny and deserves just to be enjoyed.

Getting back to the movie this film is likely to offend not only older people but women too. So it is fairly obvious that the movie is intended for a restricted audience.Humour There is more than a fair share of swearing in this movie. There are more than a few sexist remarks in this film.

But there are even a few very funny lines that aren't sexist or obscene. 2525Physical Comedy Sacha Baron Cohen is the one who provides nearly all of the funny stuff in this film but he does it really well. He finds himself in predicaments and tense moments throughout the whole film and some of his reactions are priceless. 1720Plot The plot is very farfetched. One of Britain's party leaders decides to use a stupid young man he sees outside making a fool of himself in his plot to overthrow the Prime Minister. But that young man isn't just anyone he is street tough Ali g who is one bad dude. 615Ending I didn't think the ending was too great.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Da Ali G Show on HBO I had high hopes for this film. I should have known better when it went straight to video.... and then none of my local video stores carried it! The problem with this film is it simply tries too hard. I did not not want to see the Ali G character in his home environment or running for parliament or saving England. In my opinion the Ali G character only works when he is operating OUTSIDE his environment  so we can laugh at how unbelievably stupid he is and laugh even harder at the frustrated often angry reaction his sincere stupidity arouses in all those unfortunate to encounter him. This movie bombs horribly due to the throwaway script and as a result it is an interminable exercise in sheer boredom with maybe 34 genuine laughs to be had in TOTAL. I well and truly HATED it from frame one and it just NEVER got any better despite crossing my fingers and gritting my teeth. I think Sascha Baron Cohen has talent his TV show proves it but this movie shows absolutely NONE of that talent.".

However Ali's Keep it Real' campaign seems to catch on and is more successful than expected.As with most TV  film conversions this isn't high art but it isn't rubbish either.  The story is daft and actually gets in the way of Ali the character.  When things actually need to happen to move the story along it feels a bit forced but when Ali is allowed to be the focus of the scenes it is funny.  The humour is of two types  the humour of the white boy trying to take on black culture and live in suburbia as if it was the hood while the other is dirty rude or crude jokes.  Both are funny for the most part however extending Ali's character to create other characters isn't very good they can't do it like he does it.If you're an Ali G fan then you'll probably like this but may see him as being dumbed down from his normal job of making politicians look stupid. If you like dirty jokes and toilet humour then you'll love this.  However outside of this you may just think it's rubbish and you might be right. It's sexist dirty puerile childish and silly  but when it hits as it mostly does it's very funny.  It also has lots of women for Ali to ogle  although his character is developed enough for us to believe he really does like Julie and is just stuck in character.Sacha Baron Cohen is really good and has added layers to his character to make the leap to film.  He also allows many of the jokes to be on him and does it well.  Freeman is poor and just goes to show how good a creation Ali G is  not everyone can do it!  Charles Dance is OK  but when you see what he has to do at the end of the film then you'll probably agree that he should have passed on this.  Same with Gambon really  although he doesn't sink to Dance's depth.  The rest of the cast are TV level and suffice  special mention goes to the actress who played the Chancellor's secretary I forget her name.how hot is she!Overall it's rude and childish but if you like that type of thing or are an Ali G fan then you'll laugh really hard plenty of times.

	schema:headline " Ali G Indahouse";
	schema:reviewBody "Well alongside his fame and fortune Sacha Baron Cohen has also managed to achieve such a high level of notoriety with his urban character that the actual town of Staines changed its name to StainesuponThames to get away from the negativity. That's pretty impressive Mr Cohen you made an English town change its historic name is that funny?.Like many TV characters that have reached the big screen this whole thing feels padded out forced and struggling for material. Unfortunately this is no different despite being a brilliant and popular creation by Cohen. I think it was a bad choice to go down the actual movie with a plot route as we all know this character like all of Cohen's characters works better when lampooning reality. Seeing the highly naive and thick Ali G trying to strike a conversation with a real politician about current affairs only for him to lower the tone and go off on completely random filthy tangent is what its all about. Hearing Ali comment on his bitch 'Julie' or his various friends from Staines and the things they get up too is amusing to listen too but to actually now see these people spoils the myth as it were.Of course the biggest draw with Ali G is the highly accurate satirical mocking of young British teens black and white who imitate the American rapper gang culture. This is the crux of his laughs his not so secret weapon talking with this modern day slang cum multicultural cockney hiphop dialect that is frankly cringeworthy to listen too when anyone speaks with it especially white folk. Add to that his heavily JamaicanAfro AmericanUK chav influenced streetwise attire with bling tracksuits and big trainers and you have a great controversial character ready for upset public figures.Thing is all of this is completely lost in the film because there is none of that its just a silly bland plot about Ali trying to save a community centre in Staines. There are no funny clever stinging moments because its a scripted movie instead they must rely on childish toilet humour which only works part of the time its immediately unoriginal and loses all credibility. Coupled with the fact the cast is made up of big names merely sinks this project even further big names equals no risks no proper laughs no awkwardness or embarrassing moments its all played safe which is not what Cohen and his creations are about.Now I would be lying if I said there were no funny moments in this film there aren't many but they are there. For me personally the best and most recognisable lampooning of my home country would be at the start of the film when Ali is 'street racing' in his hyper modded Renault down the high street. This very short sequence is extremely amusing because of the stringent UK road laws and the fact we have to drive at 2030mph everywhere. Watching these two uber modded cars crawl down the high street at 30...pulling up sharply at the 20mph speed board is hilarious literately the best bit in the film.Its actually reasonably funny during the start of the film whilst Ali is within his home territory of Staines and his mates. After that as we follow him to Westminster it just loses any fresh comedy hopes and becomes so derivative the character of Ali G does grow somewhat but only in the wrong way. Instead of the chavy boorish dunderhead we all know and love we end up with some Americanised superfly looking pimp that just feels too much of a stretch even for this character. We all know about the typical UK traits that Ali G represents we all roll our eyes at the image he portrays because we all see it in our daily lives that's why its so funny. If you take that away and go down another countries cultural route then your target audience won't relate to it anymore simple as that.In the end this film has just gone too far over the top with the character and its just not funny. Had it been a mockumentary style flick like 'Borat' then it would have worked I'm sure but this option doesn't. Its basically puerile with dated stupid visuals gags and must resort to showing Charles Dance in drag to try and raise a laugh and it fails at that.

	onyx:emotionText "Well alongside his fame and fortune Sacha Baron Cohen has also managed to achieve such a high level of notoriety with his urban character that the actual town of Staines changed its name to StainesuponThames to get away from the negativity. That's pretty impressive Mr Cohen you made an English town change its historic name is that funny?.Like many TV characters that have reached the big screen this whole thing feels padded out forced and struggling for material. Unfortunately this is no different despite being a brilliant and popular creation by Cohen. I think it was a bad choice to go down the actual movie with a plot route as we all know this character like all of Cohen's characters works better when lampooning reality. Seeing the highly naive and thick Ali G trying to strike a conversation with a real politician about current affairs only for him to lower the tone and go off on completely random filthy tangent is what its all about. Hearing Ali comment on his bitch 'Julie' or his various friends from Staines and the things they get up too is amusing to listen too but to actually now see these people spoils the myth as it were.Of course the biggest draw with Ali G is the highly accurate satirical mocking of young British teens black and white who imitate the American rapper gang culture. This is the crux of his laughs his not so secret weapon talking with this modern day slang cum multicultural cockney hiphop dialect that is frankly cringeworthy to listen too when anyone speaks with it especially white folk. Add to that his heavily JamaicanAfro AmericanUK chav influenced streetwise attire with bling tracksuits and big trainers and you have a great controversial character ready for upset public figures.Thing is all of this is completely lost in the film because there is none of that its just a silly bland plot about Ali trying to save a community centre in Staines. There are no funny clever stinging moments because its a scripted movie instead they must rely on childish toilet humour which only works part of the time its immediately unoriginal and loses all credibility. Coupled with the fact the cast is made up of big names merely sinks this project even further big names equals no risks no proper laughs no awkwardness or embarrassing moments its all played safe which is not what Cohen and his creations are about.Now I would be lying if I said there were no funny moments in this film there aren't many but they are there. For me personally the best and most recognisable lampooning of my home country would be at the start of the film when Ali is 'street racing' in his hyper modded Renault down the high street. This very short sequence is extremely amusing because of the stringent UK road laws and the fact we have to drive at 2030mph everywhere. Watching these two uber modded cars crawl down the high street at 30...pulling up sharply at the 20mph speed board is hilarious literately the best bit in the film.Its actually reasonably funny during the start of the film whilst Ali is within his home territory of Staines and his mates. After that as we follow him to Westminster it just loses any fresh comedy hopes and becomes so derivative the character of Ali G does grow somewhat but only in the wrong way. Instead of the chavy boorish dunderhead we all know and love we end up with some Americanised superfly looking pimp that just feels too much of a stretch even for this character. We all know about the typical UK traits that Ali G represents we all roll our eyes at the image he portrays because we all see it in our daily lives that's why its so funny. If you take that away and go down another countries cultural route then your target audience won't relate to it anymore simple as that.In the end this film has just gone too far over the top with the character and its just not funny. Had it been a mockumentary style flick like 'Borat' then it would have worked I'm sure but this option doesn't. Its basically puerile with dated stupid visuals gags and must resort to showing Charles Dance in drag to try and raise a laugh and it fails at that. Such a huge huge error for the direction of this film that has resulted in a very very average outcome.410";

Unlike the latter two films which used the unscripted manon thestreet format of the TV show Ali G Indahouse suffers from using a script.The story is mostly contrived. Alistair Leslie Graham who goes by his wannabe name Ali G is a white kid from the London suburb of Staines who wants desperately to be black.

When the government threatens to close down the center where he teaches a group of boy scouts how to be gangstas scenes of wasted comedic potential Ali G goes on a hunger strike outside Parliament to protest. The hunger strike quickly ends when the reporters covering the event tempt him with some KFC. Ali G is then recruited by a conniving Member of Parliament David Carlton to run for the representative from Staines. Carlton's plan is for Ali G to fail miserably embarrassing the Prime Minister Michael Gambon Dumbledore from all but the first two Harry Potter films causing the PM to be ousted in a noconfidence vote clearing the way for Carlton to become PM. Contrary to Carlton's plans however Ali G proves to be wildly popular by keeping it real. The PM's approval rating soars and Ali G becomes the PM's adviser. Of course Carlton isn't going to sit by idly while this happens.The movie falls back on lazy juvenile humor. Most of the jokes are stillborn and fall flat. What made the TV show so wildly funnyplaying off the character with interview subjects who weren't in on the jokeis completely absent from the movie. The movie does have some good moments such as when Ali and the gang break into the PM's residence and have to break dance through an Entrapmentinspired security system criss crossed with laser beams. And there is some funny commentary on modern society such as when Ali has to clarify over the phone an indecipherable message he texted in shorthand.But without an unwitting victim Ali G just isn't very funny. Luckily Cohen learned his lesson from this film and stuck to the format that made his show so funny in the inspired comedy Borat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Liebermans' entry in the original slasher craze is definitely more well made and intelligent than some. In fact in making it he wasn't so much inspired by Friday the 13th as he was Deliverance. He and his crew make this a powerfully atmospheric outing utilizing the real Oregon woods to great effect and turn it into a fun survivalofthefittest yarn even developing the two main characters in interesting ways. Five young adults venture into the Oregonian mountains to do some camping and check out the local land that one of them has supposedly inherited. Before long they begin to be victimized by a stealthy heavyset psychopath. Slasher movie fanatics who watch this sort of thing for gore andor nudity will be quite disappointed with Liebermans' film as it's clear he has a different agenda going on. That's not to say of course that the women aren't attractive or that there isn't some effective nastiness to be enjoyed. But what the director really wants to convey is the need to have a respect for nature  because it CAN kick your ass if you're not prepared. He begins with an intense opening set piece and generates some truly unnerving suspense this is the kind of film that can have a viewer literally on the edge of their seat. It's also stylishly done take note of one scene transition in particular. Brad Fiedel who a few years later gained his fame with his theme for The Terminator supplies a music score that is chilling in its subtlety. The whistling is a really nice touch. The better than usual cast features some very familiar actors Gregg Henry Ralph Seymour Jamie Rose Mike Kellin Chris Lemmon Jacks' son and George Kennedy as the veteran forest ranger who's aware that the area is fraught with danger. The gorgeous Deborah Benson who really should have been able to enjoy a much more visible career is a standout as the female lead who starts out as a rather tentative character starts to cut loose and ultimately finds her inner strength. John Hunsaker is extremely creepy as the killer. There's one well executed plot twist along the way and at the end an innovative and memorable way of dispatching our villain. The pacing is deliberate the camerawork and cinematography excellent and the scenery beautiful in what has to be one of the more unheralded horror films of its time. It comes highly recommended. Eight out of 10.".

The ingredients are there for a horror delight and directorcowriter Jeff Lieberman does an adequate job at achieving it. It's formulaic woodland horror but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story which is quite basic in a trimmed sense is effectively told in certain realism. Maybe a little more exposition wouldn't have gone astray but Lieberman's craftsmanship makes up for the material's flaws and typical details with rising tension moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by Brad Fiedel's very ominously lingering score. Whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop. Cinematographers Dean M. and Joel King do a striking job too. There's plenty of style abound even with its minimal scope and the buildup is slow grinding. At times the pacing can become a stopandgo affair. It's not particularly violent but there's still a meanstreak evident even if some of it happens of screen. The latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done as it has the darkness coming alive with itS burly killers and you get actor George Kennedy riding his white horse in a slight but wonderful turn. There's a likable bunch of performances Deborah Benson makes for a strong dashing heroine. Gregg Henry Chris Lemmon Ralph Seymour Jamie Rose Mike Kellin and Katie Powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries. The final climax is rather twisted but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinking Is that it? A welletched backwoods slasher item which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm.".

The only version I've seen of JBD is on Paragon VHS supposedly it is available on a compilation DVD but I've never seen it. Anyways I digress... More like the Hills Have Eyes than Friday the 13th this film stands on its own due to it's atmospheric look and style and it's commitment to building it's characters. The film is effectively creepy throughout never wholly revealing the killer to you instead masking the killer or killers through shadows and camera work. The film score is quite haunting and unlike other slasher films it doesn't spike up every time someone moves it just builds along with the suspense and flows with the story. The film was recently remade loosely as Wrong Turn. If you can find Just Before Dawn I highly recommend watching it with the lights out.".

JBD an unhurried frightener flick maintains much suspense throughout which it never loses some of it truly claustrophobic. This horror is one of those few I've actually found truly and effectively scary. Some moments truly jangle the senses. Violence is restrained here too.

It has a less is more thing going for it. The unrelated ten minute opening too is one of grand suspense in a movie that pushes all the right buttons.

Rope bridges waterfalls an abandoned church and the dense Oregon forest set the stage here for a whole lot of fun and some surprisingly sophisticated thrills.It had taken me a long time to get around to seeing this film but boy oh boy what a surprise we have here! Taking pointers from Deliverance and also heavily reminiscent of The Hills Have Eyes despite the fact that the filmmakers refute having even seen that film before writing the script Just Before Dawn is one of the slickest and most dazzling backwoods slasher pictures to come out of the 1980s. While the general premise clearly has little to offer in terms of originality the production values here really elevate the film incredible cinematography of the landscapes and forests are gorgeous while conversely terrifying and the individual cast members and their on screen chemistry is incredibly believable. Sophisticated and wellplaced curves in the plot also make for some understated moments of awe and terror in another's hands the script here could have taken the Friday the 13th route but there is plenty of clever writing and a serious attempt at tension and suspense. The haunting whistling score adds another layer of ominousness to the film blurring the lines around the film's diegesis and composition is it the soundtrack or is someone whistling at us from the woods? Is there a difference? Jeff Lieberman's direction here is amazing and Deborah Benson is perfect in the film's central role. At the end of the day or rather beginning Just Before Dawn is one of the most underviewed slasher thrillers of its time while it is cherished by a great few it is not a film that has fully received the audience it deserves. Pitted against 98 of the slasher fodder that was the 1980s it is the cream of the crop moodily shot wellacted wellwritten and indelibly atmospheric. The film's peers of the time that attempted similar things the atrocious Don't Go in the Woods comes to mind did so with about 110th of the grace and its influence has bled on into contemporary films see Wrong Turn. Really the bottom line is that Just Before Dawn is a class act all around. Imagine how shocked and giddy I was when I found out after watching it that it was basically filmed in my backyard! I think I've officially got summer hiking plans now sans backwoods maniacs with machetes or at least I would hope. 910.".

Through many tense sequences they are stalked by a pair of twin inbred giants as well as trying to navigate and survive the dense foliage and natural pitfalls of the land. The twins remind one of Michael Myers unrelenting brutal monsters with an urge to kill. In one memorable scene not even a tree can stop them which after being climbed by one girl a twin proceeds to methodically cut it down just to reach his victim.The atmosphere is outstanding with the low lighting of the overall film making it even more gritty and dense. Something about being lost in the woods is just extremely frightening in and of itself to imagine. There are some very interesting and unique nuances that take place such as the five campers interacting with the local family multiple times and the ranger being around throughout. The last twenty minutes or so are probably the best as the film just builds and builds.

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface Just Before Dawn sounds just like dozens of other killer hillbilly slasher films. Whitebread Warren buys some property in the gorgeous Oregon mountains and takes his girlfriend Cowering Connie prankster friend Jokey Jonathan and his girlfriend Makeupobsessed Megan and Jonathan's brother Danny aka 5th Wheel to visit the new digs. They're warned away from the area by a ranger a prior survivor AND a creepy mountain family but you know how it is...and they've got a deed! Anyway things go wrong our cast members meet the wrong end of some sharp things. Typical 80s slasher but Jeff Lieberman really manages to make it something special. The woods are both beautiful and ominous the main characters actually seem like they'd be friends in real life there's decent gorea fun twist and a nice example of a character finding some inner strength. Sure I would have liked a higher body count but that's really my only quibble. Give this one a chance and you might like it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see the Horror Classics DVD version of this film before it was mysteriously removed from the 4 film DVD and replaced with something else. The picture and sound quality of the film on that edition was a nightmare in itself. Yet that version is STILL superior to the one with the deluxe DVD treatment. The reason was stated in Brad Fiedel's interview segments on the Special Edition DVD. He had noted what I first found so striking about this film. This being the use of music at moments of inactivity in the film but leaving the moments of activity in silence thus giving the horror scenes a stronger feel. The problem with this reissue is it carries the extra film score used to fill in these intentional gaps in score. Fiedel complained of this and made it clear that the filler music was not his. The music actually sounded a lot like Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. Sad for me that I am also a major fan of that film and have to associate the two.The film itself managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the genre horror film. A group of friends go up on a mountain one of them inherited. On the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmarish secret. The movie moves along at a great pace. In fact every time I have seen it I still find myself shocked to see 45 minutes had passed before things started really going wrong for the campers.While the Horror Classics version is filled with many gaps the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film intelligent and even superior to most slasher films I have ever seen. The Director Jeff Lieberman had made some unique horror films previous to this one making this one the most mainstream and yet very different to the mainstream at the same time. It is a good fun film with surprising acting performances to boot. The new spiffed up DVD version is worth a rent the now collectors item Horror Classics version now OOP is worth the hunt.".

	schema:headline " The latest synonym of 'Horror'";
	schema:reviewBody "'Just Before Dawn' is one rare slasher that has impressed me every time I watched it. The reason lies in its penetrative and intense backwoods atmosphere that disturbs me deeply. Jeff Lieberman has always applied a simple but methodical approach to make the viewers uneasy. His 'Blue Sunshine' could be classified as both simple and bizarre at the same time. The antagonists of Lieberman's films often suffer from anguish and kill for the sake of enjoyment. The creepy and campy atmosphere persistent sound of the nearby waterfall and finally the above average performances by Gregg Henry Chris Lemmon Jamie Rose and Deborah Benson give this movie a constant momentum avoiding any element of boredom. The film has very less gore and almost no nudity making this perfect by all means. One can bet that Lieberman doesn't want to make his creation famous with the help of nudity and gore so the lovers of these stuffs would be somewhat disappointed. On the contrary the movie seems inspired by the atmosphere of John Boorman's legendary 1972 film 'Deliverance' that involves hillbillies somewhat similarly. However this doesn't make JBD a copy cat as it teems with originality and deploys a simple plot to please and astound the viewers.Two hunters Ty Mike Kellin and Vachel Charles Bartlett are out in the woods drinking and exploring an old abandoned church after a successful hunting trip. The men are in high spirits when Ty catches the look of a horrendous man John Hunsaker looking down at them through the roof hole. Ty leaves Vachel behind to trace the man down but is shocked when his truck rolls towards him and he barely escapes injury. We soon witness a grisly figure cutting Vachel open to the groin with a serrated machete. The figure menacingly laughs while Vachel cries in pain. Ty watches in horror when he finds the figure putting on Vachel's clothes and looking at him with fiery eyes. The scene soon cuts to Warren Gregg Henry Constance Deboraeh Benson Daniel Ralph Seymour Jonathan Chris Lemmon and Megan Jamie Rose who are in a camper heading towards the wilderness to have a great camping adventure. On the way they are warned by the forest ranger Roy George Kennedy about the dangers of the wild. Roy persuades them to go back but meets no success. Ahead they meet Ty who is out of his breath drinking and trembling. In a palsied voice Ty narrates his horrible experience to the teens and urges them to take him along. The teens however refuse his request and set out to the woods. Ty left behind gives a satirical laugh while he watches the grisly man climb up Warren's camper.The teens camp at a remarkably serene location filled with the constant sound of waterfall and packed with lush greenery. Everything seems to be as normal as any other camping excursion with an exception of a perverted killer who is constantly on the trail of his young preys. That night they are disrupted when a local old man Hap Oslund comes along with his family holding a gun and furiously advises the teens to leave at once because he thinks that they are doing no good in the wild than 'raising the devil'. The youngsters pay no heed to the old man's words and continue camping. Next day Jonathan becomes the first target of the hillbilly who cuts down the rope bridge forcibly facilitating Jonathan's fall. Soon Megan and Daniel become his targets when they are stabbed in the old church. Finally Warren and Constance are left with no option than to face their enemy.....or enemies? Well there are so many twins around here!JBD is a great effort by Jeff Lieberman and I personally find it more interesting and menacing than other backwoods tales like Sleepaway Camp Cabin Fever and even Evil Dead which all try to intensify the horror aspect with the aid of explicit gore. Surprisingly JBD is very mediocre on gore. Here the viewers are afraid to see the clash between two different cultures the one inculcated in the city while the other tamed in woods. Like 'The Shining' JBD has some amount of hypnotic qualities which I suppose are due to the breathtaking locations the placidity of nature and the fear of wilderness. JBD really comes at par with the other horror gems of 1981 like 'Dead  Buried' 'Dark Night of the Scarecrow' 'The Burning' and 'The Beyond' in terms of horror. 1010 for Mr. Lieberman!".

Roy McLean warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back.

There is an old wooden one room school house that draws the gals and guys inside and it is from that point on the film starts to get very scary. There is one occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree in order to get away from a human beast who desires her body and starts chopping the tree down in order to capture her.

Of course the loonie mountain men stalk the campers. And then the fun begins. No it's not Seven or Zodiac. It's a low budget slasher movie from 1981 but it still stands the test of time.

	schema:reviewBody "For whatever reason I tend to be drawn to these backwoods hillbilly horror films like a moth to a flame. I can't get enough of them. In this particular subgenre I would call Just Before Dawn average. It's not the best I've seen but it's far from being as bad as something like Midnight 1982. In general I think these films appeal to me because of their realism. Monsters ghosts and other supernatural elements are fine but even the most basic and mundane of these films ask the viewer to stretch their imagination to some degree. In contrast we've all heard stories about the crazy inbred mountain people and their distrust of modern society. And while films like Just Before Dawn may take liberties with the extreme violence there's no denying the real stories of actual murders as a result of this culture clash.In Just Before Dawn a group of twentysomethings makes there way to a remote mountain for a little fun and relaxation. They are warned twice once by the Forest Ranger and again by a crazed man in the woods to turn back. Ignoring the warnings they set up camp and prepare to enjoy themselves. But these woods are home to more than the normal forest creatures. There's a killer on the loose and the group of young adults soon become the target. Sound familiar? This plot description could be applied to about a dozen films I can think of off the top of my head. It's that original.I look at Just Before Dawn as a case of missed opportunities. There were places the movie could have gone to break away from the standard 80s backwoods hillbilly horror mold and done something unique. For example more information on the mountain family and what makes them tick would have been very interesting. Or more explanation on the killers and how they lived and their motives would have been very interesting. Or including the subplot involving mountain religions as suggested in the interview on the DVD would have been very interesting. But as it is every opportunity to do something other than have a group of young people stalked through the woods by an unseen silent assassin is missed.To be fair I'll give the movie some credit in a couple of instances. First I thought it was a nice touch to keep the characters real. What I mean is that too often in these movies characters are little more than overdone stereotypes. The characters in Just Before Dawn aren't much different from people I've known. Second there are a couple of very well done camera shots. For example the scene of the killer walking through the waterfall in the background as two characters swim in the lake is very subtle and very effective. Third a couple of the kill scenes rise above what I associate with lowbudget 80s horror. The killing of the hunter at the beginning of the movie is very nice.In the end it's a shame that the makers of Just Before Dawn didn't take more chances. Had they been willing to push the envelope a bit more this movie might have been one of the better examples of this subgenre instead of being merely average.".

At this point these kids should probably start for home but then we wouldn't have a film would we? They drive their camper as high as it will go then hoof it to the summit. But you guessed it them thar demons that they blew off start doing them in one by one. Will the forest ranger save them in time? Jeff Lieberman Squirm turns in this beautifully shot film that is a bit slow at times. I found Brad Fiedel's T2 music score to be very haunting and beautiful a perfect match for the lovely forest and waterfall locations. The cast headlined by Kennedy Creepshow 2 do a go job of relaying the fear of the script which at times came up with some tense setpieces. Just Before Dawn drags a bit but would be an excellent edition for the fan of 1980's slashers.".

There are 6 deaths and one of them you don't see but it leaves you mind to think how was she killed? the stranded theme reminded me of 1977's the Hills Have Eyes which followed kind of the same concept but in the desert with canninbals.

	schema:headline " Much better than I was lead to believe";
	schema:reviewBody "Sure it has its pretentious moments it plays like arthouse liveaction Fantasia but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg  Un ballo in maschera  This segment may very well spoil the film for some people because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot a hackneyed one at that. The photography is unaccomplished. The best thing about it is the bit of Lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with. This segment made me VERY nervous about continuing. 210.Charles Sturridge  La virgine degli angeli  an unclear segment but it hardly matters. The film has the best cinematography of the bunch mainly because it is in a stunning black and white. The segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 710.JeanLuc Godard  Armide  I chose to brave this muchmaligned film for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard I was much more impressed than I thought I would be. I can't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen but judging from what I have seen this may be his best work since the 60s. It is the funniest segment in this film and the most artistically accomplished. Bravo JeanLuc! 910.Julien Temple  Rigoletto  a very funny segment it is also quite predictable. Still this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors. It also has a great selfreferencing joke about omnibus films themselves. The final scene is very weak. 710.Bruce Beresford  Die tote Stadt  this short segment involves too lovers in I think Venice. It is pretty with some nice shots of doves flying about the city. It is slight but nice. 710.Robert Altman  Les Borades  not one of the better segments unfortunately this is more of a music video than a concept short film. It involves the occupants of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance. The music and images work well together so at least I can give it credit for being a good music video. 710Franc Roddam  Liebestod  somewhat unfortunate for Beresford's segment this segment is very similar to it. As you might assume from my phrasing this one struck me much more. It is about a young man and his girl going to Las Vegas on a fatalistic voyage. 810.Ken Russell  Nessun dorma  maybe the most visually striking segment it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. It is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 810.Derek Jarman  Depuis le jour  I have heard a lot about Jarman and this is the first piece of filmmaking I have seen from him. Hopefully I'll see more in the future. This one is also musicvideoish but it is better than Altman's segement. It mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days. The editing and the use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful. 810.Bill Bryden  I pagliacci  the sad clown possibly one of the most famous arias particularly memorable from an episode of Seinfeld this serves as the material separating each segement and the finale.

	onyx:emotionText "Sure it has its pretentious moments it plays like arthouse liveaction Fantasia but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem but I have always had a keen interest in them. I will now rate the segments individually.Nicolas Roeg  Un ballo in maschera  This segment may very well spoil the film for some people because it is absolutely the worst of the whole bunch. It is difficult to follow mostly because it tries to adhere to a clear plot a hackneyed one at that. The photography is unaccomplished. The best thing about it is the bit of Lesbian homoerotica that it never does enough with. This segment made me VERY nervous about continuing. 210.Charles Sturridge  La virgine degli angeli  an unclear segment but it hardly matters. The film has the best cinematography of the bunch mainly because it is in a stunning black and white. The segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 710.JeanLuc Godard  Armide  I chose to brave this muchmaligned film for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard I was much more impressed than I thought I would be. I can't claim to have seen all that many of his films since he made so many that almost no one has seen but judging from what I have seen this may be his best work since the 60s. It is the funniest segment in this film and the most artistically accomplished. Bravo JeanLuc! 910.Julien Temple  Rigoletto  a very funny segment it is also quite predictable. Still this story about a husband and wife who are cheating on each other at the same resort is wonderfully filmed with long complex tracking shots that depend on precisely timed choreography from the actors. It also has a great selfreferencing joke about omnibus films themselves. The final scene is very weak. 710.Bruce Beresford  Die tote Stadt  this short segment involves too lovers in I think Venice. It is pretty with some nice shots of doves flying about the city. It is slight but nice. 710.Robert Altman  Les Borades  not one of the better segments unfortunately this is more of a music video than a concept short film. It involves the occupants of an insane asylum attending a theatrical performance. The music and images work well together so at least I can give it credit for being a good music video. 710Franc Roddam  Liebestod  somewhat unfortunate for Beresford's segment this segment is very similar to it. As you might assume from my phrasing this one struck me much more. It is about a young man and his girl going to Las Vegas on a fatalistic voyage. 810.Ken Russell  Nessun dorma  maybe the most visually striking segment it plays in a fantasy world more than in reality. It is a beautiful tale of a fallen angel. 810.Derek Jarman  Depuis le jour  I have heard a lot about Jarman and this is the first piece of filmmaking I have seen from him. Hopefully I'll see more in the future. This one is also musicvideoish but it is better than Altman's segement. It mainly concerns an old woman remembering her younger days. The editing and the use of different film stocks to represent both time and emotion are very beautiful. 810.Bill Bryden  I pagliacci  the sad clown possibly one of the most famous arias particularly memorable from an episode of Seinfeld this serves as the material separating each segement and the finale. It is simple and effective. 710.Overall I give it a solid 710. It isn't anywhere near as bad as you've heard.";

It's like looking through someone's garbage...you really get a sense for who they are.Based upon what I've seen here here's what I think about each director and their segmentNicolas Roeg  Always an experimental guy but by nature experiments often fail.  Such is the case with Roeg's segment which perplexingly casts his wife Thresa Russell as a male fascist ruler about to be assassinated.  I have no idea what he was thinking but the segment doesn't work at all.Charles Sturridge  This guy must have major skeletons in his closet.  It's the story of three children sadly watching a replay of themselves being killed in a car accident on TV the result of taking their parents' car out for an illadvised drive.  It's a beautiful intensely sad sequence one of the best in the movie.JeanLuc Godard  Never known for being subtle.  This is the WORST of the movies.  If you can't figure out that it's about sexual frustration go live in a cave.  It takes something truly special to make two gorgeous women parading around naked to be so mindnumbingly boring.Julien Temple  Mainstream director somehow having backed into the arthouse scene.  This entertaining bit of absurdity plays like an elaborate Saturday Night Live sketch with a husband and wife out cheating on each other at the same hotel.  It's funny and sexy and surprisingly at home with the more cerebral segments.Bruce Beresford  Great respect of love sex and sensuality.  Pleasant enough basically the story of a woman Elizabeth Hurley giving herself to her lover for the first time.  Nice buns on Elizabeth but it's a wonderful little sequence regardless.  Gorgous photograaphy.Robert Altman  Tell this guy to do whatever he wants and he'll be at a loss as to what he wants to do.  Utterly pointless boring and irritating short about the inmates of an asylum sitting in a theatre awaiting the night's performance.  Nothing but a series of swooping camera shots and people acting crazy.  Really bad.Franc Roddam  Pessimistic and cynical especially when it comes to love. Beautifully shot sequence about two young lovers who travel to Las Vegas to have one last night together before committing suicide.  Subtly gives us hints as to why they do what they do life is a pointless series of tragedies which leads up to old age which makes the sequence all the more heartbreaking.  Bridget Fonda's film debut and it seems she was pretty enthusiastic about taking off her clothes right off the bat.  Nothing wrong with that!Ken Russell  Seems to have known most segments would be deadly serious and pretentious so decided just to goof off.  Russell fans will love this sequence others will probably just be bewildered.  Nothing to read into here a woman is on the operating table after being in a car accident and has hallucinations about being adorned with jewels as opposed to being stitched back together.  Well shot and genuinely imaginative.Derek Jarman  Simplicity is the key.  An old woman thanks happy thoughts of her younger days as an actress.  That's it.  Simple charming moving.Bill Bryden  Let's hear it for the hasbeen.  A dying actor John Hurt performs the famous opera from Pagliacci the sad clown to an empty theater after which he drops dead.  It's a brutally sad sequence about the devastation a performer feels after they have been forgotten by the public.Overall it's an interesting movie.  The girls' bare bottoms and guys' ripped pecs of Godard's sequence will help both men and women get through it but Roeg's and Altman's misfires will have you reaching for the fastforward button.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have long wanted to comment on this film but have found doing so extremely difficult. When released it was promoted as a major work of art whereas in practice it is a hodge podge of short sequences unrelated in either style or content so why bother with it? By its nature it could never have been a great film. Think of any film that you personally regard as a great work of art and imagine what it would have been like if it had been divided into ten segments each created by a different Director commissioned to portray a different but fundamental aspect of human existence................Aria bombed badly when it was first released  I left the cinema feeling that despite many interesting sequences I would not want to see it again. But some sequences proved very seductive and I rented a tape to rewatch them a few months later. After this happened a second time I knew I must have my own copy this has since become one of the most frequently viewed tapes in my private collection. The film comprises a collection of short segments each presented against the background of a well known operatic aria but illustrating or featuring some vital aspect of life as we live it. We can quickly decide which of the various segments mean most to us but we need much longer to decide why and in what ways the others are less satisfactory. Such thoughts keep returning even when we believe we have basically forgotten the film and ultimately make it virtually unforgettable. Clearly even though we are not dealing with a great film it is a very important one.The only link between the ten segments of this film is the fact that each is presented against the background of a well known operatic aria. I would have expected opera buffs who are totally familiar with each of the arias and their context in the opera concerned to have been much less enthusiastic about the very different and individualistic interpretations created by the selected directors than other viewers who are not really familiar with opera as an art form and who accepted the aria concerned simply as background music. But from comments already recorded in the IMDb database this does not seem to be the case. Opera buffs as described above mostly seem to be significantly more appreciative of the various segments of this film than other viewers. This suggests both that the main appeal of opera lies in the music rather than the libretto and that opera lovers are more ready to associate the arias with the emotions which the individual film directors are attempting to arouse even when these are not those of the original opera.Ultimately we are left with ten short films by leading directors each visually creating an emotional experience associated with ordinary life. Inevitably each viewer will find that some segments will appeal whilst others do not. For each viewer the segments which appeal most will depend upon their individual character and life experiences. There are no rights and wrongs in this respect and reviews of this film which suggest that segments A B and C are excellent whilst X Y and Z are failures are of very little value. A more helpful approach seems to be listing those aspects of life that the ten directors felt were brought to the forefront of their attention when they first studied their aria and subsequently attempted to interpret visually in their segments. Not surprisingly love seems to be the most important of these it is featured in half of the ten segments. One shows the love between a newly married couple a second shows a not much older couple who have retained their love but have become disillusioned by the life they have lived have few expectations for the future and are prepared to end their lives together a third shows the pain of unrequited love a fourth the faded love between a married couple who are cheating and a fifth the obverse side of love obsessive hatred that has festered to the point where one human being is driven to plan the final destruction of another. These segments as well as some of the others feature extensive nudity and have led to comments that the film is little more than soft porn. This seems unfair  nudity still has a strong emotional impact and is therefore a useful tool for a director faced with creating imagery that effectively conveys the message he intends within a very brief ten minute film sequence.Another universal aspect of human life is death not surprisingly this is also recognised in several of the segments Other emotions featured in these ten segments include humour and pathos the subconscious urge felt even by the most beautiful women to adorn themselves and the tranquility that old age can bring to those who feel they have done the best they can with their lives. An interesting challenge for those who do not know this film but are familiar with other works by the directors involved would be to watch these various segments and then try to identify the director responsible. Overall it would be hard for anyone to watch this film without experiencing a strong emotional reaction to one of more of these segments and it would be almost impossible for any individual review to do this film justice even if IMDb relaxed their length restriction on comments. This above all is a film where I would have expected that the opportunity to exchange comments about the various segments on the IMDb message board would have appealed to all those who have viewed it. For some reason this does not seem to have been the case.".

Welllll...it kind of sort of worked. Clearly someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the arias chosen for example Bjoreling's Nessun Dorma so if you were blind and lying on the floor just listening to the DVD you got more than your money's worth. Not every director succeeded but more did than not and the flick seems to improve with each viewing over the years. My favorite is the eerily beautiful love duet from Die Todt Statd okay a young naked Elizabeth Hurley is eye candy but her husband singing to her his wife's ghost is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to Otello and Desdemona's Gia nella Notte Densa in all the operatic repertoire. Could the flick been better sure what couldn't not have been but it's well worth a view especially of you're in a hyperromantic mood.".

	schema:headline " Opera's Passing Parade";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film when it first came out in the theaters and a recent viewing on DVD only confirms my initial opinion that it's a masterpiece though a flawed one. So I've been baffled by the abuse heaped upon it over the years by critics and viewers and decided to finally air my own thoughts and what I feel may be the reasons for said abuselMy take on this film differs from others. First I'm convinced that in order to fully appreciate it you have not only to love opera but see it as something essential to your life. Furthermore you must also be willing to agree and identify with the viewpoint of the films' creators that this allconsuming passion with opera places one's estate in today's world in a cultural time warp.Though there aren't many out there who fit this description I feel it accurately defines the demographic of Aria's audience. I also believe that producer Don Boyd and any others who conceived of the daring idea for this film and whose job it was to make ten scenes written and directed independently by different people somehow coalesce knew exactly what they were doing even though the project seems occasionally to have gone awry. The episodes using recordings of Baroque opera directed by Jean luc Goddard and Robert Atman though interesting in themselves are bafflingly out of placeMost of the episodes were cleverly organized to achieve both a cumulative musical effect and further the film's dramatic theme which is gradually unveiled by the entre'acte activities of the seemingly enigmatic character portrayed by John Hurt who keeps appearing between episodes. A kernel of that theme arrives in the very first episode a 20th Century reenactment of the assassination of a Swedish king as portrayed in Verdi's In Ballo Maschera playing on the soundtrack. But contrary to Verdi where a diffident king dies without resistance in the arms of his beloved and in glorious song Nicholas Roeg has his protagonist unexpectedly defend himself shooting all of the wouldbe assassins dead and thus confounding his significant other.With the exception of Bruce Beresford's take of Die Tote Stadt none of the other episodes are dramatically faithful to their operas. Instead most seem designed to reflect an absurd disparity between the remantic sentiments of dead composers from past centuries playing on the soundtrack and the glaring realities of an every day world gone mad homeless children roving the streets a couple's disastrous attempt to cheat on their spouses at a sexthemed resort teens slashing their wrists under the neon glitz of Las Vegas etc.As the episodes progress the film's concern with death  grand opera's favorite obsession  becomes overriding. Also recorded excerpts of busy operatic ensembles give way in the later episodes to arias sung by a single voice.The penultimate episode directed by Derek Jarmon forms arguably the film's dramatic climax. A single radiant old woman dressed in a frayed gossamer stage costume and lit from above is seen bowing over and over as accolades of flower pedals rain on her from on high. The beatific vision is accompanied by the aria Depuis le jour from Luise sung by a mellifluous Leontyne Price. The woman personifies opera itself old and tattered but reveling in her memories taking one last bow as she bids a splended farewell to her loving and appreciative audience unseen but undoubtedly as wrinkled and antediluvian as she.And then the final episode in which John Hurt mimes Leoncavallo's Canio singing Vesti la giubba. As was the old woman he too represents opera  or perhaps the operaloving audience itself  overthetop pouring his heart out to a single female audience member in an otherwise empty opera house. Closeups of the woman reveal her barely concealed scorn for the singer. And when she too leaves the abandoned man falls dead the victim of yes a broken heart! Only a true opera lover could identify with such histrionics.Up to now the music used by each director had been made by recent opera stars in contemporarysounding recordings Price Bergonzi etc. But perhaps to highlight the theme of opera's passed parade this final episode is accompanied using Pagliacci's aria sung by Enrico Caruso in a recording made nearly a century ago. Perhaps it is being suggested that the social revelance of opera has in fact died longer ago than even the films creators had imagined!".

So Aria is kind of a nobrainer.  This movie is obviously not going to appeal to afficianados of classical musicthe videos are generally a little too sophomoric or melodramatic so the target audience is guys who want to see plenty of naked women.  I would recommend this film to anyone who has watched the AnnenbergCPB project French in Action series because the ravishingly beautiful girl who plays Mireille doffs all her clothing in a sublimely ridiculous sequence involving bodybuilders.  One or two of the pieces really do work on an artistic level. The Liebestod piece is mournful tragic and very affecting La Virgine degli Angeli is chillingly beautiful and Depuis la Jour is downright heartbreaking.  But the rest run the gamut from silly Robert Altman's timewasting sequence the Buck Henry bit to completely awful Die Tote Stadt features the most terrible job of lipsynching everbut hey there's a naked girl! the weightlifting sequence hardly plays any music and makes absolutely no sensebut hey there are two naked girls!.   The biggest travesty is the inclusion of Nessun Dorma possibly the most beautiful piece of music ever composed in a video that looks like Mister Rogers' nightmares.  Although it has its moments Aria is basically a chance for these directors to show a lot of female flesh and justify it as art.".

	schema:headline " A very uneven film but very fun to watch";
	schema:reviewBody "Omnibuscompilations films are rarely if ever consistent and Aria is not an exception. It is a fun and interesting film to watch though and while there are a few misfires it is to me better than the IMDb rating and some reviews suggest. It is understandable why there'll be people who won't like it especially for those looking for faithful plots to the operas featured or those who don't like classical music but those who love great music great visuals great singing and some interesting ideas will find a lot to enjoy.As expected Aria is very uneven but actually of the ten segments only three didn't work at all from personal opinion. Those three were Roeg's Un Ballo in Maschera Godard's Armide and surprisingly Altman's Lea Boreades. Un Ballo in Maschera has Verdi's wonderful music and the singing of Robert Merrill Carlo Bergonzi Leontyne Price Reri Grist and Shirley Verrett going for it. Otherwise it had ideas that weren't nowhere near explored enough it was convolutedVerdi's opera may have an implausible story but it was much easier to follow it is one of the least accomplished looking segments in the film Theresa Russell with a moustache and as a male fascist ruler was something that was quite distasteful and weird and it was directed in a way that I had no idea what Roeg was trying to do and because of the chaotic feel of the whole segment Roeg probably had no clear idea what he was doing either. Les Boreades is an example of something with an okay if strange idea that has nothing interesting done with it. Altman is a great director but he directs with little imagination or interest hereit feels very music videolike not much happens and when something does you don't have much of a clue. And it's pretty much the same with Armide the secondsilliest of the segments after Rigolettothough that was actually funny but also manages to be duller and more incoherent than Les Boreades and it's very repetitive. Plus it's at odds at with the music and the story of the opera the opera I consider a tragedie en musique but here Godard does it the opposite except apart from the odd funny moment it's like a comedy with nowhere near enough laughs.However there are some very strong highpoints. Personal favourites are Roddam's Liebestod and Russell's Nessun Dorma sequences. Liebestod is an absolute wonder visually and matches Wagner's magnificent music brilliantly of all the segments it's the segment that matches the music the most effectively. The tragic love story is beautiful and moving and Bridget Fonda makes for a highly credible debut. Leontyne Price's rich powerful voice gives a very haunting quality as well. Nessun Dorma is wonderfully surreal and of the segments is the most imaginative visually. It is a wonderfullooking segment that while having Russell's very marmite style all over it it doesn't feel too overexcessive like some of Russell's films have been prone to. The aria is the most wellknown of the ones featured and Jussi Bjorling's rendition with that thrilling top B is one of the best along with Corelli's and Pavarotti's. Sturridge's La Virgine Degli Angeli also looks stunning with a hypnotic dreamlike quality it's not as imaginative as Nessun Dorma but is a very very close second to Liebestod as the most striking segment. It's also very touchingly done and Price also sings the aria and it's heavenly one of the best of the aria there is. Wonderful also is Jarman's Depuis Le Jour the most emotional and reflective of the bunch storywise. Like Les Boreades there is a musicvideo feel in places but it's actually in an interesting way.Regarding the other three segments they are neither masterpieces or disasters and on the whole work well. Temple's Rigoletto is highly entertaining wonderfully filmed and cleverly shot. But it is a very acquired taste if you dislike vulgar you will dislike this. The farcial comedy shows actor with good comic timing and the segment is worth it for Beverly D'Angelo who is hot with a capital H. As well as Verdi's music and the singing of Robert Merrill Anna Moffo and Alfredo Kraus. Bryden's Pagliacci is not convincing lipsynchingwise but has a very moving performance from John Hurt and the segment is both intimate and subtly dramatic. There couldn't have been a more perfect choice of aria and who better to sing it than one of the most beautiful tenor voices ever Enrico Caruso? Beresford's Die Tote Stadt is beautifully shot especially the shots of the flying doves the scenery is magical Korngold's music is predictably fabulous as is the singing and Elizabeth Hurley is entrancing. It's also charming and touching. It is very slight though and Carol Neblett's voice does not fit Hurley at all angelic it is but it's too mature.To conclude very interesting and fun it mostly looks great and is faultless musically but is very much variable. It was difficult as to rate it either a 6 or 7 but because although the three misfires really bring Aria down to a considerable degree the music singing most of the visuals and four highpoints segments were so good that I'll award Aria a 710.

This aria interpretation was very novel and was deeply moving.Equally deeply moving was the Liebestod from Tristan and Isolda. Lastly how can one dismiss Julien Temple's La Donna e Mobile with Buck Henry and Beverly D'Angelo. It was quite comical.".

No one segment is very long so the whole thing is painless to sit through but I can't really bring myself to recommend it to anyone.The standout segment for me was Ken Russell's which depicts a woman hallucinating while on the operating table after a terrible car accident. It helps that the segment is set to Nessum dorma one of my favorite opera pieces  I would find a filmed toaster glorious as long as it was set to that particular piece of music. Franc Roddam's segment is pretty decent and features Bridget Fonda in her film debut. I liked JeanLuc Godard's segment which is set in a gym and features a bunch of body builders completely oblivious of the naked women dancing around them  perhaps a comment on male narcissism? Robert Altman's segment which is primarily the reason I wanted to see this movie at all is utterly forgettable  the only notable thing about it is that you can tell he was filming Beyond Therapy at the same time as many of the same actors are in both. Nicholas Roeg's segment which opens the film is pretty bad as is Julien Temple's painfully unfunny contribution though it features a smokin' Beverly D'Angelo while Bruce Beresford's is just boring. Watch Derek Jarman's segment for a glimpse of a very young and pretty Tilda Swinton.There's not much to say about films like this. Some portions are better than others none of them are masterpieces.Grade B".

Not really sure if this was just a bizarre coincidence or if it was a requirement but Aria seems totally nudity heavy.Anyways I found the segments set in the present much more enjoyable then the ones in the past which makes the arias that much more pretentious. My favorite of course was the ultrabizarre Bud Cort  Beverly D'Angelo pairing about the cheating spouses. Lots of fun there. Close behind was the strange beauty of the Las Vegas one with Bridget Fonda. Again not all of it John Hurt anyone? works but some of it is interesting enough.".

Not really sure if this was just a bizarre coincidence or if it was a requirement but Aria seems totally nudity heavy.Anyways I found the segments set in the present much more enjoyable then the ones in the past which makes the arias that much more pretentious. My favorite of course was the ultrabizarre Bud Cort  Beverly D'Angelo pairing about the cheating spouses. Lots of fun there. Close behind was the strange beauty of the Las Vegas one with Bridget Fonda. Again not all of it John Hurt anyone? works but some of it is interesting enough.";

	schema:reviewBody "Based to some extent on writers David Croft and Jimmy Perry's own experiences as Butlins Holiday Camp entertainers in the UK during the same timescale the programme follows HiDeHi! epitomises the 'slapstick postcard humour of postwar Britain. Set in the fictitious seaside town of CrimptononSea HiDeHi chronicles the comedic goings on within the Maplins Holiday Camp  one of many dotted along the British coast owned by the megarich but never seen on screen Joe Maplin.Although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and ran until 1988 when the BBC deemed it too tame for it's cutting edge comedy department seasons 15 focused on 1959 while seasons 69 spotlighted 1960  a time when the old style British Holiday Camp began to fall into decline. During the first 5 seasons Jeffrey Fairbrother played brilliantly by the late great Simon Cadell was the camp's entertainment manager a well meaning yet slightly pensive exuniversity professor breaking free of his upper class background and venturing into the real world to head his team of entertainment staff who were in stark contrast to his own laidback personality. From season 6 onwards Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster played by David Griffin when Cadell quit the show at the height of it's popularity an exRAF war hero who in many ways was similar to Cadell's character in background but more a scoundrel than a gentleman.However the real stars of HiDeHi throughout the nine seasons were Ted Bovis played superbly by Paul Shane a stereotypical working class ale drinking bawdy comic  someone who could never resist an opportunity to fiddle the campers Gladys Pugh played by Ruth Madoc who's currently experiencing a career comeback with appearances in the hit BBC Comedy Little Britain chief Yellowcoat what the entertainment staff were called because of their bright yellow jackets and sports organiser  but more importantly the one person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from embarrassment by covering up their inexperience in running a holiday camp Peggy Ollerenshaw Su Pollard the slightly dopey yet lovable lowly chalet maid with a burning ambition to become a Yellowcoat and Spike Dixon Jeffrey Holland Ted's innocent protg learning more about 'show business' than he hoped for.As usual with a Croft  Perry production the assembled cast of characters were a bunch of misfits played superbly by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge played by the late Leslie Dwyer who was in his 70's by the time he left the show the alcoholic childhating children's entertainer Fred Quilly Felix Bowness a former champion jockey with a dubious past Yvonne  Barry StuartHargreaves Dianne Holland  Barry Howard the snobbish former ballroom dancing champions who were in the twilight of their careers and Sylvia and Betty Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard the two main girl Yellowcoats who were always looking for the type of fun Joe Maplin would never allow in one of his camps.HiDeHi typified the slapstick era of the late 50s with it's saucy and to a certain degree vulgar tongueincheek humour jokes about people sitting on toilets and anecdotes about 'women with big knockers' were the order of the day. But despite it's whiff of Carry On funniness it was always so innocent and became something of recommended family viewing back in the 80's. Of course the critics of the show remarked that the show had outstayed it's welcome by a good couple of years but I disagree. While the early seasons focused mainly on bawdiness and slapstick humour the latter series of HiDeHi saw more thought put into the scripts and the main characters especially Spike Dixon  Gladys Pugh were able to grow with more sensitive story lines. That said there were a few criticisms of the show. Clive Dempster was no Jeffrey Fairbrother and the former didn't quite have the onscreen chemistry with Gladys as Jeffrey did I personally think it would've been more believable if Gladys had married Jeff five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused more than just a few continuity errors the disappearance of old faces and introductions of new characters weren't explained properly especially with the Yellowcoats who came and went with much regularity and the character of Gladys Pugh who in the pilot episode was made out to be a freeloving maneater that was suddenly transformed into a naive virgin like character! Also to mention quite pedantically most of the 1959 holiday season was covered in season one so to stretch the rest of the year out in five further series was something bordering unbelievable. Still the show wasn't meant to be meticulously looked upon and the comedy more than outweighed it's flaws.All in all HiDeHi was probably one of the last comedies from the BBC's golden period and even if it never managed to rival such British comedic mainstays as Only Fools  Horses Porridge or even Last Of The Summer Wine Hi De Hi will be best remembered as a comedy the whole family could enjoy. If you haven't already checked it out for yourself I implore you to do so.".

	schema:headline " That's the first rule of comedy. You've got to have reality!";
	schema:reviewBody "I missed the early editions of 'HiDeHi!'. I think it must have been the title that put me off. In those days the Welsh language editions of 'The Radio Times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting information as to what they were actually about. 'HiDeHi!' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or some inane U.S. import. I caught up with it eventually and was surprised to find the names Jimmy Perry and David Croft attached. As was the case with 'Dad's Army' and 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' Perry based it on personal experience in this case his time as a Redcoat at a Butlins' holiday camp. Before cheap air travel came along in the '60's camps such as these sprang up along British coastlines providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners.  As a matter of interest I worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef  Barry Island South Wales  known to all and sundry as 'Shag Land' for reasons I won't go into! The premise is this in 1959 archaeology professor 'Jeffrey Fairbrother'  Simon Cadell  becomes bored with stuffy Cambridge and applies for a job as entertainments manager of Maplin's CrimptonOnSea camp a post he is ill equipped to handle. Life is one long round of spaghetti eating contests and people in silly costumes being thrown in swimming pools. His staff includes resident comic 'Ted Bovis'  Paul Shane  his outupon sidekick 'Spike Dixon'  Jeffrey Holland  miserable Punch and Judy man 'Mr.Partridge'  Leslie Dwyer  snobby ballroom dancers 'Barry'  Barry Howard  and 'Yvonne StuartHargreaves'  Diane Holland  and the unforgettable 'Gladys Pugh'  Ruth Madoc  a fiery Welsh woman who lusted after Fairbrother at every opportunity. Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as cleaner 'Peggy Ollerenshaw' whose driving ambition was to be a 'Yellowcoat'  all the important staff members wore them . A number of sexy girls occupied these coats too most notably Nikki Kelly's longlegged 'Sylvia Garnsey' and statuesque Rikki Howard's 'Betty Whistler'. We never saw Joe Maplin. He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. HiDeHi! was the campers' greeting usually met with the equally inane 'HoDeHo!.

His replacement was David Griffin's 'Squadron Leader Clive Dempster' a war hero reduced to living off borrowed money and with a liking for fast cars. Leslie Dwyer's death in 1986 robbed the show of one of its funniest characters. 'Carry On' star Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as 'Uncle Sammy'. Barry Howard was dropped and Ben Aris stepped into his dancing shoes to play posh pig farmer 'Julian DalrympleSykes'. The period setting occasionally caused problems in one episode Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark. The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era. Still they looked great in them so who's complaining? In another Ted sang the Tom Jones hit 'Delilah' to campers. It was not composed  by Les Reed and Barry Mason incidentally  until 1968.Maplins closed its doors for good in 1988  the camp decided to go upmarket and the staff were told by Alec Foster  Ewan Hooper  that their services were no longer needed  and the last shot was that of Peggy  now a Yellowcoat  all alone jumping into the air and shouting the show's title one final time. I don't rate it as highly as Perry and Croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable. It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting. Goodnight campers! HideHi!".

	onyx:emotionText "I missed the early editions of 'HiDeHi!'. I think it must have been the title that put me off. In those days the Welsh language editions of 'The Radio Times' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting information as to what they were actually about. 'HiDeHi!' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or some inane U.S. import. I caught up with it eventually and was surprised to find the names Jimmy Perry and David Croft attached. As was the case with 'Dad's Army' and 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' Perry based it on personal experience in this case his time as a Redcoat at a Butlins' holiday camp. Before cheap air travel came along in the '60's camps such as these sprang up along British coastlines providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners.  As a matter of interest I worked in one such camp in the '80's as a chef  Barry Island South Wales  known to all and sundry as 'Shag Land' for reasons I won't go into! The premise is this in 1959 archaeology professor 'Jeffrey Fairbrother'  Simon Cadell  becomes bored with stuffy Cambridge and applies for a job as entertainments manager of Maplin's CrimptonOnSea camp a post he is ill equipped to handle. Life is one long round of spaghetti eating contests and people in silly costumes being thrown in swimming pools. His staff includes resident comic 'Ted Bovis'  Paul Shane  his outupon sidekick 'Spike Dixon'  Jeffrey Holland  miserable Punch and Judy man 'Mr.Partridge'  Leslie Dwyer  snobby ballroom dancers 'Barry'  Barry Howard  and 'Yvonne StuartHargreaves'  Diane Holland  and the unforgettable 'Gladys Pugh'  Ruth Madoc  a fiery Welsh woman who lusted after Fairbrother at every opportunity. Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as cleaner 'Peggy Ollerenshaw' whose driving ambition was to be a 'Yellowcoat'  all the important staff members wore them . A number of sexy girls occupied these coats too most notably Nikki Kelly's longlegged 'Sylvia Garnsey' and statuesque Rikki Howard's 'Betty Whistler'. We never saw Joe Maplin. He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud. HiDeHi! was the campers' greeting usually met with the equally inane 'HoDeHo!.

As said earlier it started well but went on way too long. Once Simon Cadel left it went downhill fast you were getting dire story lines and a new entertainments manager who Ruth Madoc again threw herself at. When a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. Unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over. If this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic. As it is it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series.".

	schema:headline " Hear That World You Can Stop Trying Because Perfection Has Already Been Done!";
	schema:reviewBody "A variation of this was said by John Cleese in one of his earliest if not his first appearance on an American sitcom Cheers on which Cleese was Dr. Simon FinchRoyce a colleague of Frasier Crane Kelsey Grammar.In the episode Simon Says Cleese told Sam Malone Ted Danson and Diane Chambers Shelly Long that they weren't suited for one another so Diane kept dragging Sam after Cleese to his hotel insisting he rethink his conclusion until finally Cleese a la Basil Fawlty would scream out his hotel window Listen up World the perfect couple has finally been achieved so you can stop trying!! I thought of this line as I watched the twelve episode set of Hi De Hi available to America. A slight alteration to the quote the perfect sight gag the perfect physical comedy joke.For those wanting to know Hi De Hi was a show that unlike Mr. Bean Doctor Who Fawlty Towers Hyacinth Bucket Are You Being Served Jeremy Brett Helen Mirren and numerous others never reached American public television.Hi De Hi was also about a subject that America knows virtually nothing about these late 1950s vacation resorts in the UK that were a colossal failure it seems.At best at this time in America we had the summer camp for kids such as what might be seen in Disney's The Parent Trap or Bill Murray's 1980s comedy Meatballs.The show however was a huge success and ran for eight years dealing with the staff who ran the resort and tried in vain to keep the campers amused.Definitely two of the standouts were Spike Jeffrey Holland who was the stooge who would be thrown in the pool for jokes often in a different costume which we would unfortunately never see again and most of the time we didn't see him go in the drink and Peggy Su Pollard definitely a centerpiece as a cleaning woman who wants to be one of the entertainers. She will do anything to be part of the show. She almost drowns when she wears a shark costume to Spike's drag costume of the damsel in distress.That Spike and Peggy take their respective indignities with a smile is what makes it difficult to be amused by other characters such as a grouchy puppeteer or disapproving snobby ballroom dance instructors.So in the episode The Day of Reckoning this time Spike must wear the legendary horse costume. But such a costume requires a second person. Once again it is Peggy who volunteers to be the horse's posterior.Could be my big break! she says.They are taken in costume by the horse trainer to retrieve a real horse that has been delivered. The trainer panics when the delivery man recognizes him and flees leaving Spike holding the real horse's reins.The duo decide to head back with the horse and what do they do? They do what anyone else would do who has a journey to make with a horse. They ride it.In the costume.

	onyx:emotionText "A variation of this was said by John Cleese in one of his earliest if not his first appearance on an American sitcom Cheers on which Cleese was Dr. Simon FinchRoyce a colleague of Frasier Crane Kelsey Grammar.In the episode Simon Says Cleese told Sam Malone Ted Danson and Diane Chambers Shelly Long that they weren't suited for one another so Diane kept dragging Sam after Cleese to his hotel insisting he rethink his conclusion until finally Cleese a la Basil Fawlty would scream out his hotel window Listen up World the perfect couple has finally been achieved so you can stop trying!! I thought of this line as I watched the twelve episode set of Hi De Hi available to America. A slight alteration to the quote the perfect sight gag the perfect physical comedy joke.For those wanting to know Hi De Hi was a show that unlike Mr. Bean Doctor Who Fawlty Towers Hyacinth Bucket Are You Being Served Jeremy Brett Helen Mirren and numerous others never reached American public television.Hi De Hi was also about a subject that America knows virtually nothing about these late 1950s vacation resorts in the UK that were a colossal failure it seems.At best at this time in America we had the summer camp for kids such as what might be seen in Disney's The Parent Trap or Bill Murray's 1980s comedy Meatballs.The show however was a huge success and ran for eight years dealing with the staff who ran the resort and tried in vain to keep the campers amused.Definitely two of the standouts were Spike Jeffrey Holland who was the stooge who would be thrown in the pool for jokes often in a different costume which we would unfortunately never see again and most of the time we didn't see him go in the drink and Peggy Su Pollard definitely a centerpiece as a cleaning woman who wants to be one of the entertainers. She will do anything to be part of the show. She almost drowns when she wears a shark costume to Spike's drag costume of the damsel in distress.That Spike and Peggy take their respective indignities with a smile is what makes it difficult to be amused by other characters such as a grouchy puppeteer or disapproving snobby ballroom dance instructors.So in the episode The Day of Reckoning this time Spike must wear the legendary horse costume. But such a costume requires a second person. Once again it is Peggy who volunteers to be the horse's posterior.Could be my big break! she says.They are taken in costume by the horse trainer to retrieve a real horse that has been delivered. The trainer panics when the delivery man recognizes him and flees leaving Spike holding the real horse's reins.The duo decide to head back with the horse and what do they do? They do what anyone else would do who has a journey to make with a horse. They ride it.In the costume. Truly the ultimate sight gag of the costumed horse perched upon a real horse.Hence the John Cleese quote from Cheers Hear that world you can stop trying because perfection has already been achieved. Now the most juvenile of minds might say it looks like a sexual encounter but that is for the viewer to decide.To me it looked exactly like what it was two people in a horse costume riding a real horse.That the Marx Brothers or Lucille Ball or Laurel  Hardy or Carol Burnett never did this very joke is beyond me.The only way to top it that I can deduce is two people in an elephant costume on the horse or two people in the cow costume on the horse or two people in an elephant costume on an elephant.But the blueprint was here on Hi De Hi.";

I'm astonished to find that it rates so highly 7.0 although the mere 300 or so ratings it has garnered clearly reflect that only hardcore fans have bothered visiting this page can't remember exactly how it was that I ended up here. My parents used to watch this tripe back then we only had the 3 channels to choose from and I always considered it an especially cruel and unusual form of torture. Despite consisting of only 6 or 7 episodes per series due to the BBCs seemingly endless cycle of repeats it seemed to hardly ever be off the air.To give credit where it's due many of the actors did a reasonable job the best they could with such appalling repetitive material. It is to their discredit however that only Simon Cadell had the good sense to get out after they won their BAFTA how on earth did that happen? having already seen every joke recycled about 25 times over the course of 5 series. The depths to which it plummeted over the remaining 4 series are probably the main reason David Croft had to create 2 more TV series to provide muchneeded employment for the 'stars' of this awful show by this time we had satellite TV so noone was forced to suffer through these the way my generation was forced to suffer through the likes of HideHi and 'Allo 'Allo.HideHi is typical CroftPerry fare in that all the characters are severely dated stereotypes taking part in poorlyconceived and executed farces that could easily have been written by a drunk comprehensive school drama teacher. I didn't think the 1st series was funny when I was 7 years old and I could barely believe they were still making them when I was 15. Amazing really that the BBC saw fit to screen this rubbish alongside such gems as The Young Ones 1982 and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 1981. Its 'popularity' among a largely captive audience is testament to the fact that by the cynical use of 'canned laughter' it is possible to convince my parents' generation that practically anything is funny.".

The observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from Leone's For A Few Dollars More.  There is one guy in Eastwood's poncho one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit and one seeming to act like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio.  But this movie is not about these guys.  No sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the Stranger.No. this is an altogether different story.In an obvious copying of Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure.  Once again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit.  The Stranger George Hilton is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest.  He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero Gilbert Roland.  But when Monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the Stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work.To round off the trio there is Edd Byrne's corrupt bank executive Clayton. He too wants the money for himself.  But after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot.  Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest.  The game is too find the treasure before anyone else does.  And any gun can play.With plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala The Good the Bad and the Ugly  but with a twist.This movie is not as good as Leone's films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh?  This movie is fun  60s nihilism spaghetti western style.  There are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong  just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it.  And though the movie is not classic the ending surely is.  Hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece.If you like spaghetti westerns check this one out.  It is fast furious and worth the look.".

Right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a welldone satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre.

Edd Byrnes George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved.

Tight closeups overhead shots and shots around corners are all common in Any Gun Can Play.Another plus is the cast that Castellari had to work with. George Hilton is always good in these movies. Gilbert Roland is literally playing Gilbert Roland. And SW newcomer Edd Byrnes holds his own with the two SW veterans.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this today after not having seen it since it was released in 1968. It was a lot of fun but admittedly it is not the equal of the Sergio Leone works or even those of Sergio Corbucci  although both are spoofed here.In the opening scene we see a trio that has two resembling Eastwood and Van Cleef's characters in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and another who is clearly based on Franco Nero's Django. Clearly here Castellari is letting us know that he's going to have some fun at the expense of what had preceded him in the spaghetti western canon. George Hilton's bounty killer dispatches these three and we're informed that his next target is Monetero played by veteran Gilbert Roland then in his early 60s and still the epitome of machismo elegance. At this point he had been in the business for 40 years and with the slightest of gestures blows away his younger cast mates.Monetero and his gang rob a gold shipment from a train loaded with the cavalry as well as Edd Byrnes playing a bank employee. Kookie Kookie lend me some money. His gang gets away with the loot but the money gets away from Monetero. The bank man is after Monetero for the gold shipment Hilton's character They call me the Stranger  a nod to Tony Anthony's films? is after him for the reward and the rest of the film play out a series of crosses and doublecrosses all with a fair dose of humor. The film even anticipates some of the later spaghetti westerns  particularly Gianfranco Parolini's Sabata films which also relied heavily on circusstyled gymnastics. Byrnes' character Clayton gets into some Faibanksianstyled gymnastics fights with both Hilton and later about six members of Monetero's gang and then later both Byrnes and Hilton take on many of the same gang in a bathhouse.None of this is to be taken any more seriously than Terence Hill's antics in MY NAME IS NOBODY it's probably just that this early in the game it wasn't obvious that it was a spoof as the subgenre was barely around for four years. A scene where Hilton and an insurance man spot each other through binoculars tips its hat to a similar scene in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and the overall tale of three men and the search for hidden gold is obviously based on THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY. But the best homage comes at the end a faceoff among the three main characters that satirizes the similar scene in the latter film. Only the music fails to make the point here whereas in other scenes the score is appropriate  as long as one keeps in mind that this is just an affectionate spoof and on its own it is an appealing film. The leads are more than capable  although the looping is often flat and the production design quite attractive. Even at 105 minutes the film moves quickly and never runs out of steam.".

Only the music fails to make the point here whereas in other scenes the score is appropriate  as long as one keeps in mind that this is just an affectionate spoof and on its own it is an appealing film. The leads are more than capable  although the looping is often flat and the production design quite attractive. Even at 105 minutes the film moves quickly and never runs out of steam.";

Thus the philosophy of life or lack there of is summed up once and for all in this less than classic but nevertheless fun spin off of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. In the opening scene three obviously evil gunmen ride into a western town and with menacing glares they intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. The observant watcher will notice that each of these three bears a striking resemblance to characters from Leone's For A Few Dollars More. There is one guy in Eastwood's poncho one in Lee Van Cleef's black suit and one seeming to act like Gian Marie Volonte's Indio. But this movie is not about these guys. No sooner do they ride into town when they are gunned down by someone even cooler than they a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the Stranger.No. this is an altogether different story.In an obvious copying of Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly three gunmen are again vying for a hidden treasure. Once again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit. The Stranger George Hilton is a supercool bounty hunter with a penchant for shooting people while dressed up like a priest. He is after the reward for the bandit Monetero Gilbert Roland. But when Monetero's gang steals three hundred thousand in gold coins the Stranger gets sidetracked from his normal line of work.To round off the trio there is Edd Byrne's corrupt bank executive Clayton. He too wants the money for himself. But after the money is hidden away the only man who knows where it is gets shot. Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion that shows a family crest. The game is too find the treasure before anyone else does. And any gun can play.With plenty of gunfights fist fights and double crosses the action takes these three to the ultimate showdown ripoff a three way draw for the hidden treasure ala The Good the Bad and the Ugly  but with a twist.This movie is not as good as Leone's films of course but in the end who gives a damn huh? This movie is fun  60s nihilism spaghetti western style. There are no rules no enduring loyalties and no right or wrong  just the treasure and whatever it takes to get it. And though the movie is not classic the ending surely is. Hey maybe we all can get along after all for a hundred thousand a piece.If you like spaghetti westerns check this one out. It is fast furious and worth the look.".

The key element in the Spaghettis is IRONY which easily blends into comedy in fact the source of all Spaghetti's is Kurosawa's Yojimbo which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time and most Spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the Trinity films which are both openly Spaghettis and openly slapstick comedy. So why bother satirizing a genre that  by its very nature  satirizes itself? Consequently I found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing.

	schema:reviewBody "Lately I've been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present. There are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movie had all the elements of a decent western a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although it's a spoof of this genre and for me the way it was done just didn't work and made for a disappointing movie.This movie can easily be divided into two parts.The first part is great it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter a.k.a. the stranger going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded in part by a banker. Over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money. There are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre but the comedy doesn't disrupt the overall story.The second half of the film is where the comedy goes overthetop and essentially ruins the movie. The turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place. From this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupidsilly spoof.There are three horrible fistfight scenes one at the river one in the market and one at the baths that follow in rapid succession as if one wasn't bad enough. The fighting is so fake it's ridiculous and since the sound is outofsync with the picture it makes it even worse. In the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus it's clownish. Although the worst part of these fight scenes is the music it's this lighthearted sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of 'HeeHaw'. These scenes practically derail the main story.Overall this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western but the comic turns just mucked it up. If you want to see a good western spoof then see 'Blazing Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western then avoid this movie.".

	schema:headline " Minor effort that alternates between spoof homage and rip off";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie does have its moments. For instance the opening segment features three badmen obviously modeled after the main characters in The Good The Bad and the Ugly only they are like inferior generic Rent A Center versions of Eastwood Van Cleef and Wallach and you think Oh geez are we going to have to watch these wannabes for a whole movie?? Only then they get killed off by the real hero and you breathe a sigh of relief. I liked the movie a lot for that.It actually took me a while to realize that this was more of a spoof of GBU than a rip off I thought the title Go Kill and Come Back represented some ESL translator's clumsy attempt at Spaghetti Western nihilism...but later I realized that it was meant in fun. The original title Any Gun Can Play would have made it a lot more obvious. In my defense most of the scenes are devoted to straightforward action gunplay and exposition. For instance the train robbery scene was done straight and fairly well and most of the other actual killings and gunfights weren't at all campy or cheesy in any way I could see. And Gilbert Roland played his role absolutely straight throughout the movie. BTW now that I've actually seen him act I understand what all the fuss was about. What a great screen presence! And with a lot of the minor roles such as the bandits' chief assistant who could tell the difference? So here's my main problem with the movie. Anyone who has paid any attention to The Good The Bad and The Ugly knows that it is already packed full of deadpan gallows humor and misanthropy. The characters are both enigmatic and completely venal  you never know what they are going to do or say but you do know that it will be consistent with everything else that has been revealed about them. That's what makes it watchable without that humor the movie would have been a mindnumbing deathmarch toward a pointless conclusion with despicable characters we hated and wanted to see dead. Think about it Eli Wallach's character Tuco was already a comedy relief character much of the humor and jokes were at his expense and Eastwood and Van Cleef got off deadpan one liners in almost every scene. The famous threeway Mexican Stand Off is funny because when Tuco discovers that his gun was empty the entire time his outraged reaction is priceless. Even the very last scene is screamingly funny and the resolution perfectly timed evokes a huge sigh of relief although once again it is at Tuco's expense. Go Kill and Come Back simply isn't as good  or as funny  as the movie it spoofs. Most of the scenes even the intentionally funny ones drag on far too long substituting broader more genial humor for dead pan misanthropy and overcomplicated plot twists for atmosphere and character revelation relegate it to minor league status. As a contrast the Terence Hill and Trinity movies which have much of the same feel are much funnier and show what can be done it the screenplay really wants to be tough and funny at the same time. If GBU had never come out and this movie was released it still would have sunk without a trace except for the archives of Spaghetti Western fanatics.Still Go Kill is not all that bad viewed as a pastiche. It was worth watching just to see Gilbert Roland in a major role.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining Spaghetti western with the ageless Gilbert Roland";
	schema:reviewBody "This enjoyable Eurowestern opens with a scene that predates a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for Once Upon A Time in the West but couldn't persuade Clint Eastwood to appear in. Three toughlooking gunfighters ride into a town. One is dressed like the Man with No Name in a poncho. Another is dressed like Colonel Mortimer from For A Few Dollars More and the third is garbed like Django except he rides a horse instead of pulls a coffin behind him with a machine gun in it. Our hero meets them in Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. Any Gun Can Play is a spaghetti western with an injoke on spaghetti westerns since the hero here wipes out the three killers. Aside from a little too much comedy especially in the acrobatic fight sequences this is an aboveaverage oater.The notorious Mexican outlaw Montero Gilbert Roland of Barbarosa and his gang of triggerhappy pistoleros rob an army train transporting 300thousand dollars in gold coins across the frontier. Director Enzo G. Castellari of Inglorious Bastards stages the hold up from a variety of camera angles that thrust you into the forefront of the action. The bandits seize the locomotive along with the coach carrying the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the U.S. Cavalry. While Montero and his gunmen keep the Cavalry pinned down Pajondo Pedro Sanchez of Sabata commandeers the locomotive kills the engineer and his crew and trundles it away leaving the other pistoleros behind to fend for themselves. Essentially Pajondo doublecrosses Montero and steals the gold for himself. Later Montero catches up with Pajondo at the Rio Grande. Before the bandit can reveal the whereabouts of the loot to Montero however a Cavalry sergeant shoots Pajondo dead. Before he dies Pajondo tells Montero about a medallion that serves as a clue about where he stashed the treasure. The irate Cavalry captain Ivano Staccioli of Commandos imprisons Montero but he cannot loosen the bandit's tongue even after he uses his whip on him. Infuriated by Montero's reticence the captain threatens to have the Mexican shot if he doesn't talk. Meanwhile the jailers let a priest speak to Montero but he really isn't a priest. The sixgun toting Stranger George Hilton of The Ruthless Four masquerades as a man of the cloth and rescues Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately before Montero is rescued Clayton Edd Byrnes of TV's 77 Sunset Strip takes the medallion away from him and keeps it for himself. Clayton is the bank representative that was sent to safeguard the gold. He is horrified that the Captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's career at the bank hinges on his ability to recover the gold. The Stranger stages a fire at the fort to distract the firing squad and Montero takes the Captain as hostage and tries to escape but the Stranger shoots him off the horse. Before the authorities can verify that Montero is dead the Stranger claims the body for the handsome reward he will receive and he rides out with the Captain's gracious thanks. No sooner have they left the fort than Montero's men show up to rescue him from the Stranger. From this point on the Stranger Montero and Clayton forge shortlived alliances among each other as they search for the gold. Castellari and scenarist Tito Carpi who has penned a number of spaghetti westerns such as A Few Dollars For Django and another Castellari oater Seven Winchesters for a Massacre rely on clever humor and surprise reversals to keep the action fresh and fastpaced. One cool scene has Clayton seated at a table about to eat his meal when he hears some suspicious sounds from behind him. Clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the gunmen behind him with holstered sixguns.Any Gun Can Play lives up to its title. In fact many guns do play and at least twenty or more corpses pile up before fadeout. This western isn't so much a parody as it is a knockoff of Sergio Leone's The Good the Bad and the Ugly. Mind you bad guys and good guys fall as frequently as tenpins in a bowling alley but their deaths aren't depicted in the brutal fashion of a Leone western. Any Gun Can Play doesn't take itself as seriously as the aforementioned Leone masterpiece. The three leads jockey back and forth for supremacy. Each has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure but they refuse to share their information until the shoot'em up finale. Lenser Giovanni Bergamini's colorful widescreen photography is spectacular especially the opening shots of the train chuffing along railway tracks with distant mountain peaks rearing up dramatically in the background. Another great shot occurs when Montero tests the Stranger's imperturbable calm. This scene happens after the Stranger has rescued Montero and the Mexican's minions arrive to save their chieftain's bacon. Confiscating the Stranger's sixgun Montero takes aim at the ponchoclad tough guy and empties the revolver placing his wellaimed bullets harmlessly in and around the unflinching gunslinger. Bergamini who photographed Castellari's World War II thriller Inglorious Bastards frames the scene with the Stranger in the background and his pistol in Montero's hand in the foreground for a pleasing threedimensional style shot. Meanwhile Francesco De Masi's lively orchestral soundtrack is as memorable for its own idiosyncratic melodies as Ennio Morricone's soundtracks were for the Leone westerns. The opening song is reminiscent of a 1950's Hollywood western with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although it isn't a major spaghetti western Any Gun Can Play is always entertaining nonsense with interesting plot twists and good performances especially the indefatigable Gilbert Roland who was 62 years old at the time!".

	schema:reviewBody "The sensational success of Sergio Leone's spaghetti western trilogy the Man with No Name films created a tidal wave of imitators and spoofs that washed over the cinematic landscape. This one a serious yet whimsical take on the genre is one of the more enjoyable ones. Hilton plays a bounty hunter who heads out after Roland a noted criminal who has just robbed a train of 300000 in gold. Byrnes is a bank officer who was escorting the gold and who now wants to recover it. These three men compete with each other and sometimes align with each other in order to reach the treasure which has been buried somewhere and can only be found by using a medallion carrying a family crest on it. The medallion has been cut in two meaning that the pieces must be reunited in order for the gold to be located. Lots of fighting and backstabbing takes place on the road to the finale. Byrnes though topbilled is actually playing a more supportive role here. His famous hair looks quite ridiculous in the old west setting and he's no great actor but he manages to drum up a few effective moments notably when he decides to take on Hilton in a fistfight. Hilton is incredibly handsome and sexy. Again he's not an actor that's going to raise the roof but he does very well in his cocky and mysterious role. Roland adds presence and weight to the film and is effectively sly and dangerous. The film deliberately pays homage to other greater spaghetti westerns in a tongueincheek way. There are plenty of creative camera angles intense staredowns and elaborate fight sequences that go on too long on purpose. The facial blows are given a cracking whip sort of sound effect enhancing the camp factor. The music for the film is enjoyable too and there's a hilarious Frankie Laineesquire song over the credits referring to The Stranger Hilton's character. Careddu sporting impossibly red hair appears as Roland's cohort and lover. It's not a film to be taken seriously but rather a gentle parody of the type of western that was being churned out at the time in droves. On that level it succeeds rather nicely!".

Director Enzo Castellari's sprightly direction is sprawling and mostly lightweight but there's potential in many of his grand showy set pieces and smooth rhythmic pace. Largely there's a lot of tussles fistfights and plenty of acrobatic stunts taking place compared with allout vicious shootouts. However most of these stunts are very well done and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn. The traditional story sticks close to conventional details but since there's a lot of conniving and outfoxing going on the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three. This leads up to many effective suspenseful moments clever twists and plenty of wink wink. The humour within the starch script is pretty sly. Worked in favourably amongst the light and zesty style is Giovanni Bergamini's dynamically taut framing and Francesco De Masi's impulsively rousing music score. The performances are extremely well tailored and form a striking rapport. George Hilton's wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a poised performance as Clayton that holds up well. Kareen O'Hara doesn't get much to do but is a worthy looker.

Even though Edd Byrnes' 'kookie' persona kept intruding he still managed to maintain a sufficiently duplicitous posture as banker Clayton. The slick move he pulled with the spilled drink to catch a reflection struck me as surprisingly clever. The best though was taking up the pugilistic stance to mix it up with the Stranger that was hilarious! The movie has some outstanding cinematography purporting to be the border of Mexico and it provides a great scenic backdrop to the action. The 'tres cientos mil' dollars at the core of the story is never seen until the end of the picture when it showers the principals and even then I had the impression that if the three hombres had it to do all over again it might have gone an entirely different way.".

The best though was taking up the pugilistic stance to mix it up with the Stranger that was hilarious! The movie has some outstanding cinematography purporting to be the border of Mexico and it provides a great scenic backdrop to the action. The 'tres cientos mil' dollars at the core of the story is never seen until the end of the picture when it showers the principals and even then I had the impression that if the three hombres had it to do all over again it might have gone an entirely different way.";

	schema:headline " This Spaghetti Western is somewhat worth playing. Just wish it was a little more serious than silly. It got really dumb at times.";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't get why some Spaghetti Western critics and fans said that this film directed  written by Enzo G. Castellari with some help from cowriters Romolo Guerrieri  Tito Capri is a complete ripoff of director Sergio Leone's 1966's masterpiece 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' when in truth it's really does not mirror that film that well. Don't get me wrong the concept of three corrupt gunmen having to team up and doublecrossing each other in a cat and mouse game in order to find ambiguous clues of the whereabouts of a hidden treasure does sound familiar. Plus the way this film was shot with certain scenes in very extreme close up or drawn out to stage gun sequences with hands slowly reaching the holster might look like it came from Leone's work but the similarities end there. For starters this movie doesn't have antiwar message like the others as the film isn't set during any period of historical wartime. Also it doesn't focus too much on military supporting characters and their sense of morality. They barely made appearances after the first half. Instead the movie focus on a group of bankers and their morality bankrupt ways in getting the gold along with Mexican gang members who willing to betray one another for the chance to get near it as surrounding characters. Another big different is that this movie doesn't do a good job deconstruction the old west romanticism like Leone did with his gritty over violent action sequences. This film somewhat lost some realistic ground with it's over the top cheesy fakelooking gymnastic trampoline style stunt work  pulp adventure style sound effects during fist fights. There are even comedy sequences where people fight in their underwear in a bathhouse and in a saloon with a midget helping out the protagonists. It's all quite ridiculous. Plus these scenes practically derail the main story as it adds to the runtime as mindless filler. Because of that it made the movie so badly paced. Nevertheless my main beef with this movie is that the director doesn't seem to know exactly how he wants to approach the subject manner. It's felt like a hodgepodge of childish comedies and adult driven dramatics. The direction was all over the place making it very jarring to watch. Regardless of that the movie is very well shot. I like how the director  his crew aren't unafraid to try different new things with their camera. A great example of that was the reflection in the spilled wine scene with one of the main character's entrance being shown in a vivid reddish background like dip in blood. Another series of amazing shots was near the opening of the film with the train chuffing along the railway tracks in goldish dusk with distant mountain peaks rearing up dramatically in the background. It was spectacular. It gave the audience a sense of foreshadowing on what would happen next. The ambush action sequence that follow it was truly the best scene in the film. Sadly the climatic Mexican standoff scene toward the end was not so memorable. It was highly buffoonery. Still I have to give props to the main trios of actors. You never know what their characters were going to do or say. George Hilton's wry and scuffed turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger was decent. Italian's Gilbert Roland adds presence and weight to the film and is effectively sly and dangerous as Montero. Not only that but Roland also brings class and intelligence to his role. He look  felt like sophistical Clark Gablelike villain. By far the best performer in the film. While Byrnes's boyish hair look quite ridiculous the actor gives a poised performance as Clayton. It still holds up well for somebody that started his career in soaps. As for the rest of the supporting cast. Gerard Herter Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli provide able support. While Stefania Careddu AKA Kareen O'Hara doesn't get much to do. She truly was nice eye candy. In the end the film had very excellent performances overall. As for the music. The composition by composer Francesco De Masi was a mixed bag. The opening song was catchy with it simple lyrics and loud guitar riffs. Yet the circus like music that played during the fistfights felt bizarre and highly dopy. As for the rest of the music it felt very average  somewhat forgettable. Not as iconic as composer Ennio Morricone's music from 'the Good the Bad and the Ugly'. That's for sure. Still I kinda dig how this movie opens up with three minor caricature of characters from that movie getting gunned down by 'the Stranger'. While this scene was indeed pointless as the rest of the film has nothing to do with it. It was a really welldone moment that tries to show that there is a new badass in the Wild West even if this later movie isn't as well known. After all this film did it a lot better than the awful opening to 1967's 'Little Rita of the West' which really lampoon the genre by having a pop singer kill the wellknown harden criminals. It's just sad that there isn't much good picture  audio quality copies of this film out there. A lot of the lower priced DVDs will have distinct audio hissing  poor color saturation. Some of them like the cheap box set collections from Mill Creek and St. Claire are really in bad shape as they're not presented in widescreen nor great dubbing. Then there are those foreign DVD copies under the film's alternatives titles 'Blood River' 'Glory Glory Hallelujah' '300.000' 'For a Few Bullet More' 'Go Kill and Come Back' that impossible to watch due to how out of sync the languages are. Regardless if you can find yourself a good copy. This movie is still worth the watch even if some of the action scenes  jokes don't leave you with a bang.".

But then when the film reaches the halfway mark there is a jokey fistfight between Hilton and Byrnes. It isn't very funny and is the weakest part of the film but it throws everything you have seen previously in a new light. You realise that in fact the whole thing is a spoof of Spaghetti Western conventions and in retrospect the first half is so well done that you completely miss this spoof undercurrent. What now follows is a more obvious parody with even some acrobatic jumping around from Brynes that predates all those seventies Circus Westerns. The ending a complete sendup of The Good the Bad and the Ugly climax is very well done as in other hands it could have been very silly.

Perhaps one of the funniest moments I have ever seen in an ERNEST flick was in this one where he walks up to an African tribe with the woman he longs for and says Let me take care of this You have to know how to talk to these people!  He then proceeds to talk some Ernest Jibberish for a few seconds until the tribe leader knocks him out with his cane!  Simply Hilarious!!!  Even the very opening of the film where ERNEST mimics a bunch of Animals with his rubberface and funny voices will have you laughing from the getgo!  I sure am gonna miss seeing any new goofy hijinx for our good buddy ERNEST. Star Jim Varney was sadly taken from this lifetime too early at the age of 50 due to Lung Cancer.  Thankfully his performances will Live on Forever on DVD! I think John Cherry and Coke Sams need to make the 10th and Final ERNEST Film ERNEST GOES TO HEAVEN which would be a biopic about the real life of the man who played our good buddy Ernest.  God Bless ya Jim!".

I think it's because Varney has a way of stealing a scene or a show and overshadowing every one. My favorite characterbesides Ernestcame out. Good old bitter Auntie Nelda. She's always fun to watch. Hey You the Hindu cracked me up and was the first time I've seen that character. But what really took the cake was Varney dressed up as a Harem Girl and dancing to the beat of his own drum. But 'she' catches the eye of the prince and not knowing that the Harem Girl is really a manVarney the prince kisses 'her'. I laughed so hard especially when the camera got a close up of Varney doing his 'Eewwwww' face. I have to say Varney doesn't look bad in a blond wig and false lashes. It also got me to wondering since Varney and Robin Williams were friends did Varney's character Auntie Nelda inspire Robin's character Mrs. Doubtfire? Coincidence? They do resemble one another quite well. I do wish that 'Ernest the Pirate' was finished. I would've loved to add that to my large 'Jim Varney' collection. I'm happy about my array of Ernest movies and sad as well because I know there will be no more and I have to be satisfied with all the Ernest movies and Jim Varney movies I have. And no I will NOT resort to watching the 'New Ernest'. That would be an insult to the 'Real Ernest'. It's like a slap in the face to Varney. I recommend watching this movie but I will say this it isn't for small children. Teenagers are OK. No there's no bad language or crude sexual content. But there is the deal with the rhino named Dorothy who takes the heads off the goons which you don't see but it's implied. And there is an implication of cannibalism. So no not for the younger crowd. It is rated PG so adults have to decide if their kids can watch it. I love it! I'm a sucker for anything Ernest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actually feel quite bad for saying this and criticising 'Ernest Goes to Africa' because this is coming from somebody who while acknowledging that they had faults and were not great films actually enjoyed most of the 'Ernest' films in a guilty pleasure sort of way and made a conscious effort to take them for what they are. Felt somewhat nervous reviewing the film and criticising it.Mainly because of people getting the wrong idea about me. Am a long way from a detractor a defender if anything and actually wanted to like 'Ernest Goes to Africa' having liked all the theatrically released films while being a little harsher on the straight to video outings. Regardless of the critical reception for all the films being nearuniversally negative while being more positively received by audiences. But partly because of the trend for critics to be bashed with anybody offering as much as a criticism for any of the films being at the risk of being shouted down and made to feel that they're wrong let alone dislike it.This sort of attitude reeks of arrogance and has gotten significantly worse in recent years. Usually try to refrain from saying this or bringing this up but this is becoming increasingly annoying whatever has happened to respecting people's opinions regardless of whether you agree or disagree. It really isn't that hard to do.Back to reviewing 'Ernest Goes to Africa'. 'Ernest Goes to Africa' is not without redeeming qualities none of the 'Ernest' films even the weaker ones are unsalvageable. The best things about it are the music and Jim Varney. The music is full of rocking energy and affectionate nostalgia and really adds a great deal to the action in the film. It's hard still not to relate to Ernest the sort of character that is a wellintended serial bumbler with a wellmeaning big strong heart but always finding himself messing up without intention.Varney is fun and likable in the role to me there is enough freshness in the interpretation to not make it too tired or endless mugging and his performance does give the film much needed energy. A few parts are funny personally liked the beginning and thought the highlights were the tribe scene and the character of Hey You.However faring worst are the story and Linda Kash. Even for an 'Ernest' film where the story was never a strong suit as well as being the thinnest story of the series the story in 'Ernest Goes to Africa' is the series at its dumbest most muddled and dullest with a real lack of momentum due to some scenes such as the overstretched and poorly staged chases going on for far too long. Complete with a ludicrously contrived ending that belongs more in a badly done cartoon. Kash has the single most annoying character of the whole series especially in her treatment of Ernest who really did not deserve how she treated him and she is atrociously irritating in the part.The supporting cast are no better with the villains being nonthreatening and their actions are silly and repetitive. Varney is the sole bright spot in the acting stakes. 'Ernest Goes to Africa' is really not written well at all either. The humour works a few times but they only happen in glimpsing flashes rather than as an overall whole. Nobody expects a sophisticated script in an 'Ernest' film that was well established with as far back as 'Ernest Goes to Camp' that's right the one that started it all off and it's like expecting a porn star to have acting talent. The script however is truly infantile with constant groans and head shakes than laughter hearing some of it is enough to make one feel like their IQ has significantly dropped.Likewise with the gags which suffer from being childish and contrived and from lack of momentum from some going on too long. Pacing is dull and makes the short running time feel longer while the direction is just as dull and bordering on ineptly clumsy. 'Ernest Goes to Africa' is the cheapestlooking of a series that have always been clearly low budget though the theatrically released films didn't fare anywhere near as badly as the straight to video ones the scenery looks fake and the camera work. One doesn't expect such low quality for a film from the late 90s with filmmaking generally become significantly advanced technically when done right overtime.Overall disappointing and to me the weakest of the 'Ernest' films. 410 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " What a pathetic film!";
	schema:reviewBody "I honestly don't know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa. Aside from two or three good laughs dispersed throughout the film there is nothing positive about this hourandahalf waste of time and life. It is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act film and edit this piece of trash and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment in the Ernest series.During the opening credits of the movie we see Ernest posing next to various African objects such as wooden masks and the heads of African animals making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd graders laugh. This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's frequent attempts at humor and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95 of the time.The first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is. Everyone in the film is a typical Cmovie actor but Linda Kash stands out as especially terrible. She is the epitome of overacting all of her lines are delivered with shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that you'd find only in a middle school play. Most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance. Jim Varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete retard trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices.Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe. The gems then make their way back to the United States where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market. He hides them in a bucket of two for a dollar items and then runs from the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene a waitress he likes so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems. He later takes them back to his house paints them and glues them together to make a yoyo. He gives the yoyo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average shmoe and she wants a man of adventure. Rene and Ernest are tracked down by the henchmen and are then brought to Africa to be kept as prisoners.Most of the movie really doesn't make sense. Once Ernest is in Africa he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river. In the next scene we see him as a Hindu servant named Hey You. His skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth. At first I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the film in addition to Ernest but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy once Hey You began to speak.Another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the African wilderness. Rene and Ernest have taken an ostrich farmer's truck and are being chased by the henchmen. Driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road both henchmen are shooting at Ernest who is in the back of the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest on the other hand is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver. The henchmen never hit Ernest once during the five minute chase but Ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke. I should also add that Ernest is slingshotting the eggs two at a time from a large bra.The set design is also incredibly poor in this movie. There is a large portion of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking in Africa trying to find civilization. During their hike we see them walking through fields and jungles which probably could have been shot anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply plain grassy fields with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near Africa they could have at least digitally added some African trees in the background and the jungles look like the woods of rural Connecticut with papier mch skulls vines and thorns hanging from trees. According to IMDb.com the film was actually shot in South Africa but I still wouldn't believe that at all.The movie goes on and on Ernest joke after Ernest joke. The rest of the movie doesn't really make any sense either the African tribesmen all speak English for some reason and Ernest is later challenged to a Battle of Truth by the lead henchman who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive. The henchman has a table of axes swords knives and maces before him while Ernest has a table with a sandwich a teddy bear and a few other worthless items. However Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day.Overall this movie is painful to watch. I couldn't handle it in one sitting I had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate Varney's humor. They should really put a Surgeon's General Warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie. I would have to say that out of all the movies I have ever seen none comes close to being as pitiable as Ernest Goes to Africa.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film when it came out in '97. I was in third grade at the time and was attracted to a new Ernest adventure. Even at age nine I found it an unfunny complete waste of time. I wasn't a hard kid to please nine year olds usually aren't but it was a bad sign when lovable and hilarious Jim Varney as Ernest P. Whorrol couldn't get much of a reaction of me.     Last Thanksgiving I was looking through the TV guide and found that Ernest Goes to Africa was on USA at two in the morning. It was a lonely secluded slot and I decided to give it some company. Then fifteen I just wanted a smile and an hour and half of entertainment. My judgement hadn't changed in five years and I constantly flipped channels but for whatever reason this one had me coming back.      You see there is some kind of odd magic about this film that drew me in for some reason. Maybe it's Varney's presence...maybe its the wonder of generic late night USA but whatever it is I would actually recommend watching Ernest Goes to Africa.     The story is predictably trite.  Owing oh so much to Raiders of the Lost Ark' the plot involves the theft of priceless jewels the Eyes of Agolie being stolen from a worshipping tribe by ruthless archaeologist Mr. Thompson.  They inadvertently end up at a flea market where Ernest finds them and makes a yoyo out of them.  Quick criticism these jewels look completely like plasticit seems like director John Cherry III didn't even try.  With Ernest's beloved Rene a waitress who is sick of hometown ordinary shmoes' he is kidnapped out of suspicion and ends up fleeing Thompson and his goons in a series of scenes that become more and more unwatchable in a downward spiral.    There are some honestly terrible scenes that will no doubt repel you. It starts off on the wrong foot with a desperate opener where Varney tries and tries with his large amount of comedic skill to bring out laughs with his reactions to different African artifacts but the scene fatally doesn't work.  Jim is brilliant at Ernest but in this unrelated beginning he feels like some goofy friend trying to bring out a laugh when your in a mood incapable of letting you smile.        The film has even more to complain about.  It is shot on a pretty cheaplooking video that may turn you off right off the bat.  It seems every actor present besides Varney is either a bad one or just an irritating one especially Linda Kash as Rene.  The traditional Ernest gags like the cranky granny have finally become tried thanks to Cherry's dull direction this time.  He has a noticeable boundary between liveaction cartoon and adventure film and it is painful when frequently crossed.  This is by any definition an uneven film due to this boundary.      OK enough smushing this film that is too easy of a task.  Liking it is a hard one but I challenge you to attempt it.  This film has a great asset how much fun it is to hate it.  If you don't feel the compelling magic I felt to watch it then I recommend it for this pleasurable bashing even if you are not a cynic.        The bottom line here Ernest Goes to Africa' starts of catastrophic flattens even more in the middle and has an unpredictably unsatisfying ending but if this comedic adventure isn't somehow an escape from boring old life then I don't know what is. I recommend renting this bad film staying up late and letting it take you out of your head for an hour and a half.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White is a great reada creepy and funny mystery novel with multiple narrators one of which is one of the strongest female characters I've ever come across in Victorian fiction. Unlike some of the other IMDB critics of this film version though I read it only after seeing the BBC production. While I thoroughly enjoyed the film its plot is almost totally different from the novel. It made me wonder if the writers had read two Wilkie Collins novels and decided to combine them taking the character names from one and the plot twists from the other.The look of the production is impeccablegorgeous costumes lovely English country houses and a use of light and shadow that perfectly captures the pervasive disquietude. I especially liked that two of the scariest scenes took place in broad daylight in lightcolored places instead of such customary gothic locales as dark cobwebby dungeons. The BBC's recent Victorian productions have all striven for an accuracy of period detail no more beehive hairdos worn with hoopskirt gownsthat includes dirt and squalor along with sumptuous furnishings. The  PreRaphaelite art angle though not in the book is neatly tied in too.And the acting is excellent. Tara Fitzgerald and Justine Waddell seem to have cornered the market on these period pieces and Fitzgerald in particular is perfect as Marion the steely but loving sister of the soft and sweet Laura. Ian Richardson the diabolical MP Francis Urquhart in the House of Cards trilogy is brilliant as the girls' hypochondriac uncle thrown into paroxysms at the sound of loud noises. Simon Callow is Count Fosco the villain who kills with a caress. He and Marion are worthy opponents don't miss the scene in the British Museum when she glares at him over an Egytian sarcophagus and subtly lets him know that she is onto him.One flaw in the production is the irrelevant voiceover at the beginning and end of the film but it is not serious enough to mar one's enjoyment of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends says Marion Fairlie who with her halfsister Laura lives in a vast midVictorian country estate. And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. Normally people who are dead stay dead just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then there was nothing normal about what happened to us... And we're off on a firstclass Gothic story of madness deception and villainy based on Wilkie Collins' great novel of Victorian mystery. It's a good idea to pay close attention because there are plots within plots yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves what else money lots of money. Marion Fairlie Tara Fitzgerald and her sister Laura Fairlie Justine Wadell are devoted to each other. Marion is fierce and protective Laura is softer and much more romantic. Marion has no money of her own Laura will inherit riches when she comes of age. Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of Laura has been pledged sometime ago to Sir Percival Glyde James Wilby an altogether too charming aristocrat. They are the wards of their uncle a fussy condescending immensely selfcentered hypochondriac Ian Richardson. All seems to be quite routine but then a young artist Walter Hartright Andrew Lincoln is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he arrives at night to the local train station there is no carriage so off he sets out on foot to the estate. In the dark woods he encounters a strange woman dressed all in white wandering about and speaking of things he does not understand who then disappears. Are we uneasy? Yes and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like Laura. Later does love emerge between Walter and Laura? Does a bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival? Does a canker gnaw? And do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among Laura Marian and the woman in white...do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions...do we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival's close friend Count Fosco Simon Callow...and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity as well as the power of honor and true love that humanity is capable of? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums see falls from high towers dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church? Well of course and it's a grand journey for us. This BBCMasterpiece Theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values. To fit Collins' 500pluspage novel into a television show of less than 120 minutes means a good deal had to be cut or abridged and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available. Still taken on its own terms the production of The Woman in White in my opinion works very well as a moody romantic dark television tale. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin who still has charm amidst the villainy. Ian Richardson as the young women's uncle almost steals the show. He gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalances the story every time he appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is simply a monster yet a supremely civilized and charming one. Collins described him as being of immense girth. Callow does a fine mannered job of it but to me he lacks a little of the monstrosity of evil. At one point Marian tells us My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels we sometimes act as if we were in them. Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura.".

	schema:reviewBody "Judging from the vehement hate this version of The Woman in White has gotten on Amazon seeing as the book is a masterpiece and how outstanding the 1982 version with Diana Quick was I was expecting this adaptation to be bad. After seeing it it is better than it's given credit for though the 1982 version is far better which was very faithful was more consistently acted and had a perfect length and pace. Those who say that as an adaptation the 1997 version is very unfaithful are right with some names changed physical appearances not matching and Glyde's real motivation for persecuting Anne not making much sense here. However adaptations do deserve to be judged on their own and on its own while very flawed the 1997 version is not that bad. The book is big and its complexity is difficult to adapt so the attempt is at least laudable.It could have done with being longer125 minutes is not enough I don't think and could have slowed down that way the story and characters would have had more complexity and intricacy. The voice over agreed was not needed and added nothing and not all the casting works both due most likely to their roles being halfrealiseddeveloped. James Wilby was rather dull and not oily enough for Sir Percival Glyde he is charming and aristocratic which is just one part of his character but from personal perspective he never believed as a main villaincriminal. And Simon Callow also suffering from the worst of mismatched physical appearances too thin is too mannered and civilised for Fosco quite possibly one of literature's most interesting villains the intelligence is there the evil doesn't register at least to me.However it is a beautifully made adaptation. The scenery sets and locations looking splendid there is an eeriness but also like a postcardcometolife quality and makeup costumes and hair that looks authentic. The photography is seamlessly composed like looking at a painting. The music score is an underrated one it was only mentioned in like 3 or 4out of 58 reviews on Amazon it is very magnetic and has an eerily haunting quality that matches the tone adeptly. The dialogue does have flow sounds very intelligent and thoughtful and makes an effort to make the characters believableespecially Marian Madame Fosco and Farlie. The story is not as intricate there could have been more of a danger if the villains convinced and were developed more but still has that Gothic touch is fun and tense and the romantic angle is tender.So while it loses the book's complexity and doesn't make as much sense there is evidence of good solid storytelling. The British Museum scene is tense in a subtle way and through body language too and the climax is chillingly hairrising. Most of the cast do work. Tara Fitzgerald commands the screen brilliantly bringing out Marian's strongwilled and passionate qualities. Justine Waddell is a softer more trusting and sympathetic contrast as Laura almost fairylike and Susan Vidler is a touchingly vivid Anne even with some of her lines being on the deadpan side. Kika Martin's Madame Fosco is harrowing and Adie Allen in a role that even when condensed has shades of Rebecca's Mrs Danvers has the right sinister touch. And Ian Richardson who was one of the high points of the earlier adaptation of The Woman in White gives an interpretation of Mr Fairlie that has actually grown while keeping the essence of the character. He is every bit the nervous wreck but also appropriately condescending and selfcentred with a touch of humour.Overall for a better version adaptationwise it's best to watch the 1982 version judging it on its own it is decent and is not wholly deserving of the vitriol it's gotten. 6.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100 faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending however is much better than that in the novel and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still the plusses John Toll's magnificent cinematography Stephen Warbeck's great score etc I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives Cage's miscasting a heavily diluted script.But two days later I was queuing again to see Corelli and although not perfect I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber the Nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound Italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine GrecoItalian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive.On leaving the cinema second time around I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes off to John Madden who despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the British critics any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies!has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart verve and humanity the core virtues of the novel in fact that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now.If you are a fan of the book like me it's hard but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli Pelagia Mandras Dr Iannis as if for the first time pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. In fact you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD.810".

Louis de Berniere's bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100 faithful. All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful and had stripped the book's plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending however is much better than that in the novel and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still the plusses John Toll's magnificent cinematography Stephen Warbeck's great score etc I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives Cage's miscasting a heavily diluted script.But two days later I was queuing again to see Corelli and although not perfect I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber the Nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound Italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine GrecoItalian supporting cast bring de Berniere's sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive.On leaving the cinema second time around I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes off to John Madden who despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the British critics any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies!has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart verve and humanity the core virtues of the novel in fact that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now.If you are a fan of the book like me it's hard but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli Pelagia Mandras Dr Iannis as if for the first time pretend you're watching something made from an original screenplay and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. In fact you'll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD.810";

	schema:headline " Ambitious project falls slightly short";
	schema:reviewBody "As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film a lot is lost.  Here director John Madden Shakespeare in Love takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off.  What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic.  The cinematography by John Toll Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall winning Oscars for both is splendid.  Working with Madden the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful.  Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople giving the town an authentic feel.  The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance which take up the greater part of the film.  There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment.  However by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated.  While the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely skeletal.  Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight.  When fight he must Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.Penelope Cruz whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia.  In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic.  She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine.  However Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia's fianc.I rated this film an 810.    Despite some drawbacks this is a touching film that is well worth seeing.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission.".

	schema:headline " Love And War And Occupation";
	schema:reviewBody "After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours from primarily two points of view. The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras Christian Bale. I had questions about the depth of their love from the start but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli Nicholas Cage. This of course was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people and sometimes fell in love  often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island Pelagia is torn between them.The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy quite true from a historical perspective and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line we would rather surrender to this German's dog than to you Italians. The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting which the German troops on the island simply can't understand and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war  until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done I thought.It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish but still deserves praise.710".

Beautiful feel good scenery and with a light touch of humour that made it rather more endearing than a straight drama would have been.  The romance was gentle inoffensive and sufficiently interwoven with enough proper storytelling to keep my interest and the score was not too obtrusively operatic.Overall the film takes a satisfying circular route from start to finish inducing a range of emotions as it progresses.  It's about 2 hours long but I didn't find myself fidgeting or looking at my watch once  and that's quite a feat for me!!  Very enjoyable.".

The film is set against the backdrop of a war between the Germans and Italians in a Greek island but the war is given less significance and what we see appears very sketchy. The entire film appears too sketchy melodramatic and clichd. Much of it is also historically inaccurate.On the technical front it is well executed. The cinematography of the beautiful exotic locations is breathtaking. The score is terrific. Where acting is concerned Penelope Cruz can't seem to lose her Spanish accent she's playing a Greek character but her performance is otherwise wonderful. John Hurt and Christian Bale are equally marvelous. Nicolas Cage is a miscast. His Italian accent energetic personality overdone nonverbal gestures all yield to a caricature rather than a character.Perhaps director John Madden was pressured to fit the entire novel into a two hour period and he chose to focus on the romance more to draw a larger crowd. I can't shake the feeling that perhaps someone like Anthony Mingella would have made a better and more complete film of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was watching this movie one thought had come to my mind for several times It's not really what I expected I thought it would be better but now that I finished watching it I realize why should I expect a better result from this movie? Isn't it just a love story made up in Hollywood show's standards? Of course it is! If so why expect more? Captain Corelli's mandolin is a romance story in war time WWII and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn't count was the Hollywood standard's touch... What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot which was not full of plot holes as this one is! instead of this sweet story romance with the perfect ending which we're used to watch in a great part of Hollywood's movies! Another Hollywood standard's gaffe which is very common is the natives' languages issue. The differences between Italian Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a forgotten Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it's just little technical details that don't even matter to the plot but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! But the movie has not just badsided arguments! On the good side I can find the original idea which comes from a book and the thought that is possible to be Human and have Human feelings even inside a War. It's possible to sing and be happy have good feelings to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie and at this particular point I wasn't disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another goodsided argument is History's knowledge The movie is not very deep at that issue but it's good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the EasternSouth Europe.Globally Captain Corelli's mandolin is not a bad movie but it's not as good as I initially though either mostly because of the Hollywood show's standards upmentioned.".

What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot which was not full of plot holes as this one is! instead of this sweet story romance with the perfect ending which we're used to watch in a great part of Hollywood's movies! Another Hollywood standard's gaffe which is very common is the natives' languages issue. The differences between Italian Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a forgotten Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it's just little technical details that don't even matter to the plot but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! But the movie has not just badsided arguments! On the good side I can find the original idea which comes from a book and the thought that is possible to be Human and have Human feelings even inside a War. It's possible to sing and be happy have good feelings to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie and at this particular point I wasn't disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another goodsided argument is History's knowledge The movie is not very deep at that issue but it's good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the EasternSouth Europe.Globally Captain Corelli's mandolin is not a bad movie but it's not as good as I initially though either mostly because of the Hollywood show's standards upmentioned.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEAD Others here have wondered how this rates an IMDb 610. They're not alone though my math runs slightly different 810 for the first 30 minutes zilch for the rest. Because it's as if there are two movies here a lyrical smallbudget essay about the impact of reluctant victors on reluctant losers. And a war movie so addled of execution you not only wonder where the hell the mandolin went but where the plot disappeared to as well. It's as if director John Madden suddenly grows tired of the picturesque and picaresque and goes home leaving everyone to stumble around in a morass of exploding cliches. Exposition? There ain't any. Bad enough that Cruz's capitulation to Cage is so unreal worse though that the Italians sign up without demur or debate to the partisan side and battle it out with their former German allies for. . . What? No idea if the island's some kind of strategic outpost the script certainly seems unaware of it. Lazy film making doesn't get any lazier than this. What's especially sad about all this is that the original novel was based on fact and wrought with such a delicate hand that it deservedly met with worldwide praise. Here however history is tarnished rather than garnished and truth made to look like just another celluloid improbability. The nadir comes with the postwar 'earthquake' when you think 'aw for God's sake do we REALLY need this rubbish on top of everything else?' Only later do you realise that the earthquake did happen and that it's the movie's narrative incompetence that makes fact look like fiction. Of the cast only Cruz and Hurt are worth mentioning Cruz because she is a consistent consummate actress and Hurt because he gives the impression that there's still some dramatic meat left on the plate even when the script ultimately deprives him of anything to gnaw on. As a result Hurt's concluding monologue  which wraps up the entire movie  at least sounds slightly less trite than as written so that you're not completely flattened by the stupefying banality it all. Even so the performances of Cruz and Hurt still fail to mask the central problem that at the end of the day 'Captain Correlli's Mandolin' isn't actually about Corelli or his mandolin or indeed. . . anything at all. Hopeless. 210.".

	schema:headline " The lack of romantic chemistry a hopelessly muddled plot and leaden direction sabotages Captain Corelli's Mandolin.";
	schema:reviewBody "Captain Corelli's Mandolin confuses more often than entertains. Although I haven't read Louis de Bernieres's World War IIera bestseller I know enough about the changes to recognize the shortcomings of director John Madden's leaden movie adaptation. Audiences may remember this English director best for his 1999 Oscarwinning comedy Shakespeare in Love. Personally I enjoyed Madden's earlier effort Mrs. Brown 1997 starring Judi Dench as Queen Victoria. Nevertheless if good looks guaranteed great cinema Captain Corelli's Mandolin would qualify as spectacular. Lensed on location in scenic Greece by twotime Oscarwinning cinematographer John Braveheart Toll this ambitious but abominable Nicholas Cage  Penelope Cruz wartime tearjerker is easier on the eyes than the ears. Aside from establishing a concrete sense of setting and atmosphere Madden and scenarist Shawn A World Apart Slovo have butchered Bernieres's novel so that it emerges in bites and incomprehensible pieces. Incredibly Madden and Slovo let the action veer erratically between comedy and tragedy with an indifferent romance at the heart handicapped by a curious lack of chemistry. Complaints about miscasting may arise in the minds of some moviegoers. Nicholas Cage's insufferably sweet Pucciniloving mandolinstrumming Italian artillery captain is almost enough to give Fascism a good name. Meanwhile nothing good comes of Cage's ersatz Chico Marx accent. Actually Sylvester Stallone would have been convincing in this role. If poor dialects irritate you prepare for a veritable cacophony. English supporting actor John Hurt Iberian beauty Penelope Cruz and Welsh leading manvillain Christian Bale all sound and look outofplace alongside Greek native Irene Papas. Purists will most likely skip this Zorba the Greek meets The English Patient not only for its inconsistent babble of accents but also for its mishmash of historical revisionism not to mention its pallid plot.Captain Corelli's Mandolin unfolds on the idyllic Greek isle of Cephallonia in 1940. A wise old local physician Dr. Iannis John Hurt of Alien who has been compiling a history of the island and its earthquakes narrates this yarn. He lives outside the village with his grownup headstrong daughter Pelagia Penelope Cruz of Blow in a small mountainside home. A brawny fisherman called Mandras Christian Bale of Shaft wins Pelagia's heart with his rough and tough ways. Her crusty old mustached father warns her from the start I would expect you to marry a foreigner. According to him Greek men dominate their wives and Mandras is not her equal. When Mussolini invades Albania Mandras and she get engaged. He ships out to fight the Italians. Pelagia pens dozens of letters but Mandras never sends a reply. Later we learn about Mandras's illiteracy. Perhaps Pelagia's father knows best. Anyway this revelation smells like a plot contrivance. How could a bright welleducated girl like Pelagia overlook such an obvious fact? She serves as her father's nurse and aspires to be a doctor herself. Doctors are trained to observe so Pelagia should have known. Furthermore neither Mandras nor Pelagia appear as if they were made for each other. One flirtatious splash in the Mediterranean doesn't a romance make. Madden doesn't pump up the passion between these two. Sadly Bale and Cruz make an unpersuasive couple. Meanwhile Madden has given audiences the village tour and introduced its citizenry. Dr. Iannis wields a fishhook to extract a dried pea from a man's ear canal. Although his hearing has been restored miraculously the husband dreads a future where he must endure his wife's constant complaints. This joke serves as a bookend of sorts that opens and concludes the film. Suddenly the skies erupt with military aircraft and parachutes blossom. Mussolini's Fascist troops have come to occupy Cephallonia and ships pour in more men and equipment.When Captain Antonio Corelli Nicholas Cage of The Family Man lays eyes on Pelagia her beauty overwhelms him. Bella bambina! He exclaims and orders his platoon to glance in her direction. Initially true to the romance formula Pelagia wants nothing to do with Corelli. She regards the Italians with fear and loathing. Corelli is not only an artillery captain but also serves as a translator. The scene in the town square when the Greeks refuse to surrender to the Italians preferring instead the Nazis deserves a lusty laugh. Later the Italians decide to billet their officer elsewhere. The Italian Army quartermaster makes arrangements with Dr. Iannis to board Corelli. Pelagia hates these arrangements until the captain captivates her with his mandolin.Gradually Pelagia's glacial attitude melts and she falls in love with Corelli even after her betrothed returns to the island and joins the Greek partisans. Mandras's mother Drosoula Irene Papas of TV's Homer's Odyssey is not happy about this new arrangement. The Cage  Cruz romance kindles few sparks. A more meaningful but tragic romance occurs between a socalled good Nazi officer Captain Gunter Weber David Morrissey of Hilary and Jackie and another island girl. Although Madden shows the Italians firing their artillery this bunch of guys heads to the beach to guzzle wine and warble Verdi operas to their prostitutes. At first everything seems great when our protagonists learn that Mussolini has surrendered and the war is over for them. Captain Corelli's Mandolin has focused primarily on comedy until the Nazis come goose stomping into the action and everything turns tragic. Sadly Madden botches both assignments. He cannot stage a decent big battlefield scene and he fares no better with the intimate romance scenes. If you're looking for a better version of Captain Corelli's Mandolin then check out Gabriele Salvatores's Mediterraneo 1991 which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. World War II buffs will appreciate the genuinelooking Stuka divebombers that rain destruction on Cephallonia. The lack of romantic chemistry a hopelessly muddled plot and leaden direction sabotages Captain Corelli's Mandolinand it fade outs on a whimper rather than a bang of jubilation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have just returned from Kefalonia. That's the only reason for marking this movie with 3. I like the Island...I simply have no idea what's wrong with John Madden. On the paper the guy seems to know what he's doing. Seems to be able to differ good from bad if we take that there is no right and wrong. But after letting myself finish this movie since I seem to be a masochist when it comes to finishing everything I am watching I have got the impression that this fellow had been directing this in a complete emotional chaos because I can not believe that his fellow citizen Louis de Bernires had anything close to this idea. Love story?! Goddammit no! Let's start with the casting. Nicolas Cage?! Let's see his character is a profligate Italian occupier fighting along with the Nazis under Mussolini and seducing a wive of an honest Greek patriot who goes to war to prevent his home Island being occupied...On the scale of charm from 1 to 10 that actor must have been something like 15 to even having any chance to make his character acceptably nice so one could even finish watching the movie! There were only two movies in the entire career of Nicolas Cage when he reached above 5 on such scale and where he has been able to transfer some kind of emotion through his character Leaving Las Vegas and Face Off. However considering that something above 5 is way below required 15 I have a feeling like I have been raped after watching this movie to the end.OK I understand. The history of art deals with probably the greatest anguish of mankind  the unpredictable ways of love. But after she Pelagia  Penelope was able to deceive and leave her handsome honest simpleminded patriot Mandras played by Bale probably the only one partially rising to the occasion along with Penelope here for the above described Cage I believe the only honest feeling one could actually gain would be to support the angry Kefalonian inhabitants by marking her with    sporca puttana for the ones still liking the Italian lover  No really even John Waters' Pink Flamingos love does not seem so repulsive anymore.OK I could be moving on with this but I believe I have made my point clear enough.".

But after she Pelagia  Penelope was able to deceive and leave her handsome honest simpleminded patriot Mandras played by Bale probably the only one partially rising to the occasion along with Penelope here for the above described Cage I believe the only honest feeling one could actually gain would be to support the angry Kefalonian inhabitants by marking her with    sporca puttana for the ones still liking the Italian lover  No really even John Waters' Pink Flamingos love does not seem so repulsive anymore.OK I could be moving on with this but I believe I have made my point clear enough.";

The only problem is that I've seen her in this role before. Other than that the movie is 1950iestype of inane. The Greeks are proud archetypes but hey daddy's still all for emancipation and that the Italians are jolly opera boffins and the Germans uptight evil maniacs. Beautiful proud Pelagia is betrothed to a resistance fighter but has the hots for a jaunty Italian soldier. You connect the dots. That's really all there is to it.The sad thing is that the entire plot's long been done before a million times better and with infinitely more charme in the 1991 Italian movie Mediterraneo. If you like the general idea of a romantic comedy about Italians occupying a Greek island and going native in the process you've struck gold.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers throughout Am I alone in thinking this film in many ways improves upon an excellent if flawed novel? Make no mistake DeBernieres' book is a modern classic but it has two major weaknesses  one aesthetic another of historical accuracy. This film nobly addresses both of these.1 Captain Corelli's Mandolin is an excellent and moving novel. The idyllic prewar life of the natives is vividly and touchingly depicted. The subsequent horrors of war are thus all the more harrowing when they finally arrive.For all that DeBernieres singularly fails to create a satisfactory conclusion. The last hundred pages or so detailing the intricacies of Pelagia's postwar existence are not uninteresting in themselves but seem banal indeed compared to the stirring drama that has come before. It is essentially a Second World War novel and should have ended with Corelli's departure from the island or at least soon after. The concluding chapters add nothing to the novel  DeBernieres should have been more ruthless and ended the story as soon as the main action stopped. The Great Escape would not have been improved by a concluding section about the surviving character's lives in the postwar decades and nor is this.Commendably the film improves upon this weakness. Now Corelli returns soon after the war's end. This is a decided improvement on the novel where an ageing Corelli does not return  inexplicably  until fifty years later! It is thus far too late for him and Pelagia to get together and provides a wholly unsatisfactory outcome to the novel.2 The novel is also undermined by a serious historical misrepresentation of the Greek antiNazi resistance movement notably the organisation ELAS who Mandras falls in with. In the book these are portrayed as Stalinist demagogues more interested in the propagation of a narrow interpretation of Marxist dogma and political infighting with the British Allies than genuinely resisting the Nazis. After the war they are portrayed as practically being akin to the Nazi terror they supplantin Cephallonia the Communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration campsHitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils.' p442.As DeBernieres now grudgingly admits in this respect he got his research badly wrong. Although I am no expert on wartime Greece by all accounts ELAS played an active and constructive role in combating the Nazis. The film rectifies DeBernieres' error showing Mandras and the other guerrillas fighting the Nazis side by side with the Italians. This does involve a fairly major alteration in the novel's story line however  Mandras's attempt at rape and subsequent death thus do not occur here nor do any of his guerrilla experiences which are detailed throughout the middle stages of the book.There were other changes in the film that I was less keen on however. The role of the Italian soldier Carlo who plays a fairly major part in the novel is here almost wholly omitted presumably because of fears that his homosexuality would offend the crucial American market. His gesture in saving Corelli from the firing squad is thus largely inexplicable except as  rather lamely  a benevolent sacrifice towards Pelagia.On the other hand CCM is such a long and complex novel that one can forgive the film makers for not transcribing every aspect of the book to the screen. Film is a different medium to literature. The unfairly hostile critical reception this film has received suggests far too many expected a carbon copy of the novel to be revealed on film. And as Madden also directed the generally awful but highly overrated Shakespeare in Love perhaps this evens the score somewhat.That said the film is not perfect. I am not convinced Cage was the ideal Captain Corelli. The depiction of village life does come across fairly whimsically and compares poorly to the portrayal of European rural life in the 1940s in Jean De Florette. Although I've said changes from the book are not bad per se some of the changes  the date of the earthquake from 1953 to 1947 seemed rather pointless. But generally ignore the pedants. The film would not be improved either by a forcing the cast to learn and speak their character's native languages and subtitling throughout or b correcting such 'inaccuracies' as the Italians occupying the island for two years er  they did or b depicting Abyssinian style atrocities committed by the Italian forces on the island none recorded. While not quite in the class of other Second World War classics like Empire of the Sun Schindler's List or The Bridge on the River Kwai this is generally a good film.".

Pelagia and her father find themselves housing Italian Captain Corelli who loves music and is charming. While Pelagia hates Italians and loves her husband she finds herself falling for the Captain over time.At the time of release there was plenty of dating couple who went to see this film and there was also a boost in the tourist trade in Greece accompanied by lots of television travel programmes talking about the islands and the film. These two things were in my mind when I sat to watch the film tonight and I quickly understood why they were the case. Firstly the reason so many travel shows picked it up is because the film makes the place look great! Each shot is full of warm colour and the locations are picturebook all the way through. The idyllic feel that the location brings is also part of the wider film with a story that is sweet but high on Hollywood gloss. I have not read the book and have no intention of reading the book but I understand from other's comments that the screenplay has lost some 'difficult' elements and focused on the romance in the story. Ignoring this as many who have not read the book will be able to the film is just like the landscape  sweeping easy on the eye nice and ultimately quite unmemorable.This explains why it was a popular date movie or to use that expression I generally dislike chickflick. The romance is simple and sweet and it is enjoyable on that level I can't say it touched me on a deep level or any level but it was sweet and I quite liked it. Towards the end it gets harder and more about the war than the romance but I felt this was too sudden a change that had been left too late in the game to fully work  it was too much of a sea change for me to fully go with it.The cast are mostly pretty and OK just like the landscape. Cage is too nice to be true but still tries hard his Italian accent has corny 'mamamia' moments but is generally OK. Cruz is fairly bland and doesn't bring a great deal to the film other that her looks which personally don't appeal to me that much and Christian Bale is given little to do considering how good an actor he is generally. Hurt is good value as always and the support cast fill in the gaps well even if few of them have anything approaching what could be called a character.Overall this is a sweet film that turns bitter for the final quarter of it's running time  a change in mood that is quite difficult when it occurs due to it's suddenness. However it manages to stay quite sweet and romantic despite running with a simplified script and a glossy approach to everything. It is quite unmemorable and I doubt I shall ever watch it again but I found it to be like the landscape  easy on the eye and rather pleasing to watch without touching me on more than a superficial level.".

Everything is too much simplified so the story goes too fast.I am sure that if Louis de Bernires himself should make film screenplay from any of his novels it would cost a lot of money and 150 minutes of time at least. But it won't be sweet happyend story about cute girls charming italian captains and brave partisans. It would be much more. Life and Bernires' characters aren't so simple. Somebody really thought that if he will fill the movie with quotes from the book people will think that it actually is book. This isn't bad film...I still give 7 points from 10. It's just deeply disappointing for those who read the novel. Maybe there are many perfect novels in the background of many average hollywood flicks. But sometimes there will be much better not to shoot some fine books...

Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl there are plenty of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series. The only foreign actor to my knowledge who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoonand as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.There is some historical truth reflected in the film. People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh unlike the Germans who succeeded them. Also Mussolini's forces as hinted in the movie had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign. After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces rather than to the Germans. as portrayed in the film is quite plausible although I am not certain this actually happened.".

Lots of whipping. A white woman is lectured about how she should never lower herself and have sexual relations with a slave. Then she immediately has sex with a slave. The slave is chained up so she jumps on him. Well at least the video box cover didn't lie. Soon the white man running the plantation has sex with a chained up slave woman. This is all in the first fifteen minutes.So besides interracial slave sex what else does this movie have on it's mind? Not much. The plantation owner's son comes back from England. He is going to run the plantation and have sex. He falls for the local preacher's daughter and some family drama happens. More chained up slaves have sex with their masters. All in all I counted about eight sex scenes. There is a nice sordid vibe running through Mandinga. I would bet there is another harder version of this flick running around. But even this version was pretty strong for softcore. I can only recommend this one to the most fervent admirers of Bsleaze. Everyone else should avoid.".

Naturally the Italians couldn't wait to jump on thisthey were already making plenty of interracial sex films at the time and they have never been a country inhibited by good taste witness the cycle of Italian sexploitation films set in Nazi death camps. This film is less offensive than its model however because it's very ineptly made. Not only do you have the atrocious dubbing and dodgy Southern accents but the white characters are all played by darkskinned southern Italians and the blacks are played by northern Africans rather than AfricanAmericans. I also don't think there's too many palm trees and olive trees in the American South.A young man returns from Europe to his wealthy father's Southern plantation. He begins an affair with his widower father's golddigging girlfriend who the latter refuses to marry. But then he falls in love with a virginal preacher's daughter and marries her much to golddigger's chagrin. She gets her chance for revenge though when the couple's first baby is born and turns out to be black! But all is not as it seems. Strangely there's actually no interracial sex in this movie. The lusty evil golddigger does seem to get off on watching the males slaves be whipped and after she and the son catch two slaves having sex they vow to show then how their masters make love and their is a brief interracial orgy. I'm using quotes however because the slave couple are obviously both north African Arabs and actually have lighter skin than the swarthy Italian actress playing the white mistress.Given that all the sex here is between white people and pretty unattractive white people at that this would never have made it as an American blaxploitation flick. I doubt it made more than a brief appearance on the urban grindhouse circuit back in the day but it is currently in The Grindhouse Experience Volume 1 DVD collection along with quite a few better movies. I'd recommend the whole collection but not really this movie as a standalone title.".

What they do is take an innovative moneymaking and foreign concept maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action sleaze and political incorrectness. But what to do when the nonItalian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy? Well then I guess you simply disregard everything in terms of storybuilding or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slaverysaga Mandingo released one year earlier but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth character drawings unsettling atmosphere or thoughtprovoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships. MandingA is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already. The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in South America. The elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower who probably also won a couple of MoustacheoftheYear awards who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him. His mistress who if I understood correctly is also his cousin ? is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last. The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times even in front of the slaves supposedly to demonstrate how their masters do it but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter. His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever. Hey  I just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes Mandinga sound like an interesting film! Well it's NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations. It's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through but if the themes appeal to you then definitely check out the aforementioned Mandingo. Much rather than sick exploitation that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film with real actors great music and impressive filming locations. Mandinga has nothing absolutely nothing to offer.".

The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times even in front of the slaves supposedly to demonstrate how their masters do it but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter. His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever. Hey  I just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes Mandinga sound like an interesting film! Well it's NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations. It's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through but if the themes appeal to you then definitely check out the aforementioned Mandingo. Much rather than sick exploitation that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film with real actors great music and impressive filming locations. Mandinga has nothing absolutely nothing to offer.";

As the barbed wire fences and Army checkpoints go up overnight suddenly people cannot get to their outhouses or walk from one side of the street to the other. It has some advantages  everyone squeezes into the tiniest corner of the pub because it is in Northern Ireland territory where the beer is cheaper but worst of all is the church and its graveyard.

The characters and setting really did appear as they did in my mind when reading the book. Off the top of my head look out for the following classic scenes and dialogue from the book  Madigan talking to the camera 'author' in the book about his legs his wife retreating not running away etc..  The owner of the Holy Drunkard pub describing his wedding day  Drawing the line to decide the border  Rafferty  Moving coffins to and fro across the border  two brothers smoking the same fag  the soldiers waiting for a train to show up  and lots lots more!Sean Hughes is great as Madigan changed from Milligan in the book .... Gryff Rhys Jones is head of the border patrols Ronnie Drew of the Dubliners has a cameo role Richard Attenborough plays the 'author' and one of the Macgann brothers is in it as well. For me it's one of those films that I could watch over and over again as there are so many funny lines and scenes  bit like rewatching Life of Brian.".

I believe the LP was transferred to CD but don't know if it's still in print.There is a movie of Adolf Hitler My Part in his Downfall with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful mess but it's funnier than this thing.It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen.

Women unable to feed their chickensharvest the eggs men being able to go into the bar but not actually sit at it.

	schema:headline " An absolutely hilarious satire on Irish NorthSouth relations";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Spike Milligan this is an absolutely hilarious satire on Irish NorthSouth relations. The film takes place in 1924 and concerns the tiny village of Puckoon in County Sligo which finds that the new border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State negotiated by the Boundary Commission has split the village in two. Since not even a single blade of grass from one side was given to the other by the Boundary Commission in reality the film and the novel could be seen as a light alternate history. The unorthodox border arrangement means that part of Puckoon's churchyard is not only in Northern Ireland but the site of the British Customs post. Since the town's Catholic population cannot contemplate leaving people to rest in Protestant soil for all eternity they devise a daring plan to exhume the bodies under cover of darkness. Unfortunately they don't realise that the IRA is planning to smuggle a coffin filled with explosives to Northern Ireland and things go a bit pear shaped. I have never read the novel but the screenplay by Terence Ryan is certainly reminiscent of Milligan's comedic style so I get the impression that the script stuck to it quite closely. The film which is very well directed by Ryan has an extremely Irish sense of humour and I appreciated its irreverent tone and many fourth wall breaking moments. It is only 72 minutes long but it manages to fit quite a bit into its short running time.The film stars Sean Hughes in an incredibly funny performance as Dan Madigan a shiftless feckless feckin' eejit as we say in Ireland who finds himself at the mercy of the WriterDirector played by the always wonderful Richard Attenborough in his final film as an actor before his death in 2014. Attenborough replaced Milligan himself in the role as the latter's ill health forced him to drop out of the film. He died before it was released and it is dedicated to his memory. Dan often takes issue with the hardships that the WriterDirector inflicts on him in order to combat his laziness such as crashing his bike getting struck by lightning and being urinated on. The scenes in which Dan argues about his treatment with the WriterDirector are one of the highlights of the film not least because he typically finds himself on the receiving end of an even worse punishment afterwards.The film has an eclectic cast of Irish and British actors. And Elliott Gould. Daragh O'Malley is hilarious as Puckoon's priest Father Rudden who devises the relatively... wellintentioned graverobbing plot and tries to bless passing Protestant Boy Scouts in order to save their souls. Gould whom Attenborough previously directed in A Bridge Too Far is not the most obvious casting choice for a film of this kind but is nevertheless very funny as Dr. Goldstein. He adopts a slight Irish lilt never going over the top with it as other lesser actors would do. In his penultimate film appearance Milo O'Shea does not have much screen time but I loved his scenes as Puckoon's sole policeman the 75yearold Sgt. McGillikuddie. The great Irish character actor David Kelly whom I was lucky enough to meet in 2008 has a fantastic cameo as the publican Mr. O'Toole whose business takes a sharp turn for the worse when it is discovered that part of the pub is in Northern Ireland where beer is 30 cheaper. Griff Rhys Jones is great as the supercilious Colonel Stokes who is rather aggrieved that he must deal with the eccentric locals and shoots himself in the foot at one point. That probably hurt. The film also features nice appearances from Freddie Jones as both the Boundary Commission representative Sir John Meredith and a blind man in the pub Peter Woodward who wrote Attenborough's final film as a director the very bad Closing the Ring as Colonel Martin and Joe McGann as Chief Inspector Tomelty. I have to say though that I was very surprised to see Ronnie Drew of the Irish folk band The Dubliners pop up since I had no idea that he made any films whatsoever.Overall this is a hugely enjoyable film that does not hesitate to have a bit of fun at the expense of almost every major institution in Ireland as well as the British government and its administration of Northern Ireland.".

The trouble with 'Puckoon' is that like Milligan's other books they simply do not work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot.No way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'Sex Lives Of The Potato Men' 'Fat Slags' and 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' but then neither is it as good as it should have been. The last halfhour involves a lot of running around by the police the British army some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin and is really tedious to sit through. Ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film.The other problem is the total absence of charm. 'Waking Ned' had this in spades while the 'Father Ted' television series was funnier by far. Spike lived long enough to see the film and apparently enjoyed it. His daughter Jane has a cameo as Madigan's bride.The highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning I don't mind dying! said Spike I just don't want to be there when it happens!.".

Puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all. Out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night...we might just have picked the worst. And yes they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly. Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character? Out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with this is now my favourite. The character Foggerty the village idiot played by Nickolas Grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color. If there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year please let it be Puckoon cause I don't think it can be any worse. I still wonder if this just might have been the worst way I have spent my money and take my word for that I have made many lousy purchases over the years.".

Zasu pronounced ZaySue does her best Olive Oyl impersonation walking around whining and ringing her hands or attaching herself to the policeman's laynard. I kept waiting for her to say ohhh myyyy but instead it's something always happens to somebody. The first time I saw this film I loved Zasu and found her character really funny. I've since seen her in other films where she does this same whining uptight fragileflower routine. So upon watching this film again I started getting a little annoyed with the constant whining and near hysteria over a piece of dust. But there are some funny comedy bits here and it's also a mystery movie as well. It's an interesting mix of mystery and comedy that actually works. The mystery plot holds together well through the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason who plays Arthur Crimmer the policeman. The haunted House is fun with many a secret passage and even a skeleton in the attic! Well worth the watch. Read more public domain movie reviews at httppdmoviereview.blogspot.com".

Okay if that makes sense so far then the rest of the film will too.Over in the old dark house Zasu Pitts is spooked from the first moment we see her and that's before the real action of The Crooked Circle has even started. Soon police officer James Gleason arrives and Zasu spends the remainder of the picture clinging to various pieces of his uniform much to his annoyance. They make a cute couple.Other club memberswho all end up assembled at the house of courseinclude Berton Churchill as a jovial host who thinks it's amusing that the Circle has vowed to kill him Rosco Karns who manages a few wisecracks and C. Henry Gordon as Yoganda a mystic of sorts who has just joined the group claims to have insight to future events and may or may not be an infiltrator from the other side. Ben Lyon and Irene Purcell are the obligatory handsome young couple who are bothin different waysdeeply involved in the case.It's totally silly but plenty of fun.";

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently one reviewer didn't read the earlier reviews before writing his entry. As other reviewers pointed out Zasu Pitts didn't talk like Olive Oyl  Olive Oyl's voice was modeled on hers! This was a comedymystery and Zasu Pitts was one of the most popular comediennes of her time. She was a star of silent films and her voice and manners transferred successfully to the talkies where she was a big star and favorite of audiences. Her 'whining' was her shtick and audiences loved her for it.The role played by Zasu Pitts in this and many other films is actually almost identical to the one played by Stepin Fetchit and Mantan Moreland. Zasu is a whimpering cowardly fool  played for obvious comic relief. Of course she was a white woman so no one mentions the obvious connection. If she had played Charlie Chan's maid she would have fit right into the Birmingham Brown role.The plot in this film is clunky and the acting a bit stiff and caricatured but it was made in 1932 and they were still trying to figure out how to make talkies. Watched with that in mind The Crooked Circle is quite enjoyable. After over a year and with a second viewing I'm back to add a few comments. It's interesting that even at the very beginning of the old dark house genre humor was already an essential part of the mix. One might think that the setting would have featured horrormystery films but Hollywood had already figured out that to sell a film to the largest audience possible it was best to mix genre elements. Thus we get a murder mystery set in a semiGothic atmosphere with more than one comic relief character. This film did have the other common element an attractive young couple in the romantic role but that element played only a small role here. If it was a murder mystery without the old dark house they might have added a musical number as well. Something for the boys the men and the ladies and girls all in one. Personally I find the humor far overdone here and would much prefer a straight Gothic thriller but I've learned to get along with the humor over time. The policemanasfool was played rather hard here the price you have to pay to get the rest of the story. I still give this a six out of ten on second viewing but I can see where audiences would have enjoyed it at the time.".

The film at first appears to be a dandy Bmovie about an evil organization called the Crooked Circle and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. While this is very odd especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes and COULD have been interesting this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors. Why? Well because Zazu Pitts never one of my favorite actresses spends most of the movie whining just like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache!! While murders are being committed people are being kidnapped or whatever you can always count on Zazu whining at full volumealmost like someone's obnoxious 3 yearold who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time she's NOT an integral part of the film but received top billing. Why she is even there is beyond meI assume it's just to whine and yell. As a result I found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I referred to this actress of dubious talent as Satan! I'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product they too felt pretty much the same way I did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance.This film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet.

We also liked Irene Purcell's mystery heroine but the best performances came from Robert Frazer as a resourceful gunman and Frank Reicher as the hero's none too subservient valet.

	schema:reviewBody "The Duke is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old Duke John Neville dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman he passes his Dukeship down to his dog. The dog's best friend an American girl named Charlotte played by Courtnee Draper whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic subplot which in its own way acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert The 'Duke' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor.Though from the technical viewpoint I dislike this film as I only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role. Though the plot is good elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a Doggie Duke I personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness. The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. The director Phillip Spink uses midlong shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. Plus the acting of Muirhead and Heyman whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role.But as a mature movie fan I find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. I can admit I found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be farfetched but has definite connections. I do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but I do highly recommend it to Dog lovers families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see 'Scotty' in his final role.".

Barnes Wallace has to put up with one of them in a general who won't let him create his dam busting bombs until somebody higher up puts the general in his place. The Enigma crackers have to put up with General Montgomery not using their excellent information because Montgomery is too pompous which extended the war by months. I could go on and on and on with more examples like these where they do this. This film parodies all of it. Is it a silly movie? YES! I can appreciate Key Largo The Nun's Story Casablanca and many other serious movies. But there is room on my plate for some silly comedies that don't go overboard. If you like movies like Blazing Saddles the original Producers with Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel and Being There this movie is of the same genre. If you liked those movies then you will probably like this one but if you didn't like those movies avoid this one. The first ten minutes alone made the movie worthwhile. Comedy can be overplayed or underplayed. This one was done to my taste but may be overblown for other viewers.".

One day when he and his niece are out riding horses the Duke suffers what may be a heart attack and goes home to bed never getting up again.

Duke breaks out of the upstairs and arrives just in time to hear of his own rise to aristocracy! Advantage doggie! The niece is delighted as well for she loves the dog now named The Duke. She has a new admirer too a lad who comes to work in the kitchen. But as one might guess the dastardly disinheritors comb the laws of royalty to find loopholes. At first they discover the new duke must have a ball and gain the queen's approval to get the title. Foiled again! The niece hires an etiquette expert the Duke learns how to act in high society and the queen boogies at the ball before bestowing the title. But as this Canine Royal has long had an affection for another dog named Daisy the grifters decide to entice Duke with a spiffy poodle ending in dog marriage so that they can control the Duke's little fiefdom. Will they succeed at last? This darling bit of silliness is greatly enjoyable. Most families will love the story cast settings costumes and beloved canines. What a stitch to see dogs join a conga line and wear fancy dress. In fact the dog playing Duke is one talented pooch. So this Duke's no fluke seek it out soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Mind numbing thriller in the wilds of the Alaskan wilderness has Brian Kemp Michael Gross and his son and daughter Max  Dee Myles Ferguson  Deanna Milligan trapped in their cabin under 30 feet of snow. The three end up being terrorized by this maniac Duncon Snyder David Hassilhoff who's offthewall actions were responsible for the mess that they all including Duncon where in by being trapped and in danger of freezing to death under a mountain of snow.Only worth watching for Hasselhoff's incredible performance that has to go down in motion picture history as one of the most outrageous portrayal of an obsessed and out of control lunatic ever put on film.Taking off from Russia with a load of cut diamonds worth millions Duncon after gunning down the Russian Major George Joseph who tried to doublecross him which was understandable later shoots his partner Whitney Dons Davis while in the air over mountainous Alaska. Whitney who saved Duncon's neck by risking his life flying him out of Russia and preventing Duncon from facing a Russian firing squad or a lifetime stay in sunny and beautiful Siberia got just what he deserved by trusting a lunatic like him.Duncons brainless action in gunning down his partner and then having the plane crash into a snowcovered Alaskan mountain range cause an avalanche that almost cost him his life and lead to Duncon being rescued by the Kemp's Brian Max  Dee whom he dropped into their snowcovered cabin frozen stiff and almost dead. Brought back to life by the kindhearted and caring Kemps Duncon instead of being grateful in them saving his good for nothing life instead tries to manipulate them into digging the wrong way out of the snow covered cabin down instead of up in order to find his stash of stolen diamonds that he hid in a camera. Eager to get his hands on the hot ice diamonds Duncon plans to murder the Kemps and take off after he finds them. It takes a while for Brian to realize what a dangerous psycho this Duncon really is as he started to notice one or more looses crews in Duncon's head out of whack but by then it was almost too late for him as well as Max  Dee to stop the wild and crazy guy.Avalanche is one of those movie that you just can't turn off no matter how bad and ridicules it is with David Hesselhoff not knowing just what he's supposed to be or do in it. At one point in the movie I thought that Hesselhoff had so much trouble keeping a straight face acting either like a deranged psycho or a mentally challenged Forrest Gumptype that he must have been hypnotized like the claustrophobic Bela Lugosi was in his being locked in a closet episode in Black Friday so that he wouldn't crack up and thus blow the entire scene!I have to say that in this movie I was in a way rooting for the bad guy Duncon Syndner. Duncon who besides being completely out of his bird took about the worst beating I've ever seen anyone take and still survive in a movie and that includes the indestructible Jason in all of the more then half dozen Friday the 13th movies that he was in. I know millions of bad movie lovers like myself hope and pray that Duncon or David Hassehpff would somehow come back from the frozen dead in a sequel to entertain us for just one more time!".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Mind numbing thriller in the wilds of the Alaskan wilderness has Brian Kemp Michael Gross and his son and daughter Max  Dee Myles Ferguson  Deanna Milligan trapped in their cabin under 30 feet of snow. The three end up being terrorized by this maniac Duncon Snyder David Hassilhoff who's offthewall actions were responsible for the mess that they all including Duncon where in by being trapped and in danger of freezing to death under a mountain of snow.Only worth watching for Hasselhoff's incredible performance that has to go down in motion picture history as one of the most outrageous portrayal of an obsessed and out of control lunatic ever put on film.Taking off from Russia with a load of cut diamonds worth millions Duncon after gunning down the Russian Major George Joseph who tried to doublecross him which was understandable later shoots his partner Whitney Dons Davis while in the air over mountainous Alaska. Whitney who saved Duncon's neck by risking his life flying him out of Russia and preventing Duncon from facing a Russian firing squad or a lifetime stay in sunny and beautiful Siberia got just what he deserved by trusting a lunatic like him.Duncons brainless action in gunning down his partner and then having the plane crash into a snowcovered Alaskan mountain range cause an avalanche that almost cost him his life and lead to Duncon being rescued by the Kemp's Brian Max  Dee whom he dropped into their snowcovered cabin frozen stiff and almost dead. Brought back to life by the kindhearted and caring Kemps Duncon instead of being grateful in them saving his good for nothing life instead tries to manipulate them into digging the wrong way out of the snow covered cabin down instead of up in order to find his stash of stolen diamonds that he hid in a camera. Eager to get his hands on the hot ice diamonds Duncon plans to murder the Kemps and take off after he finds them. It takes a while for Brian to realize what a dangerous psycho this Duncon really is as he started to notice one or more looses crews in Duncon's head out of whack but by then it was almost too late for him as well as Max  Dee to stop the wild and crazy guy.Avalanche is one of those movie that you just can't turn off no matter how bad and ridicules it is with David Hesselhoff not knowing just what he's supposed to be or do in it. At one point in the movie I thought that Hesselhoff had so much trouble keeping a straight face acting either like a deranged psycho or a mentally challenged Forrest Gumptype that he must have been hypnotized like the claustrophobic Bela Lugosi was in his being locked in a closet episode in Black Friday so that he wouldn't crack up and thus blow the entire scene!I have to say that in this movie I was in a way rooting for the bad guy Duncon Syndner. Duncon who besides being completely out of his bird took about the worst beating I've ever seen anyone take and still survive in a movie and that includes the indestructible Jason in all of the more then half dozen Friday the 13th movies that he was in. I know millions of bad movie lovers like myself hope and pray that Duncon or David Hassehpff would somehow come back from the frozen dead in a sequel to entertain us for just one more time!";

Nevertheless the philosophical and political tropes of Shirow are well dealt with albeit not so deep as in Ghost in the Shell or in the two later Appleseedinstallments.Animationwise it is clearly a product of an era before Akira gave anime that huge boost.If you like cyberpunk anime from the 1980s and early nineties and if you enjoyed Shirows earlier work from the same era like Black Magic M66 1987 or Dominion Tank Police 1988 then you will surely like Appleseed the OVA.".

	schema:headline " A very enjoyable film";
	schema:reviewBody "Before you watch this film I suggest you read the manga first or at least get a good idea what it's about otherwise you'll probably be lost. Though the plot between the original comics and this adaptation differs the characters and setting stay the same and it's a good start to get an idea of what it's about.Also another recommendation watch it in Japanese with the subtitles on if possible. In my time I've heard some pretty bad dubs but 'Appleseed''s English dub is just appalling.At least in my point of view this was a very enjoyable film. During action sequences and chatter between characters I laughed and smiled constantly. I don't think there was a point in it where I felt bored it's pretty entertaining the whole way through.But the main thing I loved was the music and animation style. It really reminds you of old 80s cartoons and I loved the nostalgia. The music a kind of synthy jazzytype score was constantly engaging and enlightening. I really loved that too.The story too may seem a bit silly but it had a few interesting twists and was often engaging too.A lot of other reviews have compared 'Appleseed' to watching from a weird CCTV camera. I have not got a clue where that criticism has come from other than a poor quality VHS release. But the DVD version I have looks brilliant the animation was way above the standard for the time it was made.Fans of the manga will love it like I did and for anime fans it's a must but it probably isn't for everyone.Overall 9.710".

	onyx:emotionText "Before you watch this film I suggest you read the manga first or at least get a good idea what it's about otherwise you'll probably be lost. Though the plot between the original comics and this adaptation differs the characters and setting stay the same and it's a good start to get an idea of what it's about.Also another recommendation watch it in Japanese with the subtitles on if possible. In my time I've heard some pretty bad dubs but 'Appleseed''s English dub is just appalling.At least in my point of view this was a very enjoyable film. During action sequences and chatter between characters I laughed and smiled constantly. I don't think there was a point in it where I felt bored it's pretty entertaining the whole way through.But the main thing I loved was the music and animation style. It really reminds you of old 80s cartoons and I loved the nostalgia. The music a kind of synthy jazzytype score was constantly engaging and enlightening. I really loved that too.The story too may seem a bit silly but it had a few interesting twists and was often engaging too.A lot of other reviews have compared 'Appleseed' to watching from a weird CCTV camera. I have not got a clue where that criticism has come from other than a poor quality VHS release. But the DVD version I have looks brilliant the animation was way above the standard for the time it was made.Fans of the manga will love it like I did and for anime fans it's a must but it probably isn't for everyone.Overall 9.710";

The plot itself makes sense but the characters don't.This might sound picky but considering that the city of Olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would YOU feel comfortable there as a human? Would any machine ever emulate human arrogance shortsightedness and greed quite so effectively? I doubt it. There are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the 'bioroids' or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters. Seems sloppy to me.The main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this. Little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity. The short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we don't see any character depth. The groundwork's all down yet we're left with no finished product. A cropped version of this OAV would have made a great TV episode once some character subplots had been established.The highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the actionespionage.The flaws really start to show through once you've had a chance to digest all the goingson so I couldn't recommend this for owning but it's certainly worth a watch or two! Whilst this review is mostly negative I really do think it's worth your time to watch this but it's not something to rush out and buy. In a nutshell A watchable wasted opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I forget let me say the artwork in here is outstanding. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship the drawings are beautifully done. If this wasn't animated critics would be lauding the direction in here because it's really good.To the story Sylvester is picking through the garbage at the shipyards but the pickins' are slim. While brooding at the dock next to a big ship in a porthole he spots Tweety in his cage. Tweety spots him too and you know his first comment  the same one he always makes when he spots the cat. Anyway Sylvester runs over opens the porthole and says Hello breakfast! Tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says You bad old peeping tomcat! The cat falls into the water.The undaunted Sylvester quickly sneaks back aboard ship tiptoes into Tweety's cabin grabs him and is ready to leave when  wham!  there's Granny at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester takes a beating as the old lady protects her pet bird once again. But flippety gibbet says Granny I've dropped my glasses. I can't see a thing without 'em. Heavens to Betsey where are those cheaters.Now Sylvester has the upper hand....and the normal cattryingtocatchbird shenanigans are on again like Granny's glasses. Sylvester's most clever act was to take her glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them so when she woke up and put them on she'd see the bird and think it was okay.Overall a very entertaining animated short that was a lot of fun to watch. As you can tell by the quotes I love the dialog in some of these old cartoons.".

I agree the cartoon has moments that are somewhat hitandmiss moments I personally didn't care for the seasickness joke myself but it has enough enjoyable moments I feel.The animation is pretty excellent particularly in the colours while the music has just the right amount of quirkiness. The dialogue is funny and clever Granny gets the best of them especially the lines about her glasses and the sight gags are good. Sylvester is fun to watch as always like Wile E.Coyote he is a cunning sort of character whose traps constantly backfire and Tweety and Granny are good as well Tweety especially is more active than he usually is. And as always Mel Blanc does a stellar job with the voice work. In conclusion flawed but enjoyable. 810 Bethany Cox".

He spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he spys Tweety is one of the passengers. The ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating Canary forever. But as cartoons starring Tweety go this one is quite good but it's ALL thanks to that brilliant cat.".

BaaderMeinhof had nothing on this GrannyCanary outfit. TWEETY'S S.O.S. documents how the seemingly innocuous pair exploit their guise of being ordinary to proliferate explosives shipboard until this liner's captain is incapacitated allowing these pirate thugs to seize command of the vessel and all souls aboard as this animated short ends with the purloined ship no doubt headed for the Canary Islands where the hostage passengers and crew will be sold into slavery a fate worse than death for many. Fighting a onefeline battle Sylvester cleverly infiltrates the liner as a stowaway. Battling the ill effects of salt pork this Super Cat nonetheless initially is able to eat one of Granny's cloned Tweety flock at the 339 mark after deftly painting a likeness of the Evil Bird on a lens of the Witch's glasses. As always another Tweety instantly takes the place of the one which went down Sylvester's hatch and things go downhill from there. TWEETY'S S.O.S. is enough to make one ponder anew that ageold question When the Titanic went down which did it take more ofcats or canaries?".

Sylvester is a great character on his own but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a Granny.
